      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVERYDAY LESSONS FROM JONAH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Book of Jonah is anything but “everyday.” It features extraordinary events we would seldom, if ever, see. God talks to Jonah like a next-door neighbor. He tells the prophet to travel to the capital of the Assyrian empire that controls the prophet’s nation. His mission is to warn those enemies that God is going to destroy them in forty days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Jonah flees by ship in another direction, and God stops him cold with a raging storm that threatens his life and everybody’s on board. The loss of all the cargo comes in an effort to keep from sinking. When the captain and crew find out that the disaster has arisen from Jonah’s disobedience, they try to row back to shore but have to accede to his directions to throw him overboard to get the sea back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
