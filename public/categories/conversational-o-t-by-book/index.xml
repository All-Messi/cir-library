      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 SAMUEL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversational Version&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Birth of Samuel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu (son of Tohu son of Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to the LORD’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”   &#x9;1 Sam 1:1-8&lt;/p&gt;</description>
