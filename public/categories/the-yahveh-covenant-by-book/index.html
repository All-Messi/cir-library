Solomon and the assembly went to it, 6and he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.   	2 Ch 1:1-6</p></p>

<p>1:1In the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, laid siege to Jerusalem. 2Yahveh delivered Jehoiakim to him, along with articles from God’s Temple. He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/Babylonia and put them in the treasury. 3He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, 4young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had him teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, 5and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. 6Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. 7The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel was Belteshazzar, Hananiah was Shadrach, Mishael was Meshach, and Azariah was Abed-nego.

<p>King Xerxes’ Banquet</p>
<p>1:1Ahasuerus/Xerxes ruled from India to Nubia over 127 provinces [486-65 B.C.]. 2In his third year on his throne in Susa the capital, 3he held a banquet for his nobles and officials, the army chiefs of Persia and Media, and the nobles and governors of the provinces. 4For 180 days he showed the wealth of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty. 5After that, he gave everybody there—least and greatest—a banquet that lasted a week in the court of his palace garden. 6There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings held up by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble pillars. There were gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement made out of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. 7Drinks were served in gold cups of different kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty. 8The drinking was done by law: attendees were not compelled, because the king had ordered each official of his household to follow each person’s wishes. 9Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the king’s palace.

They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread.

<p>1:1The fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 3God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back forth like bolts of lightning.	Ezek 1:1-14</p></p>

<p>1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham Ben-Elihu (Ben-Tohu Ben-Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.</p>
<p>3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to Yahveh of hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But Yahveh had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to Yahveh’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”	1 Sam 1:1-8</p></p>

<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Jerusalem Deserted</p>
<p>1:1How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people!</p>
<p>She’s like a widow that was once great among the nations!</p>
<p>The princess among the provinces has become a slave!</p>
<p>2She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her.</p>
<p>Her friends have betrayed her</p>
<p>and become her enemies.</p>
<p>3Judah has gone into exile in affliction and hard servitude;</p></p>

<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>BOOK 1</p>
<p>Psalm 1</p>
<p>1People are blessed that don’t</p>
<p>take advice from the wicked</p>
<p>or stand among sinners</p>
<p>or sit with scoffers,</p>
<p>2but delight in the Law of Yahveh</p>
<p>and meditate on it day and night.</p>
<p>3They’re like trees planted beside a river</p>
<p>that bear fruit in season,</p>
<p>whose leaves don’t wither.</p>
<p>They’re successful at what they do.</p>
<p>4Sinners aren’t like that:</p>
<p>they’re like chaff that wind blows away;</p></p>

Prophets don’t live forever, 6but my message commanded through them did come to bear on your ancestors.
