      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT IS GOOD TO REMEMBER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the grand cycle of life, only four or five generations of humanity are accessible to our experience at any one moment in history. Those earlier men and women we must remember, and so we set aside this day to reflect on their contribution to our welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember because doing so fosters appreciation. None of us are self-made people. Those who went before set the range of possibilities that we choose among and now enjoy. Were it not for their sacrifices and labors, we would not have the freedoms we prize or many of the possessions we own. Surely we shape our own lives and mold their direction by our efforts, but those efforts are largely exerted within the options that have been handed down to us. We owe our ancestors a great debt of gratitude, and we inherit an obligation in turn to leave our legacy—to respect, cherish, and protect the privileges inherited our forefathers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The saying goes, “The future of an event belongs to the event.” Let me explain. When something happens, it does not just happen disconnected from what is around it. Out of it flows what it leads to. That fact opens up a way to measure the importance of the occurrence. How long do its effects last? How many people does it impact? How much capacity does it have for its consequences to grow as time goes on?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Memorial Day Meditation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memorial Day Meditation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Morrison,  Lutheran, Lillis Catholic,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vermillion Christian Church&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One obvious feature of this cemetery is the stones erected here. But they are not just stones; they have names on them: Dowd, Donahy, Kramer, Bramhall, Nocks. These markers focus our attention on specific individuals. They are like icons on a computer. When we click on them, they open up to a vast reservoir of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are sorrows we shared, hardships we endured together, disappointments we knew, happy times at the kitchen table, and honest labor in that field north of the house. These stones mean something because they direct our attention on a mother, a neighbor, a friend, someone else connected to us. In this cemetery people have indeed remembered, as shown by the flowers beside many graves and as shown by your presence in this gathering today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Do You Have That You Didn’t Receive?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Do You Have That You Didn’t Receive?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lord, today we consider our place in the larger scheme of things, and so acknowledge you, first of all, as the beginning of all else besides you, the sustainer of all you have made, and the basis for the hope that stretches out before us. Amen&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the question: What do you have that you didn’t receive? Obviously, you have labored long and hard in the process of life. Yet what you have contributed could not have been done without the possibilities and opportunities already in place and the abilities passed down to you. In the countryside around, lie fields where you and your neighbors work the ground, plant the seed, harvest the crops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
