The mechanisms available for harmonizing scriptures with each other and with experience amount to the same things as the mechanisms used for properly interpreting human language. The same things we do to clear up ambiguities we do to resolve difficulties. Apparent difficulties normally arise because either or both sides of the dilemma are unclear, but people do not realize that at the time they sense a problem with the text.
