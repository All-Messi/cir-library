<p>WITH PERSONAL GROWTH AND WITNESSING</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>“Apologetics” deals with multiple components that combine in produce faith and growth in it. The conviction is that the structure of apologetics correlates with the process of evangelism and the pattern of personal growth. Evangelism looks at this matter from the standpoint of the communicator and sees it as communication; apologetics looks at it from the viewpoint of the hearer and experiences it as conversion; personal growth looks at it from the perspective of a believer and realizes it more and more as sanctification. What is seen, however, is the same thing. The accompanying diagram depicts the structure of the process.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>ATTITUDES TOWARD SUFFERING</p>
<p>It is not so much the suffering itself that determines whether we can handle it; it is the attitude we take toward it. Because of the great amount of persecution and suffering endured by God’s people over the centuries, the Bible gives a lot of advice on how to think about pain to deal with it effectively. Major portions of scripture that deal with suffering-pain-calamity-death are Job, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Peter. Cross references from these books lead to other shorter sections on this difficult subject.</p></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Basic Principle: The home is a specialized setting for interpersonal relationship.</p>
<p>On top of the interpersonal comes the responsibility-authority factor that parenting entails. That understanding establishes the attitude we take toward children and the way we deal with them.</p>
<p>Parenting is first and foremost a matter of relating to our young people as persons. Models for parenting are too often thought of as like being a (1) policeman, (2) friend, (3) counsellor, or (4) servant. The better approach is to start with personal relationship and add responsibility to it.</p></p>

<p>As with most experiences, worship involves structural/form-al and affective/ emotional elements. It deals with the patterns we use privately and corporately; it involves also the impact these patterns make on us. Definitions of the term worship differ according to one emphasis or the other; hence, they range from I-Thou vertical relationship, on the one hand, to subjective religious effect, on the other. One describes worshiping; the other refers to what is worshipful. What different people mean by worship varies, but the structural components of gathered worship itself are readily identifiable.</p></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Can we give any reason for considering ourselves significant?</p>
<p>Do we feel significant?</p>
<p>How much of our time, energy, and resources is spent on the quest for meaning?</p>
<p>Importance of meaningfulness</p>
<p>Results of meaninglessness are boredom, pleasure seeking, escape (drugs, suicide,</p>
<p>etc.), hedonism, materialism, busyness, struggle for power.</p>
<p>John 10:10b: Jesus came that people might have “abundant life.”</p>
<p>Definition of meaningfulness</p>
<p>The term life does not mean “existence,” but “meaningful existence.” It has to do with quality, not quantity. It includes a state of perceived “blessedness.” Meaningfulness comes from being part of a guaranteed purpose that is bigger than us.</p></p>

<p>The body is what we notice first about people.</p>
<p>It is with the body that we act and relate to them: shake hands, smile, talk, hear.</p>
<p>What a person looks like is more than looks: “Pretty is as pretty does.”</p>
<p>As with all other studies in this series, the proper use of the body is relative to the interpersonal framework. That observation follows primarily because the body is our instrument of action, and sin and goodness are actions. That fact combines with the related observation that sin and goodness (morality) pertain only to actions done in an interpersonal connection.</p></p>

<p>“Be angry,</p>
<p>If youpl get angry,</p>
<p>In yourpl anger,     do not sin; don’t letsg the sun go down on your anger.”</p>
<p>Anger in itself is not a sin (A),      (B) manage it.</p>
<p>Anger can evidently be managed, because Paul says not to let the sun go down on it.</p>
<p>Anger is okay. All the emotions are built-in features of humanness: fear, love, joy, anger, sadness. So don’t stifle it. Sublimating anger would surely lead to some kind of debilitating effect—depression and its own consequences.</p></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Relating to other believers in Christ would be easier if we were all at the same stage of growth in understanding and virtue, and if we all understood things the same way. But, we are not equally strong and do not see things alike. We must make allowance for differences to “keep the unity of the faith in the bonds of peace” and to avoid stumbling and discouragement.</p></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A.	The author’s experience with divided churches</p>
<p>Success at resolving church conflict has not been the most consistent experience. What often happens is a resolution through a power struggle in which the congregation loses those with the minority opinion. There is an erosion of membership on one or both sides of the discussion. People are hard to change once they have made up their minds and have committed themselves openly to a viewpoint.</p></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Sanctification process is like education; change (i.e., learning) takes place in doing.</p>
<p>Sanctification is deliberate; otherwise, we are not likely to differentiate properly between negative and positive social influences. Sanctification must be a chosen course of action because it correlates with something that is “taught” rather than “caught.”</p>

<p>The originating idea behind fasting may have come from the observation that when we are consumed with something important we may forget to eat (hunger). A similar thing can happen when we are working on some project and forget how late at night it has gotten (sleep). We tend to push ourselves beyond usual stamina when we are caught up in something important or interesting (energy use). Paul observes a similar thing about marital relations in 1 Corinthians 1.</p></p>

<p>Worship is an interpersonal act toward God as Thou. It is a conscious, spontaneous self-expression by a person to God as a present, superior, second person. The three most important points about it are that worship is interpersonal, that it recognizes God as superior, and that it is relationship to him as second person. That understanding of worship takes its cue from the word picture in προσκυνέω, “to bow low, kneel to, or kiss the feet of another.”</p></p>
