      <description>&lt;p&gt;MANKIND&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.&#x9;&#x9;The Purpose of Mankind&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II.&#x9;&#x9;The Image of God in Mankind&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;III.&#x9;&#x9;The Effects of Sin on Mankind (See What the Bible Says About Salvation, pp. 38-45.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;&#x9;Section I: Consequences of sin: personal perversion and meaninglessness&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.&#x9;&#x9;Section II: Consequences of sin: guilt, alienation, and destruction of the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;environment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C.&#x9;&#x9;Section III: Perpetuating sin: ignorance&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once sin entered the human race, it moved from person to person, from generation to generation down to our own day. We get it started it on our own and keep it moving “unassisted”; we get a lot of help from other people! In this section we are thinking about the ways our ignorance can get sin started and keep it moving without the input other people often give.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE PURPOSE OF MANKIND:</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE PURPOSE OF MANKIND:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Section I: God’s Delight&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given his nature, God decided on certain purposes. In light of those purposes, he made the creation, including humankind. So God made the nature of man the way he did because of the purposes he had for us in his creation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God made mankind simply because he delighted in doing so. Aside from any further considerations, persons experience fulfillment in being creative. The same holds for our personal God. Because of sheer delight, God expressed himself creatively and “saw that it was good.” That recurring statement in Genesis 1 expresses his sense of satisfaction in doing so (Genesis 1:31; cp. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). In that respect, God created us for something of the same reason he made the rest of creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNITY AND DIVERSITY IN THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By creation, all human persons have the image of God, which means they have the interpersonal capacity and equal inherent worth. Since the image exists at the individual level, we must view the created variants as “modes of the image.” Sex, race, size, intelligence, athletic ability, physique, age, and the like do not affect inherent worth and can therefore have no place in our attitude toward ourselves or other people. We do not have to be married to participate in the image, we do not have to become Jews to be a favored people, we do not have to speak English to be part of the kingdom, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 TIMOTHY 2:8-15: SITUATIONAL OR GENERAL?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/1-timothy-28-15-situational-or-general/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 TIMOTHY 2:8-15: SITUATIONAL OR GENERAL?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpreters have proposed several ways for removing from present observance of New Testament directives about male-female role relationship in the church and the home: 1 Timothy 2:8-15; 1 Corinthians 11:2-16; 14:33b-36; Colossians 3:18-19; and 1 Peter 3:1-7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way has been to (1) consider female deference a fallen condition (Genesis 3:16). Now that Christ has removed the curse, the principle no longer obtains. But the New Testament injunctions appear after Christ would have removed this supposed “curse.” Besides, “rule” (מָשַׁל, mashal) in Genesis 3:16 does not mean “rule” in some unwholesome sense as in a “cursed” estate; elders are to “rule well” in the church (1 Timothy 5:17; Hebrews 13:7, 17) and in the home (1 Timothy 3:4; cp. deacons in 3:11). Paul argues for female deference because the man was created first and the woman was deceived. In 1 Corinthians 11:7-9 the apostle adds that she was created from man and for man, and that Adam was created in the image of God (in some sense, degree, directness, or manner that Eve was not (cp. Genesis 2:21-23, 18).1 The five observations pertain to events that occurred before any fallen condition existed.2 Moreover, the other elements of the “fallen situation” in Genesis 3:14-21 have not been removed. Lastly, it is not a fallen condition that God is the head of Christ and that Christ is the head of every man, observations that Paul lays parallel to the man as the head of the woman (1 Corinthians 11:3; cp. Ephesians 5:23-24).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>1 TIMOTHY 2:9-15</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 TIMOTHY 2:9-15&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Paul’s Intended Connection Between Genesis 2-3 and Women’s Roles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul appeals to the sequence of creation and the manner of the fall for his not allowing women to teach or to exercise authority over men. One inference is that (1) Paul appeals to Genesis to confirm, rather than to prove, the propriety of his custom; it is a post facto appeal rather than an a priori one. He says what he says by his own authority rather than because of a historical divine reason. His authoritative conclusion rests on some practical consideration rather than a theological one. Then cultural propriety can be the basis; so outside the first-century circumstance, it does not necessarily apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT OF CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO WOMEN’S STUDIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something must explain why equally committed Christians come out on different sides of the same issue from the same Bible. It is either because of (1) unconscious presuppositions, (2) faulty reasoning, (3) misunderstanding of how language works, or (4) inadequate concept inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following notations attempt to (a) map out the issues, (b) isolate the relevant interpretation principles, (c) define the exegetical task, and (d) identify the biblical texts most involved. They also try to (e) narrow down the point at issue so that irrelevant matters are set aside so that what we are sure of can lessen the practical problem in the church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ADDITIONAL THOUGHT ON WOMEN’S STUDIES</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/additional-thought-on-womens-studies/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL THOUGHT ON WOMEN’S STUDIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Ministry Before Consensus”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some additional questions arise from previous presentations on women’s studies. For one thing, I have used “ministry” in the title of a paper that centered on leadership in relation to women&amp;rsquo;s roles. “Ministry” is broader than leadership, but leadership is the area in which disagreement about women&amp;rsquo;s roles has arisen. One way to help resolve controversial issues is to appeal to the larger category in which they stand. A title about “ministry” is useful on this subject because women are clearly free to make significant contributions to kingdom work; the question is whether they are free to make contributions in formal leadership ministry over men. Ministry as the larger category sets the context for leadership ministry. Any distinctive elements in the latter must be added in such a way as not to contradict the larger framework. The thesis in “Ministry Before Consensus” has been that we can carry forward the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s work significantly and with minimal negatives even before we resolve the problem. We can do that if we keep the problem clearly defined, if we keep it from spilling over into foreign issues, and if we maintain a proper understanding of Christian leadership. Women&amp;rsquo;s formal and informal Christian leadership ministry needs to conform to Christian leadership ministry generally, Christian leadership ministry needs to take place in a way that harmonizes with Christian ministry, and Christian ministry of every sort must retain the characteristics of interpersonal process. Since it is ministry that we want to get done, ministry is the subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ANALYSIS OF AUGUSTINE’S DOCTRINE OF EVIL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS OF AUGUSTINE’S DOCTRINE OF EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view of mankind common in evangelicalism descends from Augustine of Hippo. His early efforts in philosophy centered on the problem of evil. Although he spent his earliest years under the influence of Catholic Christianity, he left that background to become an Auditor for nine years in a Gnostic-like sect that followed the teachings of Mani. At first, Manichaeism seemed to him to explain the problem by teaching that evil and good are two kinds of substances. They have become intermingled in mankind so that “salvation” consists of separating good from its mixture with evil. Because of internal inconsistencies that Augustine came to see in this dualistic philosophy, he eventually left it and returned to Christianity. The problem of evil stood at the beginning of his development as a philosopher-theologian; its solution stood near the center of the theological system he formulated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APPLYING NEW TESTAMENT TEACHING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ON MARRIAGE, FAMILY, AND PUBLIC DECORUM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CONCEPT 1:  Family is the basic unit of society, more than the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CONCEPT 2:  When order is added to personal relationship, the qualities of person relationship&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;are not set aside.  Structure retains the interpersonal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CONCEPT 3:  Worth and the sense of worth come from behavior compared to responsibility, not&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;person compared to person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worth comes from accomplished responsibility, not “success” in competition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God created us to have fellowship with him, so he made us in his image by giving us the interpersonal capacity. But in practice there has always been a breakdown in the realization of that potential in every individual, a breakdown we may call depravity.1 Like Satan and the fallen angels earlier, every one of us has failed to express our capacity adequately or correctly. In different ways and to varying extents we fail to function interpersonally, in conformity to our own created nature, and in accordance with divine purpose. With the exception of Jesus Christ, each of us has misused the specific abilities that comprise interpersonal capacity and its derivatives, and thereby has affected all aspects of ourselves, our relations, and our destiny; so we say that everyone has total depravity. It turns out that in varying degrees, depravity has been universal since the beginning and all-pervasive in every person that ever lived. Depravity means that although everyone has the real creatable image, no one fully has the ideal ethical image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CRITERIA FOR A BIBLICAL VIEW OF HUMAN ABILITY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITERIA FOR A BIBLICAL VIEW OF HUMAN ABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prevenient grace and natural depravity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In place of the natural depravity of traditional theology, we prefer to speak of psychological depravity. In doing so, we acknowledge the power of sin without considering ourselves subject to a determinism that results in lostness. In the construct of depravity plus prevenient grace, psychological depravity functions on the analogy of habit. Prevenient grace consequently omits natural regeneration from God’s acts of grace that precede salvation. A view of human ability is developed below under five criteria listed according to the sequence in which they apply to the process of restoration to fellowship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITIQUE OF AUGUSTINE’S VIEW OF EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Augustine’s treatment of the problem of evil falls short for two related reasons. (1) He did not properly distinguish natural and moral evil, suffering and sin, pain and guilt. In his thought, they amounted to the same problem. (2) He attempted to examine even moral evil primarily in reference to the category of nature. In so doing, he glossed over the distinction between impersonal and interpersonal reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ETHICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMAGE AS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethical Use of Imago dei&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) The image as interpersonal capacity connects the natural and the ethical usages of the expression image of God. One pervasive concern of biblical content is wholeness, the big picture, the synthetic emphasis in contrast to a dichotomistic, analytical, reductionist approach. That concern carries over into the terminology. The penchant for integration accounts for the rather facile shifting back and forth between natural, behavioral, and relational usages of terms like image, life, sin, flesh, create, knowledge, and wisdom associated with the creation narrative. Integration accounts for places where such expressions may combine these rather different, though related, concepts when dealing with subjects in broad scope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVANGELICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MEN-WOMEN RELATIONSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introductory Observations&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, women’s studies relate to the genetic nature of men and women and cultural expectancy regarding their interaction. Discussing evangelical perspectives on men and women in relationship adds biblical interpretation to the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this subject what makes a viewpoint evangelical is not so much the viewpoint itself as the accompanying attitude toward scripture and the consequent method of interpretation which that attitude involves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EXTREMELY SINFUL: Psalm 51&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psalm 51 records David’s response to his sin with Bathsheba:  heading of the Psalm, “When Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone into Bathsheba” (2 Samuel 11-12).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David’s redeeming quality was admission of his sin, his willingness to repent, and his concern to reach out to God for forgiveness: Psalm 51:1-4, 7-17, which is the bulk of the Psalm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David felt totally characterized by sin as when we say someone is a “born liar.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GALATIANS 3:28: A TEST CASE FOR SOUND HERMENEUTICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“There is no male and female because you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). The wording of that part-verse has become a popular way for Christians to express the egalitarian principle that (a) in the home and in the church, there are no necessary role distinctions between the sexes. A man or a woman has the same theoretical “right” to lead. In its healthiest form, egalitarianism calls for “a fair field and no favors” in all parts of the social arena.1 A more extreme alternative to male headship is the belief that (b) in the home and in the church, there is only interpersonal leadership. Not only is there is no designated final responsibility in marriage and ministry referenced to sex; there is no hierarchical arrangement at all; there is only natural vs. formal leadership.2 Cooperation rather than structure is the ideal modus operandi. At least the first of these viewpoints is a proposed meaning of Paul’s statement to the Galatians. This study evaluates that reading in light of the evident exegetical and theological import of the passage, and addresses various ways by which women’s roles come or might come into its sphere of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GREEK ELEMENTS IN THE INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF EPHESIANS 5:21&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;editorial question&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Ephesians 5:21&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does “defer to one another in the fear of Christ” belong with the preceding or succeeding context?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The United Bible Society’s text of the Greek New Testament puts the injunction with the preceding material in the third edition, but with the succeeding context in the third edition (corrected). Grammatically the participle “submitting” parallels participles in the preceding two verses—participles that grammatically modify the subject of the finite verb in 5:18. A free-standing participle can be a command; but clear cases of that usage are infrequent in the New Testament (Mark 5:23; Romans 12:92, 10?, 11?, 123?, 132? 163?, 172?, 18, 19; 13:11; 1 Corinthians 8:24; Ephesians 5:21?; Titus 2:7; 1 Peter 2:18; 3:1). Moreover, nothing grammatical calls for invoking that usage in Ephesians 5:21 because of the parallel between “deferring” and the preceding participles of 5:19-20: “. . . speaking to one another . . . singing and making melody . . . giving thanks . . . deferring to one another . . .” Grammatically, “deferring” ties with the preceding flow of thought by being parallel to the three preceding participles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HERMENEUTICS AND NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exegetical Impasse&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A standoff has persisted in exegesis between Calvinistic and non-Calvinistic interpreters largely because no resolution can come at the level of individual passages that have implications for anthropology. A few examples illustrate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Psalm 51:10 says, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” Ezekiel 18:31 shows another emphasis, “Make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.” The difficulty is whether Psalm 51:10 interprets Ezekiel 18:31 or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HUMAN DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overview of Natural Depravity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the late fourth century Augustine, bishop of Hippo in North Africa, gave classical expression to natural depravity as part of his understanding of the nature of evil. In his thought, evil is a lack (privation) in the form of substance relative to its original form. That relatively deformed condition produces evil action. The nature of evil is lack, the cause of evil is lack in form, and the criterion of evil is lack in form compared to pristine form&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IMAGE AND LIKENESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have not made a distinction between “image” and “likeness,” even though Genesis 1:26 uses two words to compare mankind and God. (a) Nothing in the context distinguishes them. Furthermore, (b) in most other passages only one term occurs, image in Genesis 9:6-7; 1 Corinthians 11:7; James 3:9 and likeness in Genesis 5:2 in an otherwise word-for-word parallel to 1:26. Like in Genesis 3:5, 22 translates a different item than in 1:26.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Description of Imperatival Intent&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imperative forms can convey a range of meanings; they have (1) varied quality. In language, authorial intent does not bear a one-to-one relationship with linguistic forms. In assessing a writer’s use of the imperative mood, we look beyond the form itself and infer its force from the near and distant literary context, the historical context, and the nature of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Imperatives may entreat, where one wants a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDWELLING SIN: ROMANS 7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Paul speaks of sin resident within him (or indwelling sin), perhaps he means it phenomenologically; that is, the experience of sin feels like something inside him. His point is that sin is not just something outside us (environment, influence) trying to tempt us into misaction; it is something inside us as well. There is a subjective as well as objective component in the sin phenomenon. The implication is personal responsibility for subjective response to objective influence and stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISSUES IN WOMEN’S STUDIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Guided Study&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are six items for thought and research on women’s studies. Some points may be referred to in Hermeneutics: Getting the Point; check the scripture index for locations. As much as possible, consciously integrate into your write-up the principles studied in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some items involve work with the original languages and may not seem fully understandable to those who have not studied Greek. There is no expertise in biblical languages required, however, since the exercises are vocabulary items that can be looked at through Englishman’s Greek Concordance to the New Testament. On some questions students may want to consult Dr. Warren’s “Preliminary Essays on Women’s Studies.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ITEMS AFFECTED BY THE DOCTRINE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ITEMS AFFECTED BY THE DOCTRINE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the nature of mankind is a central consideration in Christian theology, the doctrine of natural depravity in mankind affects a variety of issues and impacts them in significant ways. The following enumeration of consequences may not be necessary in every case, but historically this concept has triggered them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anthropology itself is significantly different because mankind is understood as born without the full spiritual capacity that Adam and Eve had before they sinned. Beyond the consequences of their sin that Genesis 3 and elsewhere indicate, natural depravity adds to the silence of scripture by saying that in some way—either by built-in natural result or direct divine penalty—their sin led to a defective genetic nature that everybody has biologically inherited. Because we all have descended from the same pair, we are all infected with this defect in every aspect of our being. The will is weakened so that we cannot resist temptation even when we want to. The affections are so disoriented that often we do not even want to resist. We do not love what we should. Even emotional disorders may integrate with natural depravity. Bodily drives are perverted, which accounts for unwholesome sexual desires, homosexuality, bestiality, gluttony, drunkenness, as well as inhibitive and compulsive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intellect is skewed at least relative to spiritual matters, so that we are blind to what should be “as clear as the nose on our face.” Some have integrated the concept more broadly by connecting it with the idea that supposedly people use only 5-8% of the brain’s capacity. That somehow represents the difference between the IQ of fallen and unfallen man. Unfallen Adam could use 100% of his brain power and was more intelligent than afterward. He supposedly had great intuitive knowledge as well as greater intellectual power than anyone has now. Some have claimed that he had such a grasp of natural science as is unattainable today (John Laidlaw, The Bible Doctrine of Man, 1895; see Gordon Clark, pp. 20-21).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 1994, James Torrance, professor emeritus of systematic theology at the University of Aberdeen, presented the Didsbury Lectures in the Nazarene Theological College, Manchester. InterVarsity Press offers these lectures in written form with a preface and appendix added by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worship is the central concern of the volume, which brings the author to emphasize the nature of God particularly as trinitarian and gracious. Worship is described as “our participation through the Spirit in the Son’s communion with the Father” (p. 15; cp. 21). We “worship the Father through the Son in the Spirit” (p. 22). We “participate through the Spirit in the incarnate Son’s communion with the Father” (p. 59). “The real agent in all true worship is Jesus.” Granted the ambiguities in such phraseology as “participation through the Spirit” and “Jesus as the only true agent,” we nevertheless see that Christ’s “priesthood” is not simply in regard to something completed; it is the sole ongoing basis for perpetual relationship to God, in life generally and in worship especially.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Trans. from the 2nd German edition by Gordon J. Wenham. Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1991 [1981]. 224 pp. pr&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neuer begins by placing the relevance of his topic in the contemporary challenge of secular feminism, an important point because the church, in being biblical, should not be needlessly countercultural. Subsequent chapters on male-female differences reflect the natural assumption that in the family and in the church God has assigned role emphases correlated with sex in keeping with the way he has gifted males and females. Five chapters deal with the view of man and woman found in the Old Testament, the gospels, the epistles of Paul, the rest of the New Testament, and in church history. Two chapters address the continuing validity of the biblical viewpoint and the urgency of practicing it. The volume concludes with a summary of main points. Along the way, five excursi expand on texts and issues that call for more extended treatment than the ongoing presentation itself allows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MAN AND WOMAN IN ADAM AND IN CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One major argument for egalitarianism in marriage and the church pictures female deference as a fallen condition that has been reversed in Christ. “Your husband will rule over you” (Genesis 3:16) has changed to “In Christ there is no male and female” (Galatians 3:28). New Testament comments about male headship merely temporalize the Christian ideal in the interests of Christian mission. The following comments attempt to show that this scenario artificially combines unrelated ideas and overextends the cultural variable. Genesis 3:16 does not indicate a result of the curse, Galatians 3:28 is not an absolute principle, and statements elsewhere about headship are not necessarily pragmatic concessions to cultural norms that no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MINISTRY BEFORE CONSENSUS ON WOMEN’S ROLES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IN THE CHURCH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practical situations have a way of forcing us to “get on with it” despite unresolved questions. While pragmatics fosters “caving in” to illegitimate pressures, it also keeps us from letting theoretical matters make the system dysfunctional and pushes us to put things in perspective. Current differences of understanding about the range of women’s roles in the church and the home offer one more example of the qualifying effect of practical need on doctrinal theory. The need to fulfill the mission mandate suggests that we adopt an interim approach that does justice to everything we are sure about in connection with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NATURAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMAGE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter we offered restrictive guidelines for identifying the image of God—boundaries within which the understanding of image must fall. The image must be a creatable likeness that applies to the whole individual even after the Fall. Then we offered two sets of positive evidence for the image as interpersonal capacity to build the view “from zero.” There were two deductive arguments: (1) the interpersonal purposes of mankind predict interpersonal nature of man as the image; (2) being in the image of an interpersonal God implies that mankind is interpersonal. Finally, we made inductive observations: human peculiarities observed in connection with image terminology end up being aspects of interpersonal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTATIONS ON 1 TIMOTHY 2:11-12&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does αὐθεντεῖν mean “exercise authority” or “domineer”?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) The law of contrast implies that αὐθεντεῖν does not mean “dominate” since it is a correlative term with ὑποταγή in the previous verse. Ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ and αὐθεντεῖν seem to be correlative expressions like learn and teach, with which they appear. Correlative terms stand in a common larger category as natural contrasts: lost-saved, father-son, prophecy-fulfillment, faith-works, and the like. Within the same context the sense in which one is meant is the sense in which the other is used. If father means physical father, then son means physical son, not spiritual son. If prophesy means to state a significant principle, then fulfill means to be an example of that principle, not the occurrence of a prediction. Correlative terms obey the law of contrast/opposition/negation inside the law of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PREVENIENT GRACE AND NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have set aside the doctrine of natural depravity because (a) natural depravity lacks adequate primary biblical evidence for it. (b) Natural depravity creates contradictions. One set of propositions summarizes an argument against natural depravity. Since God is self-consistent, the variable that explains the Great Dilemma must lie outside God. Since only God and we figure in salvation, that variable must lie in us. We must be capable of responding to God; otherwise, God would be choosing who is saved by choosing whom he enables to respond to him unto salvation while saying that he does not want anyone to perish (2 Peter 3:9). As natural depravity in effect means divine self-contradiction, natural ability maintains divine self-consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the outset we want to make explicit three notable ideas in the designation “interpersonal capacity.” (a) Interpersonal means that the image of God has to do with persons instead of things, forces, animals, or ideas. (b) Interpersonal relates the image to the social setting. The image involves more than the individual because it pertains to marriage, community, church, society, humankind as well as God’s purposes for persons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary/Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proposition counter to natural depravity is as follows: there is no (1) clear (2) biblical basis for saying that Adam’s ability in regard to (3) spiritual things after the fall was any different from what it was (4) before the fall in a (5) biologically inheritable sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By “clear” biblical base we mean that some passages could be understood the way natural depravity takes them, but no passage requires such an understanding. In fact, many texts offered in support of that concept cannot have that meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRUCTURING THE HERMENEUTICAL TASK IN WOMEN’S STUDIES: WISDOM OR LAW?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are inclined to think that some reasonable explanation lies behind the variant understandings of gender roles by equally sincere and capable Christian interpreters. Something must be happening in the minds of some that is not happening in others who likewise take a proper view of scripture. We suspect that part of the difficulty lies at (a) the linguistic level. People do not remember that the imperative mood can have more than one quality, hence, our essay elsewhere on “Imperatival Intent,” which assembles the different values that imperatives and their equivalents may have. Another part of the difficulty lies at (b) the corpus level. People make different assumptions about the nature of the New Testament as a body of normative literature, hence, this essay on “wisdom” vs. “law” and the accompanying excerpt on “Confusing Advice and Commandment.” What we have to say here comes in association with the accompanying diagram.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUBMITTING TO ONE ANOTHER:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 5:21-6:9&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This portion of Ephesians deals with “household teaching” on the relationship of husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and slaves. Other comparable texts are Colossians 3:18-4:1 and 1 Peter 2:(13-)18-3:7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regard to each relationship, Paul appeals to interpersonal principles to set the tone for it. In other places, he does the same thing to solve problems that impact practical relationships in the body (languages, 1 Corinthians 12-14; leadership, 2 Corinthians 10-13; etc.). He can do that because personal relationship is always the context in which further considerations exist and must exist in a way that does not interfere with that context. Paul implies that interpersonalism should carry the process as much as possible. Only when influence for practical reasons is inadequate is there a need to invoke the principle of authority (much less force).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY STATEMENT AGAINST NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proposition counter to natural depravity is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;there is no (1) clear (2) biblical basis for saying that Adam’s ability in (3) spiritual matters after the Fall was different from what it was (4) before the Fall in a (5) biologically inheritable sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By “clear” biblical base we mean that certain passages might be understood in the way natural depravity assumes, but no passage requires such a reconstruction; many texts proposed in support of that concept cannot have that meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE “IMAGE OF GOD”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE “IMAGE OF GOD”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of my creative energies lately have been directed toward tracing through the implications of interpersonal relationship as the organizing reality for Christian truth. Nowhere has this observation appeared more relevant than in the study of the nature of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries extensive thought has gone into the interpretation of Genesis 1:26-27 and related materials: “Let’s make mankind in our image after our likeness.” There have been four proposed aspects of the “image of God” together with their effects. Reason heads the list. The ability to think abstractly relates to the capacity for language communication, creativity, responsibility (dominion), conscience, even humor, self-transcendence, and the ability to project consciousness over behind the eyes of another person. People can penetrate a situation in thought and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE DENIAL OF NATURAL DEPRAVITY:</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE DENIAL OF NATURAL DEPRAVITY:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A DISTINCTIVE OF “THE RESTORATION MOVEMENT”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One distinctive of the Churches of Christ/Christian Churches has been their relatively high view of human nature. They have stood virtually alone in denying the traditional doctrine of natural depravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the late fourth century, Augustine, bishop of Hippo in North Africa, gave classical expression to this concept as part of his understanding of the nature of evil generally. In his thought, evil is a lack (privation) in the form of substance relative to its original form. This relatively de-formed condition produces evil action. Thus, the nature of evil is lack, the cause of evil is lack in form, and the criterion of evil is lack in form compared to original form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE IMAGE AND ETHICS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE AND ETHICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory of meaning, the basis for self-image, and the theory of ethics all three reference the same factors: being, action, and relationship. The previous chapter discussed meaning and self-image as the objective and subjective sides of the same thing. This chapter notes that ethics belongs to action in the interpersonal sphere. Since we have identified the image of God with the interpersonal capacity, it remains for us to explicate the principles for ethical theory that grow out of the construct established by God’s creating us in his (a) interpersonal image for (b) fellowship and (c) purpose. Action connects the first item with each of the last two. Image defines human nature/being, which behavior ties to relationship and purpose. Relationship and purpose are relational since action relates persons to others in fellowship and relates them to the results of their deeds. Action connects being to relations (ethics) even as action connected objective and subjective in the previous chapter (meaning).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE AND THE BODY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Including the Body in the Image&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter we address more deliberately the issue noted before. A long-standing debate about the image concerns whether to include the body in it. There are three ways to relate the image and the body. The body might be (a) part of the image, (b) involved with the image, or (c) analogous to the image. Several considerations go into deciding whether the body is in, with, or like the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE OF GOD AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Interpersonal capacity” includes three notable ideas about the image. (a) Interpersonal stresses the fact that the image of God has to do with characteristics of persons rather than that of things, forces, ideas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) Interpersonal relates the image to the social setting so that it involves more than the individual by addressing marriage, community, church, society, mankind as well as the purposes of God for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGO DEI AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BASES AND INTEGRATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes that the image of God in us is the interpersonal capacity. It does not necessarily say something new, but endeavors to assemble relevant factors, to clarify a viewpoint that best incorporates them, and to show its consonance with the Christian worldview. In method, the approach sets aside a reductionism that strives after identifying our “essence” and “risks” reification, faculty psychology, depersonalization, and individualism, which are tendencies that derive from non-revelatory origins. It opts instead for a combinationalism that accounts for all the features of nature, function, and relationship that’s special revelation pictures us as having and called to have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE MEANING OF “SUBMISSION”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MEANING OF “SUBMISSION”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with other controversial matters, the biblical view of marriage and the family gets lost in the throes of pendulum thinking. Truth tends to lie between extremes, but on this issue unnecessary rigidness creates an extreme opposite and equal reaction. After a while,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;discussions on headship and submission get lost in a battle between those extremes and lose sight of the proper orientation for the subject. Emotions take over on one side, which wants to defend the accuracy of scripture in all matters whereof it speaks. The other side wants to breathe some fresh air of freedom for women and their service in the kingdom. Whenever something comes up that seems to foster one extreme, people on the other extreme react. As a result, discussion does not resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE NATURE OF MANKIND&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preface&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The present volume was a project during a year’s sabbatical at Manhattan Christian College in Manhattan, Kansas. I am grateful to fellow faculty members, administration, and trustees for approving the sabbatical proposal. To my colleagues—especially Steve Isom, Dr. Franklin Karns, and Dr. Scott Caulley—I owe a debt of thanks for shouldering increased teaching loads so the necessary courses for the l989-1990 academic year could be maintained. Students and family have been encouragements as well during the completion of this and other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRADITIONAL REASONS FOR GOD’S CREATING US&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Issues can be relatively simple in themselves; and so the question seems about God’s reason for creating us. Issues get complicated when we try to distinguish our own understanding from other ones and when we have to give reasons against such alternatives, especially if they overlap our own.1 As in our positive presentation so also in evaluating other positions, interpersonalism serves as the criterion for what is foreign and contradictory to what scripture says about the nature and purpose of God and man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRIMMING BACK THEOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BY SHEDDING NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Contribution of “Restorationism”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A less emphasized contribution of the Restoration Movement has been its dispensing with the centuries-old concept of natural depravity. The idea originated with Augustine of Hippo (354-430), who was emerging from the Greek philosophical tradition that did philosophy in the ontic category, in particular, Manichaeism. His seminal notion was that evil was a privation of form in being relative to its pristine condition, with perverted function arising from the deformation. That explanation of theodicy applied to the human condition and its behavioral outworking called sin. The Reformation and contemporary evangelicalism as well have incorporated that concept into their systematics. A student of historical theology has to go from the Stone-Campbell movement all the way into liberalism to find an absence of the natural depravity concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain a balanced approach in the current women’s studies debate, we should keep in mind what women did with divine approval in both Testaments. The following is a suggestive list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anna: a “prophetess” in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus’ presentation in the temple. She “gave thanks to God and spoke of him to all that were looking for redemption in Israel” (Luke 2:36-38).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN’S STUDIES AND “STANDARD SITUATION”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One point in 1 Timothy 2 has to do with husband-wife vs. man-woman as Paul’s intended reference. Connecting the statements of 1 Timothy with (a) a husband-wife contrast rather than (b) a man-woman contrast represents a crucial variable between instruction on marriage roles vs. gender roles. A third approach to the text has something of the same effect but seems to be more straightforward and therefore less cumbersome: (c) Paul is addressing “standard situation,” that is, married with children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN’S STUDIES NOTATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In women’s studies, something is causing equally committed, intelligent, educated, hard-working, well-known Christians to come to incompatible conclusions, which leads to disagreement and division. Since this topic has behavioral correlates, we cannot treat it as we do the millennial question and go on about our work; this topic affects how we go on with our work. Since it is a broad-to-narrow issue, people with different persuasions find it hard to be equally tolerant; it is usually easier for a broader view to be accepting of a more restricted one than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ΑΥΘΕΝΤΗΣ  (AUTHENTĒS)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important item in 1 Timothy 2 is a case of αὐθεντέω (authenteō) that Al Wolters pointed out at the November meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society in Lisle, Illinois.  It appears in Origen’s Commentary on 1 Corinthians, which, I believe, is one of Origen’s as-yet untranslated works. The full Greek text of the commentary is in Journal of Theological Studies, X (1909), 29-51. The reference appears in 74:20 of Origen’s Commentary. The text is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
