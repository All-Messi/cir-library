            <p class="essay-description"><p>As to words, people shift categories without shifting them as to concepts, because the categories are interconnected in actual experience. Being, action, and relationship are equally present in any real event, but with the mind we can differentiate between them. So language, which reflects the subjective activity of sensory perception and mental conception, differentiates between the aspects of an event even though they are objectively interrelated. If we do not distinguish language and reality, we take a point stated about one aspect and slide it onto another. Furthermore, language itself may use a nature term to refer to an action or to state reality. If readers do not keep in mind the nature of the issue, they can make all kinds of false inferences.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>Different kinds of presuppositions include (1) preliminary ideas from which further ideas derive. Presuppositions, or pre-understanding, lie ahead of the present matter. They color what we read and hear on this matter. An example of presupposition would be the idea that what works is good (pragmatism).</p>
<p>Presuppositions can be (2) larger constructs that qualify statements about matters within them. One big issue in contemporary hermeneutics is the question about implicit cultural limitation. Revelation critiques culture and stands in prophetic relationship to it. Nevertheless, some have entertained the idea that Paul and others sought to show they were not cultural subversives. On the basis of the way they deal with slavery, table fellowship (eating with someone), salutation (speaking to someone), dress code (veil-wearing, hair length), this thinking pattern has been applied to (a) egalitarian vs. hierarchical structure of marriage and (b) homosexual behavior between consenting partners. One issue is whether such behaviors mean the same thing in our setting as they did then.</p></p>

<p>Many of the examples below raise issues that are not in themselves very important. We offer them, however, as (1) “exercises” in hermeneutical creativity on matters where frankly it does not hurt to be wrong. Besides, it is not healthy to get in the habit of “dodging” critical issues because they impact (2) evaluating biblical accuracy. Though the points themselves are often not significant, their existence in a religious text does raise a point that is significant—whether people can trust the biblical accounts. Distrusting them for unnecessary reasons should be avoided, and we cannot legitimately trust them without correct exegetical work as a means of properly avoiding unnecessary criticism of scripture.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE KINGDOM</p>
<p>The first portion of Matthew 5-7 has to do with the first “petal on our daisy”: Blessings and Responsibilities (5:3-16). Before looking at the meaning of the verses individually, we must see how the structure of the sermon may affect its interpretation. Since it is wisdom literature, it is loosely structured. The significance of this point can be appreciated by looking at Luke’s Sermon on the Plain (6:20-49), which has several close parallels with the Sermon on the Mount. Despite similarities many interpreters consider them different presentations, partly because they may fall at different points in Jesus’ ministry. Regardless of whether they are two accounts of the same sermon or different accounts of two sermons, Luke’s rearrangement of similar material shows that we should be cautious about making too much out of connectors between blocks of material. In other words, context connections in wisdom literature are less helpful in interpretation, because the writer tends to connect his paragraphs more loosely. They are self-contained units more than interdependent ones. In yet other places Luke has bits and pieces that appear in Matthew 5-7. Luke 13:22-24ff. compares with Matthew 7:21-23 on the judgment scene and the narrow gate. Luke 16:17-18 parallels Matthew 5:18 and 32, which includes the “jot and tittle” statement and the ethics of marriage. The connections we see between portions of the sermon may not have been as strong in Jesus’ mind as they might look to us. The structure of Matthew’s account may be more apparent than real. Observations based on sequence and association may be well to make, but their validity probably rests more on the nature of adjacent subjects than on their placement.</p></p>

<p>Interpretation involves (1) discovering the referent, (2) connecting the referent by consistency with the rest of the big picture (integration), and (3) making application to issues the author does not address, including the modern needs of believers. The first two aspects belong to “what it meant”; the last is “what it means.” We “interpret” (exegesis) to discover “meaning” (integration) so we can “understand” and have “wisdom” (application). Until we reach a level of understanding that enables us to use what we know, we do not “understand” in a “useful” way.</p></p>

<p>Viewpoints based on feelings can come from confusing feelings with the work of the Spirit. People do not consider changing beliefs because they feel that the viewpoint they have must be right. There is danger in supposing that the sense (feeling) of certainty is a reason for certainty—that the Spirit places it directly in the mind. There is no more reason to assume that happens in regard to a feeling than a thought. In either case, if people cannot differentiate between something planted by the Spirit and their own thoughts and feelings, they should not consider it divine in origin.</p></p>

Romans 3:31?), (4) an obedience that accomplished what was commanded (Romans 13:8-10), (5) a necessary inference from another passage, (6) a meeting of the requirements for something (“This course fulfills the requirement”), and (7) a mere formal similarity (? Matthew 2:18, 23; perhaps 2:15).</p></p>

<p>For interpreters to do their work properly, they must be able to bring to the text an awareness of as many linguistic and conceptual features as appear and are presupposed in the materials they are trying to understand. Jesus’ hearers in John 7:34-36 wondered whether he would go among the Gentiles or Diasporic Jews when he said, “You cannot go where I am going.” They could not understand him because in their minds they did not have the possibility of Messiah’s ascension to heaven.

Technicalizing leads to expectancy for uniform usage. It specifies a smaller group within those who could be described by the word picture. In church offices, elder means more than “older”; it ‎means a(n older) man who oversees a group of believers as when qualifications are listed and a process of selection takes place.</p></p>

<p>Interpretation of texts often comes in terms of the assumed overall viewpoints, more than by the requirements of the text under discussion. Hence, we can’t solve the problem itself because we are not dealing with the whole viewpoint that gives credence to the idea on this text.</p>
<p>One approach to an unacceptable view is to show that each text used to support it can be handled in a way that fits with another view. When all the texts so used have been addressed in this way, no basis remains for the questionable idea. So, it is not a matter of disproving, but of showing that the other view cannot shoulder its positive burden of proof; so the view is at best a matter of opinion because it is a viewpoint based on inadequate evidence.</p></p>

<p>Even though the Sermon on the Mount is wisdom literature and therefore less structured, it has pattern and carries a unifying theme. The initial set of beatitudes introduces statements of responsibility for being God’s light and salt in the world. To accomplish that purpose, Jesus’ disciples must correct their thinking at points like the ones he mentions. We should not misconstrue this correcting as discarding previous revelation, but as fulfilling it by proper understanding. In 5:20 Jesus tells his followers that their righteousness needs to exceed that of contemporary religious leaders, a comment clarified by six illustrations. Under the contrast formula “You have heard that it was said by them of old time . . . but I tell you     . . .” Jesus discusses murder, adultery and divorce, oath taking, revenge, and love. Chapter 6:1-18 is a further unit about hypocrisy.</p></p>

<p>Streamlining causal distinctions is a shorthand way of speaking about causal relationships. It occurs especially when the exact manner of connection is unimportant for present purposes. It can create ambiguity because the (1) mode of causality and (2) the directness of causation get blurred. All languages streamline causality and interchange modality, but Hebrew does so more than English and other modern languages do in cultures impacted by scientific precision. Much of the “God talk” in scripture comes to mean something different when English speakers use it; they bring the verbiage into their language without adjusting its import.

<p>Figurativeness and literalness are matters of degree. The degree of figurativeness depends on the purpose of communication.

Didactic material lies between the extremes. High levels of figurativeness do not occur so often in passages that seek to inform, because figurativeness works against clarity. Figurative language is used more for confirming truths already understood, exhortation, and impression.</p></p>

<p>AND SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR NEW TESTAMENT INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Guidelines for biblical interpretation include the “big three”: (1) the principle of harmony, (2) the principle of contrast, and (3) the nature of the case. The first derives from the nature of scripture, which as a matter of principle we accept as true throughout and therefore harmonious. The second principle derives from the nature of language, which conveys ideas relative to a framework of thought. The last principle derives from experience, a prime resource for knowing the way things are. All three principles interrelate and impact the interpretation of human language in general and scripture in particular.</p></p>

<p>(1) Texts get quoted incorrectly in popular usage. “Money is the root of all evil,” for example, misquotes the text, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” [incorrect quotation]</p>
<p>(2) The parts of a text get connected the wrong way. “By grace you are saved through faith, and that [faith] is not of yourselves; it is a gift from God.” That does not refer to faith, but to the salvation indicated in the verb—as the neuter form for “that” in the Greek text shows.

            <p class="essay-description"><p>NEW TESTAMENT INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>OF OLD TESTAMENT TEXTS</p>
<p>Several hermeneutical questions arise about the New Testament writers’ use of Old Testament texts. In cases like Matthew’s use of Hosea 11:1, we may broaden the definitions of prophecy and fulfillment as a way of legitimizing his use of the prophet’s comment. Making this move reflects a prior commitment to the principle that inspiration makes New Testament authors “forever correct.” People’s prior commitment to “inerrancy” causes them to take a positive view on a text that they might not otherwise have chosen or would otherwise consider a matter of opinion. That does not weaken its validity; it merely demonstrates consistency. We cannot with finality settle some questions directly. We take views on derivative issues that harmonize with primary views. On the other hand, the possibility of other imaginable reasons for a writer’s use of an earlier text does not invalidate one affirmed because of assumed inerrancy. We are involved here in the distinction between a presuppositional and phenomenological approach to the view of scripture. Without the assumption that divine inspiration kept writers from error, we would have less justification for using insights from one writer to clarify ambiguous words of another writer, for harmonizing two authors who could otherwise mean incompatible things, for interpreting biblical statements so as not to conflict with information we learn from science, for choosing this interpretation from among two or more otherwise equally plausible views, given only the text itself, or even for taking a less likely sounding interpretation.</p></p>

<p>You have heard that it was said to them of old time, “You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths.” But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your conversation be yes, yes and no, no.

            <p class="essay-description"><p>OVERCOMING THE CRITICAL MIND SET</p>
<p>When Jesus says, “Do not judge,” he raises four questions: (1) What does judge mean? (2) Why do we do it? (3) Why should we stop it? (4) How can we stop it? We can study Matthew 7:1-6 by asking these questions about the text.</p>
<p>I. What does judge mean?</p>
<p>Judge means more than “evaluate.” In 7:6 Jesus warns his listeners not to cast pearls before swine or give holy things to dogs. To take that advice, we have to make a judgment as to who is, so to speak, a “dog” or “pig.” We must always discern the difference between right and wrong or effective and ineffective, and we are called on to warn fellowmen about such things. Nevertheless, on occasion Matthew 7:1 is quoted in self-defense by people appropriately confronted with some characteristic sin. But, since fellow Christians have mutual responsibility to lead each other to repentance, Jesus does not forbid reaching a verdict on the morality of someone’s behavior and approaching him about it respectfully.</p></p>

<p>Basic claim: law is artificial to interpersonal process and detrimental to Christianity; law impacts interpretation, faith, and practice. We are calling the Christian worldview “interpersonal” because persons in relationship are the most original, eternal, supreme, basic, pervasive, universal, and complex aspect of the system. Christianity’s prominent vocabulary deals with persons relating positively to one another: love, faith, grace, mercy, promise, truth (in communication), conscience, heart, mind, blessing, righteousness, reconciliation, joy (vs. happiness), humility, peace (vs. national tranquility), spirit (vs. physical circumcision for naturalization into a physical nation). All the features of interpersonalism contrast with their opposites. The first and second great commandments (cp. Golden Rule) deal with love, the summarizing, most important, outward-directed pattern of interpersonal action, which produces the other interpersonal actions. As Micah 6:8 said of old, “What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God” (cp. Deuteronomy 10:12-13; Isaiah 66:2).</p></p>

<p>Matthew 6:19-34 gives us an opportunity to use a simple method of Bible study. It consists of asking a question and reading scripture with an eye for answers. We may be surprised at how often scripture addresses such questions. Familiar scriptures take on a fresh light because new experiences establish a new context for seeing new applications. The answers were not noticed before because we were not prepared for them. Matthew 6 offers insights into matters we never thought the Bible even addressed.</p></p>

Themes may be used to fulfill the purpose of writing. (Note Tenney, Galatians, pp. 25-35)</p></p>

<p>Is there a verse or set of verses in scripture that supports the hermeneutical principle (biblical/systematic) that specific passages are to be understood within the overall context of scripture itself, or is this a logical principle of interpretation put together from experience?</p>
<p>The question about systematic interpretation of the Bible can be asked about the interpretation of any body of communication. Systematic harmonization is the natural thing to do in interpretation; there is nothing surprising about it. We always take an individual comment in light of the whole conversation because we know enough about language to know that a person cannot say everything in every sentence. The same principle applies to a book or an author’s set of books. For the time being, we assume the author is speaking consistently between the parts of a conversation, between articles, or between books spread out even over several years.</p></p>

<p>The previous study on Matthew 7:12 dealt with the meaning of the Golden Rule. This study looks at the impact of the Golden Rule on individuals and on their relationships. In the parallel between “[Do] [to others] [as you would have others do to you]” and “[Love] [your neighbor] [as yourself],” we made two primary observations. (1) Do replaces love; so love is an action that can be commanded. That doing is a giving of ourselves for the joy of others. Often love means giving of ourselves for the needs of others, but we can also love God, who “is not served by men’s hands as though he needed anything” (Acts 17:25). It is better, then, to define love broadly enough to include loving him. When we meet people’s needs, we are increasing their happiness; so love becomes self-giving for the joy of others.</p></p>
