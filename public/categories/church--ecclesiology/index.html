<p>We may question whether Judas should be counted among the men called apostles in the primary sense. Although he originally had that role, he left it (cp. Acts 1:15-22).. In addition, he did not see the resurrected Christ receive the commission and enablements distinctive to apostles in the primary sense. With Judas omitted, that leaves thirteen apostles with Matthias replacing Judas and Paul joining the class later.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>ARE THERE MODERN-DAY APOSTLES?</p>
<p>Two Word Meanings</p>
<p>Christians sometimes ask whether there are apostles in the church today. To answer the question, we must clarify what it means because the New Testament uses apostle in more than one way. Its general sense refers to someone who is “sent,” which makes it a synonym for missionary. In its technical usage, apostle refers to a group of men, fourteen in number, who had additional specialized qualifications: they were direct witnesses of the resurrected Christ (except for Judas Iscariot), directly chosen and commissioned by Christ, directly endowed with their message, directly guided in their work, and directly empowered by the Spirit. (See “Paul as Primary Apostle.”). “You tried the ones that call themselves apostles and aren’t” (Revelation 2:2) implies that some apostles were distinguishable from other apostles. If all apostles were simply traveling evangelists or insightful men differing only in degree, they could be called apostles. Denying the claim would be like denying that someone was a missionary. They were in fact traveling, they were in fact insightful if they were, and they were in fact sent from somewhere.</p></p>

<p>Physical force, legal authority, and personal influence are three means of controlling persons. The distinctness, compatibility, and relationship of the latter two are especially important in a study of church organization. Authority is the legal right to compel the behavior only of status inferiors. Influence is the personal ability to impel the behavior even of status superiors. A study of organizational structure concerns itself with the pattern of authority flow.</p></p>

<p>THE NEW TESTAMENT STRUCTURE</p>
<p>Basic Structure</p>
<p>This chapter sketches the original organization of the universal church according to the evidence of the New Testament taken alone. As respects authority the approach will be to determine what positions have authority and to consider the rest as functions. This procedure is possible not only because an either-or matter is under consideration, but more particularly because authority includes function. One cannot suppose that a function is seen as such only because the evidence recorded happens to be insufficient to show that it was really an office. That approach becomes an argument from silence and shifts the burden of proof onto the negative. The negative burden of proof in this instance would be impossible since the only available evidence would pertain to function, which is part of the larger concept of office.</p></p>

<p>Divine Origination</p>
<p>Prescriptive Divine Origin</p>
<p>The normativeness of the first-century pattern may be conveniently discussed under three headings progressively arranged: divine origin, intended permanence, and inherent exclusive-ness.</p>
<p>Formal application</p>
<p>Christ’s lordship. Jesus Christ is an appointed King of a granted kingdom (Luke 19:12). The givenness of that entity includes its form—“kingdom”—as well as the principles of kingdom government–formal authority prescriptively applied. The organization of the church did not result from a natural process of crystallization among the disciples of Jesus, for Jesus was not a teacher like Socrates, who wrote nothing, founded nothing, and died, only to leave behind a group of followers that evolved a tradition of thought and practice. As to essential nature the church is kingdom as well as brotherhood. As regards government, the church may be called a Christocratic monarchy.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>COMMENTS ON ORDINATION</p>
<p>Across Christendom ordination has had a variety of meanings. The most extreme position has been that (1) ordination validates the “administration” of sacraments. Unless a duly qualified clergyman presides, the sacrament is invalid in much the same way that a wedding performed by a person “off the street” would not be recognized by the state. A Justice of the Peace must be duly appointed to perform wedding ceremonies as an agent of the state. In this view, ordination is for theological reasons. The clergy concept is part of the larger idea that grace flows through the church, that is, through those who validly stand as executors of divine administration. It is a legal conceptualization like that of Justice of the Peace, validity being based on “apostolic succession.” Legal administration of grace, however, is a contradiction of terms.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>The church is saved people serving in divine pattern. The body of Christ possesses essential oneness by virtue of individual unity with Christ and collective unity through Christ. This invisible oneness is manifest by a dynamic structure-function called the church. Functional unity in Christ combines with organizational unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.</p>
<p>As a first major concern the historical argument for non-denominationalism focused particularly on the last of these elements: the organizational pattern of the church established under direct apostolic administration. Although the first four elements have probably never been fully present in the visible church, it was anticipated that sufficient evidence was available to show that formal oneness did exist in the beginning.</p></p>

<p>Paul gives “husband of one wife” as a characteristic of elders and deacons in 1 Timothy 3:2, 12 and Titus 1:6. The following diagram traces the pattern of thought for determining what he meant by this phrase.</p>
<p>STEP I. We must distinguish between what to do because it is best under the circumstances (“expediency”) and what a passage requires (“exegesis”). For instance, in the case of married versus not married, it is one thing to say that there are advantages to having a married eldership; it is another thing to say that Paul is requiring a married eldership. This treatment of the problem addresses primarily what the passage means as to whether elders and deacons must be married.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>ORDINATION: WHO AND WHOM</p>
<p>Ordination to ministry involves three considerations: (1) the understanding of New Testament offices and ministry, (2) the New Testament meaning of ordination, and (3) the meaning attached to ordination by society today and by the state.</p>
<p>I. Who should be ordained?</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the church, the New Testament does not evidence an understanding of ordination that corresponds with the traditional clergy concept. Ordination does not validate a person’s ministry. It does not bestow the right to preach, “administer sacraments,” pronounce absolution. The only ordination observed in the New Testament is an appointment to specific tasks. If done, ordination today simply commends an individual to the general Christian community. It indicates that in the ordaining congregation believes the person has the character, abilities, and skills appropriate to the calling. That has been sufficient to qualify him also for the rights vouchsafed to religious leaders by the state. So ordination has been a matter of expediency rather than necessity.</p></p>

<p>I. Ordination is for the one ordained.</p>
<p>Ordination is for impressing on the person ordained the importance of his calling. People set aside time for things that are important. By setting aside time to concentrate on what it means to minister, the body of believers shows the person their regard for that calling. Ordination provides a time to be impressed with the significance of the “ministry of reconciliation,” as Paul called it (2 Corinthians 5:18-21).</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>PAUL AS PRIMARY APOSTLE</p>
<p>Some have questioned whether Paul belonged to the primary group of Jesus’ followers called “apostles.” During the early years of the Christian era, the Judaizing element in the church attempted (1) on doctrinal grounds to put him in secondary position. They tried to create the impression that he stood at odds with the primary apostles, those centering around Peter in Jerusalem. Judaizers believed that Gentile converts should become Jews in the process of becoming Christians. Paul opposed their call for circumcising Gentiles and thereby identifying them with national Israel and obligating them to keep the Mosaic Law. He understood in the first case, relative to the church, that Christianity does not have a political component. He observed in the second case, relative to salvation, that putting Gentiles under Jewish Law would in theory bring them under a perfection requirement for continued relationship to God—initial salvation by grace and continued salvation by works.</p></p>

<p>In theory, two positions operating in relationship may differ from one another in authority in at least six ways:</p>
<p>(a)	as to its being resident in one vs. passing through the other from the first;</p>

<p>The conclusion seems too restrictive that elders handled spiritual matters while deacons handled material ones. The idea comes from the account of the seven appointed in Acts 6:1-6 to “serve tables.” The account does not call them “deacons,” and later we find Philip and Stephen involved in spiritual matters and operating beyond the local situation. Their work evidently progressed beyond the earlier or primary responsibility. So, the case is ambiguous for defining the role deacons fulfilled.</p></p>

<p>The church is saved people serving in divine pattern. The body of Christ possesses essential oneness by virtue of individual unity with Christ and collective unity through Christ. This invisible oneness is manifest by a dynamic structure-function called the church. Functional unity in Christ combines with organizational unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.</p></p>

<p>Basic Structure</p>
<p>This chapter sketches the original organization of the church in the New Testament. It determines what positions exercised authority and which were functions, all being places of service. The procedure works because it addresses an either-or matter and because authority includes function. We cannot suppose that a function seemed to be such only because the records happen to be insufficient to show that it was really an office. That would argue from silence and shift the burden of proof onto the negative. The negative burden would be impossible since the only available evidence would pertain to function, which is part of the larger concept: office.</p></p>
