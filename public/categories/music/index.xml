      <description>&lt;p&gt;LEADING CONGREGATIONAL SINGING:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SONG LEADERS AND INSTRUMENTALISTS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virgil &amp;amp; Ruth Ann Warren&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instrumentalists serve to enhance congregational participation in worship. Their work should not distract or confuse worshipers’ participation. Mistakes should be minimized, for example, which means preparing the music ahead of time instead of relying too much on sight- reading ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introductions can establish tempo as well as pitch for each selection. So, instead of coming to a hold after the introduction, maintain a steady beat for starting the singing. Newer hymnals have marks that show what musicians can use as an introduction. Usually it consists of the last four measures of the hymn. Perhaps a better way is to combine maybe four measures from the beginning with two or four measures from the end. That reminds the congregation how the hymn begins, a useful aid especially if it is a song that is less familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
