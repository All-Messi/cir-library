<p>The deistic impulse of a Newtonian universe shows itself in theological liberalism (the “older modernism”) that is akin to ancient Sadduceeism. This impulse correlates with (a) the stress on “scientific” method, taken to mean something that eliminates anything supernatural. There is a confusion between what a method can address and the idea that only those things exist which that method can address. The deistic impulse tries to foster an aura of philosophical legitimacy by claiming that (b) miracle would be a contradiction of natural law. The claim confuses contrary and contradictory, and different from opposite.</p></p>

<p>There is a distinction between progressivism and evolution, the one being forward movement while the latter is simply modification. Progressivism in the 1800s expressed itself in post-millennialism and in biblical criticism in the Tübingen school, which denied to Paul all his letters except four: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. German rationalism postulated a long upward development pattern that brought about the Christian literary canon as late as A.D. 180. In the 1900s, this extreme gave way to a more reasonable approach that did not see a need for 150 years to develop the New Testament documents. Some, like John A. T. Robinson went to the opposite extreme by saying that all the New Testament books could have existed by A.D. 70. World War I smashed the onward-and-upward hopefulness about humankind, and led to pre-millennialism eschatologically and a turn toward less extreme critical viewpoints in New Testament studies. The evolutionary framework is still presupposed, but Paul is usually allowed to have at least nine of the letters that ancient Christian writers assigned to him.</p></p>

<p>I. Definition of Canonicity</p>
<p>Canonicity constitutes normative literature. It sets the doctrinal “norms” by which we consider issues and measure viewpoints. In Christianity, canonicity correlates with inspiration. The canon consists of writings that came from “inspired” men, men whose writings were as correct and authoritative as they would have been if God himself had “exhaled them” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>CRITICAL INTRODUCTION TO 2 JOHN</p>
<p>I. Authorship</p>
<p>A.  External</p>
<p>The external attestation to 2 John is not so strong as that for 1 John. Absence of citations from the book may have been due to its subject matter. It is significant that the objections to apostolic authorship come from the later Christian writers.</p>
<p>B.  Internal</p>
<p>The term “the Elder” (v. 1) is appropriate for any older man of any office, especially since by the time of its writing, the apostle John was probably the only living apostle. “Elder” among the Jews was applied to leaders at (1) the synagogue level, but also at (2) the city level and (3) the national level. By analogy it appears that “elder” could have been applied to local units but also to the whole “nation” (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; cp. Philemon 9?). So it could designate the ultimate leadership within any level (John, Peter, Paul?). The expression “apostles and elders” (Acts 15:2) is significant in this respect. Could it mean elders in general with the apostles as specially marked among them? A slightly different arrangement terminologically would have the apostles as “apostles” of the universal church and at the same time (some of) the “elders” of the Jerusalem church. The passage in Eusebius that contains Papias’ statement (Ecclesiastical History 3:39:4) introduces all the apostles as “elders.” So a distinction between the apostle John and an elder John is not necessary in view of Papias’ use of the words. Note also 1 Peter 5:1.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>DESTINATION AND DATE OF GALATIANS</p>
<p>The main introductory problems associated with Galatians are its destination and date. Determining the destination affects the time frame for the date. Since the readers are called “Galatians” (3:1; cp. 1:2), the question is whether Paul uses the term to mean (1) the ethnic group of Gauls, who gave their name to the ancient Hellenistic kingdom, or (2) the citizens of the Roman province of Galatia. The “northern Galatia” theory refers to the first option; the “southern Galatia” theory indicates the second. By that time the Roman province extended farther south to include Lystra, Derbe, and Iconium, cities Paul and Barnabas evangelized on the first missionary tour. Northern Galatia was a less extensive territory in the mountainous inland area around Pessinus and Ancyra.</p></p>

<p>Ephesians does represent a historical situation. Tychicus is the bearer, who will tell a definite readership about the affairs of Paul. The lack of detailed historical and geographical data is offset by its probable encyclical destination and its hortatory-doctrinal purpose. Furthermore, since Ephesians was published contemporary with Colossians and borne by the same messengers, historical details were not of such importance, being available from the bearers.</p></p>

A similar comment appears in the account of the spear thrust: “He that has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knows he says true things that you may believe” (19:35; cp. 20:30-31). The characteristic description appears five times in the gospel beginning with the night before Christ’s death: 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, and 21:20.1 Other more vague references to unnamed men include the second of “two disciples” of John that heard Jesus speak (1:35-39), the first being Andrew (1:40); and “another disciple,” known by the high priest (18:15).</p></p>

<p>Historical backgrounds are important because they illuminate scripture. They often confirm the biblical record and may help prove its trustworthiness on things that can be tested. So we view historical backgrounds as a valuable resource. This presentation, however, stresses another observation. Like all sources of information, historical backgrounds misused can harm rather than help biblical studies. It can detract from hermeneutical and apologetic concerns.</p></p>

<p>I.  Selectivity</p>
<p>The fact that the book does not recount all the events means that selection has occurred. If selection has occurred, the writer does not just tell about a bunch of things that happened (“stream of consciousness”). Rather, he is a historian that makes a judgment about what events are epitomes and direction-setting events. Seeing the big picture, a historian chooses events that—from the vantage point of God above or of later perspective—prove to be more important because of their impact on subsequent events or prove more useful to any distinctive purpose the author may have.</p></p>

For the sake of meeting the minds of the ones we want to address, we use the vocabulary of the other in reference to our own subject so there can be a correlation of parts of thought systems, or functional equivalents. Becoming/being a Christian we might call a natural “high” because of the modern drug scene. Vocabulary generated by such circumstances will be peculiar to the circumstance (cp. “circumcision of the heart,” “fullness of the godhead,” “armor of salvation”).</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>NEW TESTAMENT STUDIES AND THE USE OF AMANUENSES</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The majority of New Testament writings are letters, so we expect them to reflect practices in first-century letter writing. One custom was using an amanuensis, a stenographer who wrote down the contents. Biblical studies do not give this factor much attention even though New Testament writers used amanuenses. The oversight seems unusual to us today since most of us in the Western world write our own correspondence. If we do employ a secretary, it is primarily for computer skills. We are accustomed to reproducing by typeset, copiers, or computer printers. But ancient writers had to use different methods. If the work of an amanuensis can impact New Testament studies, we should allow that to affect our thinking where appropriate.</p></p>

<p>A prevalent idea in current religious studies is that Christianity as we know it became associated by way of historical process with the Roman government. The line of descent from Jesus that history preserved was that line of development, both as to its viewpoints and its literature. Petrine Christianity as represented by the Judaizers was the main contrast to Pauline Christianity and its international universalism. Government influence suppressed and destroyed the writings of “heretics” as measured by the preserved standard, and generally disenfranchised its people. So, the understanding of Jesus as well as the canonical literature that has descended to us results from historical processes and no more represent a “legitimate,” or true, understanding of Jesus than other traditions did.</p></p>

<p>Some scholars suppose the apostles did not consider their work as something for the subsequent ages of the church. They were writing for the then and there. They had supposed that Christ would return within the lifetime of some first-generation Christians. Writing for posterity did not enter their minds. If their literary activity took place under these conditions, collecting their writings to establish a permanent canon would not have been a concerted effort either. Only when it became evident that Christ would not immediately return did the early Christians begin to locate and assemble apostolic writings.</p></p>

<p>CORRESPONDENCE THEORY</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 does not form the whole of the “previous letter.” It is not a unit that can stand on its own, so its beginning and end have been removed and then inserted where it does not fit very well. The reasons for considering these verses an interpolation are (1) that they do not tie closely to the surrounding context and (2) that if they are omitted, the flow of thought is smooth enough that a reader would not notice anything was missing. In relation to the first reason, we wonder why a redactor would put it in at this point if it does not fit with the context very well, especially after he had excised it from its original setting in a fashion that does not form a unit. If a redactor could insert a paragraph that was loosely connected, an author himself could do the same thing.</p></p>

<p>I. Origin</p>
<p>Paul wrote Romans after the acquaintances previously known from elsewhere had moved to the imperial city (16:3-16), after he had preached from Jerusalem to Illyricum (Romans 15:19, cp. 23), while he was in route to Jerusalem with the offering for the saints (Romans 15:25-28, 31), and at a time when he anticipated preaching the gospel in Spain (15:24, 28-29). According to Acts 19:21-22, while Paul was still in Ephesus on the third tour, he planned to go to Jerusalem and then to Rome. On this third tour, Paul organized the collection for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (cp. Acts 20:4; 21:15; 1 Corinthians 16:1-9;     2 Corinthians 8-9). Having left Ephesus after the riot, Paul journeyed north through Troas, across through Macedonia, and down to Greece (20:1-6) before returning through Macedonia and down the east coast of the Aegean Sea to Miletus and on to Palestine. He had not planned to minister again in Asia (Acts 20:25, 38). His three-month stay in Corinth during this trip would have given him time to compose Romans.</p></p>

<p>I.	While 2 Samuel 7:14 must refer to Solomon because Solomon so understood it (1 Kings 6:11-13; 8:17-21), it cannot refer exclusively to him since the context speaks of an eternal seed (2 Samuel 7:16).</p>

<p>Introductory Guidelines</p>
<p>The kinds of sources found in Pauline material are not only those that appear in literature generally, but those that fit the nature of scripture. This observation is not meant to prejudice research but to point out a consistency Christians expect to find in this study. So the first guideline is that (a) scripture is like what God himself would exhale. Presumably 2 Timothy 3:16 teaches that scripture as such is God-breathed as to its intended content. Sources and processes of origination for Pauline material correlate with the nature of scripture that issues from them.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>THE DETERMINING PRINCIPLES FOR CANONICITY</p>
<p>In keeping with the structure of apologetics, the following sketch deals with the principles for determining whether a writing belongs in the Judaeo-Christian canon.</p>
<p>The historical principle comes logically first because canonicity has first to do with (5) where the book came from, which means who wrote it and where he got his information. Behind this step lies the concern about (4) how people recognized divine spokesmen and distinguished them from false claimants. The question rests on the observation that God’s breaking into the world through special revelation always, by definition and the nature of the case, involves (3) miracle. Even the prophets themselves must be able to distinguish divine revelation from their own thoughts. The next step is (2) the distinction between divine miracle that confirms revelation and other phenomena like demonic miracle, deception, parapsychological phenomena, misidentified natural occurrences. This distinction is most decisively made by (1) the triumph of the divine in confrontation with alternatives: the “resurrection” of Israel from Egypt (and attendant events) for the Old Testament and the resurrection of Messiah from the grave in the New Testament serve as prime examples. These are historical considerations because biblical revelation is a historical (vs. metaphysical) construct. The historical principle determines canonicity by giving us the right books in the first place; it is positive.</p></p>

<p>Among the suggestions offered for the purpose of Luke-Acts are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Luke-Acts was prepared as a trial brief for Paul’s first appearance before the judgment seat of Caesar. It explained the forerunner and founding personality of Christianity and showed its general relationship to Judaism, and then proceeded to outline the pattern of its spread from Judaea throughout the rest of the Roman Empire. The fact that Acts portrays the relationship between Christians and Roman rulers in a good light could corroborate this suggestion. Theophilus could have been Paul’s trial lawyer. “Most excellent” (Luke 1:3) could be a title of address for such a dignitary (Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25).</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS</p>
<p>Scholars speculate about synoptic origins in an effort to create a scenario for the features of the first three gospels as a set. We do not have to settle on what actually explains the phenomena; we need only develop credible possibilities for explaining those features.</p>
<p>I. Introducing the Synoptic Problem</p>
<p>The “synoptic problem” addresses the relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The degree of their similarity calls for explanation beyond what happened. Their unusual similarity is then complicated by the differences between them. Evangelical perspective calls for minimizing appeal to contradiction to solve the question. The synoptic phenomenon is part of the “gospel problem” as a whole. In addition to the characteristics of all four gospels, the synoptic problem focuses on features shared by the first three. The following considerations highlight how alike they are.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>THE WITNESS OF ACTS TO THE KERYGMA</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Theories about an evolutionary origin for the Christian religion present a fundamental line of inquiry. The body of literature called the “New Testament” supposedly shows stages that process passed through. If the New Testament does not actually represent the original Christian preaching, what really did comprise their message, and how can we recover that primitive gospel?</p>
<p>Acts of Apostles, written after the life of Jesus of Nazareth, presupposes incidents in his ministry. It purports to be a history of men divinely appointed to establish a religion based on these incidents. The record of their “acts” includes accounts of what they said as well. Such a record should prove valuable in discovering the content of the earliest “preaching,” the kerygma.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>TYPICAL ISSUES IN CRITICAL INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Critical introduction addresses several issues related to the study of documents. In this setting, “introduction” does not mean getting acquainted with a book’s contents for the first time. “Critical” introduction does not “criticize” the book as if to degrade it. Critical introduction evaluates the nature of a book and matters surrounding its origin.</p>
<p>Two classifications of information critics draw on in this endeavor are internal evidence and external evidence. Internal evidence refers to data in the writing; external evidence refers to information from elsewhere. In critical introduction to the New Testament, (a) extant early Christian literature provides most of the external evidence. (b) Other resources related to the origins of Christianity help evaluate the records of early Christianity. They have been assembled in writings like F. F. Bruce’s Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1974) or Gary R. Habermas’ Ancient Evidence for the Life of Jesus: Historical Records of His Death and Resurrection (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1984). A final, more distant source of introductory information comes from extra-biblical records that preserve (c) the historical background in the contemporary biblical world.</p></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The New Testament contains several literary genres:</p>
<p>gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)</p>
<p>history (Acts)</p>

<p>apocalyptic (Revelation)</p>
<p>wisdom literature (Sermon on the Mount, James, Jude).</p>
<p>I. Content</p>
<p>Wisdom literature has some affinities with law. They both deal with human behavior and so use the imperative mood extensively. Wisdom, however, is a larger category than law even as advice is larger than commandment. The accompanying diagram shows their relationship. Advice vs. commandment, opinion vs. faith and fact, procedure vs. fundamental morality represent distinctions between the two types of material. Advice and commandment differ as to intent and scope. The advice in wisdom literature is not interested just in what</p></p>
