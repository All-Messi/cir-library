            <p class="essay-description"><p>“BEYOND THE JORDAN”:  A PHRASE IN QUESTION</p>
<p>“Beyond the Jordan” is a recurring biblical phrase that requires detailed study. It has relevance to locating unknown places like “the threshing floor of Atad” in Genesis 50:10, 11. In this reference “beyond the Jordan” occurs twice as an explanatory note for the position of the threshing floor.</p>
<p>Questions arise as to whether the geographical note carries a consistent meaning, what that usage is, whether more than one consistency may be involved, and whether there are sufficient clear usages to determine its significance in ambiguous cases.</p></p>

<p>The deistic impulse of a Newtonian universe shows itself in theological liberalism (the “older modernism”) that is akin to ancient Sadduceeism. This impulse correlates with (a) the stress on “scientific” method, taken to mean something that eliminates anything supernatural. There is a confusion between what a method can address and the idea that only those things exist which that method can address. The deistic impulse tries to foster an aura of philosophical legitimacy by claiming that (b) miracle would be a contradiction of natural law. The claim confuses contrary and contradictory, and different from opposite.</p></p>

<p>There is a distinction between progressivism and evolution, the one being forward movement while the latter is simply modification. Progressivism in the 1800s expressed itself in post-millennialism and in biblical criticism in the Tübingen school, which denied to Paul all his letters except four: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. German rationalism postulated a long upward development pattern that brought about the Christian literary canon as late as A.D. 180. In the 1900s, this extreme gave way to a more reasonable approach that did not see a need for 150 years to develop the New Testament documents. Some, like John A. T. Robinson went to the opposite extreme by saying that all the New Testament books could have existed by A.D. 70. World War I smashed the onward-and-upward hopefulness about humankind, and led to pre-millennialism eschatologically and a turn toward less extreme critical viewpoints in New Testament studies. The evolutionary framework is still presupposed, but Paul is usually allowed to have at least nine of the letters that ancient Christian writers assigned to him.</p></p>

<p>Can we put in sequence the origin of reciprocating parts that are necessary for the viability of the organism and the parts themselves? If we can put their origin in sequence, they are not reciprocal. But the parts of plants and animals are in fact reciprocally interdependent unto viability. All parts have to be present and functional at all times. Disorganization destroys functionality.</p>
<p>Reciprocation is related to the concept of irreducible minimums, but it adds to it the origin of complexity and change between levels of complexity; hence, the mechanisms of change plus hoistic harmony.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>COMMENTS ON EXTREME EVIL</p>
<p>Although the problem of evil is not “easy” to answer, we can understand some things about how a degree of evil could occur in a holy God’s universe. But why an all-powerful God allows extreme evil to happen is more difficult. Scripture itself does not explain why he lets evil operate to the degree it does. Nevertheless, some observations make the issue more understandable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, whatever the reason(s), God does not place himself above the horrors of human suffering. It is beyond us how he can stand by and let atrocities take place before his very eyes when he could do something to stop them. We must remember, however, that the Father has not only stood by and let evil people mistreat other evil people and even abuse good people; he stood by and let sinful men crucify his own Son. No wonder Jesus cried out, “Why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46; etc., cp. Psalm 22:1). The human perspective of the dying divine Son is graphically evident in that “cry of dereliction.” That situation is even more difficult when he lets good men do evil, thinking they were doing him service (John 16:2). The crucifixion of Messiah involves both the Father standing by and the Son standing in the pain (John 18:6, etc.)—even though Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels to deliver him (Matthew 26:53). Whatever the reason, it is significant enough that deity went through it himself, not asking us to endure anything he was unwilling to suffer. Deity does not play favorites with his own, not even with his own Son, not even with himself.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>COMPARING THEISM AND NATURALISM IN ORIGINS THEORY</p>
<p>A formal similarity could be seen between “emergent evolution” and progressive creationism. The “emergent points” of emergent evolution might appear to correlate with the “intervention points” of progressive revelation. From a scientist’s viewpoint, we could consider the possibility that a connector in a progression is a natural one rather than a supernatural one, as previously supposed. We may not already know that a natural “force” exists for accomplishing this complexification. There is a difference, however, between keeping the natural category potential for explanation in such cases and making it the necessary category for explanation by disallowing the supernatural category in principle. The latter is what methodological naturalism does by assuming that its method, good in itself, somehow becomes the only legitimate method. Creationists, however, want to keep the supernatural category open after the initial creation of mass-energy. The formal similarity is limited because of the internal-external variable in the respective formats at their correlating junction points.</p></p>

<p>I. Authorship</p>
<p>A.  External</p>
<p>The external attestation to 2 John is not so strong as that for 1 John. Absence of citations from the book may have been due to its subject matter. It is significant that the objections to apostolic authorship come from the later Christian writers.</p>
<p>B.  Internal</p>
<p>The term “the Elder” (v. 1) is appropriate for any older man of any office, especially since by the time of its writing, the apostle John was probably the only living apostle. “Elder” among the Jews was applied to leaders at (1) the synagogue level, but also at (2) the city level and (3) the national level. By analogy it appears that “elder” could have been applied to local units but also to the whole “nation” (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; cp. Philemon 9?). So it could designate the ultimate leadership within any level (John, Peter, Paul?). The expression “apostles and elders” (Acts 15:2) is significant in this respect. Could it mean elders in general with the apostles as specially marked among them? A slightly different arrangement terminologically would have the apostles as “apostles” of the universal church and at the same time (some of) the “elders” of the Jerusalem church. The passage in Eusebius that contains Papias’ statement (Ecclesiastical History 3:39:4) introduces all the apostles as “elders.” So a distinction between the apostle John and an elder John is not necessary in view of Papias’ use of the words. Note also 1 Peter 5:1.</p></p>

<p>The main introductory problems associated with Galatians are its destination and date. Determining the destination affects the time frame for the date. Since the readers are called “Galatians” (3:1; cp. 1:2), the question is whether Paul uses the term to mean (1) the ethnic group of Gauls, who gave their name to the ancient Hellenistic kingdom, or (2) the citizens of the Roman province of Galatia. The “northern Galatia” theory refers to the first option; the “southern Galatia” theory indicates the second. By that time the Roman province extended farther south to include Lystra, Derbe, and Iconium, cities Paul and Barnabas evangelized on the first missionary tour. Northern Galatia was a less extensive territory in the mountainous inland area around Pessinus and Ancyra.</p></p>

<p>To locate the study of critical introduction to the Old Testament within the total picture of apologetics, we give here an abstract of the flow of apologetics. Instead of beginning with objective Christian evidences, as traditionally done, we include a prior step so that evangelism and apologetics become much the same kind of thing. Coming to conviction begins in the present with (1) our sense of need to be loved, to feel innocent and meaningful, and to have something to depend on. (2) The answer in Christianity comes as a cluster of historical events surrounding the person of Jesus the Messiah, especially his resurrection and the meaning of his life, death, and resurrection for human need in any age. (3) When we begin to carry out the principles of living that Christ taught and to receive in experience Christ’s love, the purposefulness of life, the freedom from guilt, and the confidence of living under One we can trust, we confirm subjectively that the truth is also the truth for us. Living in the new condition helps us identify more clearly the real needs among, and plus, perceived needs. This stage helps us understand the message itself more clearly, and so on. The process forms an ongoing dynamic of reciprocal causations between the three “poles.”</p></p>

<p>Ephesians reflects no definite, localized, historical situation which it is intended to meet.</p>
<p>Ephesians does represent a historical situation. Tychicus is the bearer, who will tell a definite readership about the affairs of Paul. The lack of detailed historical and geographical data is offset by its probable encyclical destination and its hortatory-doctrinal purpose. Furthermore, since Ephesians was published contemporary with Colossians and borne by the same messengers, historical details were not of such importance, being available from the bearers.</p></p>

A similar comment appears in the account of the spear thrust: “He that has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knows he says true things that you may believe” (19:35; cp. 20:30-31). The characteristic description appears five times in the gospel beginning with the night before Christ’s death: 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, and 21:20.1 Other more vague references to unnamed men include the second of “two disciples” of John that heard Jesus speak (1:35-39), the first being Andrew (1:40); and “another disciple,” known by the high priest (18:15).</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>METHODOLOGY FOR CRITICAL INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>TO THE OLD TESTAMENT</p>
<p>For Christians, critical introduction to the Old Testament has the advantage of inspired external evidence to confirm and complement the internal evidence for authorship, date, and character of the earlier literary works. That approach represents logical order, not necessarily chronological order. The Christian method (1) begins with the New Testament verdict of Christ and the apostles insofar as they speak on critical Old Testament issues and (2) examines the data in those books to see whether they fit the verdict. Lastly, the method (3) crosschecks each book with information available from archaeology and ancient Near Eastern literature. The New Testament sets the framework for any view of the character and manner of origin for the Jewish canon. Tshe procedure could begin with the claims in the Old Testament books and measure the contents against the claims. In fact, that is what critics do with any book, but they would not be doing it as Christians. Critics do not have to do it necessarily as Christians, but Christians can take advantage of a factor already in place for clarifying and confirming matters where it can.</p></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The majority of New Testament writings are letters, so we expect them to reflect practices in first-century letter writing. One custom was using an amanuensis, a stenographer who wrote down the contents. Biblical studies do not give this factor much attention even though New Testament writers used amanuenses. The oversight seems unusual to us today since most of us in the Western world write our own correspondence. If we do employ a secretary, it is primarily for computer skills. We are accustomed to reproducing by typeset, copiers, or computer printers. But ancient writers had to use different methods. If the work of an amanuensis can impact New Testament studies, we should allow that to affect our thinking where appropriate.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>A prevalent idea in current religious studies is that Christianity as we know it became associated by way of historical process with the Roman government. The line of descent from Jesus that history preserved was that line of development, both as to its viewpoints and its literature. Petrine Christianity as represented by the Judaizers was the main contrast to Pauline Christianity and its international universalism. Government influence suppressed and destroyed the writings of “heretics” as measured by the preserved standard, and generally disenfranchised its people. So, the understanding of Jesus as well as the canonical literature that has descended to us results from historical processes and no more represent a “legitimate,” or true, understanding of Jesus than other traditions did.</p></p>

<p>The concept of evolution originated at least as early as the fifth century B.C. in the person of Greek philosopher Empedocles and may be traced in various forms through Aristotle, Augustine, and others until modern times. Charles Darwin gave classical expression to this much older idea when he published his Origin of the Species in 1859. He highlighted the principle of “natural selection,” which was supplemented by Lamarck’s notion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics” and de Vries’ “theory of mutations.”   Others influential in refining the evolutionary model and background factors include Maupertius, Erasmus, Robert Chambers, Herbert Spencer, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, and Mivart.</p></p>

<p>Some scholars suppose the apostles did not consider their work as something for the subsequent ages of the church. They were writing for the then and there. They had supposed that Christ would return within the lifetime of some first-generation Christians. Writing for posterity did not enter their minds. If their literary activity took place under these conditions, collecting their writings to establish a permanent canon would not have been a concerted effort either. Only when it became evident that Christ would not immediately return did the early Christians begin to locate and assemble apostolic writings.</p></p>

<p>CORRESPONDENCE THEORY</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 does not form the whole of the “previous letter.” It is not a unit that can stand on its own, so its beginning and end have been removed and then inserted where it does not fit very well. The reasons for considering these verses an interpolation are (1) that they do not tie closely to the surrounding context and (2) that if they are omitted, the flow of thought is smooth enough that a reader would not notice anything was missing. In relation to the first reason, we wonder why a redactor would put it in at this point if it does not fit with the context very well, especially after he had excised it from its original setting in a fashion that does not form a unit. If a redactor could insert a paragraph that was loosely connected, an author himself could do the same thing.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>RESOLVING APPARENT CONTRADICTIONS IN SCRIPTURE</p>
<p>Resolving apparent contradictions in scripture calls for methods of interpretation. The approach assumes the inerrancy of scripture; brain teasers often become paradoxes in wording rather than contradictions in reality. The approach also assumes that scripture is divine in such a way that makes it harmonious throughout. The mechanisms available for harmonizing scriptures with each other and with experience amount to the same things as the mechanisms used for properly interpreting human language. The same things we do to clear up ambiguities we do to resolve difficulties. Apparent difficulties normally arise because either or both sides of the dilemma are unclear, but people do not realize that at the time they sense a problem with the text. The following list is a summary of mechanisms for resolving discrepancies.</p></p>

<p>I. Origin</p>
<p>Paul wrote Romans after the acquaintances previously known from elsewhere had moved to the imperial city (16:3-16), after he had preached from Jerusalem to Illyricum (Romans 15:19, cp. 23), while he was in route to Jerusalem with the offering for the saints (Romans 15:25-28, 31), and at a time when he anticipated preaching the gospel in Spain (15:24, 28-29). According to Acts 19:21-22, while Paul was still in Ephesus on the third tour, he planned to go to Jerusalem and then to Rome. On this third tour, Paul organized the collection for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (cp. Acts 20:4; 21:15; 1 Corinthians 16:1-9;     2 Corinthians 8-9). Having left Ephesus after the riot, Paul journeyed north through Troas, across through Macedonia, and down to Greece (20:1-6) before returning through Macedonia and down the east coast of the Aegean Sea to Miletus and on to Palestine. He had not planned to minister again in Asia (Acts 20:25, 38). His three-month stay in Corinth during this trip would have given him time to compose Romans.</p></p>

<p>I.	While 2 Samuel 7:14 must refer to Solomon because Solomon so understood it (1 Kings 6:11-13; 8:17-21), it cannot refer exclusively to him since the context speaks of an eternal seed (2 Samuel 7:16).</p>

This observation is not meant to prejudice research but to point out a consistency Christians expect to find in this study. So the first guideline is that (a) scripture is like what God himself would exhale. Presumably 2 Timothy 3:16 teaches that scripture as such is God-breathed as to its intended content.

<p>According to the higher critical reconstruction of Hebrew history, ritual sacrifice developed later than the time of Moses.

<p>A. Amos 5:21-26</p>
<p>Contrary to higher critical opinion, Amos’ opposition to feasts, solemn assemblies, burnt offerings, peace offerings, meal offerings, and songs in Israel’s contemporary worship was due to (a) their syncretistic nature, (b) their superficial manner, or (c) the polytheistic character of Israel’s worship. Amos’ objection was not to sacrifice as such, but to sacrifices invalidated by contextual considerations.</p></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Attempting to determine the date of the events in Job proceeds assumes that the book is more than a piece of literary art. The poetic form of most of the book has led some to regard it as less than historical, but form does not speak to historicity. Writers use poetry to tell the events at the Red Sea (Exodus 15) and the story of Sisera’s defeat (Judges 5). Prose fiction, on the other hand, appears constantly in modern authors. Whereas skillful writers of contemporary literature do produce remarkable works about fictitious people and happenings, it is doubtful whether that happened among the ancients. Their literature appears to have been at least a development of some kernel of historical truth, including the sophisticated poetry extant from the later Greek tragedians. Furthermore, Job is both poetry and prose, so the idea that poetry points to fiction and prose to non-fiction does not apply consistently.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>THE DETERMINING PRINCIPLES FOR CANONICITY</p>
<p>In keeping with the structure of apologetics, the following sketch deals with the principles for determining whether a writing belongs in the Judaeo-Christian canon.</p>
<p>The historical principle comes logically first because canonicity has first to do with (5) where the book came from, which means who wrote it and where he got his information. Behind this step lies the concern about (4) how people recognized divine spokesmen and distinguished them from false claimants. The question rests on the observation that God’s breaking into the world through special revelation always, by definition and the nature of the case, involves (3) miracle. Even the prophets themselves must be able to distinguish divine revelation from their own thoughts. The next step is (2) the distinction between divine miracle that confirms revelation and other phenomena like demonic miracle, deception, parapsychological phenomena, misidentified natural occurrences. This distinction is most decisively made by (1) the triumph of the divine in confrontation with alternatives: the “resurrection” of Israel from Egypt (and attendant events) for the Old Testament and the resurrection of Messiah from the grave in the New Testament serve as prime examples. These are historical considerations because biblical revelation is a historical (vs. metaphysical) construct. The historical principle determines canonicity by giving us the right books in the first place; it is positive.</p></p>

<p>(a) the purpose would best applies to Luke-Acts taken together.</p>
<p>(b) the purpose ought specifically to relate in some way to Theophilus (1:1).</p>
<p>(c) the purpose can be a combination of purposes.</p>
<p>Among the suggestions offered for the purpose of Luke-Acts are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Luke-Acts was prepared as a trial brief for Paul’s first appearance before the judgment seat of Caesar. It explained the forerunner and founding personality of Christianity and showed its general relationship to Judaism, and then proceeded to outline the pattern of its spread from Judaea throughout the rest of the Roman Empire. The fact that Acts portrays the relationship between Christians and Roman rulers in a good light could corroborate this suggestion. Theophilus could have been Paul’s trial lawyer. “Most excellent” (Luke 1:3) could be a title of address for such a dignitary (Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25).</p></p>

<p>Scholars speculate about synoptic origins in an effort to create a scenario for the features of the first three gospels as a set. We do not have to settle on what actually explains the phenomena; we need only develop credible possibilities for explaining those features.</p>
<p>I. Introducing the Synoptic Problem</p>
<p>The “synoptic problem” addresses the relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The degree of their similarity calls for explanation beyond what happened. Their unusual similarity is then complicated by the differences between them. Evangelical perspective calls for minimizing appeal to contradiction to solve the question. The synoptic phenomenon is part of the “gospel problem” as a whole. In addition to the characteristics of all four gospels, the synoptic problem focuses on features shared by the first three. The following considerations highlight how alike they are.</p></p>

<p>Introductory Comment</p>
<p>Belief in the resurrection does not wholly depend on the evidence for one unique event. That event ties into other matters that anticipated it in prophecy and issued from it in history. To a significant extent, accepting Jesus as Messiah depended on the Jews’ proper understanding of Old Testament anticipations for the Messiah. This web of evidence increases exponentially the power of the data. A different understanding of Messiah and his kingdom, however, predisposed most patriotic Jews to reject him on doctrinal grounds. Nevertheless, as Gamaliel’s presentation shows in Acts 5, the argument from the very existence of the church tended to short-circuit that doctrinal objection sufficiently to force a re-evaluation of prophetic interpretation and current policy toward Jesus’ disciples.</p></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Theories about an evolutionary origin for the Christian religion present a fundamental line of inquiry. The body of literature called the “New Testament” supposedly shows stages that process passed through. If the New Testament does not actually represent the original Christian preaching, what really did comprise their message, and how can we recover that primitive gospel?</p>
<p>Acts of Apostles, written after the life of Jesus of Nazareth, presupposes incidents in his ministry. It purports to be a history of men divinely appointed to establish a religion based on these incidents. The record of their “acts” includes accounts of what they said as well. Such a record should prove valuable in discovering the content of the earliest “preaching,” the kerygma.</p></p>

            <p class="essay-description"><p>TYPICAL ISSUES IN CRITICAL INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Critical introduction addresses several issues related to the study of documents. In this setting, “introduction” does not mean getting acquainted with a book’s contents for the first time. “Critical” introduction does not “criticize” the book as if to degrade it. Critical introduction evaluates the nature of a book and matters surrounding its origin.</p>
<p>Two classifications of information critics draw on in this endeavor are internal evidence and external evidence. Internal evidence refers to data in the writing; external evidence refers to information from elsewhere. In critical introduction to the New Testament, (a) extant early Christian literature provides most of the external evidence. (b) Other resources related to the origins of Christianity help evaluate the records of early Christianity. They have been assembled in writings like F. F. Bruce’s Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1974) or Gary R. Habermas’ Ancient Evidence for the Life of Jesus: Historical Records of His Death and Resurrection (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1984). A final, more distant source of introductory information comes from extra-biblical records that preserve (c) the historical background in the contemporary biblical world.</p></p>

<p>Wisdom literature has some affinities with law. They both deal with human behavior and so use the imperative mood extensively. Wisdom, however, is a larger category than law even as advice is larger than commandment. The accompanying diagram shows their relationship. Advice vs. commandment, opinion vs. faith and fact, procedure vs. fundamental morality represent distinctions between the two types of material. Advice and commandment differ as to intent and scope.
