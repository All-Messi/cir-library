<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Cyrus Lets the Exiles Return</p>
<p>1:1In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfill his message through Jeremiah, Yahveh stirred up Cyrus. He sent a written proclamation everywhere in his kingdom:</p>
<p>2“Cyrus, king of Persia, says, ‘Yahveh God of heaven has given me the kingdoms of the world and appointed me to build him a temple in Jerusalem, in Judah. 3Whoever is from his people, your God be with you! Go up and rebuild the Temple of Yahveh God of Israel, the God in Jerusalem. 4Wherever there’s a survivor, support him with silver and gold, supplies and livestock, plus freewill offerings.’”           	Ezra 1:1-4</p>
<p>5God stirred up the leaders of the tribes from Judah and Benjamin along with the priests and Levites to go to Jerusalem to rebuild his Temple. 6Their neighbors encouraged them with silver and gold items, with goods, livestock, and valuables, plus freewill offerings. 7Cyrus brought out the items from Yahveh’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had carried to the temple of his gods. 8He had Mithredath the treasurer bring them out and count them out to Sheshbazzar, ruler of Judah: 930 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins, 29 censers, 1030 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls, 1,000 other articles—115,400 gold and silver items in all. Sheshbazzar took them up with the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.        	Ezra 1:5-11</p>

<p>59The following went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but couldn’t provide evidence that their families and their descendants were from Israel. This group included 60descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda,                                              652.</p>
<p>61descendants of the priests: descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (This Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and took Barzillai’s name.)</p>
<p>62They searched among their genealogical records, but they couldn’t locate them. They were considered unqualified and for the priesthood. 63The governor said they shouldn’t eat the most holy things till a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.</p>
<p>64The whole assembly numbered 		42,360</p>
<p>65plus their male and female servants 		7,337</p>
<p>and men and women singers. 	200</p>
<p>66They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 67435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.</p>
<p>68When some heads of families arrived at Yahveh’s Temple in Jerusalem, they offered willingly for restoring God’s Temple on its foundation. 69According to their ability they gave to the treasury 1100 lbs 61,000 drachmas of gold, 6250 lbs 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly vestments.</p>
<p>70The priests and Levites, some of the people, singers, gatekeepers, Temple servants, and all Israel lived in their town	    Ezra 2:1-70</p>
<p>The Altar Is Rebuilt</p>
<p>3:1When the seventh month came and the Israelites were in the towns, they came together in Jerusalem. 2Jeshua Ben-Jozadak, his brothers the priests, Zerubbabel Ben-Shealtiel, and his brothers built God’s altar for offering burnt offerings as written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 3They set up the altar on its original site despite their fear of the people around them. They offered burnt offerings to Yahveh morning and evening. 4They celebrated the Festival of Booths as written and offered the set number of burnt offerings daily as required by the Law. 5From then on, there was continual burnt offering for new moons and the annual festivals Yahveh had consecrated. Everyone offered a freewill offering to Yahveh. 6From the first day, seventh month, they offered burnt offerings, but the foundation of the Temple hadn’t been laid. 7Then they donated money to the masons and carpenters as well as food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians to bring cedar from Lebanon by sea to Joppa with permission from Cyrus.	    Ezra 3:1-7</p>
<p>8The second month, second year after arriving at God’s Temple, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, the rest of the priests and Levites, and everybody from the captivity began the work. They appointed the Levites 20 years and older as supervisors. 9To oversee the workmen, Jeshua with his sons and relatives stood united with Kadmiel and his sons (all descendants of Judah/Hodaviah) and with the Levites from the family of Henadad. 10When the builders had laid the foundation, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets. The Levites, descendants of Asaph, stood with cymbals to praise Yahveh according to King David’s directions. 11They sang, praising and thanking Yahveh, “He’s good; his love for Israel endures forever.” The people shouted when they praised him because the foundation had been laid. 12Yet many priests, Levites, and heads of families—old men who’d seen the first Temple—cried out loud. Many others shouted out loud with so much joy 13that people couldn’t tell the shout of joy from the outcry of weeping. They could be heard for a long way.	   Ezra 3:8-13</p>
<p>Enemies Oppose the Rebuilding</p>
<p>4:1When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a temple to Yahveh God of Israel, 2they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders, “Let us build with you. We worship your God too. We’ve been sacrificing to him since Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, sent us here.” 3But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders said, “You don’t have anything in common with us building a temple to our God. We’ll build it like King Cyrus decreed.”</p>
<p>4Other residents in the land tried to discourage the people and scare them away from building. 5They bribed advisors to work against them all during Cyrus’ reign till the reign of Darius, king of Persia. 				         	         	        		         Ezra 4:1-5</p>
<p>6Years later, at the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus/Xerxes, they lodged a complaint against Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>7Still later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote to Artaxerxes. The letter was in Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language for the king. 8Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote out the letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes—9they and their associates on behalf of the judges and local leaders, officials, and secretaries over the people of Erech, Babylonia, and Susa (Elam), 10and the rest of the nations that the great and honorable Osnappar/Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River [Avar-naharah, Aramaic]. 11Here’s a copy of the letter:</p>
<p>Ezra 4:6-11a</p>
<p>“To King Artaxerxes</p>
<p>From your subjects in Beyond the River</p>
<p>12The Jews that came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They’re rebuilding the rebellious, evil city, finishing its walls and repairing its foundation. 13If it’s rebuilt and its walls are finished, they won’t pay tribute, custom, or toll, and it’ll damage the king’s revenue. 14Because we serve the palace, it’s not fitting for us to see your dishonor. We’ve sent to inform you 15so a search can be made in your ancestors’ records. You’ll discover that the city has been rebellious and damaging to kings and provinces, that they’ve incited revolt in the past, and that’s why it was destroyed. 16If it’s rebuilt and its walls finished, you won’t have any possession in Beyond the River.”              	   Ezra 4:11b-16</p>
<p>17The king answered Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates in Samaria and the rest of Beyond the River:</p>
<p>“Greetings,</p>
<p>18The document you sent us has been translated and read to me. 19I’ve issued a decree. A search has been made, and it’s been discovered that the city has rebelled against kings in the past, that revolution and sedition have occurred in it; 20that strong kings have ruled Jerusalem, governing the whole province Beyond the River; and that they received tribute, custom, and toll. 21So issue a decree to stop those men from rebuilding the city till I issue a decree. 22Take care of this matter promptly. We must not let this situation harm the royal interests.”</p>
<p>23As soon as Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates read a copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter, they hurried to Jerusalem and stopped the Jews by force. 24The work on the Temple halted till the second year of Darius, king of Persia.	Ezra 4:17-24</p>
<p>Tattenai’s Letter to Darius</p>
<p>5:1The prophets Haggai and Zechariah Ben-Iddo served as prophets to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. 2Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua started again to rebuild God’s Temple. His prophets supported them. 3At that time, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues came and asked, “Who issued a decree for you to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?” 4We told them the names of the men that were reconstructing it. 5But God kept an eye on the elders of the Jews. They didn’t stop them till a report could go to Darius and a written reply could come back.</p>
<p>Ezra 5:1-6</p>
<p>6Here’s a copy of Tattenai’s letter to King Darius:</p>
<p>7“To King Darius, all peace.</p>
<p>8We have gone to the province Judah, to the Temple of the great God, which is being built with huge stones and with beams that are being laid in the walls. This work is progressing with great care and is getting done. 9We asked those elders who issued them a decree to rebuild that Temple. 10We asked for their names so we could write down who was in charge and inform you.</p>
<p>11“They answered, ‘We serve the God of earth and sky. We’re rebuilding the Temple that was built many years ago by a great king in Israel. 12But because our ancestors provoked the God of earth and sky, he delivered them to Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian. He destroyed that Temple and deported the people to Babylon. 13But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this Temple. 14He also took out the gold and silver utensils from God’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had taken to the temple in Babylon. He gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, who’d been appointed governor. 15He told him to take those items and deposit them in the Temple in Jerusalem and let God’s Temple be rebuilt on its site. 16Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations. From then till now, it’s been under construction and isn’t finished.’</p>
<p>17“If it pleases you, conduct a search in the royal treasure house there in Babylon to see if King Cyrus did issue a decree to rebuild that Temple, and send us your decision on the matter.”		Ezra 5:7-17</p>
<p>Darius’ Decree</p>
<p>6:1King Darius issued an order to search the Babylonian archives, which were housed in the treasury. 2But in the fortress in Ecbatana, in the province of Media, they found a scroll with the following written in it:</p>
<p>“Record:</p>
<p>3In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree:</p>
<p>‘As to God’s Temple in Jerusalem, rebuild it, where sacrifices are offered. Keep its foundations the same. Its height and width are 90ft 4with three courses of large stones alternating with one course of timbers. Pay for it out of the royal treasury. 5Take back to God’s temple the gold and silver articles Nebuchadnezzar took from it.’	   	Ezra 6:1-5</p>
<p>6“Now then, Tattenai, governor of Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, officials in the provinces Beyond the River, don’t interfere. 7Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild God’s Temple on its site. 8And, I decree what you’re to do for those elders in rebuilding this Temple: without delay pay them the full cost out of the royal treasury from taxes in the provinces Beyond the River. 9As the priests in Jerusalem request, give daily whatever they need: young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings, wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil. 10Then they can offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 11For anybody who violates this edict, I decree that a timber be pulled out of his house, he be impaled on it, and his house be made a garbage pile. 12May the God that has put his name there overthrow any king or people that tries to violate this decree and destroy that Temple of God. I, Darius, have made this decree. Carry it out diligently.”	Ezra 6:6-12</p>
<p>Completion and Dedication of the Temple</p>
<p>13Tattenai, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates carried out the decree diligently. 14The elders of the Jews succeeded in the construction by the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah. By God’s command and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, 15they completed it the third day, the month Adar, sixth year of King Darius.</p>
<p>16Israel, the priests, Levites, and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of God’s Temple. 17They offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for Israel 12 male goats corresponding to the 12 tribes in Israel. 18Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God as written in the Book of Moses.</p>
<p>Passover Celebrated</p>
<p>19The exiles observed Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. 20The priests and Levites had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 21The Israelites from the exile and the ones that had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations in the land, joined them in reaching out to Yahveh God of Israel by eating the Passover. 22They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week with joy because Yahveh had given them reason to celebrate. He had inclined the heart of the Assyrian king to encourage them in the work on his Temple.	     Ezra 6:13-22</p>
<p>Ezra Arrives in Jerusalem</p>
<p>7:1After that, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, came Ezra Ben-Seraiah (Ben-Azariah Ben-Hilkiah 2Ben-Shallum Ben-Zadok Ben-Ahitub 3Ben-Amariah Ben-Azariah Ben-Meraioth 4Ben-Zerahiah Ben-Uzzi Ben-Bukki 5Ben-Abishua Ben-Phinehas Ben-Eleazar) Ben-Aaron the chief priest. 6Ezra, a scribe, an expert in the Law of Moses, came up from Babylon. The king granted him everything he requested because Yahveh’s hand was on him. 7Some Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. [8] 9On the first day, first month, Ezra started out from Babylon. On the first day, fifth month he arrived at Jerusalem because God’s good hand was on him. 10He had set his heart on studying the Law of Yahveh, practicing it, and teaching its statutes and ordinances in Israel.</p>
<p>Ezra 7:1-10</p>
<p>11 The Decree King Artaxerxes Gave Ezra the Priest and Scribe,</p>
<p>One Learned in Yahveh’s Commandments</p>
<p>12“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra, priest and scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, greeting.</p>
<p>13“I’ve decreed that any of the Israelites, their priests, and Levites in my kingdom that want to go to Jerusalem, can go with you. 14The king and his seven advisors have sent you to ask about Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God that you have with you. 15They’ve sent you as well to take the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel, who lives in Jerusalem. 16That’s accompanied by all the silver and gold you’ll find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering by the people and priests that donated for their God’s Temple in Jerusalem. 17With this money diligently buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and liquid offerings, and offer them on the altar in the Temple of your God. 18Whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you can do according to the will of your God. 19To the God in Jerusalem deliver in full the utensils you’ve received for the service of your God’s Temple. 20The rest of the needs for his Temple that you have occasion to provide for, do so from the royal treasury.   Ezra 7:11-20</p>
<p>21“I, King Artaxerxes, decree to the treasurers in Beyond the River, that you provide diligently whatever Ezra requires from you, 22up to 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 1100 bushels 100 kors of wheat, 900 gallons 100 baths of wine, 900 gallons 100 baths of olive oil, and salt as needed. 23Whatever the God of heaven commands, do with zeal for his Temple so there won’t be any anger against the realm of the king and his sons. 24We also inform you not to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, or workmen in that Temple of God. 25And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that’s available to you, appoint magistrates and judges in Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. You can teach anybody that doesn’t know them. 26On whoever doesn’t observe the Law of your God and the law of the king, carry out judgment strictly, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of possessions, or imprisonment.”</p>
<p>Ezra Praises the LORD</p>
<p>27Bless Yahveh God of our ancestors, who has put such a thing in the king’s heart, to adorn Yahveh’s Temple in Jerusalem. 28He has extended enduring love to me in the presence of the king, his advisors, and powerful officials. In that way Yahveh gave me courage, and I assembled leading men from Israel to go up with me.		Ezra 7:21-28</p>

<p>Ezra’s Journey to Jerusalem</p>
<p>15I assembled them at the canal that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. When I looked over the people and the priests, I didn’t find any Levites. 16So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam (leaders), and for Joiarib and Elnathan (teachers). 17I sent them to Iddo, leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to tell him and his brothers (the Temple servants at that place) to bring ministers to us for God’s Temple. 18By God’s good hand on us, they brought</p>
<p>Sherebiah (an insightful Ben-Mahli, descendant of Levi) as well as his sons and brothers, 18 men;</p>
<p>19Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men;</p>
<p>20220 Temple servants that David and the officials had given to assist the Levites—all identified by name.</p>
<p>21Then I declared a fast at the Ahava Canal, to humble ourselves toward God and look to him for a safe journey for us, our little ones, and our possessions. 22I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and cavalry to protect us, because we’d told him, “God favors those who look to him. His power and anger oppose those who leave him.” 23We fasted and looked to God on the matter, and he listened to our plea. 		   Ezra 8:15-23</p>
<p>24Then I set apart 12 leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 others. 25I weighed out to them the silver and gold, the utensils, and the offering for God’s Temple that the king, his advisors, officials, and all Israel present there had offered: 2624½ tons 650 talents of silver, utensils worth 7,550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 7,550 lbs 100 talents of gold, 2720 bowls worth 19 lbs 1,000 darics of gold; and 2 utensils of fine, shiny bronze, precious as gold. 28Then I said,</p>
<p>“You’re holy to Yahveh; the utensils are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahveh God of your ancestors. 29Keep them till you weigh them in the presence of the leading priests, Levites, and heads of families at Jerusalem, in the rooms in Yahveh’s Temple.”</p>
<p>30The priests and Levites received the silver, gold, and utensils, to take to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>31Then we left the Ahava River on the twelfth day, first month to go to Jerusalem. God watched over us and delivered us from enemies and ambushes along the way. 32We arrived at Jerusalem and rested three days. 33On the fourth day, we weighed out in God’s Temple the silver, gold, and utensils to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, Eleazar son of Phinehas, and the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34We numbered and weighed everything, and recorded the total.</p>
<p>35The exiles offered burnt offerings to God: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering. 36Then they delivered the king’s edicts to his satraps and the governors of Beyond the River [Ever-hannahar, Hebrew], and they supported the people and God’s Temple.         		  Ezra 8:24-36</p>
<p>Ezra’s Prayer About Intermarriage</p>
<p>9:1When these things had been completed, the officials approached me,</p>
<p>“The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites haven’t separated from the foreigners and the disgusting things of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 2They’ve taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons. The holy race has intermingled with foreigners. The officials and rulers have been the most prominent in this unfaithfulness.”</p>
<p>3When I heard that, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled some hair from my head and beard, and sat down appalled. 4Everybody gathered around me that trembled at God’s message about the exiles’ unfaithfulness. I sat appalled till the evening offering. 	  Ezra 9:1-4</p>
<p>5Then I got up from my humbled condition with my cloak and shirt torn. I fell on my knees and held out my hands to Yahveh:</p>
<p>6“I’m ashamed to look at you. Our sins have piled up higher than our heads. Our guilt has grown as high as the sky. 7Since the time of our ancestors, we’ve had serious guilt. Because of our sins, you’ve delivered us, our kings, and our priests to the kings of nations, to the sword, to captivity, plunder, and open disgrace like today. 8But now for a little while, you’ve shown grace and left us a remnant and given us a stake in your holy place to enlighten us and grant us a little reviving in our bondage. 9We’re slaves; yet in our bondage, you haven’t left us. You’ve extended enduring love to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, to revive us for building your Temple, restoring its ruins, and giving us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem. 10What can we say now, God? We’ve abandoned what you’ve commanded 11through your prophets, ‘The land you’re going in to possess is ceremonially unclean because of its unclean people and disgusting things that fill it end to end. 12Don’t intermarry with them. Never search for their peace or prosperity so you can be strong, eat the good things of the land, and leave it as a permanent inheritance to your descendants.’ 13After everything that’s happened to us because of our sinful deeds and great guilt—you’ve paid us back less than our sins deserve and have given us a remnant like this—14will we again break your commandments and intermarry with people that commit those disgusting things? Wouldn’t you be angry with us to the point of destroying us till there was no remnant to escape? 15Yahveh God of Israel, you’re good, because you left us a remnant. We’re guilty in your presence because nobody can withstand you on that account.”                   		   Ezra 9:5-15</p>
<p>The People Confess Their Sins</p>
<p>10:1While Ezra was praying and confessing, crying and prostrating himself in front of God’s Temple, a big crowd of men, women, and children gathered around him, sobbing with him. 2Shecaniah Ben-Jehiel, one of Elam’s sons, told him,</p>
<p>“We’ve been unfaithful to our God and married foreign women from the land. But there’s still hope for Israel. 3Let’s make a covenant with God to put away the wives and their children as you’ve advised and do it according to the Law. 4Get up! This is your responsibility. We’ll be with you. Have the courage to do it.”</p>
<p>5Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel swear that they’d adopt that proposal. They took the oath. 6Then he went from in front of God’s Temple to the room of Jehohanan Ben-Eliashib. He didn’t eat or drink; he was mourning over the exiles’ unfaithfulness. 7They issued a proclamation for the exiles throughout Judah and Jerusalem to assemble at Jerusalem. 8Whoever wouldn’t come within three days like the leaders and elders said, would forfeit his possessions and be excluded from the community of exiles. 	   Ezra 10:1-8</p>
<p>9The men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in the three days. It was the twentieth day, ninth month, and the people sat down in the open square in front of God’s Temple. They were shivering because of this matter and the heavy rain. 10Ezra stood up and said,</p>
<p>“You’ve been unfaithful in marrying foreign wives and adding to Israel’s guilt. 11Confess to Yahveh God of your ancestors, do his will, and separate from the native people and your foreign wives.”</p>
<p>12The whole assembly answered out loud,</p>
<p>“That’s true! We have to do that. 13But there are lots of people here, it’s raining, and we can’t stand outside. We can’t take care of this problem in a day or two; a lot of us have sinned in this. 14Have leaders represent the assembly and have the ones in our towns that have foreign wives meet at scheduled times with the elders and judges in each city till God’s fierce anger turns away.”</p>
<p>15Only Jonathan Ben-Asahel and Jahzeiah Ben-Tikvah opposed it. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported it.		   Ezra 10:9-15</p>
<p>Men Guilty of Intermarriage</p>
<p>16The exiles agreed. Ezra selected leaders of each family by name. They met on first day, tenth month, to look into the matter. 17By the first day, first month, they’d finished dealing with the men that had married foreign wives.</p>
<p>18Among the priests with foreign wives were the following:</p>
<p>from the family of Jeshua Ben-Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jerib, and</p>
<p>Gedaliah. 19They pledged to divorce their wives and offer a ram for their guilt.</p>
<p>20from the family of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;</p>
<p>21from the family of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;</p>

<p>23among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.</p>
<p>24among the singers: Eliashib;</p>
<p>among the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri;		  Ezra 10:16-24</p>

<p>29from the family of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth;</p>
<p>30from the family of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel,</p>
<p>Binnui, and Manasseh;</p>
<p>31from the family of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 32Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;</p>
<p>33from the family of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;</p>
<p>34from the family of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 35Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, 36Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 37Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasa, 38Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 39Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 40Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 41Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 42Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;</p>
<p>43from the family of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.</p>
<p>44Those had married foreign wives, and some had children by them. 	   Ezra 10:25-44</p>
