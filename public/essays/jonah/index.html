            <p>JONAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Jonah’s Flight from Yahveh</p>
<p>1:1Yahveh told Jonah Ben-Amittai, 2“Go to Nineveh, that big city, and shout against it; I’ve seen how sinful they are.” 3But Jonah ran away. 3He went down to Joppa, found a ship to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded.</p>
<p>4Yahveh hurled a gale on the sea, and it was about to break up the ship. 5The sailors were scared, and every man cried out to his god. They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Jonah had gone below and fallen sound asleep. 6The captain came and said, “How come you’re sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Maybe he’ll be concerned about us enough to keep us from dying.” 7They said to one another, “Let’s cast lots to find out who caused this catastrophe to hit us.” They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. 8“Tell us, now! Why has this catastrophe fallen on us? What’s your job? What’s your country? Who are your people?” 	Jon 1:1-8</p>
<p>9“I’m a Hebrew; I fear Yahveh God of heaven that made the land and sea.”</p>
<p>10They were really afraid, “How could you do that?” (They knew he was running from Yahveh; he’d told them.) 11“What should we do to you to stop the sea from raging?” It kept getting worse.</p>
<p>12“Throw me into the sea. I know it’s my fault this severe storm has come on you.”</p>
<p>13But they rowed hard, trying to get back to shore, but they couldn’t. The sea was getting even rougher. 14So they called on Yahveh, “We earnestly pray, Yahveh, not to let us die over this man’s sin. Don’t hold us guilty for throwing him to his death. You’re doing what you wanted.” 15They picked Jonah up and threw him overboard, and the sea stopped raging. 16They feared Yahveh greatly and offered sacrifice to him and made vows. 	Jon 1:9-16</p>
<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>
<p>17Yahveh had a big fish swallow Jonah, and he was in its stomach three days and nights.</p>
<p>2:1Jonah prayed to Yahveh his God from the fish’s stomach,</p>
<p>2“I called to you in my distress,</p>
<p>and you answered me;</p>
<p>I cried out for help from the belly of Sheol,</p>
<p>and you heard me.</p>
<p>3You threw me into the deep,</p>
<p>into the heart of the sea;</p>
<p>the current swirled over me;</p>
<p>your waves and breakers overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>4So I said, ‘I’ve been driven away from you,</p>
<p>but I’ll still look toward your holy Temple.’  	Jon 2:1-4</p>
<p>5Water closed in over me;</p>
<p>the great deep surrounded me;</p>
<p>seaweed wrapped around my head.</p>
<p>6I sank down to the base of the mountains;</p>
<p>the earth imprisoned me forever,</p>
<p>but you brought me up from the Pit,</p>
<p>Yahveh my God.</p>
<p>7As my life was fading away,</p>
<p>I remembered you;</p>
<p>and prayed to you in your holy Temple.</p>
<p>8Those who pay respects to pointless idols</p>
<p>forfeit your faithfulness,</p>
<p>9but I’ll sacrifice to you with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I’ll do what I’ve vowed;</p>
<p>salvation comes from youY.”</p>
<p>10Then Yahveh had the fish cough Jonah up onto the shore.	Jon 2:5-10</p>
<p>Jonah’s Trip to Nineveh</p>
<p>3:1Yahveh told Jonah again, 2“Go to Nineveh, the big city, and deliver what I tell you.” 3So he went. It was a big city, a three-days’ walk-through. 4He went through it one day’s walk and shouted, “God is going to overthrow Nineveh in 40 days.” 5The people believed him. They called for a fast and put on burlap from least to greatest.</p>
<p>6When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he got off his throne, laid his robe aside, covered himself with burlap, and sat on ashes. 7He issued a proclamation:</p>
<p>“In Nineveh by decree of the king and his nobles: Don’t anybody—animal, herd, or flock—eat anything or drink water. 8People and animals have to wear burlap. Call on God earnestly so everyone will turn from sinfulness and violence. 9Who knows, maybe God will relent from his fierce anger and not destroy us.</p>
<p>10When God saw they’d repented, he relented from doing what he’d threatened.	Jon 3:1-10</p>
<p>Jonah’s Anger over Yahveh’s Mercy</p>
<p>4:1That really made Jonah mad. 2He told Yahveh,</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what I said back home and why I tried to run away to Tarshish. I knew you’re a gracious, merciful God, slow to get angry and full of enduring love, and relent from bringing catastrophe. 3So take my life; I’d be better off dead.”</p>
<p>4Yahveh asked, “What right do you have to be mad?”	 Jon 4:1-4</p>
<p>5Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made a lean-to and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. 6Yahveh God had a plant grow up to shade him and give him relief. He was glad to see it. 7But at dawn the next day, God had a worm attack the plant, and it withered. 8When the sun came up, God had a scorching east wind blow and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head till he became faint and begged to die, “I’d be better off dead.”     	Jon 4:5-8</p>
<p>9Then God asked, “What right do you have to be mad about a plant?!”</p>
<p>“I’ve got reason to be mad enough to die.”</p>
<p>10“You’re concerned about a plant you didn’t plant or make grow, that came up overnight and died overnight. 11Shouldn’t I be concerned about Nineveh, a big city with more than 120,000 people that don’t know left from right—as well as lots of animals?”                  	Jon 4:9-11</p>
