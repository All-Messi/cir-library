<p>When Gnostic thought tried to mix Christianity into its scheme of things, it made Jesus the ruler (ἄρχων; 1:16, 18) of one of the realms, or aeons, within the full pleroma. Another aberration was that morality ceased to be a “theological” concern since state of being rather than manner of behavior became the issue.</p>
<p>What Paul does in imaging the gospel in the functional equivalents of Gnosticism includes the use of mystery (μυστήριον). According to Paul, the real mystery was that Gentiles as Gentiles have access to fellowship with God through Jesus Christ (1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3). This use of mystery appears also in the companion letter to the Ephesians (3:4-6). The mystery religions, which played on the Gnostic theme (γνῶσις; 1:9-10, 27), catered to intellectual/informational exclusivism; but Christ is for all people (Ephesians 3:14-16; cp. Isaiah 55; 60:1-3; the Book of Jonah; and Acts 15:16-18 &lt; Amos 9:11-12).</p>
