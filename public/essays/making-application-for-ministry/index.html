            <p>MAKING APPLICATION FOR MINISTRY</p>
<p>I. Cover Letter</p>
<p>Applying for a ministry can have two written aspects beyond any (a) verbal contacts with the prospective church by phone or otherwise. The first is a (b) cover letter and the second is a (c) resumé. In the cover letter you can indicate how you became aware of the opening and why you are interested in the job. Depending on the circumstance, you may reinforce your interest in that ministry by relating you background briefly as well as the reason for your sense of calling to ministry. You may include some statement about your family’s commitment with you to this work. Giving a general statement of faith helps those who review applications know where you are doctrinally. They will want to know about your view of the nature and work of Christ, the nature of scripture, the process of salvation, and so forth. Christian churches will be interested in your commitment to the restoration plea. Giving your concept of ministry may also be useful. In the statement of background applicants may give an account of their conversion, especially if they became Christians after their high school years.</p>
<p>The way you write your letter of introduction will show the selection committee how well you can express yourself in writing; so take care in making it reflect an acceptable level of competency in written composition and awareness of form in typed correspondence. Be sure to date the cover letter, include inside address and return address in it, and sign it. Make a copy for your own records.</p>
<p>Since the resumé contains objective information without comment, you may use the cover letter to personalize yourself to the readers in regard to any of the specifics listed on that other form. Here is the place where you can spell out reasons you consider your skills and their level appropriate to the ministry you are applying for. Of course, do not oversell yourself. It will probably be detected before the church hires you; and if not, you will not be able to live up to expectations if you actually go to that field. Their disillusionment will work against you in that job and in the ones that follow if “things do not work out.” You should give enough information to create interest in your application compared to other applications, but you do not have to say everything that would be good for them to know. After the preliminary selection has identified the more promising prospects, there will be phone conversations and letters as well as actual interviews with the selection committee, church leaders, and members of the congregation. You can leave something for later.</p>
<p>As a general safeguard against unintentional omissions, offer to furnish orally or in writing any additional information, including a transcript of your college work (legally they will not be able to get a transcript except through you).</p>
<p>II. Resumé</p>
<p>In addition to the cover letter, a resumé has become traditional. Whereas the above item has the form of a letter with full sentences and paragraph layout, a resumé has the form of an outline, or listing, organized under main headings with sub-entries. Usually it differs from a strict outline in not using Roman numerals, capital and lower-case numbers and letters before the headings and sub-entries.</p>
<p>Resumés typically include your age, sex (if not clear from the name or other factors), birth date, marital status, the name of your spouse, the names and age of your children, address, phone numbers where you may be reached at work or at home, parents, educational background, previous experience particularly in roles related to the one you are applying for as well as a listing of other kinds of work you have done, any awards or honors you have received, special interests and hobbies that may even be unrelated to ministry, organizational memberships, any publications to your credit. Customarily resumé begin with a short statement of objective. Obviously the younger you are the fewer entries your resumé will have.</p>
<p>You can include a category for special interests, hobbies, or skills that you have, particularly if they would enhance this prospective ministry. Dated entries are customarily arranged in reverse chronological order, the most recent listed first.</p>
<p>Three to five references normally appear at the end of a resumé. They could come at the end of the cover letter if you prefer to make the resumé look more like a vita sheet. A note about how each reference relations to you helps interviewers anticipate what they can learn from each reference. Although people you select as references seldom refuse to serve in this role, out of courtesy ask their permission so they will be able to give some thought to what they will say if and when someone contacts them. Besides, employers often request written recommendations that they can share with other members of the search committee; so your references may end up spending an hour or so in order to help you out in this way.</p>
<p>Select references who relate to you in various ways so the committee can get different kinds of input. Remember that just because someone agrees to be a reference he is not necessarily promising to give you a positive report. Employers will understand that the people you give as references, however, are likely to give you a positive recommendation. Consequently, they will talk to other people as well. They may even ask your references for further contact persons. Interviewers will ask your references about matters beyond the distinctives of their relationship to you and your abilities in the tasks you performed for them. As a matter of fact, church employers are particularly interested in such intangibles as your personality and social skills. It is best then to choose references who are more than passing acquaintances even though they may be respected people whose opinions would be valued for that reason.</p>
<p>As a final entry in your application, include a recent photograph of yourself and if possible a picture of your spouse (and family).</p>
