<p>Observations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<pre><code> The terms are used generally and technically.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code> The term “servant” is used of all New Testament offices with the possible exception of prophet. One implication of that fact is that none of the offices are figurehead positions that delegate all the work to other people.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Deacon is used of a particular formal function in only two contexts: Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:18-13 (Acts 6:1-6 is conceivably another example although the term involved does not appear.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>There is nothing to indicate that deacons had supervisory authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>The question about deaconesses can be raised in connection with three contexts:  Romans 16:1; 1 Timothy 3:11; 5:3-16</p>
<p>The New Testament does not specify what a deacon’s work is.</p>
