<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Knowing what heaven was like, why did Jesus ever leave it?</p>

<p>A. Means of communication: “son” vs. angels/prophets</p>
<p>B. Manner of communication: demonstration and description</p>
<p>holistic      vs.   in many parts/progressive</p>
<p>“son-wise”         in many ways</p>
<p>personal            verbal</p>
<p>C. Message communicated: son vs. concepts</p>
<p>II. Representation: Hebrews 2:5-9</p>

<p>B. Cleansing from defilement of conscience via the giving of the body of Messiah once and for all</p>
<p>LESSONS FROM THE INCARNATION</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>One way to teach is to give people an experience and ask them what they learned. 	In the incarnation God gave us an experience (event). What do we learn from it?</p>
<p>I. 	Our Worth</p>
<p>“I came that they might have life and have it abundantly” (John 10:10).</p>
<p>A. Incarnation is based on the image of God in man (nature): being (Genesis 1:26).</p>
<p>B. Incarnation expresses love (fellowship): relationship (John 3:16).</p>
<p>C. Incarnation calls us back to our commissions (purpose): action (Hebrews 2:6-10).</p>
<p>II. Our Attitude</p>
<p>“Make my joy full that you may be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind, doing nothing through division or self-glorification, but in lowliness of mind each counting the other better than himself. . . . Have this mind in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who, existing in the form of deity, did not count being on an equality with God something to be clung to, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross” (Philippians 2:2-8).</p>
<p>A. Humility</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Willingness to accept limitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Willingness to accept people</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>B. Unity among mankind: pride is the source of division between people.</p>
<p>III. Our Ministry</p>
<p>A. Identification</p>
<p>B. Timing for readiness: the timing of the incarnation (Galatians 4:4 “fullness of time”; John 16:12, “you cannot bear them now”)</p>
<p>C. Salvation rather than criticism and condemnation (John 3:17; 12:47; Luke 19:10)</p>
