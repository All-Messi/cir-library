            <p>THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Jerusalem Deserted</p>
<p>1:1How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people!</p>
<p>She’s like a widow that was once great among the nations!</p>
<p>The princess among the provinces has become a slave!</p>
<p>2She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her.</p>
<p>Her friends have betrayed her</p>
<p>and become her enemies.</p>
<p>3Judah has gone into exile in affliction and hard servitude;</p>
<p>she’s spread out among the nations now</p>
<p>with no resting place.</p>
<p>Her pursuers have caught up with her in the middle of her distress.</p>
<p>4The roads to Zion are in mourning,</p>
<p>because nobody attends the appointed festivals.</p>
<p>Her gates are desolate, her priests groan,</p>
<p>her virgins suffer, and she suffers bitterly herself.	Lam 1:1-4</p>
<p>5Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper.</p>
<p>Yahveh has made her suffer for her many sins.</p>
<p>Her children have gone away captive to the foe.</p>
<p>6The majesty is gone from Zion;</p>
<p>her officials are like bucks that can’t find pasture;</p>
<p>they’ve fled away weak before their pursuers.</p>
<p>7In her time of suffering and homelessness,</p>
<p>Jerusalem remembers her treasured things from before;</p>
<p>when her people fell to her adversaries and nobody helped her,</p>
<p>the enemies gloated over her and mocked her downfall.</p>
<p>8Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she’s become filthy.</p>
<p>Everybody that honored her before despises her now,</p>
<p>because they’ve seen her nakedness.</p>
<p>She groans and turns away. 	Lam 1:5-8</p>
<p>9Her uncleanness was in her skirts;</p>
<p>she didn’t give any thought for her doom;</p>
<p>so she’s fallen terribly with no comforter.</p>
<p>10The foe has reached out for her treasured things;</p>
<p>she has watched the nations invade her sanctuary,</p>
<p>people you commanded not to enter your community.</p>
<p>11The people are groaning as they look for bread;</p>
<p>they’ve given their treasured things for food to stay alive;</p>
<p>“Look, Yahveh, I’m despised.</p>
<p>12Is it nothing to you that go by?</p>
<p>Look and see if there’s any pain like my pain</p>
<p>that was severely dealt out to me,</p>
<p>that Yahveh inflicted in his fierce anger.	Lam 1:9-12</p>
<p>13He sent fire from on high into my bones, and it descended on them.</p>
<p>He spread a net for my feet and turned me back;</p>
<p>he left me desolate and faint all day long.</p>
<p>14He has tied my sins together into a yoke around my neck;</p>
<p>he has made my strength fail,</p>
<p>and turned me over to those I can’t withstand.</p>
<p>15The Lord has rejected the strong men that are with me;</p>
<p>he has called an appointed time against me to crush my young men;</p>
<p>like a winepress he has trodden down the young virgin Judah.</p>
<p>16I weep for those things; my eyes run down with tears,</p>
<p>because there’s no comforter near to restore my soul.</p>
<p>My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.” 	Lam 1:13-16</p>
<p>17Zion holds out her hands, but there’s no one to comfort her;</p>
<p>Yahveh has commanded against Jacob</p>
<p>that his neighbors would be his enemies;</p>
<p>Jerusalem has become something filthy in their minds.</p>
<p>18“Yahveh is good; I’ve rebelled against his command;</p>
<p>listen now, all you nations, and look at my pain;</p>
<p>my virgins and young men have gone into captivity.</p>
<p>19I called to my lovers, but they deceived me;</p>
<p>my priests and elders perished in the city</p>
<p>as they looked for food to stay alive.</p>
<p>20Look, Yahveh, because I’m in distress; my soul is in turmoil.</p>
<p>My heart’s upset because I’ve been rebellious.</p>
<p>The sword bereaves in the street; it’s like death in the house.	Lam 1:17-20</p>
<p>21They’ve heard that I’m groaning with nobody to comfort me.</p>
<p>My enemies have heard about my trouble;</p>
<p>they’re glad you’ve done it.</p>
<p>Bring the time you’ve promised</p>
<p>and let them be like me.</p>
<p>22Pay attention to their sinfulness,</p>
<p>and deal with them like you’ve dealt with me for my sins.</p>
<p>I groan a lot, and my heart is faint.”	Lam 1:21-22</p>
<p>Destruction for Sin</p>
<p>2:1How the Lord in his anger has covered Zion under a cloud!</p>
<p>He has thrown down Israel’s splendor from heaven to earth;</p>
<p>he hasn’t remembered his footstool in his wrath.</p>
<p>2Without mercy the Lord has swallowed up the residents in Jacob.</p>
<p>In his anger he has thrown down Judah’s fortresses</p>
<p>and leveled the kingdom and its officials to the ground in dishonor.</p>
<p>3In his fury he has cut down Israel’s power</p>
<p>and stopped restraining the enemy.</p>
<p>He has burned like a fire in Jacob</p>
<p>and consumed it everywhere.</p>
<p>4He has bent his bow like an enemy;</p>
<p>he has set his right hand like an adversary</p>
<p>and killed everybody we took pride in.</p>
<p>He has poured out his anger like fire in the tent of Zion.	Lam 2:1-4</p>
<p>5The Lord has become like an enemy;</p>
<p>he has swallowed up Israel,</p>
<p>laid its palaces in ruins,</p>
<p>destroyed its fortresses,</p>
<p>and multiplied mourning and groaning in Judah.</p>
<p>6He’s violently treated his Tabernacle like a garden shed</p>
<p>and laid in ruins his appointed meeting place.</p>
<p>Yahveh has stricken from memory</p>
<p>the appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion,</p>
<p>and deposed king and priest in his angry indignation.</p>
<p>7The Lord has rejected his altar, disowned his sanctuary,</p>
<p>and delivered to the enemy the walls of its palaces.</p>
<p>A clamor was raised in Yahveh’s Temple</p>
<p>like that of an appointed festival day.</p>
<p>8Yahveh decided to destroy the wall around Zion.</p>
<p>He stretched out a line</p>
<p>and didn’t restrain his destroying.</p>
<p>He made rampart and wall mourn;</p>
<p>they’ve broken down together.                                         	Lam 2:5-8</p>
<p>9Its gates have sunk into the ground;</p>
<p>he has ruined and broken its bars</p>
<p>and scattered its king and officials among the nations.</p>
<p>There’s no law anymore;</p>
<p>prophets don’t have visions from Yahveh.</p>
<p>10The elders of Zion sit silent on the ground;</p>
<p>they’ve thrown dust on their heads</p>
<p>and wrapped themselves in burlap.</p>
<p>The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</p>
<p>11My eyes are worn out from crying;</p>
<p>my spirit is in turmoil;</p>
<p>my heart is poured out on the ground</p>
<p>because my people have been destroyed;</p>
<p>the little ones and babies pass out in the street.</p>
<p>12They ask their mothers, “Where is the bread and wine?”</p>
<p>as they faint like wounded men in the city streets,</p>
<p>as their life dies out on their mother’s chest.	Lam 2:9-12</p>
<p>13What can I say for you?</p>
<p>What can I compare you to, young woman in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>What can I liken you to, as I comfort you, young virgin in Zion?</p>
<p>Your ruin is as wide as the sea; who can restore you?</p>
<p>14Your prophets have deceived you with false visions;</p>
<p>they haven’t exposed your iniquity to restore you from sin;</p>
<p>they’ve seen false, misleading oracles for you.</p>
<p>15Everybody that goes by claps their hands at you;</p>
<p>they gasp and shake their heads at Jerusalem,</p>
<p>“Is this the city they used to say was ‘perfectly beautiful,</p>
<p>a delight to the whole world’?”</p>
<p>16Your enemies mock you;</p>
<p>they scoff and snarl,</p>
<p>and shout, “We’ve swallowed you up!</p>
<p>That’s what we’ve been waiting for;</p>
<p>at last it’s here to see.”	Lam 2:13-16</p>
<p>17Yahveh has accomplished his purpose</p>
<p>and carried out the threat he ordained long ago.</p>
<p>He has destroyed without pity</p>
<p>and enabled your enemies to celebrate over you</p>
<p>and increased the power of your adversaries.</p>
<p>18Their heart appealed to the Lord,</p>
<p>“Resident of Zion, let your tears run down like a river day and night;</p>
<p>don’t give yourself any relief or let your eyes rest.</p>
<p>19Get up, cry out loud at the beginning of the night watches;</p>
<p>pour your heart out like water to the Lord;</p>
<p>lift your hands up to him for the life of your little ones</p>
<p>who are faint from hunger at the end of every street.”</p>
<p>20See, Yahveh, look! Who else have you ever dealt with this way?</p>
<p>Should women eat their offspring, little babies born healthy?</p>
<p>Should prophet and priest be killed in your sanctuary?	Lam 2:17-20</p>
<p>21Young and old lie on the ground in the streets;</p>
<p>my virgins and young men have fallen by the sword.</p>
<p>You’ve slain them in your anger,</p>
<p>slaughtered them without mercy.</p>
<p>22You invited terrors on every side of me as to an appointed festival.</p>
<p>Nobody escaped or survived your anger.</p>
<p>My enemy destroyed the ones I cared for and raised.	Lam 2:21-22</p>
<p>Hope in Yahveh’s Faithfulness</p>
<p>3:1I have seen suffering</p>
<p>under the rod God used in his anger.</p>
<p>2He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;</p>
<p>3he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.</p>
<p>4He made my skin and body waste away,</p>
<p>and broke my bones.	Lam 3:1-4</p>
<p>5He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.</p>
<p>6He made me live in dark places</p>
<p>like the dead from long ago.</p>
<p>7He walled me in so I couldn’t escape</p>
<p>and put heavy chains on me.</p>
<p>8Even when I call for help,</p>
<p>he shuts out my prayer.	Lam 3:5-8</p>
<p>9He has blocked my road with hewn stones</p>
<p>and made my paths crooked.</p>
<p>10He’s like a bear lying in wait for me,</p>
<p>like a lion in unexpected places.</p>
<p>11He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces;</p>
<p>and made me desolate.</p>
<p>12He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;	Lam 3:9-12</p>
<p>13he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.</p>
<p>14I’m a laughingstock to my people,</p>
<p>mocked in musical ditties all day.</p>
<p>15He filled me with bitterness</p>
<p>and made me drink wormwood.</p>
<p>16He cracked my teeth with gravel</p>
<p>and made me grovel in the dust.	Lam 3:13-16</p>
<p>17I’ve been set apart from peace</p>
<p>and forget what happiness is like.</p>
<p>18So I say, “My strength is gone,</p>
<p>and so is my hope in Yahveh.”</p>
<p>19Remember my suffering and homelessness.</p>
<p>20I certainly remember</p>
<p>and am humbled within.	Lam 3:17-20</p>
<p>21I recall this and have hope from it:</p>
<p>22Yahveh love never stops coming;</p>
<p>his mercies don’t end.</p>
<p>23His faithfulness is great;</p>
<p>it’s renewed every morning.</p>
<p>24I say to myself, “Yahveh is my portion;</p>
<p>so I have hope in him.”	Lam 3:21-24</p>
<p>25Yahveh is good to those who depend on him,</p>
<p>people that look for him.</p>
<p>26They do well to wait silently for his salvation.</p>
<p>27It’s good for people to bear the yoke when they’re young,</p>
<p>28to sit alone in silence, since God has laid it on them,</p>
<p>29to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there’s hope,</p>
<p>30to turn their cheek to their abuser,</p>
<p>to be filled with disgrace;</p>
<p>31because Yahveh won’t reject forever.	Lam 3:25-31</p>
<p>32If he causes grief, he’ll have mercy</p>
<p>according to his enduring love;</p>
<p>33because he doesn’t willingly hurt people or grieve them.</p>
<p>34-36God doesn’t approve</p>
<p>of crushing every prisoner in the land under his feet,</p>
<p>of depriving people of justice in the presence of the Most High,</p>
<p>of defrauding people in his lawsuit.</p>
<p>37Who is there that speaks and it happens</p>
<p>unless the Lord has commanded it?</p>
<p>38Don’t both good and bad come from the Most High?	Lam 3:32-38</p>
<p>39Why should we complain in light of our sins?</p>
<p>40Let’s examine our ways and return to Yahveh.</p>
<p>41Let’s lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;</p>
<p>42we’ve sinned and rebelled; you haven’t pardoned us.</p>
<p>43You’ve covered yourself with anger and chased us;</p>
<p>you’ve slain without pity.</p>
<p>44You’ve wrapped yourself in a cloud</p>
<p>so no prayer can get to you. 	Lam 3:39-44</p>
<p>45You’ve made us residue and refuse among the nations.</p>
<p>46Our enemies rail out against us.</p>
<p>47Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.</p>
<p>48My eyes run with streams of tears</p>
<p>because my people are being destroyed.</p>
<p>49My eyes will keep pouring out</p>
<p>50till Yahveh looks down from heaven and sees.</p>
<p>51My eyes bring pain to my soul</p>
<p>because of all the residents in my city.</p>
<p>52For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird;</p>
<p>53they’ve silenced me in the pit, and put a stone over me;</p>
<p>54water closed over my head; I said, “I’m lost.”</p>
<p>55I called to you, Yahveh, from down in the pit. 	Lam 3:45-55</p>
<p>56You heard my plea,</p>
<p>and didn’t hide from my prayer for relief, my call for help.</p>
<p>57You came and said, “Don’t be afraid!”</p>
<p>58Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life.</p>
<p>59Yahveh, you’ve seen my oppression; judge my case.</p>
<p>60You’ve seen their revenge, their schemes against me.</p>
<p>61You’ve heard their taunts.</p>
<p>62My assailants’ whispers aim at me all day.</p>
<p>63Look at their sitting and rising;</p>
<p>I’m what they mock in their song.</p>
<p>64Pay them back, Yahveh, according to what they’ve done;</p>
<p>65harden their heart so your curse will fall on them.</p>
<p>66Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky! 	Lam 3:56-66</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Anger Satisfied</p>
<p>4:1How the gold has tarnished; how pure gold has changed!</p>
<p>The holy stones lie scattered at the beginning of every street.</p>
<p>2The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in gold,</p>
<p>are treated like clay pots that potters make!</p>
<p>3Even jackals nurse their young,</p>
<p>but my people have become cruel like wild ostriches.</p>
<p>4The infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst;</p>
<p>little ones beg for bread, but nobody gives them any.</p>
<p>5People that used to eat delicacies sit desolate in the streets;</p>
<p>the ones brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.</p>
<p>6The iniquity of my people is worse than the sin of Sodom,</p>
<p>which was overthrown without hands in one moment.</p>
<p>7Zion’s Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk,</p>
<p>healthier looking than corals, like polished lapis lazuli.	Lam 4:1-7</p>
<p>8Now they’re darker than soot, not recognizable in the streets;</p>
<p>their skin is shriveled on their bones, withered like wood.</p>
<p>9Those killed with the sword are happier than those slain by hunger;</p>
<p>they pine away, stricken for lack of crops in the field.</p>
<p>10Merciful women boiled their own children;</p>
<p>they became their food because my people were being destroyed.</p>
<p>11Yahveh has accomplished his wrath,</p>
<p>poured out his hot anger</p>
<p>and sparked a fire in Zion that has consumed its foundations.</p>
<p>12The kings of the earth and inhabitants of the region</p>
<p>didn’t believe enemies could get in the gates of Jerusalem. 	Lam 4:8-12</p>
<p>13Because of its prophets’ sins and its priests’ iniquities—</p>
<p>who shed the blood of good people in it—</p>
<p>14they wandered in the streets, blind and defiled with blood</p>
<p>so nobody would even touch their clothes.</p>
<p>15They shouted at them, “Get away! Unclean! Don’t touch!”</p>
<p>So they fled and wandered.</p>
<p>People in the nations said, “They can’t stay here anymore.”</p>
<p>16Yahveh has scattered them;</p>
<p>he won’t continue to care especially about them;</p>
<p>they didn’t honor the priests or bless the elders.	Lam 4:13-16</p>
<p>17Our eyes failed us; looking for help was useless;</p>
<p>we certainly watched for a nation that couldn’t save.</p>
<p>18People dogged our steps so we couldn’t walk in the streets;</p>
<p>our end came near, our days failed, we were through.	Lam 4:17-18</p>
<p>19Our pursuers were faster than eagles in the sky;</p>
<p>they chased us on the mountains and ambushed us in the desert.</p>
<p>20Our very breath, Yahveh’s anointed, was captured in their pits;</p>
<p>we’d said about him, “In his shadow we’ll live among the nations.”</p>
<p>21Celebrate and be happy, Edom that lives in Uz;</p>
<p>the cup will come around to you as well; you’ll be drunk and naked.</p>
<p>22The punishment for your sinfulness is finished, Zion;</p>
<p>he won’t exile you any longer.</p>
<p>But he’ll punish your iniquity, Edom;</p>
<p>he’ll expose your sins!	Lam 4:19-22</p>
<p>Prayer for Restoration</p>
<p>5:1Yahveh, remember what’s happened to us;</p>
<p>look at our disgrace!</p>
<p>2Our inheritance has been turned over to foreigners,</p>
<p>and our houses belong to aliens.</p>
<p>3We’ve become orphans without fathers;</p>
<p>our mothers are like widows.</p>
<p>4We have to pay for drinking water and buy wood.</p>
<p>5Our drivers put yokes on our necks;</p>
<p>we’re worn out; we can’t get any rest.	Lam 5:1-5</p>
<p>6We’ve submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</p>
<p>7Our fathers sinned, and they’re gone;</p>
<p>but we have to suffer for their sins.</p>
<p>8Slaves rule us; nobody can deliver us from them.</p>
<p>9We risk our lives just getting bread</p>
<p>because of the sword in the open country.</p>
<p>10Our skin is hot like an oven,</p>
<p>because of the burning heat of famine.</p>
<p>11They rape the women in Zion,</p>
<p>and the virgins in the towns in Judah.	Lam 5:6-11</p>
<p>12They hang up officials by their hands,</p>
<p>and show no respect for old men.</p>
<p>13Young men work at the grinding mill;</p>
<p>and stagger under loads of wood.</p>
<p>14Elders are gone from the city gate,</p>
<p>young men have quit their music.</p>
<p>15The joy in our hearts is gone;</p>
<p>our dancing has turned into mourning.</p>
<p>16The crown has fallen from our head;</p>
<p>misfortune awaits us because we’ve sinned!</p>
<p>17Our heart is faint because of it;</p>
<p>our eyes are weak.</p>
<p>18Jackals prowl in desolate Zion. 	Lam 5:12-18</p>
<p>19Yahveh, you rule forever;</p>
<p>your throne goes on for endless generations.</p>
<p>20Why don’t you keep us in mind forever?</p>
<p>Why abandon us so long?</p>
<p>21Restore us to yourself, Yahveh, so we can be restored;</p>
<p>renew our days as of old,</p>
<p>22unless you’ve completely rejected us,</p>
<p>and are really angry with us.	Lam 5:19-22</p>
