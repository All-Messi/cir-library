            <p>Raymond F. Schober</p>
<p>Raymond F. Schober, 71, of Vermillion, Kansas, died Saturday evening, February 20, 1999, at the hospital in Onaga, Kansas.</p>
<p>Mr. Schober owned and operated Schober’s Service in Vermillion since 1955 and Dutch’s Place since 1965.  From 1980 to 1994 he was a field engineer for Associated Engineers.  He served on a U. S. Navy minesweeper in the Pacific Theater during World War II.</p>
<p>Born on March 14, 1927 in Rossville, Kansas, to Fred and Mary Schober, Raymond later attended school in Centralia.  He was a member of the Vermillion Christian Church, American Legion Post #257, VFW Post #1359, and was active in the city council of Vermillion.  He married Daisy Willard on December 24, 1950, in Westmoreland.  She survives of the home.</p>
<p>Raymond is also survived by three sons and daughters-in-law:  Fred and Joyce Schober of Topeka; Steve and Sara Schober of Newton, Iowa; and Brad and Gayla Schober of Centralia; by two sisters, Joyce McCullough of Topeka and Catherine Jacobs of Garland, Texas; by a brother, Eldon “Bud” Minger of Topeka; by extended family member Joyce Dendurent of Wamego; and by nine grandchildren.  He was preceded in death by two sisters, Irma Jacobs and Rosella Plunk.</p>
<p>Services will be held at 2 p.m. at the Vermillion Christian Church with interment at the Vermillion Cemetery.</p>
<p>He will lie in state from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at Padden Funeral Home in Frankfort.</p>
<p>Memorial contributions may be made to the Vermillion Christian Church or Community Home Health of Onaga in care of the Padden Funeral Home.</p>
<p>Schober Interment</p>
<p>Here each man lays aside what is mortal that he may take up what is immortal, because “mortality cannot inherit immortality.”  Here, too, each lays aside the pain and suffering, the limitations, the body that declines with toil and time.</p>
<p>Here we stand at the portal through which we all one day will step into mystery, not as mystery unknown but mystery as something not understood.  We know the connection between a kernel of corn and a stalk of corn.  But the second we would never have anticipated from the first.  Even yet with all our knowledge we do not understand that connection and transition.  Likewise, we have only the body of this life; our hearts will never imagine “what God has prepared for them who love him.”</p>
<p>Meantime, then, until we understand we must trust the One who has made known by his own resurrection that indeed we pass here but through a veil to another side.</p>
<p>Tribute</p>
<p>A husband for forty-eight years, a neighbor for forty years, a father for more than thirty-five years, a friend for forty, thirty, twenty, ten or even four years—we all remember Raymond from different perspectives.</p>
<p>When I would drop by to see Ray and Daisy, sometimes even before I could knock, Ray would call out, “Come on in.”  If I were to characterize this friend, I would say he was a “come-on-in” sort of a man.  By that I mean that he was an open personality; you felt welcomed to his presence.  There was room for you in his life.  He had nothing particular to prove, just something to do for you if you didn’t watch out.  If you went to visit him and cheer him up, you found out that you didn’t seem to have a lot to do.  You were the one who came away feeling better than when you came.</p>
<p>He was an affirmer, an appreciative person.  That leads to a story that introduces a tape we are going to play this afternoon.  One day some eleven or twelve years ago, Daisy was playing the piano and singing in their home.  After she sang “I Walked with God,” read Psalm 139, and sang “I Believe,” Raymond said, “I want you to play that at my funeral.”  Today we have a copy of that tape made those many years ago.</p>
<p>Poem</p>
<p>God saw that he was getting tired,</p>
<p>And a cure was not to be;</p>
<p>So He put his arms around him,</p>
<p>And whispered, “Come with me.”</p>
<p>With tearful eyes we watched him suffer</p>
<p>And saw him fade away.</p>
<p>Though we couldn’t bear to lose him,</p>
<p>We would not bid him stay.</p>
<p>A golden heart stopped beating;</p>
<p>Hard-working hands were laid to rest.</p>
<p>God broke our hearts to prove to us</p>
<p>That He only takes the best.</p>
<p>February 22, 1999</p>
