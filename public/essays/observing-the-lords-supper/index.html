            <p>OBSERVING THE LORD’S SUPPER</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Lord’s Supper is among the acts of worship (1 Corinthians 11: 23-29;</p>
<p>cp. Matthew 26:26-29; 1 Corinthians 10:16-21).</p>
<p>Representation (emblems): in the mind, so to speak, bread and grape juice are</p>
<p>transformed into the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>Symbols mean only what we mean into them. Without conscious involvement, the</p>
<p>Lord’s Supper is just eating bread and drinking grape juice.</p>
<p>Five directions we look in observing the Lord’s Supper</p>
<p>I. We look backward in memorial (1 Corinthians 11:24, 25).</p>
<p>A.	A memorial connects the past and the present.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Sabbath was a weekly memorial of the exodus (Deuteronomy 5:12-15).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passover was an annual memorial of the exodus (Exodus 13:3-10).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pile of rocks was a memorial of crossing the Jordan (Joshua 4:6, 7, 19-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>24).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Lord’s Supper is a memorial of the crucifixion (1 Corinthians 11:24-</li>
</ol>
<p>25).</p>
<p>B.	A memorial gives identity and meaning to “me” by placing “me” in a context.</p>
<p>II. We look inward in self-examination.</p>
<p>A.	Discerning the body (1 Corinthians 11:29) leads to discerning ourselves (11:31).</p>
<p>It is a comparison of ourselves with what the supper means.</p>
<p>B.	Self-examination is like working awhile and then looking up to see how to go or</p>
<p>stepping back to see how it looks.</p>
<p>C.	“In a worthy manner” corresponds with others being hungry while we are</p>
<p>overeating (11:21-22).</p>
<p>It is not superficial.</p>
<p>It is not a gluttonous feast.</p>
<p>It is not an insensitive meal.</p>
<p>We need to use the Lord’s Supper as a time of sensitivity (1 Corinthians 11:30).</p>
<p>Changing a sensitive time (agape) into debauchery brings condemnation.</p>
<p>Note: “Worthy manner” refers to the way communion is observed, not the quality of the person observing it, as in the comment a person might make, “I am not worthy to take the Lord’s Supper.” That would be true of everyone if such a thing were the point of the verse.</p>
<p>III. We look upward.</p>
<p>A.	A memorial causes appreciation (“is given for you”).</p>
<p>It causes us to remember what it took to get things the way they are.</p>
<p>Not remembering is a form of self-centeredness.</p>
<p>B.	A memorial provokes commitment, motivation, identification; it affirms who I am subjectively (1 Corinthians 10:16, 18-21).</p>
<p>It causes us to continue the behaviors that make the present possible for others.</p>
<p>As a rite, communion means ingesting the emblems as a re-enactment within us (not as in Jesus Christ of the mass); communion means ingesting the values they represent.</p>
<p>Baptism is an act of identification; communion is an act of re-identification with</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>Communion is a pledge of allegiance: Christ is not a dead founder, but a living</p>
<p>Lord.</p>
<p>Communion indicates a high degree of commitment: blood means violent death,</p>
<p>not death from old age or sickness or accident. It is a way to affirm our willingness, if need be, to take up our own cross and follow him.</p>
<p>Communion is a participation with Christ.</p>
<p>IV. We look outward.</p>
<p>A.	Proclamation: we can observe communion in gathered worship.</p>
<p>We say to other believers present, “I believe these things.”</p>
<p>Perhaps we speak also to other people outside the community of believers, as</p>
<p>when we drive a company car with a logo on it.</p>
<p>B.	Plea for unity: 1 Corinthians 10:17</p>
<p>Leave the gift at the altar and reconcile matters with someone we have wronged.</p>
<p>It is a participation with the church.</p>
<p>V. We look forward in anticipation.</p>
<p>Jesus is not a dead founder, but a living Lord who will return for his people.</p>
<p>A.	As an interpersonal act, communion avoids being an outward ritual.</p>
<p>a representation</p>
<p>a memorial</p>
<p>a time of self-examination</p>
<p>commitment</p>
<p>plea for unity</p>
<p>proclamation</p>
<p>B.	The commitment we make to the Lord is . . .</p>
<p>total: 	       “to the point of death”</p>
<p>permanent: “till he comes”</p>
<p>exclusive:   “not the table of demons”</p>
