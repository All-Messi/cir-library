      <description>&lt;p&gt;CANON CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Definition of Canonicity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canonicity constitutes normative literature. It sets the doctrinal “norms” by which we consider issues and measure viewpoints. In Christianity, canonicity correlates with inspiration. The canon consists of writings that came from “inspired” men, men whose writings were as correct and authoritative as they would have been if God himself had “exhaled them” (2 Timothy 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. Principles for Canonicity (See separate document “The Determining Principles for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PRIMARY QUESTIONS IN THE COLLECTION</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRIMARY QUESTIONS IN THE COLLECTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CANON&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some scholars suppose the apostles did not consider their work as something for the subsequent ages of the church. They were writing for the then and there. They had supposed that Christ would return within the lifetime of some first-generation Christians. Writing for posterity did not enter their minds. If their literary activity took place under these conditions, collecting their writings to establish a permanent canon would not have been a concerted effort either. Only when it became evident that Christ would not immediately return did the early Christians begin to locate and assemble apostolic writings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE DETERMINING PRINCIPLES FOR CANONICITY</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/the-determining-principles-for-canonicity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE DETERMINING PRINCIPLES FOR CANONICITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the structure of apologetics, the following sketch deals with the principles for determining whether a writing belongs in the Judaeo-Christian canon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The historical principle comes logically first because canonicity has first to do with (5) where the book came from, which means who wrote it and where he got his information. Behind this step lies the concern about (4) how people recognized divine spokesmen and distinguished them from false claimants. The question rests on the observation that God’s breaking into the world through special revelation always, by definition and the nature of the case, involves (3) miracle. Even the prophets themselves must be able to distinguish divine revelation from their own thoughts. The next step is (2) the distinction between divine miracle that confirms revelation and other phenomena like demonic miracle, deception, parapsychological phenomena, misidentified natural occurrences. This distinction is most decisively made by (1) the triumph of the divine in confrontation with alternatives: the “resurrection” of Israel from Egypt (and attendant events) for the Old Testament and the resurrection of Messiah from the grave in the New Testament serve as prime examples. These are historical considerations because biblical revelation is a historical (vs. metaphysical) construct. The historical principle determines canonicity by giving us the right books in the first place; it is positive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE NATURE OF THEOLOGY</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/the-nature-of-theology/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE NATURE OF THEOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. The Nature of Theology vs. Exegesis&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the epistles of the New Testament are problem-solution writings; they were written to deal with difficulties in particular times and places. In the process of answering the problems, the apostles drew upon information on many topics that relate to the need. Not everything about any one topic is in any one place; so readers have to assemble the partial treatments and combine them to form the whole picture. In exegesis, readers follow along the present line of presentation. Theology requires an added step beyond following the line of thought: the readers topically arrange the data into a harmonious whole so they can understand the message itself instead of just one presentation that contains parts of that whole. Exegesis deals with the text; theology deals with the topic. Exegesis operates verse by verse; theology operates with the truth itself as information gathered from the several contexts that address it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THEOLOGY AND LIBERAL ARTS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/theology-and-liberal-arts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEOLOGY AND LIBERAL ARTS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theology establishes the context for liberal arts. It is the discipline of the whole, the discipline of the ultimate. It addresses what is original, eternal, central, basic, ultimate, and all-inclusive. As such, theology affirms first that reality is cohesive rather than chaotic—that the parts have a whole to be part of. Theology calls for “centeredness” and centers reality in the Creator rather than the creation and in the Teacher rather than the student. By implication, theology contextualizes all other disciplines as sub-disciplines, integrates them into one whole, relates them to each another, limits their province, and critiques their methods and findings in at least a restrictive sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TYPICAL ISSUES IN CRITICAL INTRODUCTION</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/typical-issues-in-critical-introduction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TYPICAL ISSUES IN CRITICAL INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critical introduction addresses several issues related to the study of documents. In this setting, “introduction” does not mean getting acquainted with a book’s contents for the first time. “Critical” introduction does not “criticize” the book as if to degrade it. Critical introduction evaluates the nature of a book and matters surrounding its origin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two classifications of information critics draw on in this endeavor are internal evidence and external evidence. Internal evidence refers to data in the writing; external evidence refers to information from elsewhere. In critical introduction to the New Testament, (a) extant early Christian literature provides most of the external evidence. (b) Other resources related to the origins of Christianity help evaluate the records of early Christianity. They have been assembled in writings like F. F. Bruce’s Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1974) or Gary R. Habermas’ Ancient Evidence for the Life of Jesus: Historical Records of His Death and Resurrection (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1984). A final, more distant source of introductory information comes from extra-biblical records that preserve (c) the historical background in the contemporary biblical world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY OF CONVICTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Christian worldview is interpersonal. The interpersonal “category” is the ultimate frame of reference that qualifies and limits the impersonal realities that are also part of full picture. Some major aspects of Christianity are summarized below in ways that correlate with this understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture: Special revelation is interpersonal communication from God to mankind, available to us in written form. Although God could have chosen to relate to us in some other fashion, he spoke to most people through representatives whose messages are preserved in the Old and New Testament writings. We speak of those writings as inerrant relative to the (a) intended (b) content of (c) scripture as such.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SURVEY OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SURVEY OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BIBLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture is the complete word of God written and sufficiently accurate in origin and preservation to accomplish what God sent it to accomplish (Isaiah 55:11). He sent it through chosen representatives endowed with the messages he revealed to them and with the ability to correctly express it to the ones he wanted to hear it. Consequently, non-canonical writings have the status, at best, of devotional writings (Apocrypha and tradition).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE BIG PICTURE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE BIG PICTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest plagues in Bible study is a failure to see the “big picture.” We tend to read a verse, think about it, and discuss it. As a result, that statement gets lifted from its setting and put in the context of our interests or problems even when it may not belong there. Foreign ideas come into the picture because we do not keep context in mind. Bible study needs to cover large portions to keep in sight the flow of thought. In addition, the purpose and character of Christian understanding must provide the framework for individual doctrines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHAT CHRISTIANS IDEALLY BELIEVE AND PRACTICE:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian churches began as an effort to foster Christian unity by returning to scripture alone for the operation of the body of Christ and by setting aside items that have crept into Christendom from outside the New Testament. The conviction has been that division arose in part from such extras. But creating unity requires more than getting rid of what causes division; it also requires what Christ’s people must stand for. Below are characteristic beliefs and practices associated with these churches generally, though certainly not with them only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON JOHN CALVIN’S PENAL SUBSTITUTION THEORY OF THE ATONEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the Reformation, a common understanding of Christ’s atonement work considers his righteousness as a substitute for ours and his death as a substitute for our death as punishment for our sin. The comments below shoulder a negative burden of proof to show that John Calvin’s penal substitution understanding is foreign to atonement theory unless we adopt the rest of his legal theological method, where penal substitution would make sense. The thesis here is that substitutionary atonement theory does not belong in non-Calvinistic theology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Communication: Hebrews 1:1-2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Means of communication: “son” vs. angels/prophets&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SACRIFICE AND SALVATION: ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ANTECEDENTS TO REDEMPTION THROUGH CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice is as old as religion, and religion is as old as man.” The antiquity of sacrifice relates to its universality. Virtually every ancient culture offered sacrifices to supernatural entities; some cultures still do. In the Bible, sacrifice begins in the second generation (Genesis 4:2-8) and appears throughout the patriarchal and Mosaic periods, culminating in Christ’s “sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the abundance of biblical material on sacrifice, the origin of sacrifice is ambiguous. Did it arise from people’s natural religious instincts or from unrecorded divine appointment?1 The same uncertainty applies to the rationale for sacrifice; it is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Old Testament.2 After summarizing some particulars about sacrifice and noting some relevant archaeological remains, the following presentation offers a rationale for sacrifice that connects it with salvation as related to the life and death of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SIX NOTATIONS ON IDENTIFICATION ATONEMENT THEORY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Identification as the Whole Basis&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In identification atonement theory, “identification” means more than identifying with Christ from our own side so God will count Christ’s atoning death as a substitute for our own death. That leaves substitution—or whatever—as the operative mechanism. Identification likewise is not just God’s viewing us from his side as connected with Christ. Identification in these senses fits with any theory of the atonement. Identification would merely connect the sinner with Christ—in the sinner’s mind and God’s mind—in anticipation of whatever mechanism then removed the penalty: ransom, substitute, or conquest. Identification would not replace or obviate some additional operation after the subjective and objective connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRICTURES ON CALVIN’S PENAL SUBSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT  THEORY:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IDENTIFICATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Salvation through Jesus Christ is the most distinctive feature of Christianity. Herein lies its primary difference from previous divine economies, other religions, and human agendas. In Christ, God is concerned with more than letting us know about him, about his moral standards, and about our responsibilities within his purposes. Salvation is not from ignorance, as by revelation; it is not deliverance from material existence as in Gnosticism and eastern dualism; it is not deliverance from individuality as in Hinduism. It is deliverance from alienation and all the negatives that grow out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a selective account that operates like a dot-to-dot, moving from one direction-setting event to the next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MEANING OF “IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Identification with Christ” refers to a complex of factors within the reality of personal relationship, which we are calling interpersonalism. Interpersonalism is a worldview that considers persons in relationship as the highest frame of reference. That reality includes aspects like the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Faith in Christ as the object of identification in place of all others. We not only understand and believe intellectually, but trust actively that Christ is an “extension of,” and the human “manifestation of,” the other side of the divine-human relationship. We believe that identification with him leads to identification with the Father because that is the Father’s condition for identification with himself. We believe what Christ believes; we accept what he teaches about all things whereof he speaks. We put our trust in him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE RATIONALE FOR ATONEMENT THROUGH CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary statement: “Christ alone has achieved perfect goodness as a man in the flesh by obeying the Father in everything even to the point of yielding to an agonizing death. When we commit ourselves to Christ as Lord together with the values and purposes he shares with the Father, God considers us righteous like him, forgiving our sin, reckoning aspiration for achievement, reconciling us to himself.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 SAMUEL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversational Version&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Birth of Samuel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu (son of Tohu son of Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to the LORD’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”   &#x9;1 Sam 1:1-8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A POSITION STATEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ON THE MEANING OF CHRISTIAN BAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of our standard response to the gospel, God appointed baptism for expressing personal identification with Jesus Christ, which involves commitment to his lordship, values, and purposes. In consequence of our identity with him, God forgives our sin, grants fellowship with his Spirit, and numbers us among his children.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this description, (1) “standard response” means that special cases and impossible circumstances are not in view, circumstances where baptism cannot be performed or cannot be performed without endangering life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT OF DISTINCTIONS ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A distinction needs to be made between standard situations and special cases. Denying the necessity of baptism applies only to special cases. Special cases include those in which&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) a person would be risking health or life in being baptized,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) people honestly misunderstand that baptism is immersion or should have been a personal adult response of their own,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(c) someone is “killed on the way to the baptistry.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BAPTISM AS IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BAPTISM AS IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing baptism as identification with Christ provides a framework for working through several abnormal situations that arise and helps make sense even of normal situations that may be overlooked in the theory and practice of the ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addressing first the normal situation, we observe clear cases of baptism that do not move lost people into a saved condition: righteous Jews called to John’s baptism for remission of sins, saved disciples of John called to Christian baptism, and the baptism of Jesus himself by John. Such examples show that Christian—and even Johannine—baptism has a bigger frame of reference than salvation from lostness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Regardless of the correctness of the beliefs involved, many texts do not indicate them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Readers misuse scriptures for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Texts get quoted incorrectly in popular usage. “Money is the root of all evil,” for example, misquotes the text, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” [incorrect quotation]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) The parts of a text get connected the wrong way. “By grace you are saved through faith, and that [faith] is not of yourselves; it is a gift from God.” That does not refer to faith, but to the salvation indicated in the verb—as the neuter form for “that” in the Greek text shows.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS ABOUT CHRISTIAN BAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doctrinal Questions&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is baptism for (meaning)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, in Christian baptism we identify with Jesus Christ. The New Testament means identification when it speaks of (a) being baptized “into Christ,” “into the name of Christ,” and similar expressions (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; Galatians 3:27). We identify with the Messiah instead of with Moses (1 Corinthians 10:1-2) or John the Baptist (Acts l9:1-7) or the apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 1:13-15). As a result, we belong to Christ (1 Corinthians 3:22-23; 1:12). Paul means identification when he says that by baptism we are (b) “united with Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:5). Baptism is a pledge of allegiance to him in which we commit ourselves to his purposes, values, and motivations. We make that commitment to the extent of the death that baptism pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;REBAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wise policy is to let candidates make their own decision about rebaptism; after all, baptism is their obedience to God, not ours. Nevertheless, people usually take their cue from those they have come to trust on religious matters. For these reasons we will not always be able to leave the issue in the hands of candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The predominate opinion has been that rebaptism is not necessary even for those who understood their previous baptism as a testimony to other believers or as the way of entering the visible body of Christ on earth. That opinion seems wise for reasons like the following.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RETHINKING THE DESCRIPTION OF BAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following presentation gives the author’s understanding of Christian baptism even though it attempts to represent fairly a wider movement. What I am saying here may at first sound different to brethren from my background. That difference comes in part from the attention given to framework of thought and structure of presentation. We have tried to achieve wholeness, cohesiveness, and clarity by giving overt expression to our presuppositions. The difference comes also from the fact that there is some diversity in the movement, which is natural enough in a free-church heritage the size of this one. Unity through restoration assumes the desire to adjust toward a more New Testament understanding. Hopefully, this treatment will synthesize ideas and sharpen and improve what we believe and practice in regard to Christian baptism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH IN ACTS 2:38</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH IN ACTS 2:38&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian baptism is a self-expression of personal identification with Jesus Christ, and God gives consequences on the basis of that identity more than on the basis of the act itself: forgiveness of sin, gift of the Spirit, and fellowship in the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acts 2:38 connects with the thesis above by making the full threefold affirmation: baptism, in the name of Christ, and forgiveness of sins. It does not say, “(Let each one of you) repent and be baptized for the remission of sins,” as sometimes misquoted. Strictly speaking, scripture nowhere uses the phraseology “baptism for remission of sins.” The point, of course, is not to disconnect baptism from forgiveness in every way, but to conceptualize the connection exactly. Ananias does tell Saul to be baptized and wash away his sins (Acts 22:16). Peter feels free even to say that baptism saves us (1 Peter 3:21), salvation being reconciliation from alienation caused by sin. Evidently in referring to baptism, Titus 3:5 declares that God “saved us through the washing of regeneration.”1 Even John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance unto/for remission of sins (Matthew 3:2; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3; Acts 13:24; 19:4). Baptism texts include the forgiveness consequence, especially when sin figures prominently in the circumstance; hence, the deliberative question on Pentecost, “What are we going to do?” (Acts 2:37) and Ananias’ directive to “the chief of sinners,” distraught over having so severely persecuted Jesus’ disciples (Acts 22:16).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scholars speculate about synoptic origins in an effort to create a scenario for the features of the first three gospels as a set. We do not have to settle on what actually explains the phenomena; we need only develop credible possibilities for explaining those features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Introducing the Synoptic Problem&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The “synoptic problem” addresses the relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The degree of their similarity calls for explanation beyond what happened. Their unusual similarity is then complicated by the differences between them. Evangelical perspective calls for minimizing appeal to contradiction to solve the question. The synoptic phenomenon is part of the “gospel problem” as a whole. In addition to the characteristics of all four gospels, the synoptic problem focuses on features shared by the first three. The following considerations highlight how alike they are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TWO BASIC POINTS ABOUT BAPTISM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TWO BASIC POINTS ABOUT BAPTISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two points should be highlighted in presentations about baptism. First, baptism should not be too closely identified with outer response. That lends itself to distinguishing inner and outer, identifying faith with inner and baptism with outer, and then affirming that it is the inner dimension that justifies rather than the outer expressive act as well, thus trying to avoid baptism as a work and bringing it into conformity with the Pauline formula “salvation by faith” vs. works. But “faith” in Romans/Galatians does not mean inner action; that is the usage in James. Paul means action in the context of personal relationship (faith) vs. action in the context of legal process (works). We do well to unite inner and outer response in salvation and to consider baptism itself as comprised of both dimensions inseparably. That unity of aspects applies to all acts of obedience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TYPES OF SYSTEMS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all systems are alike. They often operate in respect to different kinds of matters, but the main contrast lies in the kinds of connectors in them that bind actions to results. Below are three types of systems that illustrate this diversity. We outline them here in order to clarify what causes people to differ so intensely about the role of Christian baptism in the salvation process. Basically what happens is that at various points in their total understanding of baptism they are shifting baptism back and forth between different systems without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is some diversity in that movement, which is natural enough in a free-church heritage the size of ours; but that diversity makes it more difficult to state “our position.” Nevertheless, unity through restoration accomplishes one thing for us and for everyone here today: it assures the desire to continue adjusting toward a more biblical understanding. Hopefully, this treatment will synthesize our ideas and thereby sharpen and improve what we all believe and practice about Christian ordinances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF BAPTISM SHOWS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very fact that baptism exists shows that salvation is not by works of law, works in a legal sense, works in a legal context, acts that have some legal value. Furthermore, the very existence of baptism shows that salvation is not by human effort relative even to an interpersonal standard of behavior, which, as in law, is also a perfection standard. To make this claim convincing, we must show that baptism is not primarily for bringing about entrance into the institutional church or for communicating to other people that we have decided to follow Jesus. For present purposes, that point is sufficiently shown by the biblical expression “baptism into Christ,” not “baptism into the church” or some wording that indicates testimony to other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GREEK HELPS IN NEW TESTAMENT INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, Greek raises possibilities of interpretation we would not think from the English wording. Sometimes the Greek eliminates ideas the English wording might suggest. The Greek helps us understand why translations differ at certain points, and alerts us to ambiguities in the original text so we do not get dogmatic about a certain idea in the passage. Greek awareness enables us to use study tools like Greek concordance, lexicons, and commentaries that discuss the original text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Pre-Existence&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Pre-existence&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John 1:1-4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John 6:33, 38, 51&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John 8:56-58&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John 17:5, 24&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:5-7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Colossians 1:13-17&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Hebrews 1:1-4&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B. &#x9;Eternal pre-existence&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The eternal pre-existence of Christ is difficult to prove. It is an inference from having first shown that he is personal deity. It is difficult to disprove the idea that the Father, Son, and Spirit were originally one person, but that for a time the Son and then the Spirit became a second and third person somehow set off from the original one. The nature of personhood would seem to exclude the separating idea; but it is possible that we make that inference because our personal nature is like that. The following information, however, relates to the eternal pre-existence of the Son.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VALUES OF BIBLICAL LANGUAGES FOR BIBLE STUDY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing biblical languages does not leave you so much at the mercy of translations. One disadvantage of having to work through a translation is that (a) no two languages match up exactly. A vocabulary item in one language seldom has the same range of denotations and connotations as the closest corresponding word(s) in another. The same thing applies to phrases, sentences, word endings, and particularly idioms, a culture’s customary usages of its language’s mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Solomon and the assembly went to it, 6and he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.   &#x9;2 Ch 1:1-6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/Babylonia and put them in the treasury. 3He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, 4young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had him teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, 5and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. 6Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. 7The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel was Belteshazzar, Hananiah was Shadrach, Mishael was Meshach, and Azariah was Abed-nego.&#x9;Dan 1:1-7&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement made out of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. 7Drinks were served in gold cups of different kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty. 8The drinking was done by law: attendees were not compelled, because the king had ordered each official of his household to follow each person’s wishes. 9Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the king’s palace.&#x9;&#x9;Esther 1:1-9&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians were afraid of them [13] 14and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields. &#x9;Ex 1:8-14&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 3God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back forth like bolts of lightning.&#x9;Ezek 1:1-14&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Go up and rebuild the Temple of Yahveh God of Israel, the God in Jerusalem. 4Wherever there’s a survivor, support him with silver and gold, supplies and livestock, plus freewill offerings.’”           &#x9;Ezra 1:1-4&lt;/p&gt;</description>

God’s Spirit was moving over the ocean. 3God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4He saw the light was good and separated it from darkness. 5He called light “day” and darkness “night.” Morning and evening made day one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6God said, “Let an expanse separate the water 7below it from the water above it.” It happened. 8He called the expanse “sky.” Morning and evening made day two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was the son of Jeroham Ben-Elihu (Ben-Tohu Ben-Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to Yahveh of hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But Yahveh had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to Yahveh’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”&#x9;1 Sam 1:1-8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Maybe he’ll be concerned about us enough to keep us from dying.” 7They said to one another, “Let’s cast lots to find out who caused this catastrophe to hit us.” They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. 8“Tell us, now!

I’ll be with you like I was with Moses; I won’t fail you or abandon you. 6Be strong and courageous. You’ll enable my people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors I’d give them. 7Make sure you do everything in the Law that Moses commanded you. 8Think about it day and night.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several situations foster misinterpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) adverse consequences would come from taking a certain position (persecution, being ostracized from a fellowship, loss of a ministry or a job)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) competition situations (debates)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) hurried circumstances (deadlines)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) emotional situations (anger, depression, fear)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(5) the believe that the Spirit is providing the interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(6) partial information (starting to work on answers before assembling&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;all the information it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As to words, people shift categories without shifting them as to concepts, because the categories are interconnected in actual experience. Being, action, and relationship are equally present in any real event, but with the mind we can differentiate between them. So language, which reflects the subjective activity of sensory perception and mental conception, differentiates between the aspects of an event even though they are objectively interrelated. If we do not distinguish language and reality, we take a point stated about one aspect and slide it onto another. Furthermore, language itself may use a nature term to refer to an action or to state reality. If readers do not keep in mind the nature of the issue, they can make all kinds of false inferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The genre issue comes into the reading of Genesis 1-11, the Book of Job, the Book of Jonah, and apocalyptic works like Revelation, Ezekiel, and Daniel. History is more replete with names, places, sequences of time; but myth, saga, novelle, and the like, may have these elements as well. Especially in myth, the place where an event happens may not be of prime importance because myth uses story form to teach timeless, universal ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/b-presuppositions-accompanying-misinformation-virgil-warren-phd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of presuppositions include (1) preliminary ideas from which further ideas derive. Presuppositions, or pre-understanding, lie ahead of the present matter. They color what we read and hear on this matter. An example of presupposition would be the idea that what works is good (pragmatism).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presuppositions can be (2) larger constructs that qualify statements about matters within them. One big issue in contemporary hermeneutics is the question about implicit cultural limitation. Revelation critiques culture and stands in prophetic relationship to it. Nevertheless, some have entertained the idea that Paul and others sought to show they were not cultural subversives. On the basis of the way they deal with slavery, table fellowship (eating with someone), salutation (speaking to someone), dress code (veil-wearing, hair length), this thinking pattern has been applied to (a) egalitarian vs. hierarchical structure of marriage and (b) homosexual behavior between consenting partners. One issue is whether such behaviors mean the same thing in our setting as they did then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpretation deals with what scripture teaches about doctrinal matters to be believed. It deals with what scripture teaches about practices to be done. Within “praxis” lies a further distinction between example and precedent—between what was done and what was meant to be done by other people thereafter. Establishing precedent has two steps: (1) showing that such and such was, in fact, a New Testament pattern; and (2) showing that the pattern was meant to apply universally and permanently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The meaning of “interpret”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation involves (1) discovering the referent, (2) connecting the referent by consistency with the rest of the big picture (integration), and (3) making application to issues the author does not address, including the modern needs of believers. The first two aspects belong to “what it meant”; the last is “what it means.” We “interpret” (exegesis) to discover “meaning” (integration) so we can “understand” and have “wisdom” (application). Until we reach a level of understanding that enables us to use what we know, we do not “understand” in a “useful” way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1) Irrationalism occurs when feelings become the final frame of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Viewpoints based on feelings can come from confusing feelings with the work of the Spirit. People do not consider changing beliefs because they feel that the viewpoint they have must be right. There is danger in supposing that the sense (feeling) of certainty is a reason for certainty—that the Spirit places it directly in the mind. There is no more reason to assume that happens in regard to a feeling than a thought. In either case, if people cannot differentiate between something planted by the Spirit and their own thoughts and feelings, they should not consider it divine in origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON “FULFILL”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We may wonder what definition to put on “fulfill” if it covers such a wide range of ideas as (1) a prediction’s coming to pass, (2) an event that illustrates a generalized principle (Acts 1:20?), (3) the accomplishment of something that was also the purpose of something else (the gospel’s fulfilling the Mosaic law: Matthew 5:17; cp. Romans 3:31?), (4) an obedience that accomplished what was commanded (Romans 13:8-10), (5) a necessary inference from another passage, (6) a meeting of the requirements for something (“This course fulfills the requirement”), and (7) a mere formal similarity (? Matthew 2:18, 23; perhaps 2:15).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCEPT INVENTORY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For interpreters to do their work properly, they must be able to bring to the text an awareness of as many linguistic and conceptual features as appear and are presupposed in the materials they are trying to understand. Jesus’ hearers in John 7:34-36 wondered whether he would go among the Gentiles or Diasporic Jews when he said, “You cannot go where I am going.” They could not understand him because in their minds they did not have the possibility of Messiah’s ascension to heaven. The same thing happened with the Sadducees when they presented Jesus with the problem about a woman married to seven brothers in succession. They did not understand the power of God to generate new possibilities beyond what they could already conceive of on the basis of past experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a confusion that comes into discussions when people try to use illustrations. When the model is off, inferences made from it can be foreign to the topic at hand because the model has elements in it that are not in the thing it is called on to explain..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A word, phrase, or general presentation does not mean whatever the expressions could mean; it means what fits the immediate flow of thought, the distant context, and the nature of the case. Readers need to look for the relevant contrast over against which the writer is speaking. They need to properly identify the topic an author is speaking about. They must transcend their existential situation and personality bent lest they put biblical statements in a foreign framework; otherwise, the dogmatic and practical principles get ahead of the exegetical one (see entries above). Readers have to read the biblical writer “on his own terms”; they have to “get inside the writer’s mind.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since language is based on perception, it expresses a person’s subjective viewpoint. Consequently, (a) statements can be made from the way things look more than from the way they really are (phenomenological language). In a related matter, (b) language does not reproduce the whole of the reality it refers to, but only enough to let the hearer know what the speaker is talking about. From previous experience or explanation, a hearer fills in the rest of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Restrictive means limited to some portion less than all: “They are good people” (their relatives are not good). Nonrestrictive means all the group—at least generally—is characterized that way: “They are good people (I am not talking about anybody else here, and, yes, I am aware of the rotter that abandoned his family years ago).” Both statements indicate what the speaker means, not what is true or what else he knows about other people or about any exceptions to his point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GETTING THE POINT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: The Nature of Language Communication&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. An allegory: parallels between working a puzzle and interpreting the Bible&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not everything is all there together; we have to put it together. The Bible has a historical organization and a practical application to specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are tempted to start putting pieces together before we get all the pieces turned over and sorted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We begin by turning the pieces over and sorting them by color and perhaps shape, a procedure comparable to getting the data together before beginning to work on a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assuming technical usage in the scripture is a way of trying to get something more specific out of a text than the author meant. Technicalizing is a kind of restrictive reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technical contrasts with positive, general, or descriptive usage. Technicalizing shows up in taking words as appellative names rather than as descriptive ones: church of Christ, church of God, disciples become Church of Christ, Church of God, Disciples. Technicalizing leads to expectancy for uniform usage. It specifies a smaller group within those who could be described by the word picture. In church offices, elder means more than “older”; it ‎means a(n older) man who oversees a group of believers as when qualifications are listed and a process of selection takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At each step in the process, they choose what hooks up with other points that lead toward the desired conclusion. Setting the conclusion and working to it, yields firm interpretations in ambiguous cases, and twists statements in the direction of the foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It occurs especially when the exact manner of connection is unimportant for present purposes. It can create ambiguity because the (1) mode of causality and (2) the directness of causation get blurred. All languages streamline causality and interchange modality, but Hebrew does so more than English and other modern languages do in cultures impacted by scientific precision. Much of the “God talk” in scripture comes to mean something different when English speakers use it; they bring the verbiage into their language without adjusting its import. By allowing variation within the mode, Semitic thought tends to be general and holistic in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The “big three” in interpretation are (1) the law of harmony, (2) the law of contrast, and (3) the nature of the case. All three amount to one thing—the law of harmony, but we sort them out to stress the peculiar contribution each aspect makes to the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Law of harmony (analogy)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things or two ideas can have varying degrees and kinds of relationship. From one extreme to the other is (1) what is positively determined by something else,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION, HERMENEUTICS, THEOLOGICAL METHOD&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In dealing with controversial passages, interpreters make their choice by their understanding of the big picture, the general understanding, the conceptual context. They follow this procedure even with passages that at first glance would call for a more likely-sounding interpretation. The readers may choose a less likely sounding meaning because of the general understanding they bring to the text. In such cases, where more than one reading is possible, the text doesn’t prove either idea that the readers are bringing to it; that text rises no higher than confirmatory evidence in contrast to primary proof. The passage falls out of the process of arriving at the general understanding. That general understanding must come from someplace else or from other places taken together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Examples of biblical literary genres: apocalyptic, benedictions, covenant, diatribe, didactic, drama, epistles, fable, history, lament, law, myth, parables, poetry, prophecy (predictive), proverbs, psalms, riddles, speeches (sermons, prayer, dialog), wisdom literature&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Prime concerns&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The degree of figurativeness expected in various genres&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Figurativeness and literalness are matters of degree. The degree of figurativeness depends on the purpose of communication. If the purpose is to inform, the writing less figurative; if it is to motivate, it may be more figurative. Poetry and prophecy foster figurative expression; history and law have less figurativeness. Didactic material lies between the extremes. High levels of figurativeness do not occur so often in passages that seek to inform, because figurativeness works against clarity. Figurative language is used more for confirming truths already understood, exhortation, and impression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commandment means something that excludes alternative behaviors. It applies to (a) moral law, which goes back to first principles for determining right action. Moral law comes from divine purpose and the nature of the case. It distinguishes between natural and unnatural. Since moral commandments reflect purpose and the nature of things based on purpose, people obey moral commandments to bring about a more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commandment applies to (b) positive commandment. Although other possibilities exist, this one is specified—perhaps for “good order.” Positive commandment rests more on authority because it addresses appropriate and more appropriate. (The purpose of positive commandment is nicely put by C. S. Lewis in Perelandra, p. 118.) It is a commandment obeyed out of love and deference more than from necessity, fear, or duty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first derives from the nature of scripture, which as a matter of principle we accept as true throughout and therefore harmonious. The second principle derives from the nature of language, which conveys ideas relative to a framework of thought. The last principle derives from experience, a prime resource for knowing the way things are. All three principles interrelate and impact the interpretation of human language in general and scripture in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW TESTAMENT INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF OLD TESTAMENT TEXTS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several hermeneutical questions arise about the New Testament writers’ use of Old Testament texts. In cases like Matthew’s use of Hosea 11:1, we may broaden the definitions of prophecy and fulfillment as a way of legitimizing his use of the prophet’s comment. Making this move reflects a prior commitment to the principle that inspiration makes New Testament authors “forever correct.” People’s prior commitment to “inerrancy” causes them to take a positive view on a text that they might not otherwise have chosen or would otherwise consider a matter of opinion. That does not weaken its validity; it merely demonstrates consistency. We cannot with finality settle some questions directly. We take views on derivative issues that harmonize with primary views. On the other hand, the possibility of other imaginable reasons for a writer’s use of an earlier text does not invalidate one affirmed because of assumed inerrancy. We are involved here in the distinction between a presuppositional and phenomenological approach to the view of scripture. Without the assumption that divine inspiration kept writers from error, we would have less justification for using insights from one writer to clarify ambiguous words of another writer, for harmonizing two authors who could otherwise mean incompatible things, for interpreting biblical statements so as not to conflict with information we learn from science, for choosing this interpretation from among two or more otherwise equally plausible views, given only the text itself, or even for taking a less likely sounding interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A few examples illustrate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Psalm 51:10 says, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me” (cp. 36:26); Ezekiel 18:31 shows another emphasis: “Make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.” The difficulty is whether Psalm 51:10 interprets Ezekiel 18:31 or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Allegorizing the comparison&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The allegorizing problem applies to all expressions that make comparisons: similes, metaphors, parables, illustrations (vs. examples). Comparison does not mean likeness in every respect, but in the respects the speaker indicates. All comparisons relate figure and fact as overlapping circles. Some things about the figure do not apply to the fact. When hearers press the comparison to aspects outside the purpose of the illustration,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;they abandon the speaker’s authority for claiming those likeness. They commit the equivalent of what in logic is called “the fallacy of four terms”; that is, the middle term does not refer to the same thing in both statements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpretation is a community effort. In practice, Christians do not just individually interact with the scripture; they interact with each other as well. For biblical interpretation purposes, we need to understand how language works both in studying scripture and in teaching and hearing the way of the Lord more perfectly. Theology as a community effort includes studying the history of Christian thought; it provides another resource for biblical understanding. It identifies the appropriate role of tradition as teacher rather than authority. Christians are church theologians, never professional theologians; they do something with what they learn (education for use), and they do it in community with other people inside and outside the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A. The process of hermeneutics and life [understanding the biblical message]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Goal: to find out what the scripture means by experiencing what it says; do it to understand it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Passages take on a liveliness and relevance because of experiences we face. Meaning is not just objective significance, but subjective impact. The two correspond as to content, but the impact comes from the doing. Understanding through interpretation (validity) leads to belief (truth) and obedience (commitment), which turns around and clarifies the understanding. As reciprocation occurs between parts and whole in biblical-systematic interpretation, so also reciprocation occurs between text and experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WISDOM AND LAW: DIVORCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between law and wisdom as well as the relationship between them showed up in an article on the adult offspring of divorce by Irene Sege published in the Boston Globe (see The Manhattan Mercury for Friday, December 20, 1995, D1). Generalizations about these young people show that their parents’ divorce measurably affects a sizable portion of their children when they grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of wisdom, then, not to enter marriage without the most earnest intentions of maintaining the future marriage for the children’s sake—among other things. And, it is likewise a matter of wisdom to go together into marriage with a set of values that increases the likelihood of the marriage’s permanence. This kind of observation is built on reality as based on human nature (vs. purpose or relationship) and has the pattern of tendency (vs. uniformity).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE KINGDOM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first portion of Matthew 5-7 has to do with the first “petal on our daisy”: Blessings and Responsibilities (5:3-16). Before looking at the meaning of the verses individually, we must see how the structure of the sermon may affect its interpretation. Since it is wisdom literature, it is loosely structured. The significance of this point can be appreciated by looking at Luke’s Sermon on the Plain (6:20-49), which has several close parallels with the Sermon on the Mount. Despite similarities many interpreters consider them different presentations, partly because they may fall at different points in Jesus’ ministry. Regardless of whether they are two accounts of the same sermon or different accounts of two sermons, Luke’s rearrangement of similar material shows that we should be cautious about making too much out of connectors between blocks of material. In other words, context connections in wisdom literature are less helpful in interpretation, because the writer tends to connect his paragraphs more loosely. They are self-contained units more than interdependent ones. In yet other places Luke has bits and pieces that appear in Matthew 5-7. Luke 13:22-24ff. compares with Matthew 7:21-23 on the judgment scene and the narrow gate. Luke 16:17-18 parallels Matthew 5:18 and 32, which includes the “jot and tittle” statement and the ethics of marriage. The connections we see between portions of the sermon may not have been as strong in Jesus’ mind as they might look to us. The structure of Matthew’s account may be more apparent than real. Observations based on sequence and association may be well to make, but their validity probably rests more on the nature of adjacent subjects than on their placement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HATE, ADULTERY, AND DIVORCE:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:21-32&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:21-6:18 may be regarded as an outgrowth of the comment in 5:20 that people’s righteousness should exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Murder, adultery, divorce, and the lesser sins of anger (5:22a), hate, name calling (5:22b), revenge (5:38-42), and capricious oath taking (5:33-37) are all of the same sort: they depersonalize other people. Depersonalizing relationships can be done by&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a)&#x9;legalizing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HYPOCRISY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Sermon on the Mount is wisdom literature and therefore less structured, it has pattern and carries a unifying theme. The initial set of beatitudes introduces statements of responsibility for being God’s light and salt in the world. To accomplish that purpose, Jesus’ disciples must correct their thinking at points like the ones he mentions. We should not misconstrue this correcting as discarding previous revelation, but as fulfilling it by proper understanding. In 5:20 Jesus tells his followers that their righteousness needs to exceed that of contemporary religious leaders, a comment clarified by six illustrations. Under the contrast formula “You have heard that it was said by them of old time . . . but I tell you     . . .” Jesus discusses murder, adultery and divorce, oath taking, revenge, and love. Chapter 6:1-18 is a further unit about hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERNAL EVIDENCE FOR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE AUTHORSHIP OF JOHN’S GOSPEL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Determining from internal evidence the authorship of John’s gospel requires establishing the identity of “the disciple whom Jesus loved”: “This [disciple that Jesus loved] is the disciple that bears witness of these things and wrote them, and we know his testimony is true” (21:24 + 20). A similar comment appears in the account of the spear thrust: “He that has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knows he says true things that you may believe” (19:35; cp. 20:30-31). The characteristic description appears five times in the gospel beginning with the night before Christ’s death: 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, and 21:20.1 Other more vague references to unnamed men include the second of “two disciples” of John that heard Jesus speak (1:35-39), the first being Andrew (1:40); and “another disciple,” known by the high priest (18:15).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JESUS AND THE LAW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our study of the Sermon on the Mount brings us to Matthew 5:17-20, the second “petal” on the daisy. We have entitled it “Jesus and the Law” because it shows how his ministry and teaching relate to God’s earlier revelation. This paragraph introduces Jesus’ objection to the Pharisees. He contrasts his teaching more with theirs than with the Old Testament Law itself. The verses deal with his concern that people not misunderstand what he is teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OATHS AND ADVERSARIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at Matthew 5:33-48, dealing first with verses 33-37 on taking oaths. Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said to them of old time, “You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths.” But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your conversation be yes, yes and no, no. Whatever is more than these comes from the evil one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OVERCOMING THE CRITICAL MIND SET&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Jesus says, “Do not judge,” he raises four questions: (1) What does judge mean? (2) Why do we do it? (3) Why should we stop it? (4) How can we stop it? We can study Matthew 7:1-6 by asking these questions about the text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. What does judge mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Judge means more than “evaluate.” In 7:6 Jesus warns his listeners not to cast pearls before swine or give holy things to dogs. To take that advice, we have to make a judgment as to who is, so to speak, a “dog” or “pig.” We must always discern the difference between right and wrong or effective and ineffective, and we are called on to warn fellowmen about such things. Nevertheless, on occasion Matthew 7:1 is quoted in self-defense by people appropriately confronted with some characteristic sin. But, since fellow Christians have mutual responsibility to lead each other to repentance, Jesus does not forbid reaching a verdict on the morality of someone’s behavior and approaching him about it respectfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRENGTH FOR TODAY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 6:19-34 gives us an opportunity to use a simple method of Bible study. It consists of asking a question and reading scripture with an eye for answers. We may be surprised at how often scripture addresses such questions. Familiar scriptures take on a fresh light because new experiences establish a new context for seeing new applications. The answers were not noticed before because we were not prepared for them. Matthew 6 offers insights into matters we never thought the Bible even addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TALKING TO THE FATHER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our study of Matthew 5-7 has progressed around the daisy outline to the model prayer. We discussed 6:1-18 under the heading of hypocrisy. The accompanying diagram shows how the model prayer fits inside that larger portion. Jesus’ comments about giving, prayer, and fasting follow a pattern that includes “they have their reward,” doing their alms, praying and fasting “in secret,” and “your Father will reward you openly.” His statements about prayer lead into the “model prayer,” a subset in this format for 6:1-18.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MEANING OF THE GOLDEN RULE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 35:8 prophesied that there would be “a highway of holiness” that only the redeemed would pass over. A wayfaring man, though a fool, would not err in it. Life gets complicated sometimes, but scripture teaches one principle that simplifies it for everyone regardless of capacity or station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On two occasions the Jewish religious leaders asked Jesus what the most important commandment was. Matthew 22:34 records one of the incidents:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE SERMON AS A WHOLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5-7 records the Sermon on the Mount. This study presents thirteen lessons on that material. First, we look at the structure of the whole presentation. It is “wisdom literature,” an especially appropriate expression in this case because Jesus closes with an illustration about a wise man who built his house on ledge rock. “Wisdom” lies not only in knowing what to do, but in doing it. It is application in addition to information. Wisdom is living life among men according to the will of God. It means more than avoiding evil and doing good; it means aiming at doing best. That is always the wise way to live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE VALUE OF THE GOLDEN RULE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous study on Matthew 7:12 dealt with the meaning of the Golden Rule. This study looks at the impact of the Golden Rule on individuals and on their relationships. In the parallel between “[Do] [to others] [as you would have others do to you]” and “[Love] [your neighbor] [as yourself],” we made two primary observations. (1) Do replaces love; so love is an action that can be commanded. That doing is a giving of ourselves for the joy of others. Often love means giving of ourselves for the needs of others, but we can also love God, who “is not served by men’s hands as though he needed anything” (Acts 17:25). It is better, then, to define love broadly enough to include loving him. When we meet people’s needs, we are increasing their happiness; so love becomes self-giving for the joy of others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They serve as links between the high points the author has highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On some occasions the author introduces a brief note about someone that will play a major role later in the account: Saul at the stoning of Stephen (7:58; 8:1), Barnabas as among those who sold land to support for the needy (4:36-37), John Mark as the one whose mother owned the upper room where the disciples awaited Peter’s fate (12:12).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Selectivity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the book does not recount all the events means that selection has occurred. If selection has occurred, the writer does not just tell about a bunch of things that happened (“stream of consciousness”). Rather, he is a historian that makes a judgment about what events are epitomes and direction-setting events. Seeing the big picture, a historian chooses events that—from the vantage point of God above or of later perspective—prove to be more important because of their impact on subsequent events or prove more useful to any distinctive purpose the author may have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE PURPOSE OF ACTS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In working out the purpose of Acts, we consider three items:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) the purpose would best applies to Luke-Acts taken together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) the purpose ought specifically to relate in some way to Theophilus (1:1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(c) the purpose can be a combination of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the suggestions offered for the purpose of Luke-Acts are the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Luke-Acts was prepared as a trial brief for Paul’s first appearance before the judgment seat of Caesar. It explained the forerunner and founding personality of Christianity and showed its general relationship to Judaism, and then proceeded to outline the pattern of its spread from Judaea throughout the rest of the Roman Empire. The fact that Acts portrays the relationship between Christians and Roman rulers in a good light could corroborate this suggestion. Theophilus could have been Paul’s trial lawyer. “Most excellent” (Luke 1:3) could be a title of address for such a dignitary (Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE WITNESS OF ACTS TO THE KERYGMA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theories about an evolutionary origin for the Christian religion present a fundamental line of inquiry. The body of literature called the “New Testament” supposedly shows stages that process passed through. If the New Testament does not actually represent the original Christian preaching, what really did comprise their message, and how can we recover that primitive gospel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acts of Apostles, written after the life of Jesus of Nazareth, presupposes incidents in his ministry. It purports to be a history of men divinely appointed to establish a religion based on these incidents. The record of their “acts” includes accounts of what they said as well. Such a record should prove valuable in discovering the content of the earliest “preaching,” the kerygma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ADDED NOTATIONS ON APOSTLES TODAY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We may question whether Judas should be counted among the men called apostles in the primary sense. Although he originally had that role, he left it (cp. Acts 1:15-22).. In addition, he did not see the resurrected Christ receive the commission and enablements distinctive to apostles in the primary sense. With Judas omitted, that leaves thirteen apostles with Matthias replacing Judas and Paul joining the class later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ARE THERE MODERN-DAY APOSTLES?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ARE THERE MODERN-DAY APOSTLES?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two Word Meanings&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christians sometimes ask whether there are apostles in the church today. To answer the question, we must clarify what it means because the New Testament uses apostle in more than one way. Its general sense refers to someone who is “sent,” which makes it a synonym for missionary. In its technical usage, apostle refers to a group of men, fourteen in number, who had additional specialized qualifications: they were direct witnesses of the resurrected Christ (except for Judas Iscariot), directly chosen and commissioned by Christ, directly endowed with their message, directly guided in their work, and directly empowered by the Spirit. (See “Paul as Primary Apostle.”). “You tried the ones that call themselves apostles and aren’t” (Revelation 2:2) implies that some apostles were distinguishable from other apostles. If all apostles were simply traveling evangelists or insightful men differing only in degree, they could be called apostles. Denying the claim would be like denying that someone was a missionary. They were in fact traveling, they were in fact insightful if they were, and they were in fact sent from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It appears also in 1 Corinthians 6:15; Galatians 2:17; 3:21; cp. 6:14.*&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The longest list of individuals saluted (16:3-16). In Colossians the long list of names&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;consists of saluters (4:7-14, five; while Romans contains seven—eight including Tertius).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul gives “husband of one wife” as a characteristic of elders and deacons in 1 Timothy 3:2, 12 and Titus 1:6. The following diagram traces the pattern of thought for determining what he meant by this phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STEP I. We must distinguish between what to do because it is best under the circumstances (“expediency”) and what a passage requires (“exegesis”). For instance, in the case of married versus not married, it is one thing to say that there are advantages to having a married eldership; it is another thing to say that Paul is requiring a married eldership. This treatment of the problem addresses primarily what the passage means as to whether elders and deacons must be married.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ORIGIN OF THE ROMAN CHURCH(ES)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least three household churches existed in Rome by the time Paul wrote to the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;imperial city: Romans 16:5, 14, 15.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early churches outside Palestine had varying proportions of the following groups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jews, proselytes, God-fearers (σεβόμενοι, sebomenoi), Gentiles/Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Converts from Pentecost: Acts 2:10&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. Jews returning after the relaxation of Claudius’ edict of expulsion in A.D. 49&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Claudius died in A.D. 54): Romans 16:3-5a and Acts 18:2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PAUL AS PRIMARY APOSTLE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PAUL AS PRIMARY APOSTLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some have questioned whether Paul belonged to the primary group of Jesus’ followers called “apostles.” During the early years of the Christian era, the Judaizing element in the church attempted (1) on doctrinal grounds to put him in secondary position. They tried to create the impression that he stood at odds with the primary apostles, those centering around Peter in Jerusalem. Judaizers believed that Gentile converts should become Jews in the process of becoming Christians. Paul opposed their call for circumcising Gentiles and thereby identifying them with national Israel and obligating them to keep the Mosaic Law. He understood in the first case, relative to the church, that Christianity does not have a political component. He observed in the second case, relative to salvation, that putting Gentiles under Jewish Law would in theory bring them under a perfection requirement for continued relationship to God—initial salvation by grace and continued salvation by works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ROMANS: ORIGIN, DATE, AND DESTINATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Origin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote Romans after the acquaintances previously known from elsewhere had moved to the imperial city (16:3-16), after he had preached from Jerusalem to Illyricum (Romans 15:19, cp. 23), while he was in route to Jerusalem with the offering for the saints (Romans 15:25-28, 31), and at a time when he anticipated preaching the gospel in Spain (15:24, 28-29). According to Acts 19:21-22, while Paul was still in Ephesus on the third tour, he planned to go to Jerusalem and then to Rome. On this third tour, Paul organized the collection for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (cp. Acts 20:4; 21:15; 1 Corinthians 16:1-9;     2 Corinthians 8-9). Having left Ephesus after the riot, Paul journeyed north through Troas, across through Macedonia, and down to Greece (20:1-6) before returning through Macedonia and down the east coast of the Aegean Sea to Miletus and on to Palestine. He had not planned to minister again in Asia (Acts 20:25, 38). His three-month stay in Corinth during this trip would have given him time to compose Romans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The idea comes from the account of the seven appointed in Acts 6:1-6 to “serve tables.” The account does not call them “deacons,” and later we find Philip and Stephen involved in spiritual matters and operating beyond the local situation. Their work evidently progressed beyond the earlier or primary responsibility. So, the case is ambiguous for defining the role deacons fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE NEW TESTAMENT STRUCTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basic Structure&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This chapter sketches the original organization of the church in the New Testament. It determines what positions exercised authority and which were functions, all being places of service. The procedure works because it addresses an either-or matter and because authority includes function. We cannot suppose that a function seemed to be such only because the records happen to be insufficient to show that it was really an office. That would argue from silence and shift the burden of proof onto the negative. The negative burden would be impossible since the only available evidence would pertain to function, which is part of the larger concept: office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RECONSTRUCTION OF THE FOURFOLD CORINTHIAN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CORRESPONDENCE THEORY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 does not form the whole of the “previous letter.” It is not a unit that can stand on its own, so its beginning and end have been removed and then inserted where it does not fit very well. The reasons for considering these verses an interpolation are (1) that they do not tie closely to the surrounding context and (2) that if they are omitted, the flow of thought is smooth enough that a reader would not notice anything was missing. In relation to the first reason, we wonder why a redactor would put it in at this point if it does not fit with the context very well, especially after he had excised it from its original setting in a fashion that does not form a unit. If a redactor could insert a paragraph that was loosely connected, an author himself could do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DESTINATION AND DATE OF GALATIANS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DESTINATION AND DATE OF GALATIANS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main introductory problems associated with Galatians are its destination and date. Determining the destination affects the time frame for the date. Since the readers are called “Galatians” (3:1; cp. 1:2), the question is whether Paul uses the term to mean (1) the ethnic group of Gauls, who gave their name to the ancient Hellenistic kingdom, or (2) the citizens of the Roman province of Galatia. The “northern Galatia” theory refers to the first option; the “southern Galatia” theory indicates the second. By that time the Roman province extended farther south to include Lystra, Derbe, and Iconium, cities Paul and Barnabas evangelized on the first missionary tour. Northern Galatia was a less extensive territory in the mountainous inland area around Pessinus and Ancyra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Progressivism in the 1800s expressed itself in post-millennialism and in biblical criticism in the Tübingen school, which denied to Paul all his letters except four: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. German rationalism postulated a long upward development pattern that brought about the Christian literary canon as late as A.D. 180. In the 1900s, this extreme gave way to a more reasonable approach that did not see a need for 150 years to develop the New Testament documents. Some, like John A. T. Robinson went to the opposite extreme by saying that all the New Testament books could have existed by A.D. 70. World War I smashed the onward-and-upward hopefulness about humankind, and led to pre-millennialism eschatologically and a turn toward less extreme critical viewpoints in New Testament studies. The evolutionary framework is still presupposed, but Paul is usually allowed to have at least nine of the letters that ancient Christian writers assigned to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tychicus is the bearer, who will tell a definite readership about the affairs of Paul. The lack of detailed historical and geographical data is offset by its probable encyclical destination and its hortatory-doctrinal purpose. Furthermore, since Ephesians was published contemporary with Colossians and borne by the same messengers, historical details were not of such importance, being available from the bearers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The items below have implication for greater variety in style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Subject matter&#x9;&#x9;Complex problems tend to cause complex presentations. Certain (topic)&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;subjects call for special vocabulary. What we are trying to combat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;determines terminology: “faith and works” (Judaism), “fullness” (Gnosticism), priesthood (new subject). For the sake of meeting the minds of the ones we want to address, we use the vocabulary of the other in reference to our own subject so there can be a correlation of parts of thought systems, or functional equivalents. Becoming/being a Christian we might call a natural “high” because of the modern drug scene. Vocabulary generated by such circumstances will be peculiar to the circumstance (cp. “circumcision of the heart,” “fullness of the godhead,” “armor of salvation”).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW TESTAMENT STUDIES AND THE USE OF AMANUENSES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The majority of New Testament writings are letters, so we expect them to reflect practices in first-century letter writing. One custom was using an amanuensis, a stenographer who wrote down the contents. Biblical studies do not give this factor much attention even though New Testament writers used amanuenses. The oversight seems unusual to us today since most of us in the Western world write our own correspondence. If we do employ a secretary, it is primarily for computer skills. We are accustomed to reproducing by typeset, copiers, or computer printers. But ancient writers had to use different methods. If the work of an amanuensis can impact New Testament studies, we should allow that to affect our thinking where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FRAGMENTING PHILIPPIANS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Mood shift between 3:1 and 3:2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.  Basic questions: if a segment does not fit its context, why would an interpolator put it there; if it does fit its context, why regard it as an interpolation?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.  The interpolation in this case (as well as the cases of 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 and        2 Corinthians 10-13) does not form a unit. It is difficult to tell where such a document would end (3:19?; 4:1?; 4:3?).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A RATIONALE FOR THE STRUCTURE OF GENESIS 1:1-2:3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;christir.org&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Précis&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author of Genesis 1:1-2:3 presents a picture of creating earth and sky from the time viewpoint of Israel’s founding. Specific creative acts appear in a set analogous to the intended six-day-week-plus-Sabbath that God established at the same time for his special people. The presentation is topical without concern for exact sequence, duration, parallel entry, completeness, and necessary divisions. The sequence of creation itself can differ from the sequence of the presentation about creation in a sensible order. Analogy describes the connection between the creation of National Israel and the presentation about the creation of the universe (Isaiah 43:1ff). Inspiration guides and protects the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETING THE CREATION NARRATIVE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Interpretative Approach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1 uses the week as a literary device for organizing a topical presentation of God’s prominent creative activities. It is without strict concern for sequence and duration. While Genesis 1 uses the week as a literary device, Genesis 2-3 uses parable to organize important truths around historical persons. It is not necessarily that the events of Genesis 3 led to new effects after sin occurred; these characteristics of mankind and nature were put in place by God from the start. God knew beforehand that people would sin, and built factors into their situation that would limit the extent to which they could rebel and factors that would force them to recognize their dependent situation. This approach derives from Genesis several fundamental beliefs about God, people, nature, sin, and God’s connection to these aspects of the human circumstance. It stresses meaning (theological perspectives) over time (historical account).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MANAGING THE CREATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God maintains contact with his creation and control over it. Especially in contrast to deism, God did not create the universe and leave it to operate entirely according to built-in laws for self-perpetuation. God is actively involved with what he made. There is built-in NATURAL LAW such as gravity that apparently operates “on its own” now that God has set it up to work in a particular way. But in addition, there is SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION, where God enters the natural process and brings about results that would not have occurred had he not intervened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A prevalent idea in current religious studies is that Christianity as we know it became associated by way of historical process with the Roman government. The line of descent from Jesus that history preserved was that line of development, both as to its viewpoints and its literature. Petrine Christianity as represented by the Judaizers was the main contrast to Pauline Christianity and its international universalism. Government influence suppressed and destroyed the writings of “heretics” as measured by the preserved standard, and generally disenfranchised its people. So, the understanding of Jesus as well as the canonical literature that has descended to us results from historical processes and no more represent a “legitimate,” or true, understanding of Jesus than other traditions did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This view leaves open the possibility of eternal matter and, when in combination with a parabolic understanding of Genesis 1-11, poses no difficulties for a theistic evolutionary system. Observations against this view, however, include the following:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The simpler explanation more likely holds true (law of parsimony).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C.&#x9;The apostle moves back and forth from the elements of one teaching to the elements of the other, which he would presumably not do if writing to separate groups.

See herein “The Structure of Genesis-Deuteronomy.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comment about the Sabbath. 2:1-3 comes from a day when Sabbath observance had been enacted as a memorial of the exodus (Deuteronomy 5:12-15). The purpose of the Sabbath was to serve as a memorial of the exodus, when God “created” Israel (Isaiah 43:15, “I am Yahveh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel . . .”); the manner of observance correlated with God’s creative work: as a rest, weekly, at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It may have taken a while before Gnosticism was openly known to have certain features in its written or otherwise available representations.

This impulse correlates with (a) the stress on “scientific” method, taken to mean something that eliminates anything supernatural. There is a confusion between what a method can address and the idea that only those things exist which that method can address. The deistic impulse tries to foster an aura of philosophical legitimacy by claiming that (b) miracle would be a contradiction of natural law. The claim confuses contrary and contradictory, and different from opposite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOURCES OF THE PAULINE MATERIAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introductory Guidelines&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kinds of sources found in Pauline material are not only those that appear in literature generally, but those that fit the nature of scripture. This observation is not meant to prejudice research but to point out a consistency Christians expect to find in this study. So the first guideline is that (a) scripture is like what God himself would exhale. Presumably 2 Timothy 3:16 teaches that scripture as such is God-breathed as to its intended content. Sources and processes of origination for Pauline material correlate with the nature of scripture that issues from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISPENSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human history may be organized according to the ways God has operated with mankind. The accompanying diagram pictures that history in three periods, or “dispensations”: the patriarchal, Mosaic, and Christian. The patriarchal period is so called because during that era God operated through the heads of families, or “patriarchs.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God dispensed his grace through family heads all the way from the beginning up to the time when the Israelites left Egypt. The Mosaic period is so called because during that time God operated through the Law he gave through “Moses.” He called a nation to serve as a light to the other nations—the Gentiles. God worked in this fashion from Moses to Messiah, nearly 1500 years. Since the coming of Messiah, God has been dispensing his grace to individuals through “Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EXEGESIS AND THE GOSPELS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Change of covenants deals only with what people do. That is why (a) there is no change regarding the nature of things (ontological matters) or matters of history (events, including prophecy). (b) Civil and ceremonial observances fall out because national Israel (Moses) and the Old Testament priesthood (Aaron) have been replaced by the interpersonal church with its ministry and message. (c) There are few new ceremonial matters—baptism and the Lord’s Supper—that have come in with Christ. (d) Some modifications in the moral code come in with progressive revelation. Marriage expectancy shifts from polygamy and divorce-remarriage possibilities to permanent monogamy standard.

Readiness is an educational principle he observed in working to achieve his purpose of a new united mankind (Ephesians 2:15). Over the centuries he has increased people’s readiness for spiritual growth by (1) giving progressive revelation, (2) instituting present forms for later realities, and even (3) adopting human forms to serve as shadows of later substances. Establishing covenants illustrates this third use of readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PAUL VS. THE LAW OR THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some authors have suggested that Paul in his writings for the Gentile mission was opposing the tradition of the elders rather than the Mosaic Law itself. But the following factors look away from such a reading of Paul’s concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, (1) Paul objected to circumcising Gentiles. Circumcision was a practice related to the Law itself, not just to the tradition of the elders. The apostle was evidently countering the meaning of that rite itself, which had associations with Jewish nationalism. Beyond that, circumcision identified people with law since it identified them with the Mosaic Law. Consequently, circumcision had a soteriological implication: in theory it committed people to maintaining relationship with God by committing them to the principle of personal perfection (Leviticus 18:5; Deuteronomy 27:26), the point Paul makes in Galatians 3:8-14. Succeeding at personally doing everything required by law is exactly what none of us do or have been able to do in a practical sense; we have all sinned, and we continue to fall short of perfection—“the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Starting in spirit (that is, I think, with interpersonal processes with Christ) and trying to finish in flesh (law, perfection, nationality) attempts to mix contrary types of things in order to accomplish the righteousness that is prerequisite for being viewed as righteous, which in turn is prerequisite for fellowship with God. In effect, the Law was a yoke that neither first-century Jews nor their fathers were able to bear (Acts 15:10). It was the Law itself that was the yoke, not just the tradition of the elders, which built a hedge around it by making it stricter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Old Covenant was legal while the New Covenant is interpersonal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The former (L) was added to promise (IP) for a time to define and sensitize to sin till Christ (IP) would come for universal, permanent operation leading to (perhaps conceivable millennial “kingdom” before) the eternal state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Christian gospel came into redemptive history, the status and nature of the Mosaic Law came into question. Not only was this question relevant to Jews, but Gentiles also had to cope with it, because Christianity came out of a heritage different from their own. Christendom has witnessed five ways of dealing with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the law constitutionally (code and content) and adding the gospel to it. The law and the gospel are conceived of as two stages of the same thing; they are compatible. Among the Jews the approach received significant impetus during the early years of the Gentile mission. Judaizing missionaries received strong opposition from Paul and Barnabas in Antioch and eventually in Jerusalem at the Conference on Circumcision recorded in Acts 15. In Galatians, 2 Corinthians 3, and Romans, Paul vigorously opposed the concept primarily on soteriological grounds, but other matters were also implicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He flourished about A.D. 180 as president of the catechetical school in Alexandria, Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photius says that Pantaenus heard men who had seen the apostles.   Eusebius tells us that Julian, bishop of Alexandria, sent Pantaenus eastward as far as India as a missionary because of his piety and scholarship (Ecclesiastical History 5:10). Alexander, bishop of Alexandria about A.D. 212, highly commended him. (See Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History 6:14.) Eusebius himself and Jerome also speak of him as a learned, influential Christian leader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Matthew is next.) It has the longest Old Testament quotation of any book in the New Testament: 8:8-12 &amp;gt; Jeremiah 31:31-34.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author makes every major point from an Old Testament quotation. There is a deliberate exegetical pattern (especially Psalm 110:4). This pattern represents profound insight in exegesis rather than allegorical method of interpretation, as some suppose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SKETCH OF PROPOSITIONS AND PRESUPPOSITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;on the use of 2 Samuel 7:14 in Hebrews 1:5b&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.&#x9;While 2 Samuel 7:14 must refer to Solomon because Solomon so understood it (1 Kings 6:11-13; 8:17-21), it cannot refer exclusively to him since the context speaks of an eternal seed (2 Samuel 7:16).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II.&#x9;By the nature of the case, there can be only one universal eternal kingdom.  So Daniel 2:(35) 44; Psalm 89:27 + 4, 36; and therefore the universal kingdom of Psalm 2 (first quotation) and the eternal kingdom of Psalm 110 (last quotation) must all refer to the same thing as the eternal kingdom of 2 Samuel 7 (as well as Psalm 89; Isaiah 9; etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL INTRODUCTION TO JAMES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. External Citation and Authorship Evidence (see Salmon, pp. 473ff.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Origen is the earliest writer to refer to its words by name and to cite it as scripture (Commentary on John 7:1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.&#x9;Eusebius puts it among the disputed books but accepted it for himself (comm. in Psalm 56—work of an apostle—and Psalm 100 as scripture), referring to it as the first of the catholic epistles. Eusebius notes that jew ancients quoted it, but (Salmon) Eusebius may have overlooked less direct allusions to it: Salmon notes Shepherd of Hermas; Clement of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WISDOM LITERATURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament contains several literary genres:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;history (Acts)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;epistles (Romans-Hebrews, 1 Peter-3 John)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;apocalyptic (Revelation)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;wisdom literature (Sermon on the Mount, James, Jude).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Content&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wisdom literature has some affinities with law. They both deal with human behavior and so use the imperative mood extensively. Wisdom, however, is a larger category than law even as advice is larger than commandment. The accompanying diagram shows their relationship. Advice vs. commandment, opinion vs. faith and fact, procedure vs. fundamental morality represent distinctions between the two types of material. Advice and commandment differ as to intent and scope. The advice in wisdom literature is not interested just in what&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A LETTER ABOUT SEXUAL IDENTITY DISORDER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;xxxxx,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several days ago your letter came, revealing your struggles with sexual identity disorder and what you have proposed to do about the matter. You will not be surprised, I am sure, to find a concerned ear for you in the situation you are handling, but you will not find a sympathetic ear for what you are contemplating doing with it. There is a distinction between the disorder itself and what a person proposes to do with it. The disorder may be understandable; what people decide to do with it is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That’s how you’re to remove evil from Israel.” Lev 20:10; Deut 22:22&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;23“If a virgin is engaged, and another man lies with her, 24take them both to the city gate and stone them to death—the girl, because she didn’t scream in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor’s wife. That’s how you’re to remove evil from Israel.” Deut 22:23-24 (engaged woman)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANS AND TEMPORAL AUTHORITIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In non-Christian societies, people wonder whether they can continue in their jobs if they become Christians. The minister of a new congregation in Moscow asked about that issue. A policeman had asked whether he would have to quit his job if he accepted Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A policeman would not have to give up his source of income in accepting Christ. Paul states the principle in 1 Corinthians 7:20: “Let people stay in the calling where they were when they were called.” Paul is addressing marriage issues, but he is drawing on a broader principle because he also connects it with slavery (7:21-24) and circumcision (7:18-19). Christianity is transcultural and trans-vocational; it has no racial, social, marital, economic, societal, or vocational association.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON DIVORCE: MATTHEW 5:32&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone that puts away his wife—except for sexual immorality—treats* her like an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For purposes here, we pass over some technicalities associated with the aorist passive infinitive (μοιχευθῆναι, moicheuthēnai, “makes her to be adulterated[?]”) and deal with more straightforward considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus teaches that divorce is contrary to God’s original intention for marriage. Marriage is no longer the way it was under the Mosaic Law, where a husband could legally divorce his wife even if she had not been unfaithful. No longer could he, for example, use divorce to avoid adultery—divorce his wife to marry “the other woman.” Such a thing amounts to adultery in motive and attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ETHICS AND THE GOLDEN RULE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treating other people the way we want to be treated implies the fundamental continuity of humankind. Variations between people do exist, but they do not normally deal with matters that impinge on ethical considerations. Supposing the continuity of human nature as the background for the Golden Rule is preferable to supposing that the Golden Rule describes a non-content procedure, the approach of R. M. McIver, “The Deep Beauty of the Golden Rule” in Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, pp. 233-39.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Lewis has Dr. Cecil Dimble telling his wife that polygamy was not wrong for Abraham. That comment seems misleading, but it does raise the question about standards. There seems to be more than one way of speaking of an “ethical standard.” There is (a) the ideal standard, the one that God has always had in mind for everyone everywhere. The ideal standard is based on the originating purpose of God before creation. PURPOSE&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MIXED MARRIAGE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture says so much about marriage because it is a universal experience. Besides, it is an intense experience. Married life calls for more skill and understanding than other relationships. It is harder than living alone because it is more complicated, especially when children enter the picture. It is harder than being a good neighbor, getting along with people at work, or even living together in the community of faith. Marriage affects the full range of life rather than just some aspects of it (total). The actions of one partner likely affect the other, and marriage involves a degree of intimacy. We find it possible—and even fulfilling—to relate to many people in varying degrees of “distance” or “closeness,” but in marriage there is no “distance,” and nothing is hidden. Besides, marriage is all the time whereas work is only part of the waking hours and not every day. Marriage is exclusive of all other relationships; its distinctives are not experienced with anyone else. Finally, marriage is permanent while other relationships are not necessarily for life. In a universal, total, permanent, exclusive relationship, it is imperative that the partners share at least the basic values by which marriage operates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRIMARY FACTORS IN ETHICAL THEORY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary Factors&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions about specific moral matters depend on what framework we use when we think about them. Several fundamental constructs set limits on how Christians should act. The factors involved help us interpret scripture correctly when it does address moral issues we face. Those factors are particularly vital when we have to generalize biblical standards to questions that special revelation does not address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first primary framework focuses on start-up factors that impact human behavior:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RESPONDING TO ETHICAL RELATIVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relativity in ethics seems sensible because (a) incompatible moral beliefs and practices exist, and (b) no one seems able to establish a universal basis for ethical theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response to the second point, (1) the presence of a universal God (creator, sustainer, intervener) provides that universal basis. It does so because he had purpose in creating and if he has created us in his image. Furthermore, (2) human nature is universal for humans. We should not do what is contrary to human nature physically, psychologically, and socially; we should practice what enhances well-being, peace, and unity under God’s values. Presumably there is a hierarchy of what yields greater or lesser satisfaction, gratification, peace, and happiness, according to how well actions correlate with the givens of human nature—matters like the desire to be loved, the drive for worth, the urge for security, the impulse for innocence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOME VALUES OF LOVE AS AN ETHICAL PRINCIPLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love gets us past legal minimums of do’s and don’t’s. It provides a basis for going beyond the call of duty, takes into consideration other people’s differing preferences, watches out for negative effects on weaker brothers’ behavior, and concerns itself with good and better, not just with good and bad. Love fosters a concern for enhancing the quality of other people’s lives, not just with the rightness or wrongness of specific behaviors relative to some standard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRAY NOTATIONS ON THE COMPLEXITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethics and morality relate to the interpersonal realm, with humankind. Since persons in relationship constitutes the most complex reality there is, ethics is a complex discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. The complexity of ethical theory comes from the fact that several principles determine right and wrong, and these principles are not of equal value. There is a plurality of unequal principles. Purpose, relationship, and nature are three primary factors that form the morality matrix; but subsidiary ones come into the picture as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Choice does come into the picture; it comes in the mother’s behaviors prior to the pregnancy. We have no right to take out on the baby our own sexual irresponsibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL INTRODUCTION TO 2 JOHN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Authorship&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.  External&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The external attestation to 2 John is not so strong as that for 1 John. Absence of citations from the book may have been due to its subject matter. It is significant that the objections to apostolic authorship come from the later Christian writers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.  Internal&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term “the Elder” (v. 1) is appropriate for any older man of any office, especially since by the time of its writing, the apostle John was probably the only living apostle. “Elder” among the Jews was applied to leaders at (1) the synagogue level, but also at (2) the city level and (3) the national level. By analogy it appears that “elder” could have been applied to local units but also to the whole “nation” (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; cp. Philemon 9?). So it could designate the ultimate leadership within any level (John, Peter, Paul?). The expression “apostles and elders” (Acts 15:2) is significant in this respect. Could it mean elders in general with the apostles as specially marked among them? A slightly different arrangement terminologically would have the apostles as “apostles” of the universal church and at the same time (some of) the “elders” of the Jerusalem church. The passage in Eusebius that contains Papias’ statement (Ecclesiastical History 3:39:4) introduces all the apostles as “elders.” So a distinction between the apostle John and an elder John is not necessary in view of Papias’ use of the words. Note also 1 Peter 5:1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITICAL INTRODUCTION TO 3 JOHN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Authorship&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is uncertain whether there is any evidence for 3 John ‘s being cited before the third century, if the Muratorian Canon speaks only of two epistles of John. This lack of citation and mention is understandable because of its brevity and the character of its contents. What was said of “the Elder” in connection with 1 John applies here also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. Destination&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A FORMAT FOR THINKING ABOUT FEET WASHING</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A FORMAT FOR THINKING ABOUT FEET WASHING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washing feet comes up in three New Testament texts. (a) Luke 7:44 refers to it in an episode about a sinful woman who anointed Jesus’ feet with ointment, wet them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair (7:36-50). (b) Among characteristics of widows enrolled in the church’s benevolence program, Paul lists “washing the saints’ feet” together with parenting, showing hospitality to strangers, and works of Christian living (1 Timothy 5:10). (c) In the upper room the night of his betrayal, Jesus washed his disciples’ feet (John 13:1-16). The last text has prompted some Christians to consider feet washing an ordinance like communion and baptism—or as a part of the communion observance. The paragraphs below analyze this view, giving special attention to the reasoning that seems natural to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“IN THE DAYS OF THOSE KINGS”: DANIEL 2:44&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Daniel 2:44 those kings [מֶלֶךְ] seems to refer to the preceding four kingdoms [מַלְכוּ] of 2:38-43. Daniel uses kingdom and king somewhat interchangeably in that king can by metonymy stand for the realm he rules, even though over a period of time there may be several kings in one kingdom. In 2:39 the writer says, “And after you, Nebuchadnezzar, will arise another kingdom inferior to you.” A similar shift of terms comes in 2:44, “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom . . . it will break all these kingdoms in pieces and consume (them).” Later in 7:17 the four beasts from the sea (7:3; earth, 7:17) are said to represent four kings, whereas 7:23 says that “the fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom that will be different from all the kingdoms.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANIMAL SYMBOLISM IN BIBLICAL APOCALYPTIC&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within prophecy generally, apocalyptic has several distinguishing characteristics. As to content, apocalyptic deals with eschatological reference, angelic emphasis, cataclysm, universal-cosmic scope, pessimism in people, divine sovereignty, transcendence, the concept of final comfort. As to form, apocalyptic uses animal symbolism and numerology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In chronological order the apocalyptic passages in scripture are Isaiah 24-27 (+ 6); Ezekiel 33-48 especially; Daniel 2, 7-12; Zechariah generally (although in many places the book is non-apocalyptic prophecy); the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24-25, Mark 13, and Luke 21; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-5:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12; and the Book of Revelation generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APPROACHING THE MILLENNIAL ISSUE WITH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MINISTRY IN MIND&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding end times, we can learn a lesson from Jewish religious leaders of Jesus’ day. They had so exactly worked out their understanding of Messianic prophecy that they did not recognize the Messiah when he came. We will not be that wrong this time. We will recognize him, because his return will not be a local, private entrance into the human sphere (Matthew 24:23-27). Nevertheless, we need to hold tentatively to our expectations about the timing of that event, about its relationship to other future events, and about the very nature of some related events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

An Unnecessary Concept&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the assumption, for the moment, that eternal opportunity for salvation through Christ could not be disproved, we should consider several matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Other preferable observations adjust our understanding of hell so that eternal option is unnecessary. A big impetus for the doctrine of eternal option comes from the apparent impropriety of a loving God torturing sinners endlessly in hell for no remedial purpose; punitive purpose seems not to call for such severity if punishment should be commensurate with the crime. Several factors reduce the urgency of this “problem.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE DOCTRINE OF “SOUL-SLEEPING”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Views of the human condition during the intermediate state differ as to whether it is a conscious existence. Conscious existence means that between death and the general resurrection, we experience the rewards and punishments later to be publicly declared at the great white throne judgment. Unconsciousness during that time has two possibilities: “soul sleeping” or non-existence. The second option means that when we die, we cease to exist objectively until God “recreates” us out of his memory, an event simultaneous with, or the same as, resurrection. For all practical purposes, soul sleeping amounts to the same thing though, strictly speaking, we do objectively exist. The following considerations go into evaluating the concept of “soul sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE OLIVET DISCOURSE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two related questions may be asked regarding Matthew’s account of the Olivet Discourse. (1) Who or what is the “abomination of desolation” in 24:14? (2) If some events are still future, where is the dividing line between the ones now fulfilled and the ones still to come? All three synoptists record this sermon: Matthew 24-25; Mark 13; and Luke 21.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since answering the second question determines the answer to the first, we need to establish the dividing line between past and future events first. A harmony of the accounts helps track the progress of thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE SEVENTY-WEEK PROPHECY OF DANIEL 9&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. The beginning time for the seventy “weeks/hebdomads” is best placed at the first year&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus (538 B.C.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. &#x9;The word/commandment that goes forth in 9:25 seems to be the same as the word/&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;commandment that went forth in 9:23a.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The terminology is the same: “the going forth of the commandment” (מֹצָא דָבָר) in 9:25 is parallel to “the commandment went forth” (יָצָא דָבָר) in 9:23. (In appropriate circumstances דָּבָר may be translated “commandment”: Exodus 34:28; Joshua 1:13; 1 Chronicles 26:32; Esther 1:19, etc.) In 9:23 there may be another reference to the same thing in the expression “consider the commandment” (בִּין בַּדָּבָר), although usually the word דָּבָר is translated “matter” or some other indefinite way here. Gabriel may be telling Daniel to understand the outworking of this word of God that has been decreed (9:24) on Israel and Jerusalem. The vision (מַרְאָה) of 9:23b is then in reference to the whole of 9:24-27.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FOREKNOWLEDGE AND SIN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God’s reasons for creating us are summarized under divine self-fulfillment (delight), goodness (grace), glory and betterment. Of these four reasons the first and last are personal while the other two are interpersonal. The first two are the reasons for people; the third is the purpose of people beyond themselves. If we speak strictly about the purpose of people, we focus attention on God’s goodness and on what grow out of it, particularly dominion and commission. Self-fulfillment highlights the unnecessitated satisfaction that moves persons to express themselves. Goodness roughly corresponds with God-to-man action; glory corresponds with man-to-God re-action. We say “roughly” because we cannot draw a sharp line between these aspects, which is exactly what we expect in the highly complex, reciprocating, transacting activity that interpersonal process involves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GOD KNOWN AS “HE”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GOD KNOWN AS “HE”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture consistently characterizes God in masculine terms. At the grammatical level, that pattern expresses itself in Hebrew masculine pronouns, adjectives, and verbs. “She” never designates the God Yahveh in any book of either testament.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the noun אלהים, “God/god,” does rarely refer to a goddess (1 Kings 11:33, Ashtoreth), but that never happens with the God of Israel. Not only do masculine pronouns refer to אלהים—and all his other designations—but Hebrew verbs with it carry masculine gender terminations. (Hebrew verbs have gender in the second and third persons.) Masculine adjectives likewise modify אלהים. This characterization holds true for Greek texts as well, which show θεός in the New Testament and the Greek translation of the Old Testament (LXX).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That procedure minimizes problems created by figurative language, the various meanings that words like “one” can have, and the possibility of accommodation to our mode of thinking and being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE PROBLEM OF EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ANTILOGISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Supposedly only two of these points of the antilogism may be affirmed at any one time. The solution to an antilogism comes by adding new factors, which implies that one of the factors is not an absolute bereft of circumstantial qualifications. Evil is not an absolute, and neither are the other two characteristics. As omnipotence is qualified by holiness, all three of these points are qualified by love. Love, for example, may allow free will to be used to do evil rather than stifle every attempt to misuse free will. The most important consideration in the presentation below is that a larger category surrounds the antilogism—the interpersonal one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is probably enough here to founder a good-sized horse, but that is the risk you take when you raise a good question that is at the same time complex and controversial. The first attachment I wrote up new as a second-level treatment of the trinity issue as I have come to see it. The other two attachments are more elaborate because they are lifted from my notes on Christian Doctrine, a course I taught at Manhattan Christian College for many years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VIEWS OF DEITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God/god refers to ultimate reality. Christianity views God as eternal, ethical interpersonality with certain other knowable attributes. In contrast, the ancient nations around Israel as well as peoples living in modern times have concepts of deity that are incompatible with the biblical understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Theism. A general term for belief in God, usually considered transcendent and personal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.&#x9;Atheism. The disbelief in the existence of any deity. All reality has one level, non-theistic. God is not a direction-setting aspect within the universe (panentheism, theistic naturalism), nor is he transcendent to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The difficulties that have arisen in teaching, practice, and experience have resulted from depersonalizing God or people and from de-interpersonalizing Christian experience. Christianity addresses persons in relationship both vertically and horizontally because that is the most encompassing, most basic, and most complex reality we participate in. The Christian faith is distorted if it degenerates into impersonal experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The non-miraculous must be in place before the miraculous becomes possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.&#x9;The miraculous is a non-essential, non-uniform add-on, whereas the interpersonal, non-miraculous is uniform for all Christians, everywhere, in any age. The second tier does not have to be added on, and when it is added on it is not added on for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE PURPOSE OF MANKIND:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Section I: God’s Delight&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given his nature, God decided on certain purposes. In light of those purposes, he made the creation, including humankind. So God made the nature of man the way he did because of the purposes he had for us in his creation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God made mankind simply because he delighted in doing so. Aside from any further considerations, persons experience fulfillment in being creative. The same holds for our personal God. Because of sheer delight, God expressed himself creatively and “saw that it was good.” That recurring statement in Genesis 1 expresses his sense of satisfaction in doing so (Genesis 1:31; cp. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). In that respect, God created us for something of the same reason he made the rest of creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNITY AND DIVERSITY IN THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By creation, all human persons have the image of God, which means they have the interpersonal capacity and equal inherent worth. Since the image exists at the individual level, we must view the created variants as “modes of the image.” Sex, race, size, intelligence, athletic ability, physique, age, and the like do not affect inherent worth and can therefore have no place in our attitude toward ourselves or other people. We do not have to be married to participate in the image, we do not have to become Jews to be a favored people, we do not have to speak English to be part of the kingdom, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THINKING ABOUT GOD’S WILL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asking whether something that happened was God’s will, depends on what the question means. There are two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what God causes/what he makes happen (prescriptive will) and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what he allows to happen (permissive will).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What he causes starts with him; he initiates it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What he allows starts outside of him; something/someone else initiates it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a difference between supernatural intervention and natural cause. In the first case, God directly does what occurs; in the second case, he allows built-in laws to carry things forward; he is working “indirectly.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTATIONS ON GENERAL REVELATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Terminology&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;General revelation refers to natural experiences in the natural universe. Special revelation refers to what comes through visible divine intervention into the natural. The former deals with nature, natural processes, natural events, and can include social processes, human history, subjective experience. The latter deals with supernatural intervention that a person can recognize as supernatural because it does not occur naturally. Intervention labels what God causes beyond what natural process produces. It refers to supernatural occurrences and their meaning given through special revelation. For us, special revelation centers on the revelation preserved in scripture. General revelation comes through the aspects of reality that science studies. Special revelation comes through scripture and involves inspiration. General revelation serves as the basis of philosophy, which uses reason to “discover” truth from experience. Special revelation is the basis for theology, which uses reason to “understand” truth in light of experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE RELATIONSHIP OF GENERAL REVELATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO THEISTIC PHILOSOPHY IN ROMANS 1-2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpreters commonly take Romans 1:18ff as an instance where Paul lays out the theistic argument. Then they conclude that it is possible to establish the existence of the one infinite, true God and certain of his attributes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes that Paul is not presenting an argument for God’s existence based on general revelation. Rather, he declares from special revelation the lostness of all people, against whom God’s wrath is revealed. Romans 1:18ff views collective humanity from the creation till the coming of the gospel. He presents (1) a collective anthropological viewpoint (2) in a revelational framework (3) from a total historical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ADDED NOTATIONS ON SABBATH OBSERVANCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discussions with seventh-day Christians include five questions. (1) The first question asks for the scripture basis for “changing” Saturday to Sunday as the day of observance. That question miswords the issue. It “begs the question” by assuming that the issue involves a change from one day to the other. Our approach notes that Sabbath was a memorial of the exodus, a Jewish national holiday; so there is no basis for Sabbath observance outside the context of Jewish national life. There will be no “scripture basis” for “changing” from Sabbath to Sunday, because there was no “change.” The two items are not in series but in parallel. The two days have different meanings relative to different “nations” and different founding events. It is not a matter of one continuing entity changing one of its national holidays from one day to another. Since this matter relates to the change of covenants, consult the essay entitled “Old Testament Covenants and the Messianic Covenant.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUNDAY WORSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Worship on Saturday after sundown&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament we encounter the Jewish custom of reckoning days from sundown to sundown as distinguished from the Roman reckoning from midnight to midnight. The question sometimes comes up whether Christians today could have church on Saturday evening instead of Sunday morning and/or Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do not conceive of Sunday as beginning at dark the night before. It is doubtful that we would be associating Saturday evening with the Lord’s resurrection day. It would still be, as we say, Saturday evening. Of course, not all Christian gatherings have to associate the time of gathering with the time of his resurrection; but it is most appropriate to incorporate that association into the “stated” gathering time. All clear passages about the time of gathering in the New Testament place it on Sunday rather than some other day. Meeting on the day of his resurrection was consistent enough that “the Lord’s Day” (κυριακὴ ἡμέρα) became a designation for the first day of the week (Revelation. 1:10).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE SABBATH AS A MEMORIAL OF THE EXODUS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Sabbath observance was not a memorial of the creation. If it were, it would have been observed as long as this creation stands: from the beginning, by all nations, till the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. The Sabbath is a memorial only of the exodus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;A memorial will not be a memorial of two unrelated events. The emphasis here is on realities. The creation and the Sabbath are both associated with the week, but they are not related by their nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“FRIENDS” OR “SONS”? IMPLICATIONS FOR PERSEVERANCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“He’s God’s friend.” That is about the nicest thing a person can say about someone. In the mouth of God himself, Isaiah says, “Abraham, my friend” (Isaiah 41:8; cp. James 2:23; 2 Chronicles 20:7). Friendship implies several things about our relationship to God. Jesus tells us what he is doing—revelation (John 15:15); so “friend” better describes us than “slave” or “servant” does. Besides, he cares about us—a lot, enough even to die an excruciating death for us (John 15:13-15; Romans 5:6-8, etc.). That implies doing for us whatever else we need and cannot do for ourselves; that is what a friend does (Romans 8:32; 1 John 3:17). Friendship with God separates us from people that are at cross purposes with him: “Friendship with the world is enmity with God” (James 4:4); so we have the same values and purposes that he does. Experience shows us a number of points that help us understand what ideal friendship is like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASPECTS OF HUMAN RIGHTEOUSNESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Goodness has several aspects. In relation to a standard, goodness is humanly measurable behavior relative to the divine ideal—as to its “letter” and its “spirit.” As to the behavior, goodness is the overt behavior (which tends to correlate with what is humanly measurable) but the motive, attitude, and character—generalized pattern vs. specific act. As to the setting, goodness has a subjective and objective aspect. As to the kind of interpersonal behavior, there is morality, wisdom, and ministry. These dimensions of goodness are detailed under the headings below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PREDESTINATION IN SHORT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choice, act, consequence (free vs. fixed)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The choice itself is free, but the act is not necessarily free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The act may be free, but the consequences are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Permeable, semi-permeable, impermeable&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We choose our thought (permeable limit), but God may intervene between our choice and its fulfillment (semi-permeable; Abraham’s choice to sacrifice Isaac).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We may fulfill our chosen act, but God determines the consequences (impermeable).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The principle is true for individual acts, the sum total of life, and the whole of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRESENTING THE GOSPEL TO “THE GOOD MORAL MAN”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you do with a man like “Bob”? He really is a “good guy.” A happy, outgoing person that is glad to see you and always willing to stop and talk. Several years ago he quit a good-paying job so he could spend more time working with his only son, who became a successful race-car driver in our part of the country. One day he told me, “When I was a kid, my dad never had any time to do things with me. I’m not going to be that way with ‘Earl.’” I don’t know that I ever heard him use a “cuss” word. He gets along well with his wife . . . As far as Christ is concerned, what do you do with a man like “Bob”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SHORTENING UP THE STUDY OF SALVATION FROM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the Bible Says About Salvation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since What the Bible Says About Salvation is rather long, using it in a church setting requires reducing it somewhat. There are two ways to reduce the amount of material and get at it more efficiently. First, use only the positive presentations (instead of looking at the alternative beliefs together with the reasons for and against them). Second, use the booklet Questions and Answers on “What the Bible Says About Salvation” on just the chapters (or parts of chapters chosen from the text itself).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE NATURE OF SALVATION</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE NATURE OF SALVATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Salvation as reconciliation is the most distinctive feature of Christianity. Herein lies the primary difference between the gospel, on the one hand, and the Law, wisdom literature, and the prophets, on the other. In this respect, Christianity differs from the purposes of previous divine economies and from the goals of other religions and human agendas. In Christ, God is concerned with more than letting people know that he exists, what he is like, what his moral standards are, and what his expectancies are within his purposes. Salvation is not simply from ignorance, as by revelation; it is not deliverance from physical existence as in Gnosticism and Eastern dualism; it is not a deliverance from individuality as in Hinduism. Salvation is reconciliation from alienation and from all the negatives that come from separation from God and other people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE UNEVANGELIZED ELECT?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Notion in a Nutshell: An Opinion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The diagram above takes its cue from Paul’s comments in Romans 2. God can judge unevangelized people on the basis of where their conscience has properly led them, the shaded area in the diagram. For practical purposes in that non-standard situation, God can disregard honest ignorance—where the conscience has misled and where it has omitted the rest of what Christianity stands for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TWO RESPONSES TO SIN</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TWO RESPONSES TO SIN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sin involves two issues that correspond to the two sides of a sin situation. There is the doing of a moral wrong and the reacting to a moral wrong. Because sin takes place between people, there is the person who does evil and the one who suffers evil. In resolving that circumstance, repentance happens on one side and forgiveness happens on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What happens, though, when there is no repentance? The basic principle seems to be that “where there is no repentance there is no forgiveness.” What people have done in the past they would do again unless they have changed, or “repented.” Without a change of mind, a change of heart, a change of resolve to behave differently, they are the same as they were when they sinned. Since “sin separates,” the separation continues because nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;x x x x,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your presentation follows the pattern used by Roman Catholic missionaries and many others, where general revelation (through nature) and theistic proofs bring someone to belief in God, his eternality, omnipotence, and other natural attributes. Special revelation adds a saving knowledge of God through Christ as holy, good, and loving (through history regarding God’s moral attributes). The first format has its precursor in Paul’s Areopagus speech; the second step follows Gamaliel’s argument in Acts 5, a resurrectiono-centric format in which the existence of the church and the fact of Jesus’ resurrection stand or fall together: the church exists; therefore, the resurrection occurred, Christ’s claim are true because resurrection is supernatural, and miracle confirms the claims of the miracle worker, etc. In the modern day, that two-step process has been enhanced by increased awareness of the complexity of nature with its accompanying tendency away from the likelihood that gradual change could explain chemistry-to-man by “endogenous complexification,” upward increase in complexity only by factors inside the natural order. Natural evolution replaces the need—not the fact/disproof—of supernatural deity; so it has become the apparent option for replacing the creationist model. A relevant observation, I might add, is that it is not possible to put in sequence the origin of reciprocating parts (especially for the level of observable complexity culminating in human social relationships).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“BEYOND THE JORDAN”:  A PHRASE IN QUESTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond the Jordan” is a recurring biblical phrase that requires detailed study. It has relevance to locating unknown places like “the threshing floor of Atad” in Genesis 50:10, 11. In this reference “beyond the Jordan” occurs twice as an explanatory note for the position of the threshing floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions arise as to whether the geographical note carries a consistent meaning, what that usage is, whether more than one consistency may be involved, and whether there are sufficient clear usages to determine its significance in ambiguous cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“FRIENDS OF GOD”: THE STARTING PLACE FOR ALL THINGS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THEOLOGICAL AND PRACTICAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“He is a friend of God.” That is about the best thing a person can say about someone. In the mouth of God himself, Isaiah says, “Abraham my friend” (Isaiah 41:8; cp. James 2:23; 2 Chronicles 20:7). In scripture, friendship implies several things about relationship to God. Jesus tells us what he is doing: revelation (John 15:15); so friends better describes us than slaves or servants does. Besides, he cares about us—a lot, enough even to die voluntarily an excruciating death for us (John 15:13-15; Romans 5:6-8, etc.). That implies doing for us whatever else we really need and cannot do for ourselves; that is what a friend does (Romans 8:32; 1 John 3:17). Friendship with God separates us from people that are at cross purposes with him: “Friendship with the world is enmity with God” (James 4:4; 1 John 2:15); so we have the same values and purposes that he does. Experience tells us what ideal friendship is like and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“GOD-BREATHEDNESS” AS THE CHARACTER OF SCRIPTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A series of words has traditionally stated from various angles the character of scripture in positive and negative terms. The list begins with the biblical expression in 2 Timothy 3:16, which translates literally as (1) “God-breathed.” The rather unhappy term in popular vogue for this passage is “inspired”; so “inspiration” becomes the corresponding noun for getting at the concept Paul expressed in the text. “Inspire,” however, does not properly picture the idea because it (a) creates the image of breathing into something the characteristic the word denotes—as when God “breathed into Adam the breath of life” and he became something more than he was. Such imagery limits the meaning of the text to what can add to something already there. The word picture in God-breathedness is that of “exhaling” the thing itself, so the scripture is regarded as issuing directly from God’s mouth. Scripture stands apart from all other writing by being viewed as God’s direct speaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(2) JAMES: CONVICTION CONVERTED TO WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the history of Christian thought, two opposite tendencies have plagued the church with respect to human obedience in salvation. From Jewish circles especially, the early decades of the Christian era saw strong influences to conceive of human action as producing relationship to God after the fashion of obedience under the Mosaic Law. The apostle Paul strenuously opposed that effort, especially in his letters to Rome and Galatia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(3) JAMES: SELF-DETERMINATION CONVERTED TO PRAYER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our prayer life most accurately indicates the level of our spiritual development. It is no surprise, then, to find James including encouragements about prayer in his letter to Christians beset by self-centeredness (1:5-8, 16-18; 4:2-3, 13-15; 5:13-18). They needed to convert their complaining, self-determination, and self-interest into prayer, dependence on God, and concern for one another. In this connection we have selected for special consideration the effectiveness of prayer, the importance of divine guidance, and the prayer ministry of elders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 TIMOTHY 2:8-15: SITUATIONAL OR GENERAL?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpreters have proposed several ways for removing from present observance of New Testament directives about male-female role relationship in the church and the home: 1 Timothy 2:8-15; 1 Corinthians 11:2-16; 14:33b-36; Colossians 3:18-19; and 1 Peter 3:1-7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way has been to (1) consider female deference a fallen condition (Genesis 3:16). Now that Christ has removed the curse, the principle no longer obtains. But the New Testament injunctions appear after Christ would have removed this supposed “curse.” Besides, “rule” (מָשַׁל, mashal) in Genesis 3:16 does not mean “rule” in some unwholesome sense as in a “cursed” estate; elders are to “rule well” in the church (1 Timothy 5:17; Hebrews 13:7, 17) and in the home (1 Timothy 3:4; cp. deacons in 3:11). Paul argues for female deference because the man was created first and the woman was deceived. In 1 Corinthians 11:7-9 the apostle adds that she was created from man and for man, and that Adam was created in the image of God (in some sense, degree, directness, or manner that Eve was not (cp. Genesis 2:21-23, 18).1 The five observations pertain to events that occurred before any fallen condition existed.2 Moreover, the other elements of the “fallen situation” in Genesis 3:14-21 have not been removed. Lastly, it is not a fallen condition that God is the head of Christ and that Christ is the head of every man, observations that Paul lays parallel to the man as the head of the woman (1 Corinthians 11:3; cp. Ephesians 5:23-24).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1 TIMOTHY 2:9-15&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Paul’s Intended Connection Between Genesis 2-3 and Women’s Roles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul appeals to the sequence of creation and the manner of the fall for his not allowing women to teach or to exercise authority over men. One inference is that (1) Paul appeals to Genesis to confirm, rather than to prove, the propriety of his custom; it is a post facto appeal rather than an a priori one. He says what he says by his own authority rather than because of a historical divine reason. His authoritative conclusion rests on some practical consideration rather than a theological one. Then cultural propriety can be the basis; so outside the first-century circumstance, it does not necessarily apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A MINISTER AND HIS FAMILY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New Testament qualifications for leadership deal not only with the person himself, but also with his domestic situation. Being qualified for ministry includes, then, how your wife and kids act and how you all relate to one another. The ongoing relationship within your family follows the reciprocal pattern characteristic of all social relationships. How you treat them affects how they treat you, and how they treat you affects how you treat them. Consequently, the burden does not fall just on the minister in the family. The emphasis here is, however, is on your side of the interaction. It stresses the fact that your relationship toward them is preliminary to how they subsequently enhance or detract from your ministry. Their actions do not wholly reflect how you have first loved them and their actions reflect other influences in their past and present lives, but there is a correlation between the quality of how you treat them and how they conduct themselves as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A MINISTER’S FILING SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will not remember! That is the bottom line when it comes to libraries and filing systems. The efficiency with which a minister discharges his responsibilities is directly proportionate to the degree of ready access he has to his materials. The quality of his work is determined by the extent to which he can organize and preserve the information that he generates and that comes to him from a wide range of sources. A person needs to organize his files because he will remember only a small percent of what he learns and needs to know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A TEACHING METHODOLOGY COMBINING APOLOGETICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WITH PERSONAL GROWTH AND WITNESSING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Apologetics” deals with multiple components that combine in produce faith and growth in it. The conviction is that the structure of apologetics correlates with the process of evangelism and the pattern of personal growth. Evangelism looks at this matter from the standpoint of the communicator and sees it as communication; apologetics looks at it from the viewpoint of the hearer and experiences it as conversion; personal growth looks at it from the perspective of a believer and realizes it more and more as sanctification. What is seen, however, is the same thing. The accompanying diagram depicts the structure of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABBREVIATED TIME&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture does not readily adapt itself to the eons of time projected for accomplishing what evolutionary theory postulates, particularly in the biosphere. With varying degrees of likelihood, certain possibilities might push the date A.M. beyond the 4000 + B.C. minimum reading of scripture as in fiat creationism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. &#x9;Possibilities for Elongation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. &#x9;Time prior to Genesis 1:2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proposed relationships between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2ff&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a. &#x9;Genesis 1:1 as a caption for the subsequent creation account&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT OF CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO WOMEN’S STUDIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something must explain why equally committed Christians come out on different sides of the same issue from the same Bible. It is either because of (1) unconscious presuppositions, (2) faulty reasoning, (3) misunderstanding of how language works, or (4) inadequate concept inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following notations attempt to (a) map out the issues, (b) isolate the relevant interpretation principles, (c) define the exegetical task, and (d) identify the biblical texts most involved. They also try to (e) narrow down the point at issue so that irrelevant matters are set aside so that what we are sure of can lessen the practical problem in the church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ADDITIONAL THOUGHT ON WOMEN’S STUDIES</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ADDITIONAL THOUGHT ON WOMEN’S STUDIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Ministry Before Consensus”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some additional questions arise from previous presentations on women’s studies. For one thing, I have used “ministry” in the title of a paper that centered on leadership in relation to women&amp;rsquo;s roles. “Ministry” is broader than leadership, but leadership is the area in which disagreement about women&amp;rsquo;s roles has arisen. One way to help resolve controversial issues is to appeal to the larger category in which they stand. A title about “ministry” is useful on this subject because women are clearly free to make significant contributions to kingdom work; the question is whether they are free to make contributions in formal leadership ministry over men. Ministry as the larger category sets the context for leadership ministry. Any distinctive elements in the latter must be added in such a way as not to contradict the larger framework. The thesis in “Ministry Before Consensus” has been that we can carry forward the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s work significantly and with minimal negatives even before we resolve the problem. We can do that if we keep the problem clearly defined, if we keep it from spilling over into foreign issues, and if we maintain a proper understanding of Christian leadership. Women&amp;rsquo;s formal and informal Christian leadership ministry needs to conform to Christian leadership ministry generally, Christian leadership ministry needs to take place in a way that harmonizes with Christian ministry, and Christian ministry of every sort must retain the characteristics of interpersonal process. Since it is ministry that we want to get done, ministry is the subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ANALYSIS OF AUGUSTINE’S DOCTRINE OF EVIL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS OF AUGUSTINE’S DOCTRINE OF EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view of mankind common in evangelicalism descends from Augustine of Hippo. His early efforts in philosophy centered on the problem of evil. Although he spent his earliest years under the influence of Catholic Christianity, he left that background to become an Auditor for nine years in a Gnostic-like sect that followed the teachings of Mani. At first, Manichaeism seemed to him to explain the problem by teaching that evil and good are two kinds of substances. They have become intermingled in mankind so that “salvation” consists of separating good from its mixture with evil. Because of internal inconsistencies that Augustine came to see in this dualistic philosophy, he eventually left it and returned to Christianity. The problem of evil stood at the beginning of his development as a philosopher-theologian; its solution stood near the center of the theological system he formulated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APOLOGETICS AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Promoting and Defending the Faith)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism characterizes the defense of the Christian faith in three ways. First is its need-answer-use that persons have for what Christianity offers. Apologetics—the defense of the faith—takes place in a reciprocating pattern around three poles: (1) a person’s present sense of need, (2) the conceptual and past historical basis for answering that need, and (3) the present verification through experience of the behavioral and existential correlates in that answer. The verification by experience can come back around to qualify present perception of need and to assist in the awareness of what scripture means by what it says. The process incorporates a need-answer-use triangular format that can move back and forth as well as begin at any one of the three poles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ARRANGING A MINISTER&amp;rsquo;S SCHEDULE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. The Nature and Purpose of a Schedule&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minister&amp;rsquo;s schedule is not structured so automatically as most people&amp;rsquo;s schedules are. Larger congregations with multiple staffs may foster developing a schedule pattern more like that of a business, but most churches do not lend themselves naturally to such an arrangement. Ministry is highly open-ended with many different kinds of activities. Furthermore, it varies so much from day to day and week to week and can involve all hours of the day and night. The “work-week hours” do not form so definite a block of time. For this last reason a minister should deliberately schedule his professional and non-professional activities. If he does not scheduling deliberately, before long the professional side of his work can take over the non-professional (or conceivably vice versa) and become overwhelming, or the professional part can get lopsided in favor of certain things–things wherein skills are best and interests are greatest or things in which “the tyranny of the urgent/immediate” takes over. Under these conditions laying out a minister’s schedule is both difficult and essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BODY AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The material realm does not stand in opposition to the spiritual realm but in subordination to it. That arrangement can be the case because the material realm derived by creation from the spiritual, or personal, one. Our bodies, then, stand in a subordinate relation to ourselves/spirits/personhood as the creation does to God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the body is not to be depreciated as in Gnostic thought, deprived as in asceticism, glorified as in humanism, or satiated as in Epicureanism. It is not to be made the whole picture as in materialism. It is to be subordinated in Christianity. This arrangement Paul calls “possessing the vessel” (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4; cp. 2 Corinthians 4:7; 1 Peter 3:7; 1 Corinthians 9:27; Romans 8:13; 12:1, 2). The body is the instrument by which people express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ATTITUDES TOWARD SUFFERING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not so much the suffering itself that determines whether we can handle it; it is the attitude we take toward it. Because of the great amount of persecution and suffering endured by God’s people over the centuries, the Bible gives a lot of advice on how to think about pain to deal with it effectively. Major portions of scripture that deal with suffering-pain-calamity-death are Job, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Peter. Cross references from these books lead to other shorter sections on this difficult subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BAPTISM AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of standard procedure, baptism is an act of personal identification with Jesus Christ, which means commitment to his lordship, values, and purposes. In consequence of that identity with Christ, God forgives sin, gives his Spirit, and adds us to the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nature of Baptism&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary fact about Christian baptism is that it is an (1) interpersonal act. It is done by a person in a relationship with another person for personal purposes. In personal conversion and reconciliation before God, we have the same kind of process that goes on in overcoming estrangement with people. There is no exact time when “friendshiping” occurs, but what is in fact a process performatively reduces to a point in, say, a handshake or a hug. No one supposes that shaking hands creates friendships; yet it does not merely reflect the friendship either since that friendship is in fact what has not existed before. It is a commitment to friendship and helps establish the friendship. It may testify to the friendship if anyone is watching, and it gives the participants a specific point in time to look back to in defining their status with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

God spoke the universe into existence (Genesis 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26, 29; Hebrews 11:3; 2 Peter 3:5). Its origin came from an act of the will (Acts 17:22-31), not from determinism through physical cause-effect. It was created (John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:14-20), not out of God, but by him from nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BASIC CONCEPTS IN CREATIONIST-EVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can we put in sequence the origin of reciprocating parts that are necessary for the viability of the organism and the parts themselves? If we can put their origin in sequence, they are not reciprocal. But the parts of plants and animals are in fact reciprocally interdependent unto viability. All parts have to be present and functional at all times. Disorganization destroys functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reciprocation is related to the concept of irreducible minimums, but it adds to it the origin of complexity and change between levels of complexity; hence, the mechanisms of change plus hoistic harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God created us to have fellowship with him, so he made us in his image by giving us the interpersonal capacity. But in practice there has always been a breakdown in the realization of that potential in every individual, a breakdown we may call depravity.1 Like Satan and the fallen angels earlier, every one of us has failed to express our capacity adequately or correctly. In different ways and to varying extents we fail to function interpersonally, in conformity to our own created nature, and in accordance with divine purpose. With the exception of Jesus Christ, each of us has misused the specific abilities that comprise interpersonal capacity and its derivatives, and thereby has affected all aspects of ourselves, our relations, and our destiny; so we say that everyone has total depravity. It turns out that in varying degrees, depravity has been universal since the beginning and all-pervasive in every person that ever lived. Depravity means that although everyone has the real creatable image, no one fully has the ideal ethical image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BENEDICTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The benediction slot appears at the end of the service. In popular usage “benediction” has become a label for the closing prayer, but a benediction is really a pronouncement of blessing on those assembled for worship or on God as a final statement of praise. The biblical texts given below can serve as a word of praise to God or a word of blessing on the worshipers as they are about to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BIBLICAL BRAIN TEASERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the examples below raise issues that are not in themselves very important. We offer them, however, as (1) “exercises” in hermeneutical creativity on matters where frankly it does not hurt to be wrong. Besides, it is not healthy to get in the habit of “dodging” critical issues because they impact (2) evaluating biblical accuracy. Though the points themselves are often not significant, their existence in a religious text does raise a point that is significant—whether people can trust the biblical accounts. Distrusting them for unnecessary reasons should be avoided, and we cannot legitimately trust them without correct exegetical work as a means of properly avoiding unnecessary criticism of scripture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CALLS TO WORSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Call to worship is a slot often used at the beginning of services designed to inspire awe, reverence, humility before God. Such services are more contemplative than celebrative, more vertically than horizontally oriented. The call to worship is a shorter scripture portion intended to focus attention of all participants and to prepare for a prayer of invocation. Other scripture readings may be longer in keeping with their purpose to inform, inspired, comfort and the like. The following texts are suggestions; there are may others that may be used for this purpose. The Book so Psalms is particularly useful as a resource for calls to worship. The texts below appear in vertical format so that notations can be made about subject matter, occasions when used, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Central to Less Central: An Interpersonal Format&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for Prioritizing Issues in Christian Unity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This presentation proposes a way to help fulfill two responsibilities that we tend to put in tension with one another: our responsibility for representing Christian truth and our responsibility for facilitating Christian unity. The proposal stems from believing that interpersonalism prioritizes what naturally occupies central place in Christianity. We can draw on that observation to help us in the quest for unity in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Individual salvation both precedes and pervades the subsequent horizontal group aspects of Christian unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The distinctness, compatibility, and relationship of the latter two are especially important in a study of church organization. Authority is the legal right to compel the behavior only of status inferiors. Influence is the personal ability to impel the behavior even of status superiors. A study of organizational structure concerns itself with the pattern of authority flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As respects authority the approach will be to determine what positions have authority and to consider the rest as functions. This procedure is possible not only because an either-or matter is under consideration, but more particularly because authority includes function. One cannot suppose that a function is seen as such only because the evidence recorded happens to be insufficient to show that it was really an office. That approach becomes an argument from silence and shifts the burden of proof onto the negative. The negative burden of proof in this instance would be impossible since the only available evidence would pertain to function, which is part of the larger concept of office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jesus Christ is an appointed King of a granted kingdom (Luke 19:12). The givenness of that entity includes its form—“kingdom”—as well as the principles of kingdom government–formal authority prescriptively applied. The organization of the church did not result from a natural process of crystallization among the disciples of Jesus, for Jesus was not a teacher like Socrates, who wrote nothing, founded nothing, and died, only to leave behind a group of followers that evolved a tradition of thought and practice. As to essential nature the church is kingdom as well as brotherhood. As regards government, the church may be called a Christocratic monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Interpersonalism” refers to interaction between persons, mutual relations, compenetration, mutuality, transaction. Interpersonal unity is the kind of thing John expresses with his a-in-b-in-a formula (e.g., John 10:38; 14:10, 11, 15-16, 20, 23, 38; 15:4-9; 17:21-24; 1 John 2:24-28; see also Colossians 1:27-28). Paul speaks about being “members of one another” (Ephesians 4:25). Interpersonalism contrasts with law, ritual (sacramentalism), nature (materialism), idea (rationalism), and mysticism. The ordinances are performative; they are acts by which we “say something” more than “means of grace’ that we get from them. By them we say something by what we do (cp. Titus 1:16).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Golden Rule works because we tend to respond in kind. The pattern operates negatively and positively: disrespect usually evokes disrespect, and respect evokes respect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People have different reasons for getting an education. (a) Education for knowledge is a German emphasis. The goal is accuracy and completeness in any field of study. If anything develops out of that knowledge, well and good; but the stress falls on knowledge for its own sake and the love for learning as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has been a British emphasis is (b) education for culture. The goal consists of fulfilling expectancies associated with a person’s position in the social structure. Cultured people should know their way around in the world, be able to converse intelligently about what goes on there, and be able to place themselves and their society in the proper historical niche. The upper classes serve as tradition bearers who give stability to the present social structure. As a primary function, education reinforces social position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN PARENTING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basic Principle: The home is a specialized setting for interpersonal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of the interpersonal comes the responsibility-authority factor that parenting entails. That understanding establishes the attitude we take toward children and the way we deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parenting is first and foremost a matter of relating to our young people as persons. Models for parenting are too often thought of as like being a (1) policeman, (2) friend, (3) counsellor, or (4) servant. The better approach is to start with personal relationship and add responsibility to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I in them and you in me, that the world may know that you sent me and love them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN WORLD VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic reality in Christianity is interpersonalism. God is personal, and everything else and everyone else derive from him by his creation. Interpersonalism is the most complex reality there is. It stands in contrast to nature, law, and ideas (metaphysics). Interpersonalism operates by love, nature by natural law, law by authority, and metaphysics by form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Authentic Cosmopolitanism&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by R. J. Snell &amp;amp; Steven D. Cone&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Stone-Campbell Conference; April 2017)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4, entitled “Disorder and Revolt,” addresses the impact of sinning on thinking as one aspect of depraved behavior generally. Perverted thought amidst general depravity connects in turn with university, most relevantly to formal Christian university as part of the over-all Christian enterprise mandated in the Great Commission (cosmopolitanism).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The approach traces the depravity phenomenon from elements in the thought of Aristotle through Aquinas to Lonergan, taking notice of Augustine and the Reformed tradition along the way—without necessarily appealing to the hypostatic and legal elements of their theories of sin as distinct from phenomenology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON CREEDS AND RELATED MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture alone (sola scriptura) means using the Bible as the sole authority for Christian belief and practice. It sets aside other normative sources for the Christian faith: creeds, tradition, apocryphal works, ecclesiastical pronouncements, additional primary literature beyond the sixty-six books of the canon, and persons claiming inner light and special revelation. The fundamental issue is not doctrinal error as much as practical authority. Going beyond the apostolic witness does open up the possibility—even likelihood—of false doctrine; but even if it did not, these other sources are disregarded. Other writings may have devotional value and helpful insight, but they do not determine what Christians are to believe and practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COMMENTS ON EXTREME EVIL</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/comments-on-extreme-evil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON EXTREME EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the problem of evil is not “easy” to answer, we can understand some things about how a degree of evil could occur in a holy God’s universe. But why an all-powerful God allows extreme evil to happen is more difficult. Scripture itself does not explain why he lets evil operate to the degree it does. Nevertheless, some observations make the issue more understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, whatever the reason(s), God does not place himself above the horrors of human suffering. It is beyond us how he can stand by and let atrocities take place before his very eyes when he could do something to stop them. We must remember, however, that the Father has not only stood by and let evil people mistreat other evil people and even abuse good people; he stood by and let sinful men crucify his own Son. No wonder Jesus cried out, “Why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46; etc., cp. Psalm 22:1). The human perspective of the dying divine Son is graphically evident in that “cry of dereliction.” That situation is even more difficult when he lets good men do evil, thinking they were doing him service (John 16:2). The crucifixion of Messiah involves both the Father standing by and the Son standing in the pain (John 18:6, etc.)—even though Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels to deliver him (Matthew 26:53). Whatever the reason, it is significant enough that deity went through it himself, not asking us to endure anything he was unwilling to suffer. Deity does not play favorites with his own, not even with his own Son, not even with himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS ON ORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Across Christendom ordination has had a variety of meanings. The most extreme position has been that (1) ordination validates the “administration” of sacraments. Unless a duly qualified clergyman presides, the sacrament is invalid in much the same way that a wedding performed by a person “off the street” would not be recognized by the state. A Justice of the Peace must be duly appointed to perform wedding ceremonies as an agent of the state. In this view, ordination is for theological reasons. The clergy concept is part of the larger idea that grace flows through the church, that is, through those who validly stand as executors of divine administration. It is a legal conceptualization like that of Justice of the Peace, validity being based on “apostolic succession.” Legal administration of grace, however, is a contradiction of terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMMUNION AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with any ritual or formal act, the Lord’s Supper means for us only what we mean into it. The bread and the grape juice are transformed in our minds into the body and the blood of the Lord. The elements represent rather than are. “This is my body” uses “is” in the way a new grandfather does when he pulls a snapshot out of his wallet and says, “This is my grandson.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The hardest work leads to the highest honor. Those superlatives come together at this table. God could not assign Christ’s role to just anyone, because it had such widespread importance; there could be no risk of failure. No one else qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge here that we’re benefactors of special greatness. He took the perfect life and produced a perfect life in the human condition. He took life in the human condition and produced a perfect life in the face of the worst opposition. So it’s no off-handed sign of appreciation that we give a nod to on our way to other things. It’s a focal point of worship, a culmination of prepared hearts and minds and wills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Below are several portions of scripture that belong among those that speak of matters relevant to this worship experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psalms 23&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COMPARING THEISM AND NATURALISM IN ORIGINS THEORY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A formal similarity could be seen between “emergent evolution” and progressive creationism. The “emergent points” of emergent evolution might appear to correlate with the “intervention points” of progressive revelation. From a scientist’s viewpoint, we could consider the possibility that a connector in a progression is a natural one rather than a supernatural one, as previously supposed. We may not already know that a natural “force” exists for accomplishing this complexification. There is a difference, however, between keeping the natural category potential for explanation in such cases and making it the necessary category for explanation by disallowing the supernatural category in principle. The latter is what methodological naturalism does by assuming that its method, good in itself, somehow becomes the only legitimate method. Creationists, however, want to keep the supernatural category open after the initial creation of mass-energy. The formal similarity is limited because of the internal-external variable in the respective formats at their correlating junction points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCERNING CORPORATE WORSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with most experiences, worship involves structural/form-al and affective/ emotional elements. It deals with the patterns we use privately and corporately; it involves also the impact these patterns make on us. Definitions of the term worship differ according to one emphasis or the other; hence, they range from I-Thou vertical relationship, on the one hand, to subjective religious effect, on the other. One describes worshiping; the other refers to what is worshipful. What different people mean by worship varies, but the structural components of gathered worship itself are readily identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCLUDING A MINISTRY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under most circumstances when you take a ministry of any kind, do it as an open-ended experience.  Give no thought to how long you will be there, because you should not be interested in climbing ladders so much as serving Christ. Your motive is to “bloom where you are planted” rather than look past what you are doing in order to discover “greener pastures” elsewhere. As a primary motive if you focus on moving up the ladder, you are probably not so much concerned to improve the upcoming situation as to improve your own standing. It is a form of “building on another man’s foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The church is saved people serving in divine pattern. The body of Christ possesses essential oneness by virtue of individual unity with Christ and collective unity through Christ. This invisible oneness is manifest by a dynamic structure-function called the church. Functional unity in Christ combines with organizational unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a first major concern the historical argument for non-denominationalism focused particularly on the last of these elements: the organizational pattern of the church established under direct apostolic administration. Although the first four elements have probably never been fully present in the visible church, it was anticipated that sufficient evidence was available to show that formal oneness did exist in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CONDITION vs. CAUSE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONDITION vs. CAUSE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A condition is an action required of one person by another. The other person act does not produce the result; it meets the condition for the first person to give the result. Jesus’ reference to the brazen serpent in the Old Testament illustrates idea (John 3:14-15). The Israelites were to look on the brazen serpent to be cured from snakebite. Looking at the brazen serpent did not cause the cure. God gave the cure if a person did the looking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CONFLICT RESOLUTION BY INTERPERSONAL MEANS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONFLICT RESOLUTION BY INTERPERSONAL MEANS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism shows how people can befriend people they disagree with without feeling that they are compromising convictions in doing so. Accepting persons transcends approving of their ideas or even their deeds in some cases. Presence is not approval. So, interpersonal considerations provide a format for conflict resolution. We have to relate to people to have any influence on them, and we can do that on the basis of their potential for change. This approach underlies God’s effort at the reconciliation process (salvation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INTERPERSONALISM AND CHRISTOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture makes clear that Jesus the Messiah possessed deity in the distinctive, ontological sense. From the standpoint of theory, it may not contradict the salvation enterprise for us not to understand that fact fully or with complete accuracy. His sinlessness relative to God’s will for him in the flesh appears to be the essential element for salvation purposes. It would be best, then, not to regard as “enemies of Christ” those who misperceive him as the first created being (who created everything else, Colossians 1:15-16) yet affirm his sinlessness and everything scripture says about him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COPING WITH TEMPTATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;One of the first things in the Bible is Satan’s temptation of Adam and Eve. The first thing in Christ’s life after his baptism by John was his temptation by Satan as he was entering upon his role as Messiah. Note three parallel biblical segments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genesis 3:6&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;good for food      &#x9;delight to eyes          &#x9;make a person wise&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ temptation &#x9;stones to bread         kingdoms of world    cast yourself down&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CREATION IN INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CREATION IN INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism puts the personal ahead of the impersonal. Person and personal aspects like mind, will, emotion, and conscience do not arise epiphenomenally from the impersonal, but by virtue of mind operating through will, the personal creates the impersonal (Genesis 1:1-5ff) and orders it (Genesis 1:26-31; 2:7-15). The personal is eternal, but the impersonal has beginning and end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism puts the personal God ahead of the created universe. Not only is the created universe not the ultimate frame of reference; it is not abstracted from its ultimate personal creator. None of God’s works are to be regarded apart from him or considered discretely in and of themselves whether creation, revelation, providence, or redemption. The universe has not always been here; it had a beginning from the transcendent personal creator, who had no beginning. It will also have an end, but he is eternal. The doctrine of creation from nothing is unique in ancient religions. And Judaeo-Christianity is unique in having a relational God of principle as the highest frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITERIA FOR A BIBLICAL VIEW OF HUMAN ABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prevenient grace and natural depravity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In place of the natural depravity of traditional theology, we prefer to speak of psychological depravity. In doing so, we acknowledge the power of sin without considering ourselves subject to a determinism that results in lostness. In the construct of depravity plus prevenient grace, psychological depravity functions on the analogy of habit. Prevenient grace consequently omits natural regeneration from God’s acts of grace that precede salvation. A view of human ability is developed below under five criteria listed according to the sequence in which they apply to the process of restoration to fellowship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRITIQUE OF AUGUSTINE’S VIEW OF EVIL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Augustine’s treatment of the problem of evil falls short for two related reasons. (1) He did not properly distinguish natural and moral evil, suffering and sin, pain and guilt. In his thought, they amounted to the same problem. (2) He attempted to examine even moral evil primarily in reference to the category of nature. In so doing, he glossed over the distinction between impersonal and interpersonal reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Factors that help break this inhibition are mistakenly identified as the energizing work of the Holy Spirit. The phenomenon itself is then misidentified with New Testament language speaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DEALING WITH DIFFERENCES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;It is harder to relate to people who differ from us. We cannot do what is natural without offending and may being offended. People who differ from us are the very ones we may be drawn to, because we see in them the traits we wish we had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.&#x9;The most far-reaching differences are religious beliefs and styles of living.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C.&#x9;It is not possible to deal briefly with all differences in beliefs, but we can deal with ways to minimize difficulties that stem from different lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their normal activities are less age-graded because there are fewer people and because family ties are generally stronger. As a result, they are less likely to warm up to the idea of putting their small children in a nursery during Sunday school and church. The children themselves are less accustomed to being left with a sitter while the parents go to some purely adult activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDUCATION FOR USE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Teaching Task&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bible colleges adapt higher education in partial preparation for ministry. On the one hand, they obviously differ from “secular” institutions by presenting courses from a Christian perspective. Unlike seminaries, Bible colleges begin ministry preparation at the undergraduate level. They differ also from Christian liberal arts institutions by including mostly those courses that have the greatest transfer to ministry, by teaching them with a view to ministering, by reducing the emphasis on liberal arts as such, and by including practical courses. On the other hand, Bible colleges do not try to become simply vocational-technical schools. In both practical and conceptual aspects of the curriculum, a governing principle for Bible colleges is “education for use.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Faith and sight are two ways to know. Sight means knowledge by direct perception; faith is knowledge through the testimony of other people. We know about the past, the future, the distant, and the invisible only by testimony, if at all. In short, most knowledge comes from revelation either by God or some other person. In either case, it is interpersonal—by faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESCHATOLOGY AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Last Things)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under the (inter)personal worldview, there is eschatology because the future is going somewhere intentional. Predestination guarantees the meaningfulness of history by providing destiny. The possibility of making all things new contrasts with the myth of eternal returns, the cyclical view of history. A creating God who originates by willing can bring about the truly new. The future is not limited to the possibilities of the past, nor is the future sheer eventuation; the future is foreordained by a Person who chooses destinies. There is more to tomorrow than one experience leading to the next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ETHICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMAGE AS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethical Use of Imago dei&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) The image as interpersonal capacity connects the natural and the ethical usages of the expression image of God. One pervasive concern of biblical content is wholeness, the big picture, the synthetic emphasis in contrast to a dichotomistic, analytical, reductionist approach. That concern carries over into the terminology. The penchant for integration accounts for the rather facile shifting back and forth between natural, behavioral, and relational usages of terms like image, life, sin, flesh, create, knowledge, and wisdom associated with the creation narrative. Integration accounts for places where such expressions may combine these rather different, though related, concepts when dealing with subjects in broad scope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ethics, morality, and goodness pertain to behavior in personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethics does not deal with being (ontology), substance (hypostasis), the material realm. Augustine set aside that concept of ethics in his costly error of identifying evil as loss (privation) of form in substance relative to its pristine condition. That starting point generated natural depravity for explaining universal, all-pervasive sin and the impossibility of self-salvation. According to his thinking, sin was a function of inheritable mis-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Discussing evangelical perspectives on men and women in relationship adds biblical interpretation to the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this subject what makes a viewpoint evangelical is not so much the viewpoint itself as the accompanying attitude toward scripture and the consequent method of interpretation which that attitude involves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVANGELISM AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Objects of Evangelism (See also comments on the scope of salvation under interpersonalism essay “Salvation.”)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One important ramification of the interpersonal nature of the gospel is that it applies to every person. The only qualification for receiving it is being a person, someone with the interpersonal capacity. The gospel does not have to do with birds and animals (contra Francis of Assisi). Christianity is not an elitist religion for a particular caste or nation, for heads of state, intellectuals (as in Gnosticism), the rich, the educated, the freeman, the adult, the righteous, or the married, but for every person. “I did not come so much to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance” (Luke 5:32). It is for as many as have sinned, experienced alienation (lost), and stand in need of reconciliation (saved).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVERYDAY LESSONS FROM JONAH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Book of Jonah is anything but “everyday.” It features extraordinary events we would seldom, if ever, see. God talks to Jonah like a next-door neighbor. He tells the prophet to travel to the capital of the Assyrian empire that controls the prophet’s nation. His mission is to warn those enemies that God is going to destroy them in forty days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Jonah flees by ship in another direction, and God stops him cold with a raging storm that threatens his life and everybody’s on board. The loss of all the cargo comes in an effort to keep from sinking. When the captain and crew find out that the disaster has arisen from Jonah’s disobedience, they try to row back to shore but have to accede to his directions to throw him overboard to get the sea back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why allow evil in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evil is a necessary potentiality of free will. God is not limited by the option, but&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVOLUTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can’t put in sequence the origin of reciprocating parts that are necessary for the viability of the whole organism and of the parts themselves. Additionally, the biosphere involves two sexes that both must be present from the beginning in a combinable fashion because entropy means the organisms will die; so they have to be replaced by reproduction. Living organisms involve systems of systems that must all be present from the beginning or the organism is not viable, so there cannot be step-by-step change from one set of systems to another set of systems, all the while with ongoing viability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We do not have to be high up the ladder of leadership to be leading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are all to shed influence. The Christian calling involves calling others.  Christianity is a call to leadership. Christian virtue sheds influence. When we act, we not only act but teach and lead as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We do not seem to know what to do or how to love. Behaviors like the following should clarify what loving is and does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EXTREMELY SINFUL: Psalm 51&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psalm 51 records David’s response to his sin with Bathsheba:  heading of the Psalm, “When Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone into Bathsheba” (2 Samuel 11-12).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David’s redeeming quality was admission of his sin, his willingness to repent, and his concern to reach out to God for forgiveness: Psalm 51:1-4, 7-17, which is the bulk of the Psalm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David felt totally characterized by sin as when we say someone is a “born liar.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FAITH AND SIGHT/SCIENCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Science deals with the experience of recurrent natural processes in the present. The technology science uses enhances the degree and kinds of sense perception in the natural realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limitations of Science&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Science cannot deal with universals or absolutes. It is subject to “the plague of particularity.” Science must take an inductive approach although it can form hypotheses, which are proposed universals suggested by observed particulars. The scientific method cannot deal with the absolutes of universal space or eternal time; hence, strictly speaking, it cannot see the big picture and cannot produce a worldview, because it is based on human experience, which is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FAITH AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Faith belongs to the interpersonal circumstance because it is something one person puts in another person. Faith trusts in another. Scripture applies the faith principle to two areas: salvation (consequences) and knowledge (information). In both applications a second person stands in the gap (a) between the doer and the result and (b) between the learner and what’s learned. Habakkuk 2:4 serves as the gateway into the whole Christian system: “The just will live by faith/trust.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FIVE MODELS FOR COMPLETELY RELIABLE SCRIPTURE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FIVE MODELS FOR COMPLETELY RELIABLE SCRIPTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do not need to decide between the “theories of inspiration” to understand how scripture came to have the character of “God-breathedness” (2 Timothy 3:16). As we can judge from scripture itself, God operated in more than one way in producing scripture. The models of origin may be organized according to what God specially gave to his human spokesmen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God gave the words. Probably no one holds the dictation theory of inspiration strictly understood, even though people often suppose that Christians have that explanation for the origin of the Bible. It might apply to a few cases, notably the Ten Commandments, which in the first copy were written by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18; cp. also Daniel 5:25-28). In this format God operates in a significantly positive fashion (Daniel 5).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Choice and thinking and other personal acts are occurring on both sides of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Goal: to understand following God’s guidance as a SENSE OF ASSISTANCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FORMAL PREPARATION FOR MINISTRY: THE 18-30 YEARS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graduating someone with a ministry degree does not necessarily increase the number of personnel in permanent ministry. Several factors contribute to significant attrition, especially during the early years of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes opportunities come for pursuing other interests that are more financially rewarding. More often, however, leaving the ministry stems from disillusionment, lack of fulfillment, inability to get people to respond to one’s leadership, frustration, little sense of progress. Adjusting the manner of preparation will not eliminate the problem, but adjustments in the way we conceive of ministry preparation will preserve for service a greater number of ministerial graduates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FREEDOM AND DETERMINISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The situation is like a broad arrow. Neither freedom nor determinism is absolute. Freedom is within a framework determined by several factors. Nature is the outermost limit, revelation is inside of that, and then there are other factors like circumstance and providence. Our individual freedom will never allow us to move outside the limit that nature imposes, but to a certain extent we may move outside the margin that revelation or circumstance presents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FREEDOM AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freedom means moving in accordance with reality. Freedom is not detachment from everything; that would be lostness. It means moving in conformity with what is there. The interpersonal connection lies in acknowledging the presence of God and other persons and in living with them instead of striving after an unreal individualism. Fulfillment comes from association; people must live in conformity with the fact that they are persons designed for relationship with persons. A certain amount of individual limitation is necessary to be free because other reality exists. Proper relationship to God sets the stage for proper relationship to everything else. Divine fellowship sets the stage for objective freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GALATIANS 3:28: A TEST CASE FOR SOUND HERMENEUTICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“There is no male and female because you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). The wording of that part-verse has become a popular way for Christians to express the egalitarian principle that (a) in the home and in the church, there are no necessary role distinctions between the sexes. A man or a woman has the same theoretical “right” to lead. In its healthiest form, egalitarianism calls for “a fair field and no favors” in all parts of the social arena.1 A more extreme alternative to male headship is the belief that (b) in the home and in the church, there is only interpersonal leadership. Not only is there is no designated final responsibility in marriage and ministry referenced to sex; there is no hierarchical arrangement at all; there is only natural vs. formal leadership.2 Cooperation rather than structure is the ideal modus operandi. At least the first of these viewpoints is a proposed meaning of Paul’s statement to the Galatians. This study evaluates that reading in light of the evident exegetical and theological import of the passage, and addresses various ways by which women’s roles come or might come into its sphere of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GAMALIEL’S ARGUMENT FOR THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Jesus provides a plausible explanation for his followers’ continued and growing zeal for claiming him as the Messiah although he had been killed. Messiah indeed “abides forever” as per the Old Testament witness, but killing him does not necessarily eliminate him from that role if he resurrected, especially if he arose and ascended to God with the understanding that he was to return and pick up the Messianic work in whatever fashion that proves to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GENERAL SCHEMATIC FOR CHRISTIAN APOLOGETICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To locate the study of critical introduction to the Old Testament within the total picture of apologetics, we give here an abstract of the flow of apologetics. Instead of beginning with objective Christian evidences, as traditionally done, we include a prior step so that evangelism and apologetics become much the same kind of thing. Coming to conviction begins in the present with (1) our sense of need to be loved, to feel innocent and meaningful, and to have something to depend on. (2) The answer in Christianity comes as a cluster of historical events surrounding the person of Jesus the Messiah, especially his resurrection and the meaning of his life, death, and resurrection for human need in any age. (3) When we begin to carry out the principles of living that Christ taught and to receive in experience Christ’s love, the purposefulness of life, the freedom from guilt, and the confidence of living under One we can trust, we confirm subjectively that the truth is also the truth for us. Living in the new condition helps us identify more clearly the real needs among, and plus, perceived needs. This stage helps us understand the message itself more clearly, and so on. The process forms an ongoing dynamic of reciprocal causations between the three “poles.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GLOSSARY OF COMMUNICATION-RELATED TERMS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Glossary of Communication-Related Terms describes terms and expressions used with language structure, usage, and writing. It highlights biblical and theological studies, hence, the numerous references to Greek, Latin, English, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Usages beyond these languages exist, of course, but they do not usually appear in these entries. This subject has fuzzy edges because language itself bleeds across into content—into the surrounding that it is used to talk about; besides, truth itself is holistic. Language, oral and written, involves linguistics, hermeneutics; specific languages like English, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew and their grammars; some issues in New and Old Testament textual criticism; rhetoric, and writing.

      <title>GOD AND INTERPERSONALISM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GOD AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism applies to the ultimate frame of reference in that deity forms a three-person unity. In philosophy, “God” refers to ultimate reality. In scripture, this reality is personal because he is counselor who has no counselor (Psalm 11:3-4), his pleasure is what measures all doing, and his glory is the effect of everything that happens (Ephesians 1:11; Psalm 19:1). Interpersonalism represents the most complex form of existence. It stands to reason that if it exists in the created realm, it should be present in what originated everything in the created realm. The stream, we say, cannot rise above its source. The most inclusive understanding of God is at the “corporate,” or triune, level. The traditional doctrine of trinity combines into one concept unity, diversity, equality, and order and puts it before all other reality. Note the title The Eternal We, by Harold J. Green (Chicago, Ill.: Loyola University Press, 1987). Trinity is not just any kind of threeness-in-oneness; it is an interpersonal threeness-in-oneness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GREEK ELEMENTS IN THE INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF EPHESIANS 5:21&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;editorial question&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Ephesians 5:21&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does “defer to one another in the fear of Christ” belong with the preceding or succeeding context?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The United Bible Society’s text of the Greek New Testament puts the injunction with the preceding material in the third edition, but with the succeeding context in the third edition (corrected). Grammatically the participle “submitting” parallels participles in the preceding two verses—participles that grammatically modify the subject of the finite verb in 5:18. A free-standing participle can be a command; but clear cases of that usage are infrequent in the New Testament (Mark 5:23; Romans 12:92, 10?, 11?, 123?, 132? 163?, 172?, 18, 19; 13:11; 1 Corinthians 8:24; Ephesians 5:21?; Titus 2:7; 1 Peter 2:18; 3:1). Moreover, nothing grammatical calls for invoking that usage in Ephesians 5:21 because of the parallel between “deferring” and the preceding participles of 5:19-20: “. . . speaking to one another . . . singing and making melody . . . giving thanks . . . deferring to one another . . .” Grammatically, “deferring” ties with the preceding flow of thought by being parallel to the three preceding participles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GROUP PRAYER PATTERNS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prayers may be spontaneous or planned, vocal or silent, informal or formal depending on the setting and the desired impact. Group prayer corporately acknowledges our creaturely dependence on God and our fundamental orientation toward him. Group prayer may take various forms but any form we choose needs to evoke an I-You experience with God. Prayer should be sincere and &amp;ldquo;real,&amp;rdquo; and therefore should avoid deadness born of unnatural formalism, perfunctory language full of clichés and trite expressions, vain repetitions, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GUIDANCE AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Divine guidance takes place with people; hence, it includes choices, thinking, feelings, and other personal factors with both God and people. God does not make all our choices for us; he treats us like friends more than like slaves. Pushing the idea that God has a special plan for each person may be nothing more than (1) the old self-centeredness in religious garb; self-centeredness is not interpersonal. (2) It may be a kind of laziness, because people do not want to put out significant effort in deciding or taking responsibility for their decisions. Submitting to God does not mean being submissive. “Super-spirituality” is not interpersonal spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HANDLING CRITICISM IN THE MINISTRY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We reserve the word criticism for illegitimate fault-finding. It means something negative because it has negative cause, result, or both. Criticism is evil because it does not edify of others but aggrandizes self. A critic’s conscious motive may be to hurt or offend, and the person criticized feels that hurt. Criticism does not build up anyone or improve the situation. It is not done the same way constructive efforts are done. Many times critics do not go to the person himself, but air their complaints to third parties or in public situations. They make their statements in condemnatory tone of voice and in ways which imply their doubt that the other person to be willing or able to make adjustments that correct. Their aim is to evaluate rather than ameliorate–to condemn rather than to help&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hermeneutics A&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of texts often comes in terms of the assumed overall viewpoints, more than by the requirements of the text under discussion. Hence, we can’t solve the problem itself because we are not dealing with the whole viewpoint that gives credence to the idea on this text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One approach to an unacceptable view is to show that each text used to support it can be handled in a way that fits with another view. When all the texts so used have been addressed in this way, no basis remains for the questionable idea. So, it is not a matter of disproving, but of showing that the other view cannot shoulder its positive burden of proof; so the view is at best a matter of opinion because it is a viewpoint based on inadequate evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HERMENEUTICS AND NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exegetical Impasse&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A standoff has persisted in exegesis between Calvinistic and non-Calvinistic interpreters largely because no resolution can come at the level of individual passages that have implications for anthropology. A few examples illustrate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Psalm 51:10 says, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” Ezekiel 18:31 shows another emphasis, “Make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.” The difficulty is whether Psalm 51:10 interprets Ezekiel 18:31 or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HERMENEUTICS AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(How to Interpret to Bible)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism establishes a theological method. Interpersonalism impacts hermeneutics by establishing a programmatic for interpreting the Bible. What does not deduce from interpersonalism must be firmly established by primary proof. Primary proof is the kind of proof that requires one conclusion, while secondary evidence confirms what comes from primary. Primary proof that does not arise from the nature of the case (interpersonalism ultimately) must rest on positive commandment rather than moral law, because moral law refers to what comes from the nature of the case. Interpersonalism establishes what is to be regarded a priori as central. It becomes a way of shouldering appropriately the positive burden of proof on many issues. Interpersonalism calls for doing theology in the interpersonal mode because it goes on in an interpersonal context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HOLY SPIRIT AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. The gift of the Spirit is first of all an interpersonal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is a person, not a force, a power, a feeling, an atmosphere, idea, principle, or attitude. He is not God’s energy. Since the Spirit is a person and people are persons, “having the Spirit” means relating to deity in the person of the Spirit. Consequently, his guidance and empowerment come first through interpersonal means—influence before miracle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HUMAN DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overview of Natural Depravity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the late fourth century Augustine, bishop of Hippo in North Africa, gave classical expression to natural depravity as part of his understanding of the nature of evil. In his thought, evil is a lack (privation) in the form of substance relative to its original form. That relatively deformed condition produces evil action. The nature of evil is lack, the cause of evil is lack in form, and the criterion of evil is lack in form compared to pristine form&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(a) Nothing in the context distinguishes them. Furthermore, (b) in most other passages only one term occurs, image in Genesis 9:6-7; 1 Corinthians 11:7; James 3:9 and likeness in Genesis 5:2 in an otherwise word-for-word parallel to 1:26.

In language, authorial intent does not bear a one-to-one relationship with linguistic forms. In assessing a writer’s use of the imperative mood, we look beyond the form itself and infer its force from the near and distant literary context, the historical context, and the nature of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Imperatives may entreat, where one wants a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDWELLING SIN: ROMANS 7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Paul speaks of sin resident within him (or indwelling sin), perhaps he means it phenomenologically; that is, the experience of sin feels like something inside him. His point is that sin is not just something outside us (environment, influence) trying to tempt us into misaction; it is something inside us as well. There is a subjective as well as objective component in the sin phenomenon. The implication is personal responsibility for subjective response to objective influence and stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTELLIGENTLY DISCUSSING CREATION AND EVOLUTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The presentation here is not for solving the creation-evolution problem, but for clarifying the issue and correcting inappropriate thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the Issue&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creationism as such vs. the Christian formulations of it. There is a difference between creation as a concept and the Judaeo-Christian—or even Islamic—formulation of it. The Christian formulation gets into additional matters, which vary according to the manner interpreters handle the relevant biblical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since coming to the faculty in 1977, I have been involved in interim ministries in Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri almost constantly for sixteen years. Earlier while teaching at The Cincinnati Bible Seminary (1971-1974), I did this kind of work in several churches in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. On the accompanying pages I have noted some values that I have seen come to the congregation from those kinds of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERMENT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;020317&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to suppose that we stand here at the end of a life to pay our “final respects” at a “final resting place.” Existence appears to be over because life is over. What remains seems to be dealing with the impact on us who remain. The happiness of good memories combines with the sadness of losing the source of that happiness. Sunshine on this cold winter’s day pictures our conflicted feelings. We have only to wait till time turns the winter of our loss to the summer of new things to come in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERPERSONALISM AND ORDINANCES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are performative acts, acts by which the performer “says something.” Their meaning comes from what we mean into them; otherwise, they have no meaning. That indicates that they are not rituals done to us by which grace comes to us automatically by virtue of the ritual itself somehow or by virtue of the legitimized authority of the administrator. There is value that comes on us, but it comes on us from God on the prior condition of our commitment to him as communicated by the performative act.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERPERSONALISM AND THE MYSTERY OF GOD&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism integrates with the “mystery of God” because (a) the mystery factor is highest in the interpersonal categories. That is so because the other categories—nature, law, and logic—are deterministic; but persons, especially persons in relationship, are not fully predictable since they have rationality, creativity, and free will on both sides of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mystery of God comes also from (b) the fact that God is supernatural, but we can regard him only with our finite minds.  That reduces our ability to “figure him out” or predict his next move. He will not be inconsistent with his nature, values, and purposes; but those three factors leave a lot of room for variability. They allow his freedom and supernatural abilities to operate in ways we cannot know or understand or anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERPERSONALISM AS A CRITERION FOR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FELLOWSHIP, ORTHODOXY, AND RELATIVE CENTRALITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism serves as a general criterion for deciding what is part of the faith. It is the touchstone for distinguishing “gospel from culture” and truth from preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism serves as a criterion for arranging things from central to less central within what is actually true about the Christian faith. The value of this observation lies in helping us decide what to emphasize in introducing someone to Christ (evangelism) and in arranging the sequence of virtues and duties in the process of sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTERVIEWING FOR A MINISTRY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.&#x9; General Considerations&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, extreme positions have been taken on both sides of the “preacher competition” issue in hiring a minister. At one extreme is the practice of bringing in three or four ministers for “trial sermons” and then taking a vote on which one the people want. At the other extreme is the policy ministers may advocate that search committees look at only one candidate at a time and decide yes or no before passing on to the next one. It seems curious that ministers want to look at several congregations and decide which one to take, but they do not want a congregation looking at more than one minister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Title&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This thesis examines the historical argument for organizational church unity. The New Testament Basis for the Non-Denominational Church: The Historical Argument is used as the title for two reasons especially: (1) clarity–a concept is most definite in the context of contrast; (2) relevance–denominationalism is a feature of contemporary Christendom that stands in contrast to what will be presented as the nature of the church’s unity according to the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS ON JONAH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two views have been taken of the Book of Jonah: (1) the historical and (2) the literary. Under the former, Jonah gives an account of actual events. In the latter, the work is a short story written to express more general truths about God and man in the world. The significance of the matter along with the procedure for determining the genre is dealt with below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IRREGULAR LINGUISTIC FEATURES IN REVELATION:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTERACTING WITH R. H. CHARLES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three possibilities are always present when an irregularity occurs: it was intentional, it was due to ignorance, or it was an unintentional mistake. R. H. Charles wrote the two-volume commentary on Revelation in the International Critical Commentary. It presented an extended investigation of linguistic peculiarities in the Book of Revelation. He concluded that the writer was a Jew thinking in Hebrew and writing in Greek, which he did not know very well. Other writers, particularly Henry Cadbury, have challenged this conclusion, saying that the linguistic irregularities are deliberate. The issue is of some importance because it relates to the authorship issue for the Apocalypse. If the anomalies were deliberate, it is not as necessary to posit a different author for Revelation vs. the Gospel of John and the three Epistles of John, which do not have such grammatical features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some points may be referred to in Hermeneutics: Getting the Point; check the scripture index for locations. As much as possible, consciously integrate into your write-up the principles studied in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some items involve work with the original languages and may not seem fully understandable to those who have not studied Greek. There is no expertise in biblical languages required, however, since the exercises are vocabulary items that can be looked at through Englishman’s Greek Concordance to the New Testament. On some questions students may want to consult Dr. Warren’s “Preliminary Essays on Women’s Studies.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISSUES THAT UNDERLIE MARRIAGE POLICIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is marriage a Christian institution or a social/racial/human one?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding that marriage is a racial institution means that a minister may conceive of himself as serving primarily an agent of the state rather than the church. In that case he feels freer to perform weddings for non-Christians or even for mixed couples. A minister may still want to consider whether a “minister’s” performing the wedding has the appearance of religious approval of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT IS GOOD TO REMEMBER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the grand cycle of life, only four or five generations of humanity are accessible to our experience at any one moment in history. Those earlier men and women we must remember, and so we set aside this day to reflect on their contribution to our welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember because doing so fosters appreciation. None of us are self-made people. Those who went before set the range of possibilities that we choose among and now enjoy. Were it not for their sacrifices and labors, we would not have the freedoms we prize or many of the possessions we own. Surely we shape our own lives and mold their direction by our efforts, but those efforts are largely exerted within the options that have been handed down to us. We owe our ancestors a great debt of gratitude, and we inherit an obligation in turn to leave our legacy—to respect, cherish, and protect the privileges inherited our forefathers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ITEMS AFFECTED BY THE DOCTRINE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the nature of mankind is a central consideration in Christian theology, the doctrine of natural depravity in mankind affects a variety of issues and impacts them in significant ways. The following enumeration of consequences may not be necessary in every case, but historically this concept has triggered them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anthropology itself is significantly different because mankind is understood as born without the full spiritual capacity that Adam and Eve had before they sinned. Beyond the consequences of their sin that Genesis 3 and elsewhere indicate, natural depravity adds to the silence of scripture by saying that in some way—either by built-in natural result or direct divine penalty—their sin led to a defective genetic nature that everybody has biologically inherited. Because we all have descended from the same pair, we are all infected with this defect in every aspect of our being. The will is weakened so that we cannot resist temptation even when we want to. The affections are so disoriented that often we do not even want to resist. We do not love what we should. Even emotional disorders may integrate with natural depravity. Bodily drives are perverted, which accounts for unwholesome sexual desires, homosexuality, bestiality, gluttony, drunkenness, as well as inhibitive and compulsive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intellect is skewed at least relative to spiritual matters, so that we are blind to what should be “as clear as the nose on our face.” Some have integrated the concept more broadly by connecting it with the idea that supposedly people use only 5-8% of the brain’s capacity. That somehow represents the difference between the IQ of fallen and unfallen man. Unfallen Adam could use 100% of his brain power and was more intelligent than afterward. He supposedly had great intuitive knowledge as well as greater intellectual power than anyone has now. Some have claimed that he had such a grasp of natural science as is unattainable today (John Laidlaw, The Bible Doctrine of Man, 1895; see Gordon Clark, pp. 20-21).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 1994, James Torrance, professor emeritus of systematic theology at the University of Aberdeen, presented the Didsbury Lectures in the Nazarene Theological College, Manchester. InterVarsity Press offers these lectures in written form with a preface and appendix added by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worship is the central concern of the volume, which brings the author to emphasize the nature of God particularly as trinitarian and gracious. Worship is described as “our participation through the Spirit in the Son’s communion with the Father” (p. 15; cp. 21). We “worship the Father through the Son in the Spirit” (p. 22). We “participate through the Spirit in the incarnate Son’s communion with the Father” (p. 59). “The real agent in all true worship is Jesus.” Granted the ambiguities in such phraseology as “participation through the Spirit” and “Jesus as the only true agent,” we nevertheless see that Christ’s “priesthood” is not simply in regard to something completed; it is the sole ongoing basis for perpetual relationship to God, in life generally and in worship especially.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JAMES: COMPETITION CONVERTED TO LOVE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion is not good for some people; it just makes them worse by putting God on their side. Because they know the truth, they look down on other people’s ignorance with greater boldness. The tendency to consider themselves better than their neighbors is reinforced by the status they have as one of God’s people. That phenomenon is curious since sin is always some kind of self-centeredness. If “getting religion” only reinforces such attitudes, what good is it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JUST A THOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Where Is God?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only is God someone we don’t see; he is someone we can’t see (1 Timothy 3:16). We may wonder, though, why he doesn’t show himself someway at least once in a while. He could speak to us audibly or give us a vision of himself from time to time. The short answer to the question is, “We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On second thought, maybe it is best this way. Would we relish being reminded that he is watching our every move or knowing everything that goes through our minds? How free would we feel if God acted like a micromanager? Would we live in constant fear of failure or be always self-conscious about our inadequacies?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KNOWING BY FAITH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limitations of science&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Science has three major limitations. First, (1) science cannot deal with universals, or absolutes. It is subject to “the plague of particularity” because it is limited to the inductive approach. Science can form and test hypotheses, which are mental deductions from previous particulars; but these hypotheses are approximate, since they are based on limited previous experience. Since science cannot deal with the absolutes of universal space or eternal time, science cannot lead to an adequate understanding of “the big picture.” In short, science cannot produce a worldview. It deals more with particulars than with systematics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LANGUAGE IN INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LANGUAGE IN INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language often develops its vocabulary relative to the personal-impersonal distinction. We see that in English, although it may be difficult to get a feel for how widespread or universal it is in languages generally. One example is “educate,” a word that would not likely be used for training an animal to do tricks; “train” would be the more likely word..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The capacity for speech enhances the social experience. Thomas Mann was willing even to say, “Speech is civilization.” Language helps define humanness and personhood. Our conversation reveals to other persons what we are, connects us with other people, and sets the direction for our future together. It behooves each Christian to avoid the vulgarisms that dehumanize, depersonalize, and assault other people. Instead, this interpersonal capacity should compliment, thank, and ennoble. What has so much potential for good becomes all the more devastating for evil when misused. No wonder we are justified or condemned by our words (Matthew 12:37).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LANGUAGE, EXEGESIS, AND THEOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Biblical languages, texts, and topics naturally combine for study that undergirds personal growth and Christian ministry. Acquaintance with the original languages of scripture raises options not suggested by the English, eliminates possibilities English wording might allow, and gives access to additional study tools. Furthermore, a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew facilitates the evaluation of points made by other commentators on the biblical text, a great advantage to ministers, because we are constantly called upon to deal with doctrinal issues purportedly based on “the original.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAW AND GOSPEL IN CONTRAST (IP)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul declares that the “letter” kills, but the spirit gives life. His point appears to be that the absoluteness and inflexibility of law stifles and destroys persons in operation, especially in relation with each other. It drives people away even as the Israelites turned away from the glow on Moses’ face. The “spirit,” or purpose, of the Law corresponds with the Person who gave it. “Cutting someone a little slack” is a liberating experience. On this usage of “spirit,” compare John 1:17; 4:23; Romans 7:6; Galatians 3-4. Spirit appears to mean personal and interpersonal in contrast to letter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAW AND INTERPERSONALISM IN CONTRAST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Law and personal relationship do not have a (1) part-to-whole relationship. Legal process does not represent a secondary operation inside of interpersonal operation. Grace-faith does not function inside of law, and law does not provide mechanisms inside of interpersonalism. In Pauline terms, works are not part of the grace-faith-promise-spirit system. Likewise, legality and interpersonalism are not (2) parts of a common larger operation.1 Legal works do not supplement or combine with interpersonal actions in bringing about the interpersonal consequences needed by estranged persons. Legal operations are foreign to interpersonal process. The two systems are parallel, alternative, and mutually exclusive.2 If something is of law, it is no longer of faith (Galatians 2:12); if it is legal, it is not interpersonal. If it is of grace, it is no more of works (Romans 11:6). If inheritance is of law, faith is void and promise is of no effect (Romans 4:14). Grace, faith, and promise are aspects of interpersonal operation in contrast to works and debt, which belong to legal process (Romans 4:13-16; cp. Galatians 3:18). God has not established procedures for persons to go through to get salvation; he has given them a Person to identify with and commit to in order to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LEADERSHIP AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading takes place in the interpersonal circumstance and has the purpose of helping people grow in their social skills necessary for getting the job done. Leadership is gained and exercised by interpersonal means. In the church, leadership does not come by heredity, force, being “pushy,” or by shortcutting, “riding in on another person’s shirt tail,” or bypassing lesser roles through formal education. People do not become leaders because they refuse to be involved otherwise—the “won’t-work-so-let-lead” syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LEADING CONGREGATIONAL SINGING:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SONG LEADERS AND INSTRUMENTALISTS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virgil &amp;amp; Ruth Ann Warren&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instrumentalists serve to enhance congregational participation in worship. Their work should not distract or confuse worshipers’ participation. Mistakes should be minimized, for example, which means preparing the music ahead of time instead of relying too much on sight- reading ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introductions can establish tempo as well as pitch for each selection. So, instead of coming to a hold after the introduction, maintain a steady beat for starting the singing. Newer hymnals have marks that show what musicians can use as an introduction. Usually it consists of the last four measures of the hymn. Perhaps a better way is to combine maybe four measures from the beginning with two or four measures from the end. That reminds the congregation how the hymn begins, a useful aid especially if it is a song that is less familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LEADING SONG SERVICES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ways of Structuring Song Services&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Begin with a passage of scripture, an event, a parable, etc. Hymnals normally have a scripture index that indicates the connection between hymns and scripture passages. Before each song the leader or someone in the assembly can read a passage that correlates with the overall theme or the distinctive point of the upcoming song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pick a theme and sing songs that fit with it.  Hymnals have topical indices in the back that facilitate finding songs in that hymnal which belong to many relevant topics. If the body of the hymnal is topically arranged, you can turn to that section of the hymnal and sing one song after another. This format is useful especially if the whole service is dedicated to singing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LOVE AND HATE IN SEMITIC PARLANCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several well-known scriptures combine love and hate. They appear first as worded in the New American Standard Bible followed by the wording in the Conversational Version. The manner of expression in the latter represents what gets at the Hebrew idioms that impact this set of words. After the examples, there are notations about the rationale for the translation in the Conversional Version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genesis 29:31-30&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LOVE AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both vertical and horizontal relationships have the same interpersonal character. Experiencing the horizontal helps us understand the vertical; understanding the vertical motivates us to do the horizontal. In both directions, love is the characterizing feature. It includes most aspects of interpersonal associations and originates so many of the virtues involved in them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love is accomplished by the mechanism implicit in the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12), which restates the Second Great Commandment (Leviticus 19:18). “Doing / for others / as you would have others do for you” parallels “Love / your neighbor / as yourself.” That means love is something we “do” rather than something we feel or say. Love is a pattern of doing—self-giving for the joy of “others” without qualification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MAKING APPLICATION FOR MINISTRY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Cover Letter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applying for a ministry can have two written aspects beyond any (a) verbal contacts with the prospective church by phone or otherwise. The first is a (b) cover letter and the second is a (c) resumé. In the cover letter you can indicate how you became aware of the opening and why you are interested in the job. Depending on the circumstance, you may reinforce your interest in that ministry by relating you background briefly as well as the reason for your sense of calling to ministry. You may include some statement about your family’s commitment with you to this work. Giving a general statement of faith helps those who review applications know where you are doctrinally. They will want to know about your view of the nature and work of Christ, the nature of scripture, the process of salvation, and so forth. Christian churches will be interested in your commitment to the restoration plea. Giving your concept of ministry may also be useful. In the statement of background applicants may give an account of their conversion, especially if they became Christians after their high school years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man &amp;amp; Woman in Christian Perspective, by Werner Neuer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Werner Neuer. Man &amp;amp; Woman in Christian Perspective. Trans. from the 2nd German edition by Gordon J. Wenham. Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1991 [1981]. 224 pp. pr&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neuer begins by placing the relevance of his topic in the contemporary challenge of secular feminism, an important point because the church, in being biblical, should not be needlessly countercultural. Subsequent chapters on male-female differences reflect the natural assumption that in the family and in the church God has assigned role emphases correlated with sex in keeping with the way he has gifted males and females. Five chapters deal with the view of man and woman found in the Old Testament, the gospels, the epistles of Paul, the rest of the New Testament, and in church history. Two chapters address the continuing validity of the biblical viewpoint and the urgency of practicing it. The volume concludes with a summary of main points. Along the way, five excursi expand on texts and issues that call for more extended treatment than the ongoing presentation itself allows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MAN AND WOMAN IN ADAM AND IN CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One major argument for egalitarianism in marriage and the church pictures female deference as a fallen condition that has been reversed in Christ. “Your husband will rule over you” (Genesis 3:16) has changed to “In Christ there is no male and female” (Galatians 3:28). New Testament comments about male headship merely temporalize the Christian ideal in the interests of Christian mission. The following comments attempt to show that this scenario artificially combines unrelated ideas and overextends the cultural variable. Genesis 3:16 does not indicate a result of the curse, Galatians 3:28 is not an absolute principle, and statements elsewhere about headship are not necessarily pragmatic concessions to cultural norms that no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Such an approach is not good because emotions are not a good reading of reality, even though they may seem even more real than ideas and values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MANAGING EMOTIONS (IP)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Among the several things we can do to manage our emotions, we can tap into vertical interpersonal resources through prayer and Bible reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. Secondly, we can put ourselves around positive people who affirm us as persons. Talking about the problem to other people gets feelings into words and concepts, so they feel more objective, more manageable, and clearer. We get them “off our chest.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;christsir.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MANKIND AS INTERPERSONAL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MANKIND AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Interpersonalism applies first to mankind as an explanation of God’s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humankind is “for the praise of the glory of God’s grace” (Ephesians 1:6; cp. 12, 14). Both “praise” and “grace” apply to social activity. Praise is response to grace. What God first gave from his grace we praise him for in our response. Both God and people give and receive. God gives to people in his grace and receives praise and honor. We get from grace and give in praise. Since the phenomenon consists of two-directional action between persons, from an (a) existential standpoint the purpose of people itself is interpersonal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MARRIAGE AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marriage is a specialized interpersonal relationship. Whatever we know about personal associations in general applies most crucially to matrimony. The products of love and the ways of expressing and developing it apply to marriage more than anywhere else because of the intensity and all-inclusiveness of that relationship. Marriage is primarily interpersonal with added distinctives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marriage involves complementary relationship. The ultimate concept in marriage is oneness, not sameness. Husband and wife have complementary capacities in the full range of human personhood and complementary roles in their operation as a socio-physical unit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MEANING AS INTERPERSONAL</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MEANING AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meaning addresses the connection between things. The meaning of a word refers to its connection with its referent—what it refers to. The meaning of a part in a system refers to the purpose it fulfills in connection with the rest of the parts that form the whole. Connectivity is the essence of the theory of meaning. Now to apply it to persons in relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meaning relates to ethics. As ethical considerations stem from relationship and purpose so meaningfulness stems from those same two existential and eschatological components. Significance comes from the combined interaction of lateral and longitudinal activity. Meaning differs from ethics because it covers more than moral matters, but its interpersonal character applies to ethics because we choose to purpose what others help us accomplish and because we relate through love. The fulfillment of purpose, the experience of living, and being loved give us a sense of worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MEANINGFUL LIFE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can we give any reason for considering ourselves significant?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do we feel significant?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much of our time, energy, and resources is spent on the quest for meaning?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importance of meaningfulness&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results of meaninglessness are boredom, pleasure seeking, escape (drugs, suicide,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;etc.), hedonism, materialism, busyness, struggle for power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John 10:10b: Jesus came that people might have “abundant life.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definition of meaningfulness&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term life does not mean “existence,” but “meaningful existence.” It has to do with quality, not quantity. It includes a state of perceived “blessedness.” Meaningfulness comes from being part of a guaranteed purpose that is bigger than us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The saying goes, “The future of an event belongs to the event.” Let me explain. When something happens, it does not just happen disconnected from what is around it. Out of it flows what it leads to. That fact opens up a way to measure the importance of the occurrence. How long do its effects last? How many people does it impact? How much capacity does it have for its consequences to grow as time goes on?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But they are not just stones; they have names on them: Dowd, Donahy, Kramer, Bramhall, Nocks. These markers focus our attention on specific individuals. They are like icons on a computer. When we click on them, they open up to a vast reservoir of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are sorrows we shared, hardships we endured together, disappointments we knew, happy times at the kitchen table, and honest labor in that field north of the house. These stones mean something because they direct our attention on a mother, a neighbor, a friend, someone else connected to us. In this cemetery people have indeed remembered, as shown by the flowers beside many graves and as shown by your presence in this gathering today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;METHODOLOGY FOR CRITICAL INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO THE OLD TESTAMENT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Christians, critical introduction to the Old Testament has the advantage of inspired external evidence to confirm and complement the internal evidence for authorship, date, and character of the earlier literary works. That approach represents logical order, not necessarily chronological order. The Christian method (1) begins with the New Testament verdict of Christ and the apostles insofar as they speak on critical Old Testament issues and (2) examines the data in those books to see whether they fit the verdict. Lastly, the method (3) crosschecks each book with information available from archaeology and ancient Near Eastern literature. The New Testament sets the framework for any view of the character and manner of origin for the Jewish canon. Tshe procedure could begin with the claims in the Old Testament books and measure the contents against the claims. In fact, that is what critics do with any book, but they would not be doing it as Christians. Critics do not have to do it necessarily as Christians, but Christians can take advantage of a factor already in place for clarifying and confirming matters where it can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MINISTRY BEFORE CONSENSUS ON WOMEN’S ROLES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IN THE CHURCH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practical situations have a way of forcing us to “get on with it” despite unresolved questions. While pragmatics fosters “caving in” to illegitimate pressures, it also keeps us from letting theoretical matters make the system dysfunctional and pushes us to put things in perspective. Current differences of understanding about the range of women’s roles in the church and the home offer one more example of the qualifying effect of practical need on doctrinal theory. The need to fulfill the mission mandate suggests that we adopt an interim approach that does justice to everything we are sure about in connection with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MISAPPLYING THE CHRISTIAN SYSTEM (IP)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If interpersonalism characterizes the Christian worldview, it follows that any deviation in its formulation is likely some departure from personal relationship as its most basic, central, decisive feature. It is instructive to survey the history of the church to see how it has departed. The departures have been into one of the other major categories or some combination of them, a prioritizing of something else over interpersonalism, or a reduction from the full set of factors in interpersonalism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Out of the purpose of God comes the creation by God, of which we are a part, including people in relationship. There is a fairly close fit between our nature and human morality, but the decisive issue is God’s originating purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The image must be a creatable likeness that applies to the whole individual even after the Fall. Then we offered two sets of positive evidence for the image as interpersonal capacity to build the view “from zero.” There were two deductive arguments: (1) the interpersonal purposes of mankind predict interpersonal nature of man as the image; (2) being in the image of an interpersonal God implies that mankind is interpersonal. Finally, we made inductive observations: human peculiarities observed in connection with image terminology end up being aspects of interpersonal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW TESTAMENT CANON&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The canonical books of the New Testament consist of those that were written by close acquaintances of Christ who witnessed his resurrection (apostolicity), those that were accepted across the whole church (catholicity), and those that represent a consistent viewpoint on teaching and practice (doctrinal harmony). They contrast with books written later, books of unknown origin, books accepted in small areas of the Roman empire, and those with doctrines of faith and practice that diverge widely from the canonical books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTATIONS ON 1 TIMOTHY 2:11-12&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does αὐθεντεῖν mean “exercise authority” or “domineer”?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) The law of contrast implies that αὐθεντεῖν does not mean “dominate” since it is a correlative term with ὑποταγή in the previous verse. Ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ and αὐθεντεῖν seem to be correlative expressions like learn and teach, with which they appear. Correlative terms stand in a common larger category as natural contrasts: lost-saved, father-son, prophecy-fulfillment, faith-works, and the like. Within the same context the sense in which one is meant is the sense in which the other is used. If father means physical father, then son means physical son, not spiritual son. If prophesy means to state a significant principle, then fulfill means to be an example of that principle, not the occurrence of a prediction. Correlative terms obey the law of contrast/opposition/negation inside the law of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OLD TESTAMENT TRANSLATION NOTES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Conversational Version&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Conversational Version of the Old Testament combines two goals: (1) to express biblical material the way people speak conversationally in twenty-first-century American English; (2) to apply to the text the principles a professor of composition would use to evaluate expository writing in that style. The goals supplement and limit each other. The alterations from the wording in the original text intend not to add to, subtract from, or change the semantic content—the referents themselves. Word pictures for the same referent can differ across languages without interfering with semantic equivalency; hence, translation endeavors lose “accuracy” in smaller points like imagery/word picture, emphasis, and attitude to make it sound natural to today’s reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ORDINATION: WHO AND WHOM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ordination to ministry involves three considerations: (1) the understanding of New Testament offices and ministry, (2) the New Testament meaning of ordination, and (3) the meaning attached to ordination by society today and by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Who should be ordained?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the standpoint of the church, the New Testament does not evidence an understanding of ordination that corresponds with the traditional clergy concept. Ordination does not validate a person’s ministry. It does not bestow the right to preach, “administer sacraments,” pronounce absolution. The only ordination observed in the New Testament is an appointment to specific tasks. If done, ordination today simply commends an individual to the general Christian community. It indicates that in the ordaining congregation believes the person has the character, abilities, and skills appropriate to the calling. That has been sufficient to qualify him also for the rights vouchsafed to religious leaders by the state. So ordination has been a matter of expediency rather than necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ORIENTATION TO ORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Ordination is for the one ordained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ordination is for impressing on the person ordained the importance of his calling. People set aside time for things that are important. By setting aside time to concentrate on what it means to minister, the body of believers shows the person their regard for that calling. Ordination provides a time to be impressed with the significance of the “ministry of reconciliation,” as Paul called it (2 Corinthians 5:18-21).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PARENTING AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parenting takes place first by interpersonal means. It is on top of interpersonal process that any authority comes, and that authority is bounded in its application by the distinctive purposes at work in this special setting for interpersonal process. The interpersonal circumstance sets the attitude parents take toward their children. Children are smaller but not less. If love is the medium of interpersonal relationships, love becomes the medium for parenting. The means and manner of parenting are primarily interpersonal influence instead of physical force, intimidation, authoritative control, manipulation, and the like. One of the main means of interpersonal influence is modeling what we want to teach, commend, command, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

General evolution&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;History of the evolutionary model&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of evolution originated at least as early as the fifth century B.C. in the person of Greek philosopher Empedocles and may be traced in various forms through Aristotle, Augustine, and others until modern times. Charles Darwin gave classical expression to this much older idea when he published his Origin of the Species in 1859. He highlighted the principle of “natural selection,” which was supplemented by Lamarck’s notion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics” and de Vries’ “theory of mutations.”   Others influential in refining the evolutionary model and background factors include Maupertius, Erasmus, Robert Chambers, Herbert Spencer, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, and Mivart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Reading the account of Jesus’ own baptism would not be natural for this same reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/perseverance-as-interpersonal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PERSEVERANCE AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian growth (sanctification) relates to perseverance in Christ because continued growth safeguards against apostasy. The writer of Hebrews suggests interpersonal activity as a way to persevere. He speaks of fellowship with the faithful, imitation of the faithful, and service to all mankind (chs. 10-13).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personal relationships also connect with perseverance in that how we relate is equally relevant all along the way—at life’s end as much as at any previous time. Not only is how we relate relevant, it is determinative at each point along the way. Present relationships are good or bad in terms of present good or bad motives, attitudes, and behaviors. It is not good now because it was good before—as if past acts could override present behavior. Like any social relationship, fellowship with God in the end is not an average figured across the whole life span; it consists of how things are in the end. It is not determined by making judgment at some point in the past; it is determined by judgment at the end (the final “now”). For the same reasons, previous “salvation” relationship does not preclude present alienation any more than bad past behavior destroys present reconciliation (Ezekiel 18:21-24). There is no thought of forming a social bond that somehow remains permanent despite subsequently departing from those behaviors that were required for establishing it. The state at the end is not the result of permanent miraculous change of substantive nature (condition); neither is it a permanent legal status irreversible by decree. It is an interpersonal relationship made permanent by perseverant repentance and faithful forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This situation is particularly bad because (a) people will rarely say anything to you about it. They may hold back until it makes them angry and then when they say something about it, it is probably too late for you to do anything about it in order to keep it from ruining your ministry. These problems are also bad because (b) you do not smell your own bad breath or your own body odor. Consequently, you have to do what it takes to prevent these problems even though you do not sense any need to do so. (c) Once your clothes and shoes have picked up body odor, you may not be able to get it out of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PERSONAL QUALITIES A MINISTER NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The qualities for a good minister begin with the virtues of good Christian living. In preparation becoming a Christian minister, you cannot bypass Christian virtues and start with the developing professional skills or learning religious information. After all, ministry exists for the express purpose of bringing people into a pattern of living that is more appropriate to, and consistent with, relationship to God and other people. Below is a suggestive list of personal qualities that ministers particularly need to have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;POSSESSING THE BODY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body is what we notice first about people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is with the body that we act and relate to them: shake hands, smile, talk, hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What a person looks like is more than looks: “Pretty is as pretty does.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with all other studies in this series, the proper use of the body is relative to the interpersonal framework. That observation follows primarily because the body is our instrument of action, and sin and goodness are actions. That fact combines with the related observation that sin and goodness (morality) pertain only to actions done in an interpersonal connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRAYER AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Prayer as interpersonal activity establishes the elements of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prayer is talking to God, so it is verbal communication from one person to another, silent or oral. Talking to God includes whatever occurs in conversation: praise, thanksgiving, intercession, request, confession, promise, or just talking through thoughts and experiences. The interpersonal character of the act helps explain how our Lord could pray all night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. Prayer as interpersonal activity contrasts with practices that get confused with it or substituted for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PREACHING AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of what applies to evangelism applies to preaching. Evangelism addresses the gospel to non-believers. Preaching addresses the gospel to believers by and large since most often the term describes teaching and exhortation in the gathered community of Christians. Evangelism tends to think of itself as cross-cultural; preaching usually addresses people in the same culture. Interpersonalism calls us to remember that preaching is communication to people; so it is not oratory, which emphasizes the form of delivery. It is also not recitation, which highlights the verbalizing of information and gives the impression that it does not come from the heart, that a person is saying words into the air rather than speaking into the listeners. It is not “heart to heart” talk. Reciters are performers; they are “saying their piece.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PREVENIENT GRACE AND NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have set aside the doctrine of natural depravity because (a) natural depravity lacks adequate primary biblical evidence for it. (b) Natural depravity creates contradictions. One set of propositions summarizes an argument against natural depravity. Since God is self-consistent, the variable that explains the Great Dilemma must lie outside God. Since only God and we figure in salvation, that variable must lie in us. We must be capable of responding to God; otherwise, God would be choosing who is saved by choosing whom he enables to respond to him unto salvation while saying that he does not want anyone to perish (2 Peter 3:9). As natural depravity in effect means divine self-contradiction, natural ability maintains divine self-consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the outset we want to make explicit three notable ideas in the designation “interpersonal capacity.” (a) Interpersonal means that the image of God has to do with persons instead of things, forces, animals, or ideas. (b) Interpersonal relates the image to the social setting. The image involves more than the individual because it pertains to marriage, community, church, society, humankind as well as God’s purposes for persons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two assumptions underlie the suggestions below. (a) We need not invoke the supernatural as long as natural means can accomplish the purposes. God does not generally do for people what they can do for themselves. (b) The concern is reliability of the information, not prescription of forms (words).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PROFESSIONAL SKILLS A MINISTER NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ministry calls for a wider range of useful skills than most vocations do. Obviously you cannot be top notch in everything useful to this calling, but the more skills you have at your disposal the less you limit your ministry. Within the congregation you need to surround yourself with people who can do what you are weak at or do not have time do. You also need to develop a network of people to whom you can make referrals. Needless to say, some churches and communities do not have people who can do some of the things you need help with. In those cases, play to your strengths and do the best you can with weaker areas, improving them as you have opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture directs itself to the reader in three dimensions that correspond to the three tenses of our existence. For each time dimension there is a type of biblical literary material:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;times&#x9;&#x9;literary genre&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;present     =&#x9;wisdom literature&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;past &#x9;=&#x9;history&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;future    &#x9;=&#x9;apocalyptic and prophecy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We cannot change the past; so we focus on the present and future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PROLEGOMENA FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Précis   Neglected or misunderstood factors complicate any endeavor, including the interaction between men and women in the home, the church, and society. An unnecessary “edge” gets into discussions on this matter because of unconscious preconceptions about (a) the bases for self-esteem, (b) the nature of leaders and led and their interaction, and (c) the impact that love has on all interpersonal processes formal or natural.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary/Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proposition counter to natural depravity is as follows: there is no (1) clear (2) biblical basis for saying that Adam’s ability in regard to (3) spiritual things after the fall was any different from what it was (4) before the fall in a (5) biologically inheritable sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By “clear” biblical base we mean that some passages could be understood the way natural depravity takes them, but no passage requires such an understanding. In fact, many texts offered in support of that concept cannot have that meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL STRENGTH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We adopt the principle that the gospel has applications for most every aspect of us and our associations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological has to do with the way things seem; it deals with the subjective dimension. We are not dealing directly with mental health even though we are dealing with matters that affect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture may not directly address the issue in this study, but we can draw attention to things we see in scripture that relate to the problem of psychological strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRENGTH FROM INTERPERSONALISM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL STRENGTH FROM INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological strength comes from friendship. We often reference psychological strength to inner factors because it contrasts with outer flux; we can experience “inner peace” even during unstable circumstances. But psychological strength is not so much inner peace amidst outer chaos as it is “inter” strength from other persons. Our inner stability came from someone else. Furthermore, psychological strength ties to personhood in our commitment to an ever-present, immutable God and to others in relationship with us through him&amp;ndash;fellowship. Strength persists in the face of destruction because of one person’s concern to help others by doing what may relieve them, save them, and give them peace, power, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RANDOM THOUGHTS ON ANGER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 4:26 &amp;lt; Psalm 4:4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Be angry,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If youpl get angry,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In yourpl anger,     do not sin; don’t letsg the sun go down on your anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anger in itself is not a sin (A),      (B) manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anger can evidently be managed, because Paul says not to let the sun go down on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anger is okay. All the emotions are built-in features of humanness: fear, love, joy, anger, sadness. So don’t stifle it. Sublimating anger would surely lead to some kind of debilitating effect—depression and its own consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RELATING TO WEAKER BROTHERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relating to other believers in Christ would be easier if we were all at the same stage of growth in understanding and virtue, and if we all understood things the same way. But, we are not equally strong and do not see things alike. We must make allowance for differences to “keep the unity of the faith in the bonds of peace” and to avoid stumbling and discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RESOLVING APPARENT CONTRADICTIONS IN SCRIPTURE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RESOLVING APPARENT CONTRADICTIONS IN SCRIPTURE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Resolving apparent contradictions in scripture calls for methods of interpretation. The approach assumes the inerrancy of scripture; brain teasers often become paradoxes in wording rather than contradictions in reality. The approach also assumes that scripture is divine in such a way that makes it harmonious throughout. The mechanisms available for harmonizing scriptures with each other and with experience amount to the same things as the mechanisms used for properly interpreting human language. The same things we do to clear up ambiguities we do to resolve difficulties. Apparent difficulties normally arise because either or both sides of the dilemma are unclear, but people do not realize that at the time they sense a problem with the text. The following list is a summary of mechanisms for resolving discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What often happens is a resolution through a power struggle in which the congregation loses those with the minority opinion. There is an erosion of membership on one or both sides of the discussion. People are hard to change once they have made up their minds and have committed themselves openly to a viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;REVELATION AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Revelation is interpersonal in that it is from one Person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That point applies both to general and revelation. Not abstracting general revelation from the One that speaks in it amounts to the same thing as not abstracting creation from the creator. Personalizing general revelation equals personalizing creation. Nature has the character of revelation inasmuch as it is secondary, derivative, dependent reality. From the characteristics of nature, we can “read” something of the nature of its origin and originator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Evil has a beginning and an end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evil is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evil does not simply take over and “bully” people around undeterred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evil is temporary (limited in length).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison to good, individual evils are short-lived along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Death removes it from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SALVATION AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Problem&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity analyzes the human predicament as stemming from faulty personal relationship, which in turn stems from improper personal behavior. A great amount of suffering in the world comes from inappropriate social activity. So we cannot expect the answer to our condition to be a chemical, scientific, materialistic, or miraculous solution. As a result, Christianity does not attempt to solve the problem of our human predicament in the same realm, through the same means, or by the same method the world tries to use. It is not primarily by science or scientific technology that we raise the quality of life. It is not primarily through political, military, or legal processes that we achieve peace and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SANCTIFICATION AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of spiritual growth (sanctification) comes from the nature of interpersonal process. Under the perfection demand of law, becoming perfect cannot occur after perfection is broken. But salvation before God deals with restoring a personal relationship, which means that development toward maturity can substitute for having already achieved it and always having to keep it. We can deal with each other directionally (growth) rather than positionally (perfection) because repentance-forgiveness can make up the difference between performance and perfection. That fact is part of Paul’s contrast between faith vs. works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SELAH IN THE PSALMS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Derivation of סֶלָה&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;From the root סלה, “to rest” or “be silent.” סֶלָה (penult accent) is taken as a pausal form of סֶלָה (ultima accent), directing the leader to pause or be silent presumably for an instrumental interlude (Gesenius).It always has the same form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.  From סלה, “to lift up” (Sampey, Leupold, and “most modern scholars”). It is thus a direction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to the orchestra “to raise” the volume of the accompaniment momentarily—like a fortissimo or sforzando.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/essays/self-image-as-interpersonal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SELF-IMAGE AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christians sometimes object to good self-image and feeling good about ourselves as somehow bad. The problem comes from an overreaction. To get people to see their need for salvation, Christians sometimes overdo how evil unsaved people are. Furthermore, they seem to think that feeling good about themselves makes God’s salvation unnecessary or it makes them feel them can save themselves. Interpersonalism keeps the balance between responsibility and dependence. We are responsible for responding on our side of the relationship, but our responses on our side of the relationship do not establish the relationship. We depend on the other Person to establish it from the other side—to accept us—because he is the offended party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Showers of Blessings&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;041766&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday. PRAYER. “The prayer of a good person accomplishes a lot.” God gives liberally to us if we ask in faith for blessings that accord with his will. He is approachable. When we pray, he will not rebuke us for being so presumptuous as to ask him for something. (Read James 1:5-6; 4:3; 5:16b; Matthew 7:7.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monday. WORK. When we pray for spiritual blessings, there are things we must do. The condition for the fulfillment of any appropriate request is “If you do your part.” There is no value in asking God for new clothes if we’re not willing to work to buy them. Prayer never serves as a shortcut or substitute for work. (Read James 2:14-26.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Expressing caring&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of us are not as good as we could be at communicating to people that we care about them. We can use a number of techniques for expressing love. They include taking time to listen, to talk about seemingly purposeless things, to identify with people’s interests and problems, looking them in the eye– focusing on them, smiling, giving a firm handshake or a hug, using touch, doing something for them without being asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOME IMPLICATIONS OF LEGAL PROCESS FOR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HERMENEUTICS, FAITH, AND PRACTICE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IN THE CHRISTIAN SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basic claim: law is artificial to interpersonal process and detrimental to Christianity; law impacts interpretation, faith, and practice. We are calling the Christian worldview “interpersonal” because persons in relationship are the most original, eternal, supreme, basic, pervasive, universal, and complex aspect of the system. Christianity’s prominent vocabulary deals with persons relating positively to one another: love, faith, grace, mercy, promise, truth (in communication), conscience, heart, mind, blessing, righteousness, reconciliation, joy (vs. happiness), humility, peace (vs. national tranquility), spirit (vs. physical circumcision for naturalization into a physical nation). All the features of interpersonalism contrast with their opposites. The first and second great commandments (cp. Golden Rule) deal with love, the summarizing, most important, outward-directed pattern of interpersonal action, which produces the other interpersonal actions. As Micah 6:8 said of old, “What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God” (cp. Deuteronomy 10:12-13; Isaiah 66:2).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOME INTERPERSONAL IMPLICATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FOR ONENESS IN CHRIST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Efforts at Christian unity have variously stressed one or more bases: organizational union, common experience, or essential doctrine. Roman Catholicism exemplifies the concern for unity through the church as an institution, which is particularly fitting because Catholic theology conceives of grace as flowing through the church by way of duly ordained clergy: “where the bishop is, there is the church.” Because of the emphasis on tongue speaking, pentecostalism can illustrate the common-experience approach. Erasmus among others advocated a minimum set of essential doctrines as foundational for Christian unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sanctification must be a chosen course of action because it correlates with something that is “taught” rather than “caught.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of us have achieved the level of development we would like to have. What can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(a) They have an interpersonal character, and (b) they arise from interpersonal causes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.&#x9;SPIRITUAL FRUIT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Examples of the flesh-spirit contrast&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Galatians 5:16-25&#x9;     &#x9;The Pharisees vs. Jesus, the Judaizers vs. Paul,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15&#x9;     &#x9;millenarians, and civil religion all have the same&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SPIRITUAL FRUIT AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In scripture, “spirit” vs. “flesh” stands for the interpersonal center of life in distinction to an egocentric or ethnocentric one. It is the transcendent vs. the imminent. The terminology evidently came about because flesh takes something into itself to find fulfillment. Persons, however, must give of themselves to find fulfillment. “Flesh” stands for an individualism that fosters a competitive mentality. “Spirit” stands for an interpersonalism that fosters unifying love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STEWARDSHIP AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian stewardship belongs to the interpersonal system. In relationships, people do not live to themselves or die by themselves even as in marriage the right over one’s body does not lie in the one alone but in the other also (1 Corinthians 7:4). In social relationships, each gives of self for the joy of the others. In that same fashion, God has given of himself in creating, sustaining, and redeeming us. We are not our own; we have been bought for a price, so to speak, so life itself is ours as a stewardship to glorify God with. We give ourselves to the Lord, who first gave himself for us (2 Corinthians 8:5).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It envisions, not a consumer mentality, but a producer mentality. A person must start at the right place in order to think, feel, and act properly in this stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. SELF&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our possessions are not ours; they belong to the creator: Psalm 24:1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our privileges: 1 Corinthians 4:7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our selves: we do not belong to ourselves: Psalm 24:1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You committed yourself and your life to Christ by obeying God’s plan of salvation to the extent of being baptized. You must not submit to the temptation of the teen years when the lure of sins is especially strong. If you forsake the love you had for Christ at the first, you relinquish the hope you have through him in the end. (Read Revelation 2:4, 5, 7.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRENGTHENING THE WILL AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will is an aspect of people that links mind, emotion, and action to create what we call “person.” In addition to other factors, personal relationships impact the will, the mind, and the emotions to produce action. Will contrasts from stimulus-response; so we are more than a set of complicated electro-chemical processes. We can decide; we do not have to respond to the strongest environmental stimulus. Since we can decide, we find ourselves living by values more than by drives and stimuli. We are not the determined creatures depicted by Skinnerian behaviorism, but persons created in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRUCTURING THE HERMENEUTICAL TASK IN WOMEN’S STUDIES: WISDOM OR LAW?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are inclined to think that some reasonable explanation lies behind the variant understandings of gender roles by equally sincere and capable Christian interpreters. Something must be happening in the minds of some that is not happening in others who likewise take a proper view of scripture. We suspect that part of the difficulty lies at (a) the linguistic level. People do not remember that the imperative mood can have more than one quality, hence, our essay elsewhere on “Imperatival Intent,” which assembles the different values that imperatives and their equivalents may have. Another part of the difficulty lies at (b) the corpus level. People make different assumptions about the nature of the New Testament as a body of normative literature, hence, this essay on “wisdom” vs. “law” and the accompanying excerpt on “Confusing Advice and Commandment.” What we have to say here comes in association with the accompanying diagram.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>STUDENT PREACHING MINISTRIES</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDENT PREACHING MINISTRIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many years a number of congregations have used upper division students as preachers. The churches are small (30-75 in attendance) and rural or small town with memberships that reflect their surroundings. They are spread out across the northeastern sector of the state. Student ministries can be Sunday-only, weekend, or living at the church in a parsonage and commuting to school. The arrangements you enter into depend on your age, marital status, the financial condition of the particular church, and the kind of mix you want between practical experience and academic preparation. If a student takes a ministry in one of these situations, he needs to view his work as a learning experience of service in the church more than a leadership position. There are a number of benefits that such an opportunity can give him. For one thing, he can develop his skill at preaching. In fact, preaching is his main job and other responsibilities fill in around it. Attached to preaching is the discipline of preparing messages on a regular basis, which entails finding topics for sermons, organizing thoughts so they can be presented understandably, and gaining experience at actually making the public oral presentation. Since most of you have not done much like this before, developing preaching skill will probably take quite a bit of emotional energy the first few times until you gain some confidence and sense some acceptance by the congregation. You will probably feel “out of place” for a while since a good number of the people will be old enough to be your parents and grandparents. So the best course is to approach this task as sharing a message addressed to yourself that you are letting them overhear. You will not be “telling them what to do”; you are too young for that–if indeed you ever get old enough to look at preaching that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY GUIDE ON ASSURANCE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. A study of assurance requires an understanding of the relationship between four sets of variables:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1)&#x9;Objective-subjective evidence. Objective refers to the real basis upon which our assurance rests; subjective refers to whether we feel assured of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2)&#x9;Primary-confirmatory evidence. Primary evidence fits only with one conclusion; confirmatory evidence fits with the correct conclusion, but it might fit with other possibilities as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3)&#x9;Absolute-relative. Absolute certainty means there is no possibility of doubt; relative certainty is the kind that is sufficient for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY GUIDE ON CHRISTIAN FREEDOM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elements essential to an understanding of Christian freedom are diagrammed here in three sets of logical relationships: (1) subjective refers to our feelings about the matter; objective refers to what is there regardless of our feelings about it. (2) Plus (+) and minus (-) mean the presence or absence of the category at the left for those who are in Christ. (3) Jurisdiction of law is divine regulation of human behavior. Penalty of broken law is the guilt consequence we have for breaking God’s law. Reality means the barriers, boundaries, limitations—personal and external—in the reality where we live and what we are a part of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY GUIDE ON SUFFERING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Major portions of scripture deal with suffering-pain-calamity-death: the Book of Job, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Peter. From these books cross references identify other shorter sections on this difficult subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. What basic facts about suffering do we observe in or inferred from the following groups of passages?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Genesis 3; Romans 5:12-14;1 Peter 1:6-7&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B. Genesis 18:31?; the thesis of the Book of Job; John 9:1-3ff., 34; Acts 28:1-6&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY GUIDE ON THE SANCTIFICATION PROCESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following analysis of a Christian’s growth process produces a schematic based on the inner-outer differential. By inner we mean the understanding, emotions, and motives we have; outer means the actions we do. Each group of scriptures given below affirms something about the inner, the outer, or their relationship. Determine what that fact is and why it is important. Then synthesize all the parts into a working model of the growth process with observations on its implications for witnessing and applications to Christian education and defense of the faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY GUIDE ON WEAKER BROTHER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relating to our brothers and sisters in Christ would be easier if we were all at the same stage of growth in understanding and virtue and if we all viewed things the same way. As a matter of fact, we are not all equally strong and do not see things alike. We must learn to make allowance for differences i to keep the unity of the faith in the bond of peace and to avoid stumbling and discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STUDY METHODS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This write-up describes methods of study applied to the Book of Hebrews. It follows the examples in Merrill C. Tenney’s commentary on Galatians: The Charter of Christian Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;The synthetic method&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read the Book of Hebrews in one siting to discover the author’s overall purpose in writing the book. In two or three pages, show how each section of the book (as you perceive it to be divided) relates to its purpose as determined above. Is there any one argument that pervades all the author’s individual arguments? Remember that the purpose of writing is not necessarily the same thing as some prominent theme of the book. Themes may be used to fulfill the purpose of writing. (Note Tenney, Galatians, pp. 25-35)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SUBMITTING TO ONE ANOTHER:</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUBMITTING TO ONE ANOTHER:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 5:21-6:9&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This portion of Ephesians deals with “household teaching” on the relationship of husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and slaves. Other comparable texts are Colossians 3:18-4:1 and 1 Peter 2:(13-)18-3:7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regard to each relationship, Paul appeals to interpersonal principles to set the tone for it. In other places, he does the same thing to solve problems that impact practical relationships in the body (languages, 1 Corinthians 12-14; leadership, 2 Corinthians 10-13; etc.). He can do that because personal relationship is always the context in which further considerations exist and must exist in a way that does not interfere with that context. Paul implies that interpersonalism should carry the process as much as possible. Only when influence for practical reasons is inadequate is there a need to invoke the principle of authority (much less force).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SUFFERING AND INTERPERSONALISM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUFFERING AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture treats the problem of pain like being disciplined by a parent (Hebrews 12:5-11 &amp;lt; Proverbs 3:5). Since a personal, all-powerful, all-knowing God controls the universe, everything that happens here he either initiates or allows. Everything that occurs passes through his omniscience, his will, and his power. We can be confident that the experience will not be more than we can handle (1 Corinthians 10:13).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God’s motive for allowing suffering as far up as we can handle serves for our development much as a parent’s discipline serves for a child’s maturity. Negative experiences impress us with our dependence; they help us develop virtues like humility, patience, respect, and gratitude (Romans 5:2-4; 1 Corinthians 12:7-10). They toughen us up and cause us to seek refuge in inner security (or more precisely “inter-security”) because we cannot depend on external, natural circumstances. Suffering helps us get priorities straight and rise above our present circumstance. Hard times draw us closer together with those of like faith and like difficulty, and enable us to empathize with others who suffer (2 Corinthians 1:3-4; Hebrews 2:18). They give us opportunity to glorify God by allowing us to show that we are not fair-weather friends (1 Peter 1:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SYSTEMATIC INTERPRETATION</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SYSTEMATIC INTERPRETATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a verse or set of verses in scripture that supports the hermeneutical principle (biblical/systematic) that specific passages are to be understood within the overall context of scripture itself, or is this a logical principle of interpretation put together from experience?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question about systematic interpretation of the Bible can be asked about the interpretation of any body of communication. Systematic harmonization is the natural thing to do in interpretation; there is nothing surprising about it. We always take an individual comment in light of the whole conversation because we know enough about language to know that a person cannot say everything in every sentence. The same principle applies to a book or an author’s set of books. For the time being, we assume the author is speaking consistently between the parts of a conversation, between articles, or between books spread out even over several years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TEMPTATION AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temptation tries to get us to exchange the welfare of everyone for the welfare of self. In so doing, it attempts to call us from an interpersonal to an individualistic frame of reference. Temptation tries to get us to exchange the intangible (personal) for the tangible (material) framework. It tries to get us to exchange the eternal for the temporary and the immediate for the delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can counteract these temptations through interpersonal means by fellowship with good people and by recognizing our responsibility to help them. We can consolidate our problems by doing everything as to the Lord. That way we deal with them collectively under one solution and through a personal one. We can remember who we are and whom we represent. We also trust God not to allow us to be tempted above what we can handle (1 Corinthians 10:13). The interpersonal spiritual exercises, regularly practiced, strengthen us ahead of time for confronting problems when they appear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TEMPTATIONS IN THE MINISTRY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temptations appeal to two basic aspects of our nature–physical and social. Temptation addresses legitimate physical drives in an effort to get us to fulfill them in illegitimate ways either in excess or in the wrong way. In the social dimension, temptations come through evil example, social pressure, social reinforcement, even misunderstood good example. Temptations also play on our ignorance, taking advantage of what we do not know, misreading God&amp;rsquo;s invisibility of God as absence so as to remove that curb our impulses, and turning our viewpoint of consciousness into selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE “IMAGE OF GOD”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of my creative energies lately have been directed toward tracing through the implications of interpersonal relationship as the organizing reality for Christian truth. Nowhere has this observation appeared more relevant than in the study of the nature of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries extensive thought has gone into the interpretation of Genesis 1:26-27 and related materials: “Let’s make mankind in our image after our likeness.” There have been four proposed aspects of the “image of God” together with their effects. Reason heads the list. The ability to think abstractly relates to the capacity for language communication, creativity, responsibility (dominion), conscience, even humor, self-transcendence, and the ability to project consciousness over behind the eyes of another person. People can penetrate a situation in thought and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE ANTIQUITY AND CHARACTER OF RITUAL SACRIFICE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the higher critical reconstruction of Hebrew history, ritual sacrifice developed later than the time of Moses. The prophetic movement, beginning with Amos, opposed blood sacrifice as an appropriate way to draw near to God. The reconstruction takes certain statements as reminiscent of this earlier attitude in Israel and call for examination in light of the Wellhausen claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Amos 5:21-26&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to higher critical opinion, Amos’ opposition to feasts, solemn assemblies, burnt offerings, peace offerings, meal offerings, and songs in Israel’s contemporary worship was due to (a) their syncretistic nature, (b) their superficial manner, or (c) the polytheistic character of Israel’s worship. Amos’ objection was not to sacrifice as such, but to sacrifices invalidated by contextual considerations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE CHURCH AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Theologically the church is an interpersonal system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The church as the kingdom of heaven now does not share identity with any political entity. Civil religion and state church, while characteristic of Mosaism, are foreign to Christ’s kingdom. In the Messiah there is neither Jew nor Gentile. It is comparable to spiritual Israel, being a Jew inwardly. The kingdom of “heaven” is transpolitical, transnational, transcultural, interpersonal. The kingdom of God “suffers violence” when people try to turn it into something political-militaristic-geographical (Luke 16:16-17).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

God’s Spirit was moving over the ocean. 3God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4He saw the light was good and separated it from darkness. 5He called light “day” and darkness “night.” Morning and evening made day one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6God said, “Let an expanse separate the water 7below it from the water above it.” It happened. 8He called the expanse “sky.” Morning and evening made day two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE CONVERSATIONAL VERSION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TRANSLATION NOTES FOR THE NEW TESTAMENT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Conversational Version falls between wooden translation and loose paraphrase. It is not a word-for-word translation or one told “in our own words.” Its main contribution is at the second level of translation, the custom-of-usage level, that is, semantic equivalence. The aim has been to use a casual, everyday manner of speaking. The translation tries to follow specific patterns of form and grammar that do not affect subject matter. That includes several standard principles of written composition:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE DATE OF THE EVENTS IN JOB&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attempting to determine the date of the events in Job proceeds assumes that the book is more than a piece of literary art. The poetic form of most of the book has led some to regard it as less than historical, but form does not speak to historicity. Writers use poetry to tell the events at the Red Sea (Exodus 15) and the story of Sisera’s defeat (Judges 5). Prose fiction, on the other hand, appears constantly in modern authors. Whereas skillful writers of contemporary literature do produce remarkable works about fictitious people and happenings, it is doubtful whether that happened among the ancients. Their literature appears to have been at least a development of some kernel of historical truth, including the sophisticated poetry extant from the later Greek tragedians. Furthermore, Job is both poetry and prose, so the idea that poetry points to fiction and prose to non-fiction does not apply consistently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE DENIAL OF NATURAL DEPRAVITY:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A DISTINCTIVE OF “THE RESTORATION MOVEMENT”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One distinctive of the Churches of Christ/Christian Churches has been their relatively high view of human nature. They have stood virtually alone in denying the traditional doctrine of natural depravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the late fourth century, Augustine, bishop of Hippo in North Africa, gave classical expression to this concept as part of his understanding of the nature of evil generally. In his thought, evil is a lack (privation) in the form of substance relative to its original form. This relatively de-formed condition produces evil action. Thus, the nature of evil is lack, the cause of evil is lack in form, and the criterion of evil is lack in form compared to original form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE GENERAL PICTURE OF&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN  LIVING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity is a religion to be lived, not a philosophy to be believed. Christianity addresses the practical situation with relational living as the ultimate concern: behavior in relationship to God and other people. To put it more basically, the central issue in Christianity is interpersonalism together with its sub-units (rationality), those secondary non-essential factors (physical nature), and those matters that can be added to interpersonalism for practical purposes (legal authority and natural force).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE GOAL OF A “THEOLOGICAL” EDUCATION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People have different reasons for pursuing an education. (a) Education for knowledge has been considered a German emphasis. The goal consists of accuracy and completeness in any field of study. If anything develops out of that knowledge, well and good; but the stress falls on knowledge for its own sake and the love for learning as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has been regarded as a British emphasis is (b) education for culture. The goal here consists of fulfilling expectancies associated with one’s position in the social structure. Cultured people should know their way around in the world, be able to converse intelligently about what goes on there, and be able to place themselves and their society in the proper historical niche. The upper classes serve as tradition bearers who contribute to the stability of the present social structure. As a primary function, education reinforces social position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE AND ETHICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory of meaning, the basis for self-image, and the theory of ethics all three reference the same factors: being, action, and relationship. The previous chapter discussed meaning and self-image as the objective and subjective sides of the same thing. This chapter notes that ethics belongs to action in the interpersonal sphere. Since we have identified the image of God with the interpersonal capacity, it remains for us to explicate the principles for ethical theory that grow out of the construct established by God’s creating us in his (a) interpersonal image for (b) fellowship and (c) purpose. Action connects the first item with each of the last two. Image defines human nature/being, which behavior ties to relationship and purpose. Relationship and purpose are relational since action relates persons to others in fellowship and relates them to the results of their deeds. Action connects being to relations (ethics) even as action connected objective and subjective in the previous chapter (meaning).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE AND THE BODY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Including the Body in the Image&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter we address more deliberately the issue noted before. A long-standing debate about the image concerns whether to include the body in it. There are three ways to relate the image and the body. The body might be (a) part of the image, (b) involved with the image, or (c) analogous to the image. Several considerations go into deciding whether the body is in, with, or like the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGE OF GOD AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Interpersonal capacity” includes three notable ideas about the image. (a) Interpersonal stresses the fact that the image of God has to do with characteristics of persons rather than that of things, forces, ideas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) Interpersonal relates the image to the social setting so that it involves more than the individual by addressing marriage, community, church, society, mankind as well as the purposes of God for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE IMAGO DEI AS THE INTERPERSONAL CAPACITY:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BASES AND INTEGRATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes that the image of God in us is the interpersonal capacity. It does not necessarily say something new, but endeavors to assemble relevant factors, to clarify a viewpoint that best incorporates them, and to show its consonance with the Christian worldview. In method, the approach sets aside a reductionism that strives after identifying our “essence” and “risks” reification, faculty psychology, depersonalization, and individualism, which are tendencies that derive from non-revelatory origins. It opts instead for a combinationalism that accounts for all the features of nature, function, and relationship that’s special revelation pictures us as having and called to have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Vertical and horizontal interpersonal relationship reinforce each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, personal relationship with people must precede spiritual ministry to them. Authenticating yourself has to occur before are likely to let you lead them or turn to you when they need help. A minister is best able to influence other people if first they are convinced that he can be influenced by them—if he is listening rather than just telling or commanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I venture to say, they did not do that because she was a good seamstress, although she probably was. I venture to say, they did not do that because the garments were expensive, although she may have used the best material she could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Paul balances two important points: “not more highly” and “ought to think.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Terminology: a number of words and expressions get at this concern: self-esteem, self-identity, inner security, self-respect, self-image, self-worth, psychological strength, self-concept, self-acceptance, self-awareness, knowing ourselves, how we feel about ourselves. Self-esteem is not ego.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MEANING OF “SUBMISSION”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with other controversial matters, the biblical view of marriage and the family gets lost in the throes of pendulum thinking. Truth tends to lie between extremes, but on this issue unnecessary rigidness creates an extreme opposite and equal reaction. After a while,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;discussions on headship and submission get lost in a battle between those extremes and lose sight of the proper orientation for the subject. Emotions take over on one side, which wants to defend the accuracy of scripture in all matters whereof it speaks. The other side wants to breathe some fresh air of freedom for women and their service in the kingdom. Whenever something comes up that seems to foster one extreme, people on the other extreme react. As a result, discussion does not resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many larger churches have more than one sanctuary. Besides the main auditorium they may have a chapel that seats a hundred or so and maybe even a prayer chapel that will accommodate a dozen or so. Consequently, the church is ideally equipped to handle private weddings, moderate-sized ceremonies, as well as large gatherings. Under those conditions the facility meets the needs of practically all possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE NECESSITY OF “TONGUE SPEAKING”: A CRITIQUE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian groups have different expectancies about “tongue speaking.” Some think the gift is as available now as in the apostolic age. Others take the more extreme position that it is a sign with all genuine conversions. The following remarks address that latter position. These notes also adopt the New Testament phraseology “speaking in languages” instead of “tongue speaking” because the latter is an undefined expression that allows people to invest it with a special meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Functional unity in Christ combines with organizational unity under Christ to form this non-denominational entity that has a fivefold oneness of attitude, doctrine, fellowship, name, and organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The father, a ruler of the synagogue, did what desperate fathers do: he went to find the only help he knew, because she was ill and very weak. At the earnest urging of Jairus, our Lord turned that day from present labors and walked beside a worried man toward the object of his care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE PROBLEM-SOLVING POWER OF INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes things the way they ought to be and what helps things improve to even better levels is also what corrects what is not the way it should be. The characteristics of interpersonalism give it a problem-solving power for personal problems. Inasmuch as interpersonalism has the full range of characteristics existent in persons and associations between persons, it has the potential for solving all the problems that persons in relationship can have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE RELATIONSHIP OF INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO NON-INTERPERSONAL MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpersonalism refers to the fundamental character of reality. As such, it is a claim about worldview. Interpersonal refers to the presence of the interpersonal element, but the addition of ism describes the pervasive nature of things. The same goes for legal vs. legalism, for determined vs. determinism, for scientism, and so on. In the latter instance, the word no longer describes an aspect, but characterizes the whole. It becomes that by which a person integrates as much as possible of what belongs to the whole. Only after that exercise does he bring in secondary matters to account for exceptional or practical matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Interpersonalism adjusts the sense in which some doctrine like the trinity is to be understood. It is not simply a formal threeness-in-oneness, but an interpersonal threeness-in-oneness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doctrinal teaching includes the nature of the One and the ones we relate to. It establishes the values and purposes that govern our relationship to Him and them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE THIRD REASON&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introductory Comment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Belief in the resurrection does not wholly depend on the evidence for one unique event. That event ties into other matters that anticipated it in prophecy and issued from it in history. To a significant extent, accepting Jesus as Messiah depended on the Jews’ proper understanding of Old Testament anticipations for the Messiah. This web of evidence increases exponentially the power of the data. A different understanding of Messiah and his kingdom, however, predisposed most patriotic Jews to reject him on doctrinal grounds. Nevertheless, as Gamaliel’s presentation shows in Acts 5, the argument from the very existence of the church tended to short-circuit that doctrinal objection sufficiently to force a re-evaluation of prophetic interpretation and current policy toward Jesus’ disciples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE TRUTHFULNESS OF CHRISTIANITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resurrection of Christ and the existence of the church stand or fall together. If he did not resurrect, the church would never have come into existence, because “Messiah abides forever.” The church exists, so Christ must have arisen. Something so obviously supernatural as his resurrection verifies the claims of Christ. The church is a person-centered system, centered on the person of Christ. If he is taken out of the way, the system collapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE UNEVANGELIZED AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The unevangelized have a frame of reference by which they can approximate God’s intentions for human behavior. They experience relationships with other persons (ethics) and can read from that how broken friendship is overcome (salvation). The “noble pagan” can practice the Golden Rule (The Second Great Commandment) and “grope” after God to find him (Acts 17:27) since deity must be superior and personal (The First Great Commandment). So the unevangelized can be accountable and judged in relation to their limited perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEOLOGY FROM BELOW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isaiah declares that a wayfaring fool need not err in the way of the Lord (35:8). We, being evil, know how to give good gifts to our children (Matthew 7:11 = Luke 11:13). Jesus’ comment is a cue and clue that the way of the Lord is not that hard. At least the basics of revelation we ought to catch onto from personal experience as we “feel after God to find him” because “he is not far from every one of us” (Acts 17:27).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THOUGHTS ON FASTING&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The originating idea behind fasting may have come from the observation that when we are consumed with something important we may forget to eat (hunger). A similar thing can happen when we are working on some project and forget how late at night it has gotten (sleep). We tend to push ourselves beyond usual stamina when we are caught up in something important or interesting (energy use). Paul observes a similar thing about marital relations in 1 Corinthians 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THOUGHTS ON INTERIM MINISTRIES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interim ministry buys time for a congregation to find a capable minister suited to its needs. That factor alone is a significant gain among churches that practice local autonomy because they have no official centers for organizing information about the needs of congregations and information about potential ministers. Besides word of mouth, some Christsian colleges are about the only places that make a deliberate effort to put ministers and congregations in contact with one another. Having more time is helpful also because it sometimes takes a while to check out references thoroughly, conduct interviews, arrange visits to the church, and make arrangements to close a previous ministry and relocate. When school-age children are involved, it is often not convenient or advisable to move during semesters; waiting till the end of a term might mean a three- or four-month delay. Sometimes ministers’ spouses have employment that is not easy to leave quickly. There may be property that has to be sold. Having time takes the pressure off so a church does not feel they must take the first possibility that presents itself; they can wait for the right man for a few months even, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRADITIONAL REASONS FOR GOD’S CREATING US&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Issues can be relatively simple in themselves; and so the question seems about God’s reason for creating us. Issues get complicated when we try to distinguish our own understanding from other ones and when we have to give reasons against such alternatives, especially if they overlap our own.1 As in our positive presentation so also in evaluating other positions, interpersonalism serves as the criterion for what is foreign and contradictory to what scripture says about the nature and purpose of God and man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRIMMING BACK THEOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BY SHEDDING NATURAL DEPRAVITY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Contribution of “Restorationism”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A less emphasized contribution of the Restoration Movement has been its dispensing with the centuries-old concept of natural depravity. The idea originated with Augustine of Hippo (354-430), who was emerging from the Greek philosophical tradition that did philosophy in the ontic category, in particular, Manichaeism. His seminal notion was that evil was a privation of form in being relative to its pristine condition, with perverted function arising from the deformation. That explanation of theodicy applied to the human condition and its behavioral outworking called sin. The Reformation and contemporary evangelicalism as well have incorporated that concept into their systematics. A student of historical theology has to go from the Stone-Campbell movement all the way into liberalism to find an absence of the natural depravity concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TRUTH AND EDUCATION IN A CHRISTIAN WORLDVIEW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the trial of Jesus, Pilate remarked, “What is truth?” Jesus had just explained that he came into the world to “bear witness to the truth.” Interestingly, the truth issue does occupy the central reason for the personal incarnation of God into the world of human persons. It establishes the agenda for the followers of Christ, for “education that is Christian,” and for ministry preparation through an education process. As goes the view of truth, so goes the nature of education and the process of preparing for that education of the world that is called evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WEAKER CHRISTIANS AND INTERPERSONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weaker brother situations come up with people who differ from us. Weaker brother matters deal with issues not wrong in themselves: eating shamble meat (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8), practicing vegetarianism, observing holidays (Romans 14:5), drinking wine (Romans 14:21). They are wrong depending on how we look at them and how we do them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weaker brothers are people whose viewpoint and feelings we cannot easily share on practical matters. They may be led into sin by seeing us indulge in what we do with a clear conscience. Their danger lies in following our example with a different meaning and motivation from ours. They do so because they cannot easily know our thoughts and motives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Do You Have That You Didn’t Receive?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lord, today we consider our place in the larger scheme of things, and so acknowledge you, first of all, as the beginning of all else besides you, the sustainer of all you have made, and the basis for the hope that stretches out before us. Amen&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the question: What do you have that you didn’t receive? Obviously, you have labored long and hard in the process of life. Yet what you have contributed could not have been done without the possibilities and opportunities already in place and the abilities passed down to you. In the countryside around, lie fields where you and your neighbors work the ground, plant the seed, harvest the crops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHENCE DENOMINATIONS?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear ____,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several days ago you asked why there are so many denominations, sects, and cults in “Christendom.” Since then, I have had the issue on my mind a lot; here are some points that describe the situation as I see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Denominations come mainly from a combination of (1) doctrinal differences and (2) influential personalities. Historical situations push these two factors to combine in various ways that lead to additional factors that have produced the situation today. Beliefs and the people who hold them will probably continue to fragment Christ’s followers as similar things come up over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHY EVERYONE SINS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People sin because of evil influence that appeals to pervertible drives (all of which can be appropriately fulfilled) and each person’s viewpoint of consciousness (pervertible into self-centeredness).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WOMEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain a balanced approach in the current women’s studies debate, we should keep in mind what women did with divine approval in both Testaments. The following is a suggestive list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anna: a “prophetess” in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus’ presentation in the temple. She “gave thanks to God and spoke of him to all that were looking for redemption in Israel” (Luke 2:36-38).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WOMEN’S STUDIES AND “STANDARD SITUATION”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN’S STUDIES AND “STANDARD SITUATION”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One point in 1 Timothy 2 has to do with husband-wife vs. man-woman as Paul’s intended reference. Connecting the statements of 1 Timothy with (a) a husband-wife contrast rather than (b) a man-woman contrast represents a crucial variable between instruction on marriage roles vs. gender roles. A third approach to the text has something of the same effect but seems to be more straightforward and therefore less cumbersome: (c) Paul is addressing “standard situation,” that is, married with children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WOMEN’S STUDIES NOTATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In women’s studies, something is causing equally committed, intelligent, educated, hard-working, well-known Christians to come to incompatible conclusions, which leads to disagreement and division. Since this topic has behavioral correlates, we cannot treat it as we do the millennial question and go on about our work; this topic affects how we go on with our work. Since it is a broad-to-narrow issue, people with different persuasions find it hard to be equally tolerant; it is usually easier for a broader view to be accepting of a more restricted one than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WORSHIP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WORSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worship is a conscious, spontaneous self-expression by a person to God as a present, superior, second person. It is first an interpersonal activity toward God, then a deliberate affirmation of allegiance to him, acknowledging not only his existence and nature (goodness and greatness), but his superiority and supremacy over us in life’s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. WORSHIP IS a conscious, spontaneous, self-expression by a person to God as a present,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;superior second person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WORSHIP AS DEFINED FROM  ΠΡΟΣΚΥΝΕΩ&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worship is an interpersonal act toward God as Thou. It is a conscious, spontaneous self-expression by a person to God as a present, superior, second person. The three most important points about it are that worship is interpersonal, that it recognizes God as superior, and that it is relationship to him as second person. That understanding of worship takes its cue from the word picture in προσκυνέω, “to bow low, kneel to, or kiss the feet of another.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WORSHIP AS INTERPERSONAL&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Worship is an interpersonal act in the vertical direction. It requires awareness, imagination, and concentration in contrast to habit or a stimulus-response elicited by form, place, or atmosphere. There is no required posture of the body, just a posture of the heart and mind. There is no necessary location such as one mountain or city (John 4:21). Instead, God wants people to worship him in spirit and truth because he is spirit and truth. Spirit lies inside interpersonalism. It does not require a temple, church building, or prayer room. It does not call for quietness or loudness, stillness or movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>XENOGLOSSIA IN CORINTH</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;XENOGLOSSIA IN CORINTH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. METHOD OF RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One question about New Testament speaking in languages is whether there was more than one type. Among evangelicals it is agreed that speaking in languages was a first-century phenomenon involving actual human languages. Not everyone agrees that there was a “second type.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A.&#x9;Terminological Approach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a lack of finality in the vocabulary approach regarding γλῶσσα (tongue, language) as well as λαλέω (speak) and διερμηνεύω (interpret, translate). What a word means elsewhere does not necessarily determine its usage here, especially if it is a unique matter. The statistically most likely meaning may be set aside by the peculiarities of a special setting. Inasmuch as the meaning of an expression is ultimately determined by its context anyway, it is better to examine the characteristics of the situation than to rely on word usage elsewhere. Any uniformity that can be found, however, for γλῶσσα as a reference to actual human languages does tend to shift the burden of proof onto someone who claims a non-language character for speaking in languages. The positive evidence for glossolalia based on word usage becomes a difficulty for those who call for a special usage not evidenced elsewhere. One offsetting consideration might be that if there were no other examples of what was happening among the Christians, referring to it by the closest word available could explain a special meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOUTH MINISTER SEARCH COMMITTEE: SUMMARY REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;______________ ____________ Church&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;April 28, ____&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. Principles of the Search&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The numbered items below came into the candidate’s description either from the committee that developed the job description, from the elders as a group before the search committee was appointed, from the search committee itself, or from informal comments made by other people and passed along to the search committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These factors go beyond the assumed traits expected for youth ministers: good character, good social skills, able to establish rapport with young people, biblically sound, intelligent in ways that pertain to ministry work and doctrinal understanding, balanced in being an activist and a learner, articulate; willing to listen to peers, parents, teens, and other church workers; spiritually mature, a finisher, a planner who does not try to “work out of his hip pocket,” flexible, self-motivated, a team player, someone who can balance fun with seriousness and knows when and how much of each is appropriate, someone that does not have large ego needs, someone who can trust without being gullible, a natural leader who can let other people do things, a person with a sense of propriety in talk and dress as well as personal associations particularly with those of the opposite sex, someone who can keep confidentialities. Many of these traits are degree matters, which means they strengthen over time. Some of them are difficult to assess before the fact; for now, they can be addressed by comments from references, inferred from basic behavior, and assumed in mutual trust until experience can give verification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ΑΥΘΕΝΤΗΣ  (AUTHENTĒS)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important item in 1 Timothy 2 is a case of αὐθεντέω (authenteō) that Al Wolters pointed out at the November meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society in Lisle, Illinois.  It appears in Origen’s Commentary on 1 Corinthians, which, I believe, is one of Origen’s as-yet untranslated works. The full Greek text of the commentary is in Journal of Theological Studies, X (1909), 29-51. The reference appears in 74:20 of Origen’s Commentary. The text is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
