            <p>Jennifer Chantell Wenzl</p>
<p>On behalf of the Wenzls, I want to thank you for this wonderful demonstration of support for the family and for such an overwhelming expression of love for Jenny in this time of intense sorrow.</p>
<p>Grief is our response to loss, and the deepest loss is the loss of a person.</p>
<p>Not so much what a person does for/with us, but who she is as expressed through her actions toward us.</p>
<p>says    		       by what she says to us.</p>
<p>can do                      by how she uses those abilities</p>
<p>Our sense of loss is primarily over a loss of who someone in relation to us.</p>
<p>Identity:  Who she is.</p>
<p>Our identity is what counts.  It is out of who we are that flow our deeds and our words.</p>
<ol>
<li>First dimension:  Identity consists of our attitude toward other people.  It is love in the best sense of that word.</li>
</ol>
<p>“		“     beliefs and values</p>
<p>This is what we mean by “heart”:  “I guess it all comes down to where your heart is.”</p>
<p>HEART</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Second dimension:  Who we are consists of what we have gone through and how we have handled it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Who we are involves the sum total of what we have done.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>Then finally, that heart and that experience are brought to bear in our interactions with other people:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Third dimension:</li>
</ol>
<p>In our minds Jenny is who she has been toward us.  Again, that means love again.  That is what the Bible means when it says, 1 Corinthians 13:4-8a.</p>
<p>To the extent that these qualities are woven together in our personalities, we approach the ideal of what it means to be a person—to be who we ought to be with other people.</p>
