<p>This is the conversation thread that Barry, Jack, and I had.  To get the best flow, start at the bottom and read upward.  I realize you&rsquo;ve got a lot on your mind before you leave, so you don&rsquo;t have to bother with it until you get back, if you would rather.  I&rsquo;m not in a hurry.</p>
<p>It would be nice to know if there&rsquo;s anything I said that aren&rsquo;t consistent with what the Bible says, so that I can get a better grasp on it.  So don&rsquo;t shy away from letting me know.  :-)</p>

<p>David,</p>
<p>Marcie asked me do something for her that interrupted the email before I finished.  As to whether giving is to be done only if joyful (what I heard inferred) - totally disagree.  Joyful is a place of maturity and the end goal.  We do 100s of things at the beginning because they are the right things, &amp; then in maturity grow to joyful, etc.  I teach that in marriage.  You do it as a husband &amp; father all the time.  I shut my mouth with my wife &amp;/or encourage her because I ought to, not because I feel like doing it.  I started a totally grumpy giver &amp; God honored that&hellip; &amp; he changed my heart to a joyful giver over time because of obedience.  Now I&rsquo;m a joyful giver &amp; love to give.  This is a Biblical principle as well - where your treasure is, your heart will follow!  Actions often precede emotions.  I didn&rsquo;t start a happy witness of Jesus - I hated it&hellip; but I did it because I felt guilt &amp; knew that I should&hellip; now I enjoy it somewhat!  :)  I love preaching the gospel but it still makes me really uncomfortable to one on one share the gospel with someone - but i do it regularly.  Emotions are following action.  I get push back from some of the longest term Christians about Biblical things (witnessing being the biggest example recently&hellip; but also wanting a cross more than Christ&hellip; wanting a Christian flag when it&rsquo;s not in the Bible&hellip; saying hymns are spiritual and choruses are not&hellip; ought to preach more theology and less application&hellip; ought to ought not to out to ought not to&hellip;) that should not be preached all the time&hellip; so I do my best to preach the truth in love&hellip;</p>
<p>I totally respect &amp; love you as a brother in Christ.  You befriended me as a young stupid college student &amp; invested in me during college as the little brother of your friend, Scott (maybe you did that out of mercy because of what I must have endured as little bro! ha)&hellip; so you &amp; your family mean a lot to me.  Your dad taught me more in college than any other professor.  So you have a very special place in my life.  I just totally disagree with you on this &amp; ask that you take me at my word.  And I ask that you would stand up for what I have told you when you hear concern that I&rsquo;m preaching the law or that it&rsquo;s just about filling the bank account or whatever&hellip; just state that I believe strongly in the gift of giving &amp; that tithing is an OT illustration that I believe should be used as a starting place for teaching sacrificial giving.  I do not believe that it is a sin or essential or righteous issue or that people are loved more by God if they do or do not&hellip; As to whether I should use the illustration or not, I believe that God would want that&hellip; &amp; am doing my best to teach it accurately.  In the end if they disagree, please keep me in your prayers because it isn&rsquo;t easy standing in front of the church &amp; teaching day in &amp; day out &amp; sharing sensitive issues - but that Jack &amp; I are doing the best that we can.  That is the summary of what I told you last time &amp; this time &amp; ask that you would share if you hear otherwise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to divide us.  I love you to much for that&hellip; that is why I am trying to end it.  :)  So back to, let&rsquo;s go get some pie.  I&rsquo;ll do my best to have your back &amp; ask the same of you.  Love ya.</p>

<p>My brother &amp; friend, David&hellip; I want to both eat pie &amp; throw some in your face :)  hahaha</p>
<p>As to ending it - absolutely that was my inference because there is little good that will come from the discussion.  I totally disagree with you&hellip; but I also greatly respect &amp; love you.  The only people I have ever had a problem with when using the illustration of giving are Christian church attendees who have been around for awhile but for whatever the reason they struggle with giving or authority&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never had a person with the gift of giving ever push back on a VERY BIBLICAL example.  I will not throw out the OT that was not done away with in the NT.  I use both.  It is not a law.  I not say that it was - nor did Jack.  To say that guilt that resulted in some should change what we say is totally ridiculous to be blunt.  I receive just as many comments about the subject of witnessing - it creates tons of guilt.  It&rsquo;s a proven fact that the vast majority of Christian do NOT witness&hellip; how many times have you shared the gospel with someone in the last week? Month?  Year?  I don&rsquo;t want an answer - but i want you to think about it.  Should you regularly - yes.  Is that clear in the Bible yes.  Is that sin or righteousness, etc.  No.  That&rsquo;s a maturity issue.  I gets tons of push back on that subject saying that we discuss it too much or present it in a manner of guilting - ok.  Does that change what I preach - no.  Not only sin brings guilt - reminding people of what they ought to do creates guilt as well - and it is a fact of life.  I appreciate your heart &amp; gentleness in how you have reached out.  But what I would like to ask - since you know that I do not feel that it is law, but that it is an illustration -  did you speak up in Bible study or class to tell those who struggled or pushed back.  I would have for you.  To keep asking if I have a different motivation is to question my heart - close to saying that I&rsquo;m lying.  I believe it to be a good &amp; solid &amp; biblical illustration to teach the principle of giving.  I&rsquo;ve said that&hellip; believe that you ought to do it as you ought to witness.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are less than or worse off as a Christian.  I love ya.  I am sorry if I&rsquo;m harsh in this.  Trying to be clear &amp; I know that you&rsquo;re not thin skinned so speaking blunt.  Thank you for listening.</p>

<p>I love you both, too, Barry and Jack, and I believe that you are doing your best to follow God&rsquo;s Word and the Spirit in what you do.  As I said before, I pray for you every day that the Lord will bless you and speak through you in all that you do and say.  That being said . . .</p>
<p>. . . you saying, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t agree on everything,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;In the end, we must agree on essentials&hellip; &amp; this is not an essential&hellip; so we don&rsquo;t have to agree on it,&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really a very effective way with me to put a stopper on this conversation, like I&rsquo;m sensing you&rsquo;re trying to do.  Hee hee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not concerned with what you&rsquo;re implying as much as I am with the result that I see coming from it.    While tithing in itself is not an &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; it crosses over into an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; when guilt is experienced, and thus, you have made it an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; because guilt is an &ldquo;essential.&rdquo;  Guilt is a break in relationship, perceived or not.  Have you noticed that I haven&rsquo;t said a word to you (that I remember anyway) about tithing since our conversation in Arby&rsquo;s?  I&rsquo;ve kept quiet through every sermon you both have preached since that time.  But now there is a result that has come from it that compels me to speak out again.</p>
<p>It is not just me who is having an issue with this.  I mentioned the people in our small group.  But I didn&rsquo;t mention that the issue also came up in our Sunday School class (and, no, I&rsquo;m not the one who initiated it  ).  While guilt by the Holy Spirit is a great motivator (as Jack mentioned earlier), guilt is only experienced as a by-product of sin.  It&rsquo;s when people have sinned (actual) or believe they have sinned (perceived) that brings about guilt.  These people I&rsquo;ve mentioned have not been sinning in their giving because they have been doing it joyfully and abundantly, so the guilt they are feeling is not a motivating guilt brought on by the Holy Spirit, but is a guilt brought on by compulsion.</p>
<p>We cannot preach from the pulpit that &ldquo;we are obligated to tithe,&rdquo; and then turn around and say in secret that what we really mean is, &ldquo;we have it as an example or a principle to follow.&rdquo;  Those two statements are not congruent.  If, as you say, you &ldquo;want people to give joyously with a heart understanding that they are stewards, not owners of what they have,&rdquo; then you don&rsquo;t even need to use the very specific word &ldquo;tithing.&rdquo;  But for some reason you insist on sticking to using it.  That makes me wonder if there are ulterior motives coming into play here.  Are you afraid that if people aren&rsquo;t told they are obligated to tithe that UCC finances will plummet?  God forbid that that be the reason.  (I&rsquo;m not making an accusation against you in saying this, but if there are ulterior motives, they will be found out.)</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not saying that you are stating that &ldquo;someone is righteous or unrighteous based on tithing.&rdquo;  What I said is, &ldquo;The person who gives 9% with a cheerful heart is no less righteous than a person giving 10% with a cheerful heart, nor is there a lesser relationship with God.&rdquo;  My purpose for saying that is that tithing or not tithing has nothing to do with those things (righteousness and relationship).  Therefore, if relationship is what everything is based on (Mt. 22:40), then tithing has no place for consideration.</p>
<p>Now as far as &ldquo;obligation,&rdquo; we are obligated to use ALL of our resources to God&rsquo;s glory (1 Chr. 29:10-16, Col. 3:17, 1 John 3:17), but tithing itself is not an obligation.  We are obligated to give generously what we are able (1 Tim. 6:18, 19), but we are not obligated to tithe.  There is a distinct difference between using the word &ldquo;tithing&rdquo; (which is very specific) and using the phrase &ldquo;give generously&rdquo; (which is encompassing of all).  The &ldquo;much higher standard&rdquo; that Jesus moved us to in the New Testament had nothing to do with amounts/percentages; it had everything to do with the heart.  So again, tithing has no place for consideration as far as what we are obligated to do.</p>
<p>Are you still wanting to eat pie, or just throw one in my face now?</p>

Subject: Re: Tithing</p>
<p>David - it&rsquo;s not a law, but it is an example to follow&hellip; my position of reading the 
Bible is that 10% was the teaching place / law of the OT, but it often moved to a much higher standard in the New Testament.  So sacrificial giving in the NT was often much greater, not lesser.  As to someone&rsquo;s righteousness - we do not state that someone is righteous or unrighteous based on tithing.  You approach this differently than me, as we have discussed in the past.  You seem to be more concerned about what I might be implying rather than the heart of what I&rsquo;m teaching.  The heart is that tithing is a great example in the Bible of sacrificial giving for followers of Christ who ought to understand that everything comes from God &amp; that I want to give with a joyous heart whatever I can give.  So I want people to give joyously with a heart understanding that they are stewards, not owners of what they have.  You do as well.  The tithe discussion from a doctrinal point doesn&rsquo;t matter to me&hellip; because I&rsquo;m teaching a principle to live not a law.  Love you brother!  I promise if I switch to it being a law - I&rsquo;ll tell you.  But nothing has changed.  I know that you are not as comfortable with the illustration that is a very Biblical illustration.  I understand why you are not comfortable&hellip; you&rsquo;re a great communicator &amp; theologine.  As to my own position, you don&rsquo;t have to fully like or agree with it&hellip; just like I said in my sermon on purity - some didn&rsquo;t like it either&hellip; but I want them in church.  We don&rsquo;t have to totally agree on this to be brothers.  I&rsquo;m not changing my position, &amp; I don&rsquo;t expect you to change yours either.  Neither of us are really comfortable with the wording of the other&rsquo;s position on this one issue.  But we do agree with the heart of each other&rsquo;s position.  And if we agreed on everything, we&rsquo;d be a tiny church because even in an individual family, everyone usually won&rsquo;t agree on everything :)  So it&rsquo;s ok if you don&rsquo;t fully support the wording - but it&rsquo;s not a matter of law that we&rsquo;re discussing.  I do think that maturity starts at 10% and goes up from there - but it&rsquo;s not a law or righteousness or sin&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not something that I preach every Sunday&hellip; it&rsquo;s once a year or two&hellip; so we promise to give you pie each time to help it taste sweeter!!!  :) :) :)</p>
<p>I do love you &amp; your heart.  I wish that we saw eye to eye on the semantics of this, but I feel the heart is in the same basic place.  In the end, we must agree on essentials&hellip; &amp; this is not an essential&hellip; so we don&rsquo;t have to agree on it.  So let&rsquo;s all just keep eating pie!</p>
<p>FYI I had Jack read it real quick before sending so that we both didn&rsquo;t reply&hellip; Thanks!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m wishing I would&rsquo;ve gotten some pumpkin as well!  Ha!  Yes, I&rsquo;m a glutton.</p>
<p>In response, the Greek word used in Matthew 23:23 is edei.  It is imperfect, and what we&rsquo;d call &ldquo;past tense&rdquo;.  Using this verb as a reason to continue something into the future is not really valid in my mind.  Jesus was talking to them while still under the old covenant system, which did include tithing, but His point was that it was more important and necessary to do justice, mercy, and faithfulness than it was be so precise in lesser matters.  In Jesus&rsquo; words, they were &ldquo;straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s what Jesus was concerned with&ndash;not whether or not tithing should continue.</p>
<p>I do agree wholeheartedly with you that we are to give bountifully, cheerfully, and as we have purposed in our hearts (II Cor. 9:6, 7), and that we are travelers in this world and not citizens (John 17:16, 1 Pet. 2:11, etc.), and that everything is the Lord&rsquo;s and we give to Him from what He has blessed us with (1 Chron. 29:10-16).  These things that you pointed out are right in line with a kingdom of the heart.  However, amounts and percentages aren&rsquo;t what make us righteous or increase our relationship with Christ.  The person who gives 9% with a cheerful heart is no less righteous than a person giving 10% with a cheerful heart, nor is there a lesser relationship with God.  In a system based on the heart, weights and measures are not what God is looking for, nor does He need them to accomplish His work.</p>
<p>Looking back to the history, the tithe was setup as part of the Mosaic Law in order to support the tribe of Levi (Num. 18:21), which didn&rsquo;t receive an inheritance of land like the other tribes did, so that they could devote themselves to dissemination of God&rsquo;s law to the people.  The priesthood of the Lord was their inheritance (Deut. 18:2; Josh. 13:33, 18:7), and materially, they only received cities, distributed among the remaining tribes, with surrounding pasture lands (Num. 35:2ff).  When the people didn&rsquo;t tithe, the Levites needed to seek out other means to support themselves and would then be taken away from their primary responsibilities.  Because the people, then, were not reminded by the Levites of how God wanted them to live as a nation, their spiritual well-being, as a whole, would suffer and warnings/appeals like in Malachi 3:8-10 were warranted.</p>
<p>However, we are no longer under a Levitical/temple system which is based on the Law, nor is the church a carry-over or continuation of the Levitical/temple system.  It is a completely different &ldquo;beast&rdquo; made up of a holy priesthood, in which we no longer need Levites or priests.  We have direct access to God through Jesus Christ.  To say that we are obligated to continue giving based on weights and measures like was done in the Law is the same type of thing as saying we are to continue requiring circumcision and Sabbath observance.  Those were also matters of the physical, just like weights and measures are matters of the physical.</p>
<p>Now I think you&rsquo;ll both agree that the new covenant is not of physical nature.  So what is it about continuing a physical requirement that we are hoping to accomplish?</p>

Subject: Re: Tithing</p>
<p>While guilt caused by the Holy Spirit can be a powerful motivator&ndash;that was not our intent to humanly guilt anybody into tithing.</p>
<p>When the subject of tithing comes up in the NT context&ndash;I always refer to what Jesus said in Matthew 23.23:</p>
<p>“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. NASB</p>
<p>While Jesus was berating the legalistic side of the Pharisees&rsquo; maintaining their outward appearance&ndash;he doesn&rsquo;t dismiss the need to tithe&hellip;just that they had, in their zealousness, forgot about the more important matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness.</p>
<p>That tells me it&rsquo;s still important, still should be followed, but that it is a matter of the heart and a matter of obedience.</p>

<p>Hi Jack &amp; Barry,</p>
<p>I hope your week is going well so far.  First, I want to tell you, Jack, that your idea of calling the seating area downstairs in the 200 building &ldquo;The Garage&rdquo; is a great idea.  Now I mean no offense to whoever came up with &ldquo;The Gathering Place,&rdquo; but &ldquo;The Garage&rdquo; just sticks better.  &ldquo;The Gathering Place&rdquo; sounds very bland and dilutedly churchy.  So you have my vote if the proposal ever comes up to change it.  Or, we could just use word-of-mouth to get people used to saying &ldquo;The Garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, I realize this is a couple weeks lagging, but thanks again for the apple pie.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to get the whole thing down, but I knocked a good chunk out of it!</p>
<p>Since I know that both of you work together on your sermons, I&rsquo;m including you both.  In our small-group discussion about tithing a couple weeks ago, we had one couple (both mature Christians) who said they had been giving, but not always 10%.  When they heard in your message that we are &ldquo;obligated&rdquo; to tithe, they felt guilty that they hadn&rsquo;t been giving a full 10%.  In a new covenant system based on the heart, this is raising a red flag to me.  So, my initial questions for you are:</p>
<p>1)  Is it our intent to make people tithe by guilting them into it?</p>
<p>2)  What new covenant Scriptures can you cite that we are &ldquo;obligated&rdquo; to continue the tithing mentality in a system that is based on the heart, and not weights and measures?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to your responses.  Thank you for the love and hard work you pour into our church body.  May God bless you, your families, and your efforts.</p>
