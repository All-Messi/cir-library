            <p>MICAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Version</p>
<p>1:1A Message from Yahveh to Micah from Moresheth</p>
<p>at the Time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah.</p>
<p>What He Saw About Samaria and Jerusalem</p>
<p>Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem</p>
<p>2Listen, every nation;</p>
<p>listen, world and everybody in it.</p>
<p>Let the Lord Yahveh testify against you from his holy Temple.</p>
<p>3He’s coming down from his place</p>
<p>to walk on the mountaintops.</p>
<p>4The mountains will mash down under his feet</p>
<p>and cascade into the valleys—</p>
<p>like wax in fire or</p>
<p>water on a slope.	Mic 1:1-4</p>
<p>5That’s because Jacob rebelled</p>
<p>and Israel sinned.</p>
<p>Where’s Jacob’s rebellion?</p>
<p>Isn’t it in Samaria?</p>
<p>Where’s Judah’s main high place?</p>
<p>Isn’t it in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>6I’ll make Samaria a pile of ruins in the countryside,</p>
<p>a place to plant vineyards.</p>
<p>I’ll drag the stones of its walls down to the valley</p>
<p>and expose its foundations.</p>
<p>7I’ll smash its idols</p>
<p>and burn everything in it.</p>
<p>I’ll destroy its images</p>
<p>because they came from a prostitute’s pay;</p>
<p>that’s all they’ll be.	Mic 1:5-7</p>
<p>8Because of this, I’ll mourn and wail,</p>
<p>and walk around barefoot and naked.</p>
<p>I’ll howl like a jackal</p>
<p>and moan like an owl.</p>
<p>9My people’s wound is too deep to heal;</p>
<p>it’s penetrated into Judah</p>
<p>all the way up to Jerusalem’s gates.</p>
<p>10Don’t “tell” it in Gath;</p>
<p>don’t weep at all;</p>
<p>roll in the “dust” at Beth-leaphrah.</p>
<p>11Just move on into captivity</p>
<p>naked and embarrassed, residents of Shaphir;</p>
<p>the people in Zaaman don’t dare “come outside” its wall;</p>
<p>there’s mourning in Beth-ezel</p>
<p>because its people have no back up. 	Mic 1:8-11</p>
<p>12Those living in Maroth grow weak waiting for relief,</p>
<p>because “bitter” calamity from Yahveh</p>
<p>is reaching the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>13Harness a “team of horses” to a chariot and flee,</p>
<p>people in Lachish, where Zion’s sin came from,</p>
<p>where Israel’s rebellious acts spread from into Judah.</p>
<p>14Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;</p>
<p>the houses in Achzib have “deceived” the kings in Israel.</p>
<p>15I’ll bring a “conqueror” on you, people of Mareshah;</p>
<p>Israel’s leaders will flee to the cave of Adullam.</p>
<p>16Shave off your hair in despair for the children you delight in;</p>
<p>make yourself as bald as an eagle</p>
<p>because they’re going into exile.	Mic 1:12-16</p>
<p>Judgment Against Wealthy Oppressors</p>
<p>2:1Misfortune awaits those who devise sin,</p>
<p>Who lie awake plotting schemes in bed!</p>
<p>In the morning they do them</p>
<p>because they can.</p>
<p>2They covet fields and seize them;</p>
<p>they desire horses and take them.</p>
<p>They rob people</p>
<p>and confiscate the property they’ve inherited.</p>
<p>3So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m devising a catastrophe for this family;</p>
<p>you won’t get your necks out of the noose.</p>
<p>You won’t keep carrying on arrogantly;</p>
<p>it’ll be a terrible time for you.</p>
<p>4Your enemies will taunt you with a proverb</p>
<p>and wail a bitter dirge in mockery,</p>
<p>‘We’re ruined!</p>
<p>God is reapportioning our things.</p>
<p>He’s taking them away from us</p>
<p>and giving our fields to apostates!’</p>
<p>5So you won’t have anyone stretching out a surveying line</p>
<p>for you by lot in Yahveh’s assembly.	Mic 2:1-5</p>
<p>6“‘Don’t preach about such things,’ they say;</p>
<p>‘disgrace won’t catch up with us.’</p>
<p>7Are you really saying such a thing, House of Jacob?</p>
<p>Isn’t Yahveh’s Spirit patient?</p>
<p>Does he do such things?</p>
<p>Don’t his words do good</p>
<p>for those who do right?</p>
<p>8My people rise up against my people;</p>
<p>they strip robes off the peaceful,</p>
<p>off of people that go along innocently</p>
<p>with no thought of fighting.</p>
<p>9They evict my people’s women from their pleasant homes</p>
<p>and forever strip away from their children</p>
<p>the splendor I would give them.</p>
<p>10Get up and get out of here!</p>
<p>this is no longer a place to rest;</p>
<p>there’s sinfulness here</p>
<p>that brings painful destruction.</p>
<p>11If a liar full of hot air tells you</p>
<p>he’ll preach about the fun of wine and alcohol,</p>
<p>he’ll certainly get a hearing from you!	Mic 2:6-11</p>
<p>12“I’ll assemble you, Jacob, remnant of Israel,</p>
<p>and put you together like sheep in a fold;</p>
<p>like a flock in its pasture,</p>
<p>you’ll be a noisy crowd in your land.</p>
<p>13The One that opens the gate will lead you out;</p>
<p>you’ll break out of exile through it.</p>
<p>Your King will go out ahead of you,</p>
<p>Yahveh at the lead.” 	Mic 2:12-13</p>
<p>Judgment Against Israel’s Leaders</p>
<p>3:1I said,</p>
<p>“Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel.</p>
<p>Aren’t you supposed to know what’s good,</p>
<p>2you that hate good and love evil,</p>
<p>who skin my people alive,</p>
<p>pull the meat off their bones,</p>
<p>3eat their flesh,</p>
<p>break up their bones in pieces,</p>
<p>and chop them up for the pot</p>
<p>like meat in a kettle?”</p>
<p>4You’ll call out to Yahveh,</p>
<p>but he won’t answer you;</p>
<p>he’ll turn away from you</p>
<p>because of all your sins.	Mic 3:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh says this about you prophets</p>
<p>that mislead my people:</p>
<p>“When you have something to eat,</p>
<p>you prophesy peace;</p>
<p>But you declare holy war against anyone</p>
<p>that doesn’t feed you.</p>
<p>6Consequently, you’ll have nights without visions,</p>
<p>darkness without fortunetelling.</p>
<p>The sun will set on you prophets;</p>
<p>the day will get dark over you.</p>
<p>7You seers will be put to shame;</p>
<p>you fortunetellers will be disgraced.</p>
<p>You’ll have to cover your mouths in humiliation</p>
<p>because I won’t answer you.”</p>
<p>8But I’m filled with power—</p>
<p>with the Spirit of Yahveh—</p>
<p>with justice and courage</p>
<p>to declare to Jacob his transgression,</p>
<p>to Israel his sin.	Mic 3:5-8</p>
<p>9Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel,</p>
<p>who abhor justice and twist the truth,</p>
<p>10who build Zion with bloodshed</p>
<p>and Jerusalem with violence.</p>
<p>11You leaders render verdicts for a bribe;</p>
<p>you priests teach for hire;</p>
<p>you prophets tell fortunes for money.</p>
<p>Yet you want to rely on Yahveh and say,</p>
<p>“Yahveh’s with us, right?</p>
<p>Catastrophe won’t happen to us.”</p>
<p>12So, because of you,</p>
<p>they’ll plow Zion like a field;</p>
<p>Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins;</p>
<p>the Temple mount will be a full-grown forest. 	Mic 3:9-12</p>
<p>The Mountain of Yahveh</p>
<p>4:1In the last days,</p>
<p>the mountain Yahveh’s Temple’s on</p>
<p>will be the tallest mountain.</p>
<p>It will loom above the hills,</p>
<p>and the people from many nations will stream to it.</p>
<p>2They’ll say,</p>
<p>“Let’s go up to Yahveh’s mountain,</p>
<p>to the Temple of Jacob’s God,</p>
<p>so he can teach us his ways,</p>
<p>and we can follow in his paths.”</p>
<p>The Law will go out from Zion,</p>
<p>Yahveh’s message from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3He’ll mediate between many nations</p>
<p>and settle disputes between powerful countries far away.</p>
<p>They’ll hammer their swords into plowshares</p>
<p>and their spears into pruning hooks.</p>
<p>Nation won’t attack nation</p>
<p>or train for war anymore.</p>
<p>4Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree,</p>
<p>and nobody will make them afraid;</p>
<p>the LORDY has said so.	Mic 4:1-4</p>
<p>5The nations conduct themselves</p>
<p>in the name of their gods;</p>
<p>we will follow Yahveh our God forever.</p>
<p>Israel’s Future Rescue from Exile</p>
<p>6“At that time,” Yahveh says,								“I’ll assemble the lame</p>
<p>and gather the exiles that I’ve oppressed.</p>
<p>7I’ll make the lame a remnant</p>
<p>and the outcasts a powerful nation.</p>
<p>I’ll reign over them on Mount Zion permanently.</p>
<p>8Your former dominion will revert to you,</p>
<p>tower of the flock, hill of Zion, kingdom of Jerusalem.	Mic 4:5-8</p>
<p>9“Now why are you crying out?</p>
<p>Don’t you have a king?</p>
<p>Has your advisor perished</p>
<p>and agony seized you as in childbirth?</p>
<p>10Writhe and groan, inhabitant of Zion,</p>
<p>like a woman in labor,</p>
<p>because you’ll leave the city</p>
<p>to live in open country,</p>
<p>and go to Babylon.</p>
<p>But I’ll rescue you</p>
<p>and redeem you from your enemies there.</p>
<p>11Now many nations have gathered against you, saying,</p>
<p>‘Let’s desecrate it;</p>
<p>let’s take pride in destroying Zion.’</p>
<p>12But they don’t know what I’m thinking</p>
<p>or understand my purpose,</p>
<p>because I’m going to gather them up</p>
<p>like bundles for a threshing floor.</p>
<p>13Get up and thresh, Zion.</p>
<p>I’ll give you iron horns and bronze hoofs</p>
<p>so you can pulverize many nations</p>
<p>and the wealth of their unjust gain you can devote to me,</p>
<p>the Lord of the whole world.	Mic 4:9-13</p>
<p>A Promised Ruler from Bethlehem</p>
<p>5:1“Muster your troops, Jerusalem;</p>
<p>they’re laying siege against you;</p>
<p>they’ll hit Israel’s leader in the face with a rod.</p>
<p>2But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,</p>
<p>though you’re small among Judah’s clans,</p>
<p>you’ll have a ruler come out of you on my behalf in Israel.</p>
<p>His origins are from long ago, from ancient times.”</p>
<p>3Israel will be abandoned</p>
<p>till the one that’s in labor has the child;</p>
<p>then the rest of his relatives</p>
<p>will come back from exile.</p>
<p>4He’ll stand up and shepherd his flock</p>
<p>with the power and majesty of Yahveh his God;</p>
<p>they’ll be able to remain secure</p>
<p>because at that time he’ll be great everywhere.</p>
<p>5He’ll give us peace.	Mic 5:1-5a</p>
<p>When the Assyrians invade our land</p>
<p>and overrun our fortresses,</p>
<p>we’ll fight back</p>
<p>with seven shepherds, eight princes leading us.</p>
<p>6They’ll shepherd Assyria with the sword,</p>
<p>Nimrod’s land with swords drawn.</p>
<p>Yahveh will deliver us from them</p>
<p>when they attack our land</p>
<p>and try to tramp all over our territory.</p>
<p>A Remnant to Be Delivered</p>
<p>7Then the remnant of Jacob left in the land</p>
<p>will live among many nations</p>
<p>like dew from Yahveh,</p>
<p>like showers on grass</p>
<p>that mortals can’t restrain,</p>
<p>that no one can delay. 	Mic 5:5b-7</p>
<p>8The remnant left in Jacob</p>
<p>will live among many nations</p>
<p>like a young lion in a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>He mauls and mangles as he goes;</p>
<p>no one can stop him.</p>
<p>9He’ll raise his hand against his enemies</p>
<p>and wipe them out.</p>
<p>10“At that time,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll get rid of your horses</p>
<p>and destroy your chariots.</p>
<p>11I’ll demolish your towns</p>
<p>and tear down your defenses.</p>
<p>12I’ll abolish sorcery;</p>
<p>you won’t have fortunetellers anymore.</p>
<p>13I’ll get rid of your carved images and sacred pillars</p>
<p>so you won’t worship what you’ve made.</p>
<p>14I’ll pull up your Asherah poles</p>
<p>and destroy your pagan cities.</p>
<p>15I’ll carry out angry revenge</p>
<p>on nations that refuse to obey.”	Mic 5:8-15</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Case Against Israel</p>
<p>6:1Listen to what Yahveh says:</p>
<p>“Present to the mountains your case against me;</p>
<p>let the hills hear your complaint.</p>
<p>2But then listen, mountains, to Yahveh’s complaint,</p>
<p>you enduring foundations of the world.</p>
<p>He has a suit against his people;</p>
<p>he’ll bring charges against Israel.</p>
<p>3“What have I done to you, my people?</p>
<p>How have I wearied you? Answer me.</p>
<p>4I brought you out of Egypt</p>
<p>and ransomed you from slavery.</p>
<p>I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you,</p>
<p>5My people, remember now</p>
<p>the curse that Balak, king of Moab, proposed,</p>
<p>the blessing that Balaam Ben-Beor answered with,</p>
<p>the laws that led you from Shittim to Gilgal,</p>
<p>so you could learn about myY faithfulness.” 	Mic 6:1-5</p>
<p>6What should I bring to Yahveh?</p>
<p>What should I bow with before God on high?</p>
<p>Should I come to him with burnt offerings</p>
<p>and yearling calves?</p>
<p>7Does Yahveh delight in thousands of rams,</p>
<p>in 10,000 rivers of olive oil?</p>
<p>Am I to present my firstborn for my transgression,</p>
<p>the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p>
<p>8No, he’s told you what’s good:</p>
<p>what does Yahveh require from you</p>
<p>but to do good, love kindness,</p>
<p>and walk humbly with him?	Mic 6:6-8</p>
<p>Israel’s Guilt and Punishment</p>
<p>9Yahveh will call out to the city—</p>
<p>it’s wise to respect him—</p>
<p>“Listen, tribe and city council.</p>
<p>10Can I overlook the wealth gained from cheating</p>
<p>that’s in sinners’ houses</p>
<p>and the short measure that’s accursed?</p>
<p>11Can I acquit a businessman that uses dishonest scales</p>
<p>and a bag of false weights?</p>
<p>12The rich in the city extort;</p>
<p>its residents lie and deceive.	Mic 6:9-12</p>
<p>13So I’ll send diseases to strike you down,</p>
<p>and bring you to ruin for your sins.</p>
<p>14You’ll eat, but you won’t be satisfied;</p>
<p>there’ll be hunger among you.</p>
<p>You’ll store up for safe keeping,</p>
<p>but I’ll deliver most of it to the sword.</p>
<p>15You’ll plant, but not harvest;</p>
<p>you’ll tread olives, but not anoint yourself with the oil;</p>
<p>you’ll tread grapes, but not drink the wine.</p>
<p>16You’ve followed the statutes of sinful Omri</p>
<p>and the example of Ahab;</p>
<p>you’ve taken their advice.</p>
<p>So I’ll deliver you to destruction</p>
<p>and your people to ridicule;</p>
<p>you’ll endure the nations’ scorn.”	Mic 6:13-16</p>
<p>Israel’s Misery Turned to Hope</p>
<p>7:1Misfortune is waiting for me!</p>
<p>I feel like people that pick fruit and gather grapes</p>
<p>but have no clusters to eat</p>
<p>or first-ripe figs to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>2Godly people have disappeared;</p>
<p>there aren’t any good ones left.</p>
<p>They all premeditate murder;</p>
<p>each hunts the other with a net.</p>
<p>3Both hands do evil well,</p>
<p>officials and judges both demand bribes,</p>
<p>influential people vie for preferential treatment;</p>
<p>together they weave injustice.	Mic 7:1-3</p>
<p>4The best of them are like briars;</p>
<p>the most godly are like a thorn hedge.</p>
<p>They can post a watchman,</p>
<p>but their punishment will still come;</p>
<p>their confusion is at hand.</p>
<p>5Don’t trust your neighbor,</p>
<p>don’t confide in a friend,</p>
<p>be careful what you tell your wise</p>
<p>6Son treats father with contempt;</p>
<p>daughter defies mother,</p>
<p>daughter-in-law defies mother-in-law;</p>
<p>people have enemies in their own families.	Mic 7:4-6</p>
<p>7But I will look to Yahveh;</p>
<p>I’ll wait for God, who keeps me safe.</p>
<p>He’ll listen to me.</p>
<p>8Don’t gloat over me, adversary.</p>
<p>Though I fall, I’ll get up;</p>
<p>though I live in the dark, Yahveh’s my light.	Mic 7:7-8</p>
<p>9I’ll bear Yahveh’s indignation</p>
<p>because admittedly I’ve sinned against him;</p>
<p>then he’ll give me justice against my enemy.</p>
<p>He’ll bring me out to the light,</p>
<p>and I’ll be able to see his goodness.</p>
<p>10As a result, my enemy will see it too</p>
<p>and be put to shame who said,</p>
<p>“Where’s Yahveh your God?”</p>
<p>I’ll watch while he’s tramped on</p>
<p>like dirt on a road.</p>
<p>11It’ll be a time, Israel, for rebuilding your walls</p>
<p>and extending your boundaries,</p>
<p>12a day when people come to you</p>
<p>from Assyria and the cities of Egypt—</p>
<p>from Egypt to the Euphrates,</p>
<p>from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.</p>
<p>13But first the land will become desolate</p>
<p>because of what its people have done.	Mic 7:9-13</p>
<p>14Shepherd your people with your staff,</p>
<p>your flock that lives alone in a woods</p>
<p>surrounded by productive fields.</p>
<p>Let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead</p>
<p>like they did in the old days.</p>
<p>15“I’ll show you amazing miracles</p>
<p>like I did when you came out of Egypt.”</p>
<p>16Nations will see them</p>
<p>and be embarrassed at their own weakness.</p>
<p>They’ll put their hand over their mouth in awe,</p>
<p>and their ears will pop.</p>
<p>17They’ll lick dust like a snake,</p>
<p>like a reptile in the dirt.</p>
<p>They’ll come cringing out of their fortresses</p>
<p>and turn to Yahveh our God.	Mic 7:14-17</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Compassion for Israel</p>
<p>18What God is like you, that pardons sin</p>
<p>and passes over the rebellious acts</p>
<p>the remnant of his permanent possession has done?</p>
<p>19You’ll show us mercy again,</p>
<p>tread our iniquities underfoot,</p>
<p>throw our sins in the sea.</p>
<p>20You’ll show covenant faithfulness to Jacob,</p>
<p>enduring love to Abraham</p>
<p>like you swore to our ancestors so long ago.	Mic 7:18-20</p>
