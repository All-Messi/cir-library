            <p>CHURCH LEADERSHIP</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>A. When you studies church leadership, you must adopt the principles of leadership applicable in any field. There are several fields of thought that must be studied.</p>
<p>l. 	Counseling</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Administrative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching, which applies to prospects, new Christians, and quite often the entire church, needs to include the elementary things of God’s word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discipline (which is also teaching and restoration):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. 	in love (Galatians 6:l, 2)</p>
<p>b. 	in firmness</p>
<p>c. 	in scope: in doctrine and Christian living.</p>
<p>B. Christ as King of His Kingdom</p>
<p>l. 	All rule is under Him.</p>
<p>a. 	In the Old Testament, people are under God.</p>
<p>b. 	In the New Testament, they are under Christ, God’s Son (1 Corinthians</p>
<p>l5:24-27).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Christ established the church.</li>
</ol>
<p>a. 	He set forth the values by which it is governed.</p>
<p>b.	The New Testament is our guide.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Each congregation is responsible for staying within the guidelines Christ has laid down through his apostles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Testament is the sole guide in all teaching matters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>C.  Apostolic precedent: what Jesus gave the apostles and they gave the church.</p>
<p>l. 	Jesus taught and commissioned the apostles.</p>
<p>(Paul said all were bound by what Christ spoke.)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>There is no liberty in departing from what Christ taught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liberty in human judgment takes place only where Christ and the apostles</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>have not spoken.</p>
<p>II. Church leadership breakdown</p>
<p>A. Services in the New Testament church</p>
<p>l.  Apostles (temporary)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Prophets (temporary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evangelists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deacons?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>B.	The New Testament qualifications and responsibilities (1 Timothy 3:1-19; Titus 1:6-9; 1 Peter 5:l-5; Acts 20:1-28, etc.).</p>
<p>C. 	Office or function: positions created out of need.</p>
<p>D. 	Work to be done</p>
<p>l. 	The frequent practice that elders are to preside at the communion table, offer prayers, and attend board meetings; deacons to serve the emblems, take up the offerings and attend board meetings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>There is no warrant in the Scripture for that traditional practice. They may perform these functions, of course, but Scripture gives other things as their functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>E.  Duties and responsibilities</p>
<p>l. 	Elders are to lead well: teach, guide, counsel, superintend, exercise oversight,</p>
<p>shepherd, etc.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The elders are not dictators, “not lording it over the flock,” but watching and</li>
</ol>
<p>guarding the flock.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The functions of all the leaders and teachers in the church should be understood by all the members.</li>
</ol>
<p>III. Business affairs of the church</p>
<p>A. Most states have laws that require charters and bylaws. (Their purpose is to give state and federal government guidelines for tax purposes and mailing permits.)</p>
<p>B. 	1 Corinthians l4:40 says, “All things should be done decently and in order.”</p>
<p>l. 	Bylaws are an aid in proper procedure, not doctrine.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Robert’s Rules of Order help if modified to fit the needs of the church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the courthouse for requirements of your state.</p>
</li>
