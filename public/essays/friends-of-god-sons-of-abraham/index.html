            <p>FRIENDS OF GOD, SONS OF ABRAHAM</p>
<p>PART ONE</p>
<p>Foundation for the Idea</p>
<p>“He is a friend of God.” That is about the best thing that can be said about someone. And that classic expression is what Abraham was called—the father of the faithful, the one through whose seed all the people groups of the world would be blessed. In the mouth of God himself, Isaiah uses that designation: “Abraham my friend” (Isaiah 41:8; cp. James 2:23; 2 Chronicles 20:7).</p>
<p>Plain List of Implications</p>
<p>This fundamental point in revelation clarifies and simplifies a host of matters in Christian belief and practice, not the least of which are several aspects of salvation. Friendship sets the character of associated topics within it:</p>
<p>what the relationship is and what it is based on,</p>
<p>what values and behaviors are relevant to this relationship,</p>
<p>what lostness is and what causes it,</p>
<p>what salvation is and how it occurs,</p>
<p>how Christ saves us,</p>
<p>how salvation is both universal and limited,</p>
<p>why we cannot save ourselves,</p>
<p>who sets the “terms” of salvation,</p>
<p>what kinds of acts are relevant to renewal of friendship,</p>
<p>why human responses are necessary but not efficient,</p>
<p>why salvation cannot be dispensed through third parties,</p>
<p>how salvation is both permanent and reversible,</p>
<p>what assurance of salvation is like,</p>
<p>how neither perfection nor lawlessness is the case,</p>
<p>how perfection is involved yet not possible,</p>
<p>Christ’s role in our continued relationship to God,</p>
<p>what things are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Once over lightly</p>
<p>Our first effort unpacks significant characteristics of friendship that answer to salvation matters. Then we will return to several of these issues and see how biblical revelation confirms what we can already deduce, starting with what it means to be a friend.</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>(1) what values and behaviors are appropriate in a healthy friendship, or (a) positive interpersonal relationship generally (not selfishness) and then which ones are appropriate to (b) this friendship and what behaviors are appropriate to (c) relationship with other friends of God. It shows what matters are (d) irrelevant/foreign or indifferent (+ or -).</p>
<p>Friendship describes our intended relationship to God. We live, not in chaos, but amidst order and form. That means we live in relationships, including person-to-person ones, especially interpersonal relationship with God. That association is intended to be a close positive personal relationship, that is, a friendship.</p>
<p>Friendship requires shared values and purposes as expressed in behavior. People we know about, acquaintances we have met, neighbors and fellow workers we are around, and even relatives are not as close as friends. Friendships arise only through intangibles held in common and positive interaction in terms of them. The issue is not simply behavior, but person-to-person behavior, specifically behavior toward the friend and even more specifically behavior that reflects their values and purposes as friends.</p>
<p>(2) what lostness is and what causes it</p>
<p>What friendship is implies what lostness is—estrangement, alienation, division, separation. Loss of friendship comes from behavior inappropriate to the friendship—by “sin.” So lostness is not caused by third parties, birth, inheritance, race, or state of being, but by behavior contrary to positive relations.</p>
<p>(3) what salvation is</p>
<p>What lostness is, implies what salvation is. Salvation is reconciliation—deliverance from the estrangement caused by bad behavior. So it does not deal with other kinds of deliverance as from states of being, natural, legal, or otherwise. Saved and lost are correlative terms that correspond with reconciled and estranged.</p>
<p>Basis</p>
<p>(4) how salvation occurs</p>
<p>Reconciliation comes by identification with the other person and by committing to common values and purposes. That process is comprised of a repentance-forgiveness process—repentance on the one side and forgiveness on the other. The repentance is for breaching the friendship and resolving again to operate appropriately to the kind of friendship that can exist between people and God.</p>
<p>Reconciliation is not accomplished by one side. The offender does not just decide that the fellowship is “on” again; the offended person may not be willing to take him back—perhaps because the sin was too extreme to forgive or too recurrent to deem changeable. Either side may take the initiative, but the offended person finalizes it. Choice occurs on both sides. The offender may decide to initiate reconciliation, but the offended must decide to accept. The offended may decide to initiate, but the offender must decide to accept.</p>
<p>In human-divine friendship, not only is God willing for all to come back, but he has taken the initiative; yet we must accept the offer. If choice to accept is not involved in the reconciliation, the resulting relationship would not be friendship or fellowship, it would be something else. So, salvation as reconciliation is not unconditional; it is conditioned on acceptance.</p>
<p>Salvation calls for a reversal of what caused the estrangement—a reversal of behavior. That means salvation as reconciliation does not come by acquiring special knowledge (metaphysics) or by the authority in a legal process (law). Nor does it come about by change of creatable nature, the change of the “stuff” of which we are made (ontic, hypostatic, substantive). Causes produce results after their own kind. What causes reconciliation necessarily involves changed interpersonal behavior.</p>
<p>(5) how Christ saves us into relationship to the Father</p>
<p>In reconciliation through Christ, he is not really a third party along with us and the Father. For one thing, he himself is deity; but beyond that, he is Son of God in the sense that he is like God—righteous, the One in whom the Father is “well pleased,” one whose shares the Father’s values and purposes—besides sharing his nature. Identifying with him amounts to identifying with God as when we say, “A friend of yours is a friend of mine.” Christ and the Father stand united on the same side of the friendship across from us. That amounts to saying Christ is not a third party. The holy God is willing to count us a righteous if we are willing to identify with his son, the Messiah, who is holy like the Father.</p>
<p>(6) what behaviors are appropriate to renewing friendship</p>
<p>Most basic is being sorry for offending behaviors and the intension not to repeat them. Past sin itself cannot be changed, but the past is not the issue. The real issue is what a person is like in the present. Although the past cannot be changed, it can be removed from having an impact on relationship now. So, repentance on one side combines with forgiveness on the other. The offender says, “That is no longer the kind of person I am or intend to be. I separate myself from that kind of living.” The offended says, “I accept your repentance and no longer consider you the kind of person you were. I will not hold your past against you.” With both sides separating the offender from his past behavior, nothing stands between the two to void their friendship.</p>
<p>(7) who establishes the “terms” of salvation</p>
<p>Within the repentance-forgiveness format, the offended party sets the conditions of reconciliation. Not only does the offender not just decide to renew the friendship, but he is wholly dependent on the choice of the other. So to speak, the offended party is sovereign in friendship renewal.</p>
<p>Application</p>
<p>(8) why we cannot save ourselves</p>
<p>Reconciliation is brought about by the offended party. Since a friendship has two sides, it takes two sides to re-establish one. Offenders are in no position to “set things right” on tiheir own, and the offended party is under no obligation to take them back. Being sorry does not reconcile, even though it is necessary for reconciliation. The offender is at the mercy of the grace of the offended.</p>
<p>(9) how the scope of salvation is both universal and limited</p>
<p>The universal and limited aspects of salvation correspond again to the two sides of the relationship. On the divine side, God has opened salvation to everyone. On the human side, individuals limit the possibility by rejecting the universal offer. Universal option lies on the divine side; limited acceptance lies on the human side.</p>
<p>(10) why and how responses are necessary but not efficient (cause vs. condition)</p>
<p>Repentance plus forgiveness separates the offender from his past. The primary “condition” for forgiveness is repentance: where there is no repentance there is no forgiveness unto reconciliation. Repentance includes both repudiation of the past and resolution toward the future. In addition, it leads to restitution when possible.</p>
<p>Those things that constitute repentance (and the trust it is based on) do not produce the result. Repentance is not a cause, but a condition. Conditions are not done to the result, but to the person who gives the result. If the result is goodness, no human act or set of them can reproduce the goodness because the standard is perfection in any relationship; once perfection is broken, it cannot be overcome.</p>
<p>More to the point, the result is not goodness per se, but reconciliation. In reconciliation the result has to be given by the offended party, and the act of one does not cause the other—because of what will is. “The quality of mercy is not forced.” Causes are done to results; conditions are done to persons. Neither perfection nor reconciliation is the kind of result that can be caused by an offender.</p>
<p>(11) not dispensed through proxies, or third parties.</p>
<p>Friendships are established directly by the persons involved. Third parties have no place in effecting the reconciliation any more than third parties have a place in effecting the estrangement in the first place. Such matters are decided only by the friends themselves.</p>
<p>Friendships are established directly by the persons involved. Authority cannot create personal results. Authority cannot be delegated to proxies who thereby have a right to pronounce reconciliation on behalf of others. That is so because of what friendship is; it is always and only direct, and it is always and only by personal choice. Legal process would be external to the persons; it would be neither direct nor personal because it would be done by others by authority, miracle, or enlightenment.</p>
<p>Continuation</p>
<p>(based on the same principles as application vs.</p>
<p>Galatianism, perfectionism, antinomianism)</p>
<p>(12) how salvation can be both permanent and reversible</p>
<p>When people enter a friendship, they give no thought about time. By their nature, friendships are open-ended and permanent, and there is no reason for them to end; they never “wear out.” If a person enters a relationship as something temporary, he probably has ulterior motives, but friendship does not abide selfishness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even though no one gives any thought to how long a friendship will last in its beginning, friendships nevertheless do end because of inappropriate subsequent behavior, incompatible purposes, or lack of continued interaction. As marriage—a specialized kind of friendship—is “till death do us part,” yet there is divorce. Although friendships have potential permanence, they can be undone.</p>
<p>Just as it takes two sides to establish a friendship, it takes two sides to maintain it. Neither person alone maintains the unity. It would not be possible to guarantee permanence of friendship without overriding the will. If one side were to override the will of the other, it would cease to be a friendship; it would be a person-thing or person-animal relationship rather than a person-person one.</p>
<p>(13) the kind of thing assurance of salvation is (on our side:</p>
<p>continued growth in understanding, fellowship, and service to all mankind—Hebrews outline; on God’s side: total dependability—faithfulness)</p>
<p>(14) how neither perfection nor antinomianism are appropriate;</p>
<p>(based most specifically on continued identify with,</p>
<p>friendship with; friendships do not require absolute</p>
<p>righteousness)</p>
<p>we cannot “presume on this friendship”</p>
<p>The dynamics of friendship avoid the extremes of perfectionism and antinomianism. As to the perfection extreme, in personal relationship perfection remains the goal and aspiration, though it is not an achievement. Actual, achieved perfection is not inherently necessary to a friendship because repentance-forgiveness removes the foreign and contrary elements from affecting the ongoing relationship. Actions in a relationship are done to the other person (condition) rather than to a standard (cause). Consequently, the past can be escaped. It is not the past act but the present relationship that matters, because the other person can say that the past act no longer affects the relationship. It is not simply the cumulative actions of the person by himself relative to the standard, but the effective relationship with the other person that is the goal. Repentance (on one side) and forgiveness (on the other side) override any failures that come up between the friends. The other person says that past acts do not affect present relations as long as he believes that the actions of the first person are now repudiated. The concern is motive and attitude exemplified by pattern of behavior more than individual acts. Perfection is involved as a goal, but not achievable. Inasmuch as we do not want to displease a friend in any respect, we are saying that perfection is the common standard between us. In our failures, we understand that in friendship with God lostness as well as salvation is conditional rather than causal because the process passes through the will of the other person. As John puts it, “The blood of Jesus Christ continues to cleanse us from all sin” (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>As to the antinomianism extreme, we know that behavior affects friendship negatively as surely as it does positively. We also know that extreme bad behavior is no more acceptable than extreme good behavior is necessary. Antinomianism looks sensible only if “salvation” is regarded as something other than positive interpersonal relationship or as something selfish. With friends, we have no inclination to look for loopholes, short-cuts, substitutes, outward appearances, half-heartedness, two-facedness, disinterest. We do not “play the system,” “use” the other person, presume on the relationship, or treat it as finished business. We are not in a friendship for what we can get out of it even though we want the sense of social and psychological fulfillment that it naturally produces—spiritual benefits. Friends avoid all forms of selfishness and feel directed toward the other. Friendship embodies all the great features and products of faith, hope, and love as well as such personality traits as those enumerated in 1 Corinthians. Any “benefits” beyond these are potential, not necessary.</p>
<p>(15) Christ’s role in our continued relationship to the Father</p>
<p>(intercessor, “blood continues to cleanse”)</p>
<p>(16) the kinds of benefits we can expect from friendship with God</p>
<p>There are natural blessings that arise from relationship itself: sense of acceptance, sense of belonging and identity; sense of being loved, cared about, and looked favorably upon; sense of worth, meaningfulness, and fulfillment; sense of security, sense of innocence in the eyes of the other. These matters of present experience (existential) serve as a foundation for future hope (eschatological). They are spiritual, or psychological, benefits of positive relations.</p>
<p>There may also be over-and-above benefits that a person chooses to bestow on a friend. These added benefits are possible, but not necessary or uniform. People do not become friends to “get” things or “use” someone. If they do, they are not looking for a friend, but a handout. If selfish motives arise, they weaken or destroy the good thing that friendship is.</p>
<p>(17) friendship and other types of things</p>
<p>Aside from “blessings,” other types of things can exist along with a friendship. If something legal, material, or metaphysical is added, however, it must be added in such a way that it does not vitiate the underlying friendship.</p>
<p>(18) Observations on the continued Christian experience</p>
<p>There are degrees of friendship; so there can be growth and atrophy in it—sanctification and backsliding; “love can grow cold” (Matthew 24:12); there can different depths between multiple friendships with the same person. The growth comes from reciprocal action between inner intent and outer expression as well as between one friend and the other. As friendship is not just categorical but has degrees (both in absence and its presence), so also salvation is not uniform across the saved or static within any one of us.</p>
<p>Friendship involves both inner and outer factors. Outward actions express and show the inner attitude and motive. The inner cannot exist relevantly by itself because it is not of sufficient kind and degree as to erupt outwardly. By itself the outer is not desirable by the recipient or fulfilling to the giver.</p>
<p>A friend does not try to remove all distractions that would work against friendship. Instead, distractions are allowed to provide occasion for strengthening the relationship—by letting the other being faced with choices to leave but not leave because that friendship is better than what would interfere with it. The prodigal knew “home” was better than what the “far country” offered.</p>
<p>If one person were to go too far in retaining a friend, he would (a) be fostering selfishness in the other and perhaps be moved by selfishness in himself. His efforts would stem from crushed pride in not getting a love response from someone shown love—much as a spurned suitor who won’t let the other person go and in effect becomes a stalker. God does not seek to be our friend because he needs us (Acts 17:25); he created us as ones on whom he could bestow himself.</p>
<p>Instead of overwhelming someone to keep him “friendly,” we give only sufficient basis for friendship. We might imagine divine activity short of miracle-on-being (some kind of impersonal, miraculous force), but we do not experience such things, see them in others’ experience, or witness such in scripture. Paul’s experience near Damascus and Jonah’s flight to Tarshish are about the closest examples of such a thing. But these exceptional calls to special mission draw attention to the rule in scripture and experience that in conversion and perseverance God gives them up to the consequences of their own disinterest in friendship with him.</p>
<p>As there comes a limit in time for opportunity to become friends (kairos—Revelation 10:6), so also there is a limit in degree (sliding scale) as to how much one person does appropriately to win or win back a friend alienated by his “sin.” Instead of bowling someone over with attention and reasons to accept friendship (“flooding”), we put appropriate limits on how hard we try to win them back. That limit lies at least short of overriding the will of the other.</p>
<p>Final notations:</p>
<p>What Christ (our friend/older brother) faced in the flesh despite his deific nature</p>
<p>Friendship may be preferable to interpersonalism because it requires a positive quality.</p>
<p>PART TWO</p>
<p>Item-by-Item, explanation more fully elaborated (level 3) with (a) scripture foundation and (b) contrasting concepts thereby stand in contrast to as foreign or contradictory.  “To this the scriptures agree.” At the conference on circumcision, James follows the pattern illustrated here when he notes that the experience of ministry conformed to the prophets (Acts 15:7-18). Likewise, on Pentecost, Peter said, “This is that.” Experience is correlated with revelation.</p>
<p>In the general walk-through above, we indicated that since lostness is broken relationship because of sin, it is not due to birth, inheritance, race, or state of being, but by sinful behavior between the persons.</p>
<p>Part Two: So, knowing and believing the right things, for instance, does not make us friends of God; demons believe God exists and that there is one God (James 2:19). Belief to the extent of behavior constitutes “saving faith” (James 2:14-26), that is, friendship faith. Being around Christ has no more significance in salvation than being around carpentry makes someone a carpenter’s helper. To those who will say that Jesus prophesied on their street, Jesus will reply, “Depart from me, you workers of iniquity” (Luke 13:26-27); there must be a personal relationship based on values held in common. “Two cannot walk in the way together unless they are agreed” (Amos 3:3); there must be a common purpose. “Friendship with the world is enmity with God” (James 4:4), because God and “the world” are incompatible behavior sets.</p>
<p>add distinctives to this friendship—not between equals.]</p>
<p>[Part Two in contrast to deliverance from admixture of spirit and matter (Gnosticism) or from individuality (Hinduism). Closer to home, salvation is not particularly being in a state or place called “heaven” or not being in a state or place called “ hell.” It is alienation</p>
<p>There may gifts that friends give each other because they are friends (blessings), but these are beyond the friendship itself and derive from it. They are not parallel to it or aside from it as if they would still exist if the friendship was lost. That means “going to heaven” is not something that can somehow happen even if friendship with God is broken by reversion to a life of sin.</p>
<p>Part two: The law of the harvest says that grapes do not come from thorns or figs from thistles; what is of faith is faith. Consequently, restored personal relationships cannot be produced by law, substance, or metaphysics, which are impersonal.</p>
<p>[Part Two: Especially is this situation important in divine-human restoration because this friendship is not between equals. God is greater than we are, and he is creator of us with a purpose; consequently, he is leader in the friendship. On top of sheer friendship, then, there is human deference to the divine leadership in the friendship and allegiance to him, not only in morality, but also in fulfilling the purposes he has bestowed on us.]</p>
<p>Out of pure grace, the offended party in this case has taken the initiative to do what he was under no obligation to do—call the offender to turn from his offences and return to a reconciled state.</p>
<p>Part two: This is not a deistic process (as it would be through law or through law combined with an outside entity like the institutional church.</p>
<p>[Part Two in contrast to deliverance from admixture of spirit and matter (Gnosticism) or from individuality (Hinduism). It is not specifically a matter of “being in heaven” or not “going to hell.”</p>
<p>There may be gifts that friends give each other because they are friends (blessings), but these are beyond the friendship itself and derive from it; they are not parallel to it or aside from it as if they would still exist with the friendship gone. That means “going to heaven” is not something that can somehow happen even if friendship with God is broken by human sin.]</p>
<p>[not ascend to heaven to bring Christ down].</p>
<p>(a) Scope of the atonement 2 Peter 3:9</p>
<p>John 3:16</p>
<p>[Part Two?: In his sovereignty, God determined to establish the relationship with mankind as an interpersonal one—so establishing humans with the capacities that make such a relationship possible. In carrying forward the rest of his personal ventures with mankind, he maintains consistency with his earlier sovereign decision. So it is not a circumstance in which he holds back from most the possibility of reconciliation while giving it to others. Nor does he apply reconciliation aside from the choice of the other. Otherwise, it would not be a friendship.</p>
<p>(b) apostasy issue Hebrews 10:36-39.</p>
<p>Some may wonder whether apostasy was possible under first covenant, but not under second covenant. That possibility is eliminated by the fact that the writer of Hebrews cites an Old Testament text in support of his New Testament readership.</p>
<p>It has been supposed that a difference between backsliding and apostasy might apply to the question. The Hebrew writer has in mind, however, “shrinking back to perdition.”</p>
<p>Another possibility might be that a person exposed to the gospel but not committed to the Christ of the gospel. But the text from Habakkuk speaks of “my righteous one,” a description that would not seem proper for someone not actually saved. Besides, earlier in this book, the writer entertains the situation of one falling away who was enlightened, having tasted of the heavenly gift, and made a partaker of the Holy Spirit, the good word of god and the powers of the age to come (6:4-5).</p>
<p>The writer does say, “We are not of them that shrink back to perdition.” There are those “righteous ones,” however, who could shrink back or there would be no reason to quote the passage. There would be no reason to exhort against a theoretical possibility that never can become real. The author’s words to his own readers are a statement of confidence that they, like him, will not be among apostates—those who shrink back.</p>
<p>Again, the decisive point is what salvation is: friendship with God. It is not some reward separate from the friendship and thus available without being on proper terms personally with God. Special blessings and gifts are subsequent to the relationship, not somehow aside from it. It is a matter of being pleasing to God (in contrast to “my soul has no pleasure in him”).</p>
<p>God operates within the characteristics of what he has already determined the nature of. (permanent from his intentions; reversible from our side) (not in and out on a daily basis (relative stability of friendship)</p>
<p>Irrelevancies &amp; Add-ons</p>
<p>Things irrelevant to salvation (friendship is spiritual): health (length of life), wealth, preferential treatment of his own (deliverance from suffering), physical descent (friendship is not biological/genetic), national identity (friendship is transcultural), knowledge/enlightenment/intelligence, social status, fame, miracle/supernatural endowment,</p>
<p>PART THREE</p>
<p>not by miracle [enlightenment], authority [of third parties], or metaphysics</p>
<p>Irrelevancies, opposites, unnecessary ideas, optional possibilities, and matters of opinion</p>
<p>As noted above, healthy friendships are based on common values and purposes rather than on physical kinship: “There is a friend that sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24). John told his audiences that God could raise up sons of Abraham from rocks on the ground, thus indicating that physical descent from a good person has no value for relationship to that good person’s God (Luke 3:8). The same thing applies to race and national identity. They are not all Israel that are of Israel (Romans 9:6-7); that is, spiritual Israel is not represented by the same circle as national Israel. Not all the natural branches of the Abrahamic olive tree are part of the spiritual tree (Romans 11:17-24). Unfaithful “branches” are removed or put back in depending on faithfulness. Branches from other olive trees (Gentiles) are drafted in as well on the basis of faithfulness. Differences in social status like slave vs. freeman as likewise irrelevant to being brothers (Philemon), as sex (Galatians 3:28).</p>
<p>Miracle (hypostatic hermeneutic), authority (legalistic interpretation), enlightenment (gnosticism and eastern religions), ritualism, and magic.</p>
<p>Salvation is not a supernatural process—as through miracle.</p>
<p>Salvation is not an impersonal process—as through divine fiat.</p>
<p>Salvation is not a deistic process—as through law.</p>
<p>Christian salvation is interpersonal; it deals with removing the alienation between persons by forgiveness. It differed from gnostic salvation, which sought to remove matter from admixture with spirit by secret knowledge (prioritizing spirit over matter vs. making one better than the other—as in Platonism—or pitting one against the other. It differs from Hinduism, which seeks to deliver from individuality by re-incarnational progression (lack of relationship vs. harmonious relationship).</p>
<p>OUTLINE: Plan of Action (with special emphasis on apostasy question) = statement of theological method</p>
<p>Theology from Below (level 2) (the predictive value of the friendship construct) We, “though evil, know how to give good gifts to our children” (Matthew 7:11). The implication of Jesus’ remark is that every-day experience gives us a starting point for grasping the Christian “message.” Based on noble impulses of our own, we can anticipate how things ought to be between us and with the holy God who created us for his purposes. Even though personal relationships are the most complex reality there is, they are simple to us because our own nature as persons and our life-long experience with personal interactions enable us to understand how friendship with God works.</p>
<p>Statement of Method</p>
<p>Statement of theological method: structure of the particular biblical-theological method used here: biblical basis for basic reality (friendship); apply the knowledge of that reality to individual aspects of salvation and then to texts as to positively making them clear and as to sorting between options that have occurred to interpreters in their dealing with these individual texts (foreign, false, optional/opinion).</p>
<p>(1) Establish the friendship reality 	List the salvation topics clarified by friendship with God.</p>
<p>(2a) do a “theology from below,” listing how the friendship reality impacts individual aspects of salvation (w/o appeal to scripture)</p>
<p>(2b) scripture directly teaches what friendship implies. Show on each point that inference from the nature of friendship conforms to the teaching of scripture. Go back through (at least the main) topics, appealing to the clearest text or argument on each item and listing other relevant passages that are sometimes indecisive without the underlying reality to clarify the issue.</p>
<p>Deal with ideas based on human reason arising from false starting points.</p>
<p>The format (1) starts with scripture to establish a fundamental reality, (2) looks at individual texts with the fundamental reality as a context, (3) lets specific texts within the first context add further specifics to the growing picture, and (4) uses the expanded picture to clarify other texts. Human experience is involved in (a) establishing the meaning of verbal communications—terms and expressions, and (b) matching up revelational statements with clear human experience—in this case the nature of healthy friendship.</p>
<p>Strategy of Presentation</p>
<p>Put in the larger context and alongside like issues, and—for the purposes of this study—within the particular topic of salvation (and within salvation with special emphasis on perseverance/eternal security/apostasy). Showing that the several issues share a common larger category should help make the view about individual items more understandable, more desirable, more convincing, and more memorable.</p>
<p>Structure of Presentation vs. Pattern of Hermeneutics</p>
<p>Describe this general layout given for didactic purposes and apologetic purposes as distinguished from hermeneutical procedure.</p>
<p>Distinguish between structure of presentation and pattern of origination. In reality, “theology from below” follows revelation from above. “Theology from below” gets its starting from revelation from above by recognizing the friendship character of divine-human relationship. With that context the mind of the interpreter moves forward to individual items as addressed by specific passages of scripture.</p>
<p>Theological Method</p>
<p>We can understand revelation associated with salvation because, by seeing that it is a case of friendship, scripture tells us something that corresponds with our nature and experience. We can transfer an understanding of human friendship to human-divine relationship.  Friendship is both simple and complex—simple because we have been familiar with it from birth, yet the most complex reality there is because it involves unique levels of intelligence, will, affection, self-awareness, transcendence, creativity, and other personal capacities present on both sides of a friendship.</p>
<p>Hermeneutical approach</p>
<p>Many of the points noted above have been controversial because we have not kept properly balanced the two sides of the friendship situation. Consulting individual texts of scripture does not necessarily resolve matters because passages can often be made to fit with alternative viewpoints. Getting behind the impasse by appealing to more basic factors puts us in a better position to resolve the problems that have hindered our understanding, Christian living, and witness. As in sports and other endeavors, we have to be good at the fundamentals.</p>
<p>The proposal here is that we get behind the impasse by (a) remembering what friendship is—as that common larger category, by (b) observing that each issue shares this common larger category, (c) by seeing how related truths are not in tension but together comprise a larger complexity, and (d) by highlighting texts that are least able to be taken in alternative ways.</p>
<p>The crucial endeavor here is making sure that friendship does in fact constitute the nature of salvation matters and making clear that it is not just a model, but the reality itself. “Model” suggests analogy, something “like” what we are talking about, rather than what we are talking about. The claim is that friendship is what relationship to God is. Friendship is most important because it is most basic and most inclusive. Not only does it determine positively what salvation is and how it works, but identifies negatively what things are contrary, irrelevant, indifferent, and related to non-interpersonal add-ons. We may even venture to say every perversion of the Christian faith from New Testament times to the present has been some kind of departure from its interpersonal character—its friend-to-friend nature.</p>
<p>Friendship provides a simple yet powerful tool for presenting the good news to others, the simple wayfaring men of Isaiah 35:8. Furthermore, the humble truth is that we are all “wayfaring fools” to a significant degree. Whatever makes the truth of God more understandable to us helps us become well-pleasing to him and more helpful to others. Whatever makes the truth of God more convincing both as to its likelihood in itself for being true and desirable helps us maintain faithfulness in living out God’s expectancies. Friendship makes more memorable how to think through the ins and outs of all these seemingly complicated matters in soteriology and elsewhere. Highlighting friendship means that we can unpack derivative matters for ourselves again if we cannot remember what we previously learned. Even more, since we sometimes encounter unrevealed situations—ones on which the New Testament does not give explicit direction, we have help in thinking about appropriate courses of action. In response to some new idea promoted by would-be teachers of truth and “correctors of babes” (Romans 2:20), we are prepared ahead of time with an all-purpose tool for evaluating beliefs and practices not faced before.</p>
<p>Choice of “Friend” Terminology</p>
<p>The focus on friend in this study does involve a choice between several labels scripture uses for people’s relationship to God: disciples, sons, slaves, brothers, etc. Some of these terms are obvious metaphors, which means they involve comparisons between their literal referent and what they are picturing. Several terms together may apply to the topic of interest because they individually share some characteristic with the referent, or conceivably because adding their characteristics together produces the complete picture. Instead of those possibilities, we have considered friend the reality and other terms as metaphors—pictures like the reality in just certain respects.</p>
<p>Reasons for the friendship approach to salvation issue from the following cluster of factors: The aspects of friendship satisfactorily cover the sure aspects of salvation.</p>
<p>Friendship “solves”/avoids many salvation issues that have plagued Christians for centuries; moving beyond the friendship reality is what raises these issues.</p>
<p>Other biblical imageries share known figurative aspects with known literal aspects of friendship; so their non-friendship elements need not be added to the friendship factors in order to explain using them. By definition, figurative terminology does not share all its characteristics with its parallel; otherwise, it would be literal terminology.</p>
<p>In some cases, the additional, non-friendship elements would contradict features of friendship.</p>
<p>Calling in additional non-friendship matters is what requires justification. In other words, the “burden of proof” calls for justifying the addition of non-friendship matters.</p>
<p>Even if they brought in added factors, those factors would be after the friendship, not more basic than friendship or aside from it. Those additional factors—like special blessings—would stand or fall with the friendship they are based on, not exist aside from it or in contradiction to it.</p>
<p>In part, the difficulties come from playing off of other terminology that brings in non-interpersonal matters, and involve terms that share the friendship reality and were obviously used to convey that reality instead of adding other non-friendship elements to what salvation is. In concert with that terminology, certain texts have also been taken to mean some added factor beyond friendship process. Many of the ideas that Christians have fostered do have an apparent connection with the salvation issue, but they take some point and make it too central or misconceive of it in legal, substantive, or metaphysical fashion and thereby pervert it into something that it is not. We can talk about the “kind” of friendship that is appropriate for our relationship to God, but we do not have to move outside the characteristics of friendship itself to make it fully appropriate for the subject.</p>
<p>(1) Friendship represents what all Christians already agree on as proper description of the intended man-God association. Additional features of other terms are what cause difficulty and disagreement.</p>
<p>(2) Some aspects of other terms admittedly do not conform to the reality; so we know they are not meant strictly. We do not want to allegorize such labels beyond the intended connection with the subject.</p>
<p>Christ is called the firstborn among many “brothers,” but “fathers” bring sons into being, not elder brothers; yet Christ is called the author of our salvation.</p>
<p>Jesus is not son of God in the sense of someone begotten if he is coeternal with the father. The order of authority within the godhead might work, but the more compelling reason for the expression is that Jesus as son is like God in values and behavior.</p>
<p>(3) Other terms are not compatible with each other and the referent when taken literally, but using friend literally works because all its necessary features conform to what are in the reality. Furthermore, it equals the common ground of the other terms.</p>
<p>(4) Because of the previous considerations, the “burden of proof” falls on the positive, that is, it falls on the effort to bring in additional features into restoring the God-man relationship—features beyond positive interpersonal relationship, that is, friendship. In proper thinking, it is not the job of the dissenter to disprove the other idea before he can offer an alternative; it is the job of each proposal to offer satisfactory evidence for itself, and as a result other alternatives are eliminated by the choice of the best alternative. Appropriate questions become (a) What would the added feature be? (b) What kind of thing is it? (c) Aside from the term involved, what bases are there for bringing in this or that added feature? (d) How does the added feature relate to the fundamental one that all agree is present? Is it logically or chronologically subsequent, before, or parallel?</p>
<p>The “son-of” expression is probably the most frequent metaphor for bring in additional features beyond “friendship.”</p>
<p>(5) We know son is used figuratively for other than physical reference. The reason for doing so lies in the strong tendency for sons (offspring) “look” like their parents behaviorally as well as physically. They partake of the “nature” of their fathers; hence, we have sons of darkness, light, the devil, disobedience.</p>
<p>That has to be the reason Christ is called the “Son of God.” He is not a physical son—as Muslims tend to hear when the expression is used; he is like God in functional nature and purpose. Paul called Timothy his “son.”</p>
<p>Since flesh and blood does not and cannot inherit the kingdom of God that Christ came to establish, the reason for our being called sons of God cannot be because of the physical dimension or its distinctive characteristics.</p>
<p>What is of flesh is flesh; what is of faith is faith.</p>
<p>Since legal process is no longer the kind of system Christians are under (Hebrews 8), the legal connection sonship has also does not belong the reason for the sonship terminology. Paul uses the chronological priority of “promise” over law to picture the priority of interpersonal process over legal circumstance. He adds that what came 430 years later than promise did not annul promise, and he teaches elsewhere that that it was added only temporarily till the time of fulfillment of promise would take place. To the Galatians he said that going back under law—as a result of being circumcised—was a return to what he calls elsewhere “beggarly elements.”</p>
<p>LAW OF THE HARVEST: not grapes from thorns or figs from thistles</p>
<p>Close: We are called sons of Abraham, friends of God, the bride of Christ, brothers of Christ; but the best of these is “Friends of God.”</p>
