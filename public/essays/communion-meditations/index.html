<p>Sources of communion meditation</p>
<p>Recorded events that accompanied his death-resurrection.</p>
<p>Deliberately working backwards from the sermon. There are so many appropriate facets of this event. Finding natural connections with the subject of the day’s sermon triggers some thoughts that might not come to mind otherwise.</p>
<p>Festival cycle: The religious year provides associations with communion observance. Later, the meaning of the Lord’s Supper may come back to mind by what people encounter after gathered worship.</p>
<p>Current events. What is happening locally or in the experiences of those gathered can relate naturally to Christ and aspects of his culminating ministry in Jerusalem. Included here are social, political, world events, but also the vivid, trying,</p>
<p>Items associated with identification with Christ as implied by this memorial observance. Commitment to Christ to the extent he carried out his commitment to the Father. Internalizing the values and love for Christ as pictured by consuming the elements.</p>
<p>In short, many sources for sermon material serve also as sources of communion meditations.</p>
<p>Scriptures especially appropriate for communion observance</p>
<p>Isaiah 53</p>
<p>Matthew 26:26-29 and parallels</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:23-26</p>
<p>The Book of Hebrews with all its priestly references</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>Length: Communion meditations are best kept short—maybe two minutes at most. One strong idea is about all an observant can concentrate on in any one observance. Second and third ideas can weaken the primary thought. Longer presentations and larger sets of related ideas can be developed in the sermon. The meditations ought not compete with the sermon time in the service.</p>
<p>Relevance. Whenever natural, it is best to connect the memory of the Messiah with the experiences and needs of the communicants. The sheer memory of him itself suggests implications for those who remember him.</p>
<p>These meditations are not meant to be read to a congregation. That would detract from the genuineness of the speaker’s comments.</p>
