            <p>ISAIAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1Visions Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw</p>
<p>About Judah and Jerusalem</p>
<p>During the Reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</p>
<p>and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah</p>
<p>Rebellious Judah</p>
<p>2Listen, earth and sky, Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I brought up sons,</p>
<p>but they’ve rebelled.</p>
<p>3An ox knows its owner,</p>
<p>and a donkey recognizes its owner’s manger,</p>
<p>but Israel doesn’t know me;</p>
<p>my people don’t recognize</p>
<p>that I’m the One who provided for them.”</p>
<p>4Sinful nation,</p>
<p>people weighed down with iniquity,</p>
<p>offspring of sinners who deal falsely,</p>
<p>you’ve rejected Yahveh,</p>
<p>despised the Holy One of Israel,</p>
<p>and turned away from him.		Is 1:1-4</p>
<p>5Where else can he strike you</p>
<p>as you just keep on rebelling?</p>
<p>Your head is sick;</p>
<p>your heart is faint.</p>
<p>6There’s nothing healthy in you from head to toe,</p>
<p>just bruises, sores, and open wounds</p>
<p>without compress or bandage,</p>
<p>or ointment to soften them.</p>
<p>7Your country lies in ruins;</p>
<p>your towns have been burned.</p>
<p>Foreigners stole your crops while you watched;</p>
<p>it’s a wasteland they’ve overthrown.</p>
<p>8Zion is like a shed in a deserted vineyard,</p>
<p>like a watchman’s hut in an old cucumber patch,</p>
<p>like a city under siege.</p>
<p>9If Yahveh of Hosts hadn’t left us a few survivors,</p>
<p>we’d be like Sodom and Gomorrah.	Is 1:5-9</p>
<p>10Listen to Yahveh’s message, rulers in “Sodom”;</p>
<p>hear our God’s teaching, people in “Gomorrah”:</p>
<p>11“Why are you offering me all these sacrifices?</p>
<p>I’ve had enough of your burnt offerings of rams</p>
<p>and the fat of your grain-fed cattle;</p>
<p>I’m not happy with the blood of bulls, lambs, and goats.</p>
<p>12When you show up to worship me,</p>
<p>who’s making you tramp on my courts?</p>
<p>13Don’t keep bringing me your worthless offerings;</p>
<p>I detest their incense.</p>
<p>New moons, Sabbaths, scheduled assemblies—</p>
<p>I can’t endure any more of your solemn assemblies</p>
<p>mixed with your sinfulness.</p>
<p>14I despise your new moon celebrations and stated festivals;</p>
<p>they’re a drag to me; I’m tired of them.</p>
<p>15When you spread out your hands, I won’t look;</p>
<p>though you offer lots of prayers, I won’t be listening;</p>
<p>your spread-out hands have bloodshed on them.	Is 1:10-15</p>
<p>16“Take baths and get cleaned up;</p>
<p>get your sins out of my sight;</p>
<p>give up doing sinful things.</p>
<p>17Learn how to do good, seek out justice,</p>
<p>correct ruthless people, defend orphans,</p>
<p>fight for widows’ rights.</p>
<p>16“Take baths and get cleaned up;</p>
<p>get your sins out of my sight.</p>
<p>Give up doing sinful things.</p>
<p>17Learn how to do good, seek out justice,</p>
<p>correct ruthless people, defend orphans,</p>
<p>fight for widows’ rights.</p>
<p>18“Come, now; let’s talk,” Yahveh says.</p>
<p>“Though your sins are like scarlet,</p>
<p>they can be as white as snow;</p>
<p>if they’re red like crimson,</p>
<p>they can be like wool.</p>
<p>19If you start obeying me,</p>
<p>you’ll eat the best in the land.</p>
<p>20If you refuse and rebel,</p>
<p>your enemies’ sword will overwhelm you.”</p>
<p>Yahveh has told you the truth.</p>
<p>Is 1:16-20</p>
<p>Unfaithful Jerusalem</p>
<p>21How the once-faithful city has become a prostitute,</p>
<p>she that used to be full of justice!</p>
<p>Goodness used to lodge there;</p>
<p>now murderers do.</p>
<p>22Your once-pure silver has turned to dross;</p>
<p>your drink’s been diluted with water.</p>
<p>23Your rulers rebel, your friends steal;</p>
<p>everybody likes bribes</p>
<p>and requires kickbacks;</p>
<p>they don’t defend orphans</p>
<p>or let widows’ cases come to trial.	Is 1:21-23</p>
<p>24So the Lord Yahveh of Hosts,</p>
<p>the Mighty One of Israel, says,</p>
<p>“I avenge myself of my enemies;</p>
<p>I take vengeance on my adversaries;</p>
<p>25I’ll turn against you;</p>
<p>I’ll smelt away your dross with lye</p>
<p>and remove your impurities.</p>
<p>26I’ll make your judges like they were at first</p>
<p>and your advisors the way they were in the beginning;</p>
<p>after that, you’ll be called ‘The City of Righteousness,’</p>
<p>‘The Faithful City.’”	Is 1:24-26</p>
<p>27Justice will redeem Zion;</p>
<p>repentance will lead to goodness.</p>
<p>28But Yahveh will crush rebels and sinners;</p>
<p>those who forsake him will meet their end.</p>
<p>29You’ll be ashamed of the sacred terebinth groves you delighted in,</p>
<p>embarrassed by the gardens you chose to worship your idols in;</p>
<p>30because you’ll be like a terebinth tree with withered leaves</p>
<p>and a garden with no water.</p>
<p>31The strong will become kindling,</p>
<p>and their evil work the spark that lights it;</p>
<p>everything will burn up</p>
<p>with nobody able to put out the fire.	Is 1:27-31</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Future Reign</p>
<p>2:1A Message Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw About Judah and Jerusalem</p>
<p>2In the last days, the mountain where Yahveh’s Temple is,</p>
<p>will become the tallest mountain;</p>
<p>it will rise above the hills,</p>
<p>and nations everywhere will stream into it.</p>
<p>3Many nationalities will say,</p>
<p>“Let’s go up to Yahveh’s mountain,</p>
<p>to the Temple of Jacob’s God,</p>
<p>so he can teach us his ways</p>
<p>and we can follow his paths,”</p>
<p>because the Law will go out from Zion,</p>
<p>Yahveh’s message from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>4He’ll mediate between nations</p>
<p>and settle disputes between them;</p>
<p>they’ll hammer their swords into plowshares</p>
<p>and beat their spears into pruning hooks;</p>
<p>they won’t fight one another</p>
<p>or train for war anymore. 			Is 2:1-4</p>
<p>Warning About Coming Judgment</p>
<p>5Come, House of Jacob;</p>
<p>let’s follow the light of Yahveh.</p>
<p>6He’s abandoned you</p>
<p>because practices from the east have filled you;</p>
<p>you use soothsayers like Philistines;</p>
<p>you strike bargains with foreigners.</p>
<p>7Your land has lots of silver and gold;</p>
<p>there’s no limit to your treasures;</p>
<p>you own lots of horses</p>
<p>and countless chariots.</p>
<p>8Your country is full of idols;</p>
<p>you worship your own creations,</p>
<p>what your fingers have made.	Is 2:5-8</p>
<p>9So the common people will be humbled,</p>
<p>important ones abased;</p>
<p>don’t forgive them.</p>
<p>10Get inside caves and hide underground</p>
<p>from the terror Yahveh’s bringing</p>
<p>and the splendor of his majesty.</p>
<p>11He’ll abase arrogant people</p>
<p>and humble haughty ones;</p>
<p>he alone will be honored then.	Is 2:9-11</p>
<p>12Yahveh of Hosts has set a time for reckoning,</p>
<p>for everybody that’s proud and arrogant,</p>
<p>for everybody that’s pompous and aloof</p>
<p>so they can be abased,</p>
<p>13for the tall cedars of Lebanon and oaks of Bashan,</p>
<p>14for high mountains and lofty hills,</p>
<p>15for every high tower and fortified wall,</p>
<p>16for the ships of Tarshish and their beautiful crafts.</p>
<p>17Yahveh will humble the haughty</p>
<p>and abase the arrogant;</p>
<p>he alone will be honored then;</p>
<p>18idols will disappear.</p>
<p>19People will hide in caves in the rocks</p>
<p>and holes underground</p>
<p>in anticipation of the terror Yahveh’s bringing</p>
<p>and the splendor of his majesty</p>
<p>when he takes action that makes the ground quake.</p>
<p>20At that time, they’ll toss to the moles and bats</p>
<p>the silver and gold idols they made to worship;</p>
<p>21they will hide in the caves in the rocks</p>
<p>and clefts in the cliffs</p>
<p>in anticipation of the terror Yahveh’s bringing</p>
<p>and the splendor of his majesty</p>
<p>when he takes action that makes the ground quake.</p>
<p>22Stop trusting in people who breathe;</p>
<p>why depend on them? 	Is 2:12-22</p>
<p>Judgment Against Judah</p>
<p>3:1The Lord Yahveh of Hosts will remove</p>
<p>food and water from Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>2strong men and soldiers, judges and prophets,</p>
<p>fortunetellers and elders,</p>
<p>3captains of 50 and their men,</p>
<p>advisors, expert magicians, and skilled astrologers.</p>
<p>4“I’ll make boys their officials,</p>
<p>babies their rulers;</p>
<p>5people will oppress one another,</p>
<p>neighbor against neighbor;</p>
<p>youths will insult elders;</p>
<p>inferiors will be rude to honorable citizens.”	 Is 3:1-5</p>
<p>6At that time, a man will grab his brother and say,</p>
<p>“You have a mantle; be our leader;</p>
<p>rule this pile of ruins.”</p>
<p>7But he’ll protest,</p>
<p>“I won’t be your leader;</p>
<p>I don’t have a mantel or extra food at home;</p>
<p>don’t expect me to lead you.”</p>
<p>8Jerusalem will stumble, Judah will fall,</p>
<p>because their words and deeds oppose Yahveh.</p>
<p>They’ve rebelled against his glorious presence.</p>
<p>9Even the looks on their faces give them away;</p>
<p>they show their sin like Sodom;</p>
<p>they don’t even try to hide it;</p>
<p>they’re doomed by the disaster they’ve brought on themselves.</p>
<p>10Tell good people it’ll go well with them;</p>
<p>they’ll eat what their efforts produce.</p>
<p>11But doom awaits the wicked! It’ll be bad for them</p>
<p>because they’ll get what they deserve.</p>
<p>12Children oppress my people;</p>
<p>women rule them.</p>
<p>My people’s guides get them lost;</p>
<p>they give them wrong directions.		 Is 3:6-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh is getting up to contend in court,</p>
<p>to render verdict against the people.</p>
<p>14He’s going to sue the officials of his people:</p>
<p>“You’re the ones that have ruined my vineyard;</p>
<p>plunder from poor people sits in your houses;</p>
<p>15what do you mean crushing my people,</p>
<p>grinding their faces in the dirt?”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh of Hosts says.</p>
<p>Is 3:13-15</p>
<p>From Beauty to Ruin</p>
<p>16“Because the young women of Zion are proud</p>
<p>and walk with heads held high and flirting eyes,</p>
<p>because they prance along with dainty steps</p>
<p>and tinkle the bangles on their feet,</p>
<p>17I’ll strike their scalps with scabs</p>
<p>and shave off their eyebrows.	Is 3:16-17</p>
<p>18I’ll take away their pretty anklets, headbands, and crescent necklaces;</p>
<p>19dangling earrings, bracelets, and veils; 20headdresses and ankle bracelets; sashes, perfume boxes, and charms; 21finger rings and nose rings; 22fine robes, gowns, capes, and handbags; 23hand mirrors, linen clothes, tiaras, and shawls.</p>
<p>24Instead of sweet perfume, there’ll be stench;</p>
<p>instead of a girdle, a rope;</p>
<p>instead of permed hair, baldness;</p>
<p>instead of a fine robe, burlap;</p>
<p>and instead of beauty, branding.</p>
<p>25The young men of Israel will fall by the sword;</p>
<p>the strong will die in battle.</p>
<p>26The city gates will hang in lament and mourning;</p>
<p>Jerusalem will sit on the ground like a raped woman.”</p>
<p>Is 3:18-26</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Branch</p>
<p>4:1At that time, seven widows will grab hold of one man and say, “We’ll provide our own food and clothes. Just let us take your name so we won’t be old maids!”</p>
<p>2But at that time, Yahveh’s branch will be beautiful and glorious. What the ground produces will be the pride and joy of Israel’s survivors. 3The remnant in Zion and Jerusalem will be holy, everybody that’s in his record books for living there. 4When Yahveh has washed the grime off of Zion’s inhabitants and cleaned up the bloodstains in Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and burning, 5then he’ll create over Mount Zion and its assemblies a cloud of smoke during the day, a bright blazing fire at night, and a canopy above the glory. 6It’ll be shade from daytime heat and shelter from storms and rain.  	Is 4:1-6</p>
<p>The Song of the Vineyard</p>
<p>5:1For the one I love, let me sing a song about his vineyard:</p>
<p>The one I love had a vineyard on a fertile hill.</p>
<p>2He spaded up the ground, picked up the rocks,</p>
<p>and planted the best grapevines in it;</p>
<p>he built a tower there</p>
<p>and hewed out a stone wine vat;</p>
<p>he expected it to produce good grapes,</p>
<p>but it produced wild ones.	Is 5:1-2</p>
<p>3“People in Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>judge between me and my vineyard.</p>
<p>4What could I have done for it that I didn’t do?</p>
<p>Why did it produce bitter grapes instead of sweet ones?</p>
<p>5Let me tell you what I’m going to do with it:</p>
<p>I’ll cut down the hedge around it and burn it;</p>
<p>I’ll tear down the wall</p>
<p>and let animals trample it.</p>
<p>6I won’t take care of it, prune it, or hoe it;</p>
<p>briars and thorns will take it over;</p>
<p>I’ll tell the clouds not to rain on it anymore.”	Is 5:3-6</p>
<p>7Israel is Yahveh’s vineyard;</p>
<p>the people in Judah are his delightful garden;</p>
<p>so he looked for justice but saw bloodshed;</p>
<p>he expected goodness but heard cries of distress.</p>
<p>Judah’s Guilt and Judgment</p>
<p>8Misfortune awaits you that buy up houses and fields</p>
<p>till there’s none left to buy,</p>
<p>and you’re living alone.</p>
<p>9I’ve heard Yahveh of Hosts swear,</p>
<p>“Lots of houses will be empty, even big, nice ones;</p>
<p>10ten acres of vineyard will only produce 9 gallons 1 bath of wine;</p>
<p>11 bushels 1 homer of seed will only yield 1.1 bushels 1 ephah of grain.”</p>
<p>11Misfortune awaits those who get up early to drink alcohol</p>
<p>and stay up late to get drunk on wine.</p>
<p>12Their banquets feature lyres and harps,</p>
<p>tambourines and flutes—and wine;</p>
<p>but they give no thought to Yahveh</p>
<p>or pay attention to what he’s doing.	Is 5:7-12</p>
<p>13So my people will go into exile for ignoring me;</p>
<p>their honored ones will starve;</p>
<p>their common people will be parched with thirst.</p>
<p>14Sheol will increase its appetite and eat its fill;</p>
<p>Jerusalem’s nobles and celebrating throngs will go down to it.</p>
<p>15Commoners will be humbled,</p>
<p>important people abased,</p>
<p>proud ones brought low.</p>
<p>16But Yahveh of Hosts will be exalted by his judgments;</p>
<p>the holy God will display his holiness by his goodness.</p>
<p>17Then lambs will graze in their pasture;</p>
<p>foreigners will eat among the ruins of the wealthy.</p>
<p>Is 5:13-17</p>
<p>18Misfortune awaits those who pull iniquity</p>
<p>behind them with ropes made out of lies,</p>
<p>who harness falsehood</p>
<p>and hook up their carts to sin,</p>
<p>19who say, “Let the Holy One of Israel hurry</p>
<p>so we can see what he’s doing;</p>
<p>let his purpose come close</p>
<p>so we can find out what it is!”</p>
<p>20Misfortune awaits those</p>
<p>who call bad good and good bad,</p>
<p>who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness,</p>
<p>who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.</p>
<p>21Misfortune’s in store for people that think they’re smart,</p>
<p>that consider themselves clever.</p>
<p>22Misfortune comes on winners at wine drinking</p>
<p>and champions at mixing drinks,</p>
<p>23who acquit the guilty for a bribe</p>
<p>and deprive the innocent of justice.	Is 5:18-23</p>
<p>24So, like a flame ignites stubble</p>
<p>and dry grass shrivels up in fire,</p>
<p>their roots will rot,</p>
<p>and their blossoms will go up like smoke.</p>
<p>They’ve rejected Yahveh’s Law</p>
<p>and despised the message of the Holy One of Israel;</p>
<p>25so his anger has burned against his people,</p>
<p>and he’s reached out to strike them down.</p>
<p>The mountains quake;</p>
<p>corpses litter the streets like garbage.</p>
<p>His anger hasn’t turned away;</p>
<p>his fist is still raised.	Is 5:24-25</p>
<p>26He’ll signal to a far-off country;</p>
<p>he’ll whistle for it to come from a remote land</p>
<p>and to do it swiftly and soon.</p>
<p>27Nobody from there will get tired or stumble,</p>
<p>rest or sleep;</p>
<p>there won’t be one loose belt or broken sandal strap.</p>
<p>28Its arrows will be sharp; its bows bent;</p>
<p>its horses’ hoofs will spark like flint;</p>
<p>its chariot wheels will spin like tornadoes.</p>
<p>29It will roar like a lioness, like a young lion;</p>
<p>it’ll growl when it seizes prey and carries it off;</p>
<p>nobody will be able stop it.</p>
<p>30It will growl over its prey like the ocean roars;</p>
<p>on land, there’ll be darkness and distress;</p>
<p>clouds will block out the light.	Is 5:26-30</p>
<p>Isaiah’s Call and Cleansing</p>
<p>6:1The year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high throne, and his train filled the Temple. 2Seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings:  two covered their faces, two covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3One shouted to the other,</p>
<p>“Holy, Holy, Holy is Yahveh of Hosts;</p>
<p>the whole world is full of his glory.”</p>
<p>4The thresholds shook when he shouted, and smoke filled the Temple. 5I said,</p>
<p>“I’m doomed! I’m lost,</p>
<p>a man with unclean lips</p>
<p>living among people with unclean lips,</p>
<p>and I’ve seen the King, Yahveh of Hosts!”	Is 6:1-5</p>
<p>6One seraph flew to me with a burning coal he’d taken off the altar with tongs. 7He touched my mouth with it and said, “That has taken away your guilt; your sin’s forgiven.”</p>
<p>8Then I heard the Lord say, “Who will I send? Who’ll go for us?”</p>
<p>I said, “I’ll go; send me.”</p>
<p>9He said,</p>
<p>“Go tell this nation:</p>
<p>‘Keep listening, but don’t understand anything;</p>
<p>keep looking, but don’t perceive anything.</p>
<p>10Harden your hearts,</p>
<p>be hard of hearing,</p>
<p>and shut your eyes</p>
<p>so you can’t see or hear,</p>
<p>understand and repent,</p>
<p>and be healed.’”				Is 6:6-10</p>
<p>11I said, “How long, Lord?”</p>
<p>“Till the towns are deserted,</p>
<p>the houses are empty,</p>
<p>and the land’s forsaken;</p>
<p>12till I’ve taken the people far away</p>
<p>and leave the land largely abandoned.</p>
<p>13A tenth of it will survive</p>
<p>only to be invaded again and burned;</p>
<p>like a terebinth tree or oak</p>
<p>whose stump is still standing after it’s cut down,</p>
<p>the stump will be Israel’s holy seed.”		Is 6:11-13</p>
<p>A Message for Ahaz</p>
<p>7:1At the time of Ahaz Ben-Jotham Ben-Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah Ben-Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but couldn’t take it. 2When the news reached Judah’s royal court that Syria was in league with Ephraim, their hearts sank, and they shook like trees in the wind.</p>
<p>3Yahveh said to Isaiah,</p>
<p>“Take your son Shear-jashub [A remnant will return] and go meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that supplies the Upper Pool on the road to the Fuller’s Field. 4-6Tell him not to worry about Rezin and Remaliah’s son. He doesn’t need to be afraid or fainthearted over the fierce anger of those two smoldering sticks. True, they’re plotting to attack Judah and install Tabeel as king there. 7-9But that’s not going to happen. Syria’s headquarters is in Damascus, led by Rezin; Ephraim’s headquarters is in Samaria, led by Remaliah. Just trust me, and I’ll make you outlast them. In 65 years, Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a people.”  				Is 7:1-9</p>
<p>10Yahveh spoke to Ahaz again, 11“Ask me for a sign that’s as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.”</p>
<p>12But Ahaz said, “I’m not going to do that.”</p>
<p>13So Isaiah said,</p>
<p>“Listen, David’s dynasty! Is trying people’s patience not enough that you try God’s patience too? 14So Yahveh will give youpl his own sign: a virgin will have a son she’ll call Immanuel [God is with us]. 15Before he’s old enough to eat curds and honey, refuse evil and choose good, 16the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. 17The Lord will bring on you, your people, and your ancestor’s dynasty such a time as has never come since Ephraim seceded from Judah: the king of Assyria. 18Yahveh will whistle for a fly at the mouth of the rivers of Egypt and for a bee in Assyria. 19They’ll come and light in the steep ravines, in the cracks in the rocks, on the thorns, and in the pastures. 20Yahveh will shave Israel’s head, legs, and beard with a “razor” he’ll hire from beyond the Euphrates: the king of Assyria.  	   Is 7:10-20</p>
<p>21“At that time, a farmer may still have a cow and a couple sheep. 22Nevertheless, they’ll give enough for him and the few left in the land to eat curds and honey. 23Briars and thorns will take over a vineyard that used to have 1,000 vines, worth 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver. 24People will go there to hunt with bows and arrows because briars and thorns will overrun the country. 25People won’t go to the hills where they used to hoe garden plots, because they’ll want to avoid the briars and thorns. That’s where cattle will pasture, and sheep will trample.”				Is 7:21-25</p>
<p>Assyria’s Coming Invasion</p>
<p>8:1Then Yahveh told me, “Take a large tablet and etch on it in standard letters ‘Maher-shalal-hash-baz’ [quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil].” 2I got reputable men to witness it: Uriah the priest and Zechariah Ben-Jeberechiah. 3So I had relations with my wife the prophetess, and she had a son. Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 4because before he knows how to say ‘daddy’ or ‘mommy,’ the king of Assyria will ‘carry away the wealth’ in Damascus and ‘the spoil’ in Samaria.”</p>
<p>5Yahveh spoke to me again,</p>
<p>6“These people have rejected the water at Shiloah that flows gently and admire Rezin and Remaliah’s son. 7So I’ll flood them with the powerful, abundant ‘water’ of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its banks, 8surge into Judah, flood it, and wash on through. It will get neck deep over your whole land, Immanuel.	Is 8:1-8</p>
<p>9“Be broken, nations, and terrified;</p>
<p>listen, distant lands;</p>
<p>gird up, but you’ll be crushed;</p>
<p>gird up, but you’ll be crushed.</p>
<p>10Devise a battle plan, it’ll be thwarted;</p>
<p>develop a strategy, it won’t stand,</p>
<p>because ‘God is with us’ [Immanuel].”	Is 8:9-10</p>
<p>Trust the LORD</p>
<p>11Yahveh warned me strictly not to think the way this country thinks:</p>
<p>12“Don’t suppose everything’s a conspiracy that they do or fear everything they fear or dread what they dread. 13Fear Yahveh of Hosts, the One you consider holy. 14He’ll be your sanctuary. To both houses of Israel, he’ll be a stone to stub your toe on, a rock to trip over, a snare and a trap for the people in Jerusalem. 15Many will trip on it, fall down, and shatter. They’ll be caught in a snare.”</p>
<p>16Preserve the testimony; entrust the teaching to my disciples. 17I’ll wait for Yahveh that’s turned away from Jacob’s descendants. I’ll diligently depend on him. 18I and the children Yahveh has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from Yahveh of Hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.	Is 8:11-18</p>
<p>19If they tell you to consult mediums and wizards that chirp and mutter, shouldn’t they consult their God instead? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 20Instead, go to God’s teaching, go to his testimony! If what they say doesn’t agree with that, it’s because they’re not going to see a new dawn. 21They’ll pass through the land, distressed and hungry. They’ll get mad and curse their king and their God. They’ll look up to the sky 22and down at the earth at distress and darkness, at the despair that comes from anguish. Then they’ll be thrust into deep darkness.	 Is 8:19-22</p>
<p>A Messiah Has Been Born to Us</p>
<p>9:1But there won’t be any more darkness for those who have been in distress. In earlier times, God didn’t give much prominence to the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, but at a future time he’ll make it glorious along the road from the Jordan along the Sea of Galilee, Galilee of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2Those who walk in deep darkness</p>
<p>will see a bright light;</p>
<p>it will shine on people</p>
<p>that live in a dark land.</p>
<p>3You’ll enlarge the nation</p>
<p>and increase their happiness;</p>
<p>they’ll be happy in your presence</p>
<p>like people at harvest time</p>
<p>or when they divide up spoil.</p>
<p>4You’ll take off their yoke of slavery,</p>
<p>remove the burden from their shoulders,</p>
<p>and break the oppressor’s rod</p>
<p>like when you destroyed Midian in battle.	Is 9:1-4</p>
<p>5Infantry boots from the chaos of battle</p>
<p>and uniforms soaked in blood will be burned.</p>
<p>6A child has been born to us, a son has been given;</p>
<p>the government will rest on him.</p>
<p>He’ll be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,</p>
<p>Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>7His peaceful rule will never end</p>
<p>on David’s throne and over his kingdom.</p>
<p>He’ll make it secure and maintain it with justice</p>
<p>and goodness permanently.</p>
<p>The zeal of Yahveh of Hosts will make it happen. Is 9:5-7</p>
<p>God’s Anger at Israel</p>
<p>8Yahveh is issuing a message against Jacob,</p>
<p>a message of condemnation that falls on Israel.</p>
<p>9Everyone in Ephraim will find out,</p>
<p>those who live in Samaria</p>
<p>who say with such arrogance,</p>
<p>10“The fallen bricks in our ruins</p>
<p>we’ll replace with dressed stones;</p>
<p>sycamores that have been cut down</p>
<p>we’ll replant with cedars.”</p>
<p>11But Yahveh will bring adversaries from Rezin</p>
<p>and spur them on.</p>
<p>12Syrians from the east plus Philistines from the west</p>
<p>will devour Israel with wide-open jaws.</p>
<p>Even then, his anger won’t be spent;</p>
<p>his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:8-12</p>
<p>13Yet the people still won’t come back</p>
<p>to the One that disciplined them</p>
<p>or look to Yahveh of Hosts.</p>
<p>14So he’ll cut off head and tail from Israel,</p>
<p>palm branch and reed the same day.</p>
<p>15The head is the elders and honored men;</p>
<p>the tail is the false prophets.</p>
<p>16The people’s guides are misguiding them;</p>
<p>they’re guiding them toward destruction.</p>
<p>17That’s why Yahveh doesn’t delight in their young men</p>
<p>or feel compassion for their orphans and widows:</p>
<p>every one of them is godless;</p>
<p>they all speak foolishness.</p>
<p>Even then, his anger won’t be spent;</p>
<p>his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:13-17</p>
<p>18Sin burns here like a brush fire,</p>
<p>consuming briars and thorns,</p>
<p>setting ablaze the undergrowth in the woods,</p>
<p>and sending up clouds of smoke from igniting trees</p>
<p>19The fury of Yahveh of Hosts will burn through the land;</p>
<p>its people will be the fuel for the fire;</p>
<p>nobody will spare his own brother.</p>
<p>20They’ll grab what’s on the right hand,</p>
<p>but still be hungry;</p>
<p>they eat what’s on the left,</p>
<p>but not be satisfied;</p>
<p>they’ll eat the flesh off their own arm!</p>
<p>21Ephraim and Manasseh will devour each other</p>
<p>and together feed on Judah.</p>
<p>Even then, his anger won’t be spent;</p>
<p>his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:18-21</p>
<p>10:1Misfortune awaits judges that enact unfair laws</p>
<p>and render illegal verdicts,</p>
<p>2who deprive the needy of justice</p>
<p>and rob the poor of their rights</p>
<p>so they can make widows their spoil</p>
<p>and orphans their plunder.</p>
<p>3What are you going to do when punishment arrives,</p>
<p>when devastation comes from far off?</p>
<p>Who will you run to for help?</p>
<p>Where will you hide your wealth?</p>
<p>4There’ll be nothing left for you</p>
<p>but to crouch among the captives</p>
<p>or fall among the slain.</p>
<p>Even then, his anger won’t be spent;</p>
<p>his fist will still be raised.	Is 10:1-4</p>
<p>Judgment Against Assyria</p>
<p>5“Misfortune awaits Assyria,</p>
<p>the club my anger is using,</p>
<p>the staff I’ve loaded with my indignation.</p>
<p>6I’m sending Assyria against my godless nation,</p>
<p>a people I’m angry with,</p>
<p>to capture spoil and seize plunder,</p>
<p>to tramp on like a dirt road.</p>
<p>7But that’s not Assyria’s intention.</p>
<p>It simply intends to destroy</p>
<p>one nation after another.</p>
<p>8It will say, ‘My princes will all be kings?</p>
<p>9Calno will fall like Carchemish,</p>
<p>Hamath like Arpad,</p>
<p>Samaria like Damascus.</p>
<p>10As I’ve done to other kingdoms with idols,</p>
<p>whose carved images were greater than Jerusalem’s and Samaria’s,</p>
<p>11so I’ll do to Jerusalem and its images</p>
<p>what I’ve done to Samaria and its idols.’”	Is 10:5-11</p>
<p>12So when the Lord finishes using Assyria to complete his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he’ll say, “I’ll punish the arrogant king of Assyria and his pompous pride.” 13That’s because he brags,</p>
<p>“I did this by my own power and wisdom,</p>
<p>because I’m intelligent;</p>
<p>I have broken through nations’ boundaries</p>
<p>and carried off their treasures,</p>
<p>knocked down their kings like a bull</p>
<p>14and robbed their wealth like a nest;</p>
<p>I gathered the whole world</p>
<p>like someone gathers abandoned eggs;</p>
<p>not a one flapped its wings</p>
<p>or opened its beak or clucked.”	Is 10:12-14</p>
<p>15But should an axe brag</p>
<p>about being mightier than the woodsman that chops with it?</p>
<p>Should a saw elevate itself</p>
<p>above the carpenter that saws with it?</p>
<p>That would be like a staff wielding a shepherd</p>
<p>or a cane standing up the one that leans on it.</p>
<p>16So the Lord Yahveh of Hosts will send</p>
<p>a plague among Assyria’s strong soldiers;</p>
<p>he’ll ignite their glory with a burning flame.</p>
<p>17Israel’s light will be that fire,</p>
<p>its Holy One that flame;</p>
<p>it will eat up Assyria’s “thorns and briars” in one day.</p>
<p>18He’ll destroy Assyria’s glory like a forest</p>
<p>and his fruitful “garden” body and soul;</p>
<p>it’ll waste away like sick people in a plague.</p>
<p>19So few trees will be left in his “woods”</p>
<p>a kid could count them.	Is 10:15-19</p>
<p>Hope for the Remnant</p>
<p>20At that time, the remnant in Israel and the survivors in Judah that escaped will have the sense to never again rely on allies that want to destroy them. They’ll rely on Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel, 21-22the Mighty God. 22Then, even though Israel was as numerous as sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. 23The Lord Yahveh will carry out the total destruction he’s decreed.</p>
<p>24So this is what he says,</p>
<p>“My people in Zion, don’t be afraid of Assyria that wants to strike you with a rod and threaten you with its staff like Egypt did. 25In a little while, my anger at you will be spent, and I’ll redirect it at Assyria. 26I’ll scourge it like I massacred Midian at the Rock of Oreb. I’ll hold my staff out over the sea and lift it up like I did in Egypt. 27Then I’ll lift the Assyrian burden off your shoulders and break its yoke from off your neck.”        	Is 10:20-27</p>
<p>28The Assyrians have passed through Migron,</p>
<p>attacked Aiath,</p>
<p>and set up base camp at Michmash.</p>
<p>29They’ve gone over the pass</p>
<p>and are camping at Geba;</p>
<p>Ramah has panicked,</p>
<p>and Gibeah of Saul has fled.</p>
<p>30Cry out in terror, people in Gallim!</p>
<p>Warn Laishah and poor Anathoth!</p>
<p>31Madmenah has fled;</p>
<p>the residents of Gebim are searching for refuge.</p>
<p>32The enemy will halt his advance at Nob for the day</p>
<p>and shake his fist at Mount Zion,</p>
<p>the hill of Jerusalem.	Is 10:28-32</p>
<p>33The Lord Yahveh of Hosts will lop off limbs with a terrible crash</p>
<p>and cut down Lebanon’s tall, lofty trees.</p>
<p>34With an iron axe he’ll chop down the undergrowth in its forest,</p>
<p>and Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One.		Is 10:33-34</p>
<p>A Branch from Jesse</p>
<p>11:1A sapling will grow out of Jesse’s stump;</p>
<p>a branch from his roots will bear fruit.</p>
<p>2Yahveh’s spirit will rest on him,</p>
<p>the spirit of wisdom and insight,</p>
<p>counsel and strength,</p>
<p>knowledge and respect for Yahveh.</p>
<p>3He’ll delight in respecting Yahveh;</p>
<p>he won’t judge by appearances</p>
<p>or render verdicts based on hearsay.</p>
<p>4He’ll judge the poor justly</p>
<p>and decide for the meek fairly.</p>
<p>He’ll shake the ground with the force of his words</p>
<p>and blow the sinful away with his breath.</p>
<p>5Faithfulness will be his cloak;</p>
<p>goodness will be his belt.	Is 11:1-5</p>
<p>6Wolves will live with lambs;</p>
<p>leopards will lie down beside baby goats;</p>
<p>calves, lion cubs, and grain-fed animals will herd together;</p>
<p>and a little child will herd them.</p>
<p>7Cows will graze beside bears;</p>
<p>their young will bed down together;</p>
<p>lions will eat straw like oxen.</p>
<p>8A nursing baby will play by a cobra pit;</p>
<p>a weaned child will put his hand in a viper’s hole.</p>
<p>9Nothing will do harm anywhere on my holy mountain,</p>
<p>because the land will be full of knowledge of Yahveh</p>
<p>like the ocean is full of water.	Is 11:6-9</p>
<p>10At that time, Jesse’s heir will serve as a banner for the Gentiles. They’ll rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11For a second time he’ll recover the remnant of his people that are left in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands in the sea. 12He’ll hoist a flag for the nations and repatriate the exiles of Israel and Judah from every direction. 13Ephraim and Judah won’t resent each other or harass one another. 14They’ll swoop down on the Philistines in the west and together plunder the nations to the east. They’ll control Edom and Moab, and subjugate the Ammonites. 15Yahveh will dry up the Red Sea by Egypt and blow his scorching wind on the Euphrates River. He’ll separate it into seven channels so people can wade across in sandals. 16There’ll be a highway from Assyria for the remnant to return on, like there was for Israel when he brought them out of Egypt.	Is 11:10-16</p>
<p>A Song of Praise for Salvation</p>
<p>12:1At that time, you’ll say,</p>
<p>“Thank you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>though you were angry with me,</p>
<p>you turned your anger away</p>
<p>and reassured me.</p>
<p>2You’re my salvation;</p>
<p>I’ll trust you and not be afraid,</p>
<p>because you’re my strength and song.”</p>
<p>3So I’ll draw water with joy</p>
<p>from the wells of salvation</p>
<p>4and say,</p>
<p>“Thank Yahveh, call on him;</p>
<p>tell everyone what he’s done;</p>
<p>tell them his name is Honored.</p>
<p>5Sing praises to him</p>
<p>because he’s done excellent things;</p>
<p>tell it all over the world.</p>
<p>6Sing and shout for joy, you that live in Zion,</p>
<p>because the Holy One that lives with you is great.”	Is 12:1-6</p>
<p>13:1Oracle About Babylon That Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw</p>
<p>2“Hoist a signal flag on a bare hilltop; call out an army</p>
<p>and signal them to attack the mansions of the nobles.</p>
<p>3I’ve commanded my consecrated ones</p>
<p>and strong men to carry out my anger.”	Is 13:1-3</p>
<p>4There’s noise in the mountains like a large army,</p>
<p>the uproar of gathered kingdoms!</p>
<p>Yahveh of Hosts is mustering an army for war.</p>
<p>5He and his instruments of indignation</p>
<p>are coming from distant countries, from far-off horizons,</p>
<p>to destroy the whole region.</p>
<p>6Cry out, because the day of Yahveh has come,</p>
<p>destruction from the Almighty.</p>
<p>7Everybody’s hands will fall limp;</p>
<p>everyone’s heart will melt.</p>
<p>8They’ll panic;</p>
<p>pain and anguish will seize them;</p>
<p>they’ll writhe like a woman in labor</p>
<p>and look aghast at one another;</p>
<p>their faces will be hot.				Is 13:4-8</p>
<p>9The day of Yahveh is coming—</p>
<p>cruel, with fury and burning anger—</p>
<p>to desolate the land</p>
<p>and destroy its sinners.</p>
<p>10The stars and constellations won’t glimmer;</p>
<p>the sun will be dark at dawn,</p>
<p>and the moon won’t shine.</p>
<p>11“That’s how I’ll punish the world for its sin,</p>
<p>put an end to its arrogance,</p>
<p>and humble the pride of ruthless people.</p>
<p>12I’ll make people rarer than gold,</p>
<p>rarer than gold from Ophir.</p>
<p>13I’ll make the sky shake and the earth quake</p>
<p>at my fury when my burning anger comes.” 		Is 13:9-13</p>
<p>14Like hunted gazelles or sheep with no shepherd,</p>
<p>everyone in Babylon will try to get back to their own people,</p>
<p>to escape to their own country.</p>
<p>15Anybody that’s found will be thrust through;</p>
<p>anybody that’s captured will fall by the sword.</p>
<p>16Their little ones will be dashed to pieces while they watch;</p>
<p>their houses will be plundered and their wives raped.</p>
<p>17“I’m going to stir up the Medes against them,</p>
<p>who don’t care about silver or delight in gold.</p>
<p>18Their bows will slaughter the young men;</p>
<p>they won’t show mercy to babies</p>
<p>or pity children.”	Is 13:14-18</p>
<p>19Babylon—the glory of the kingdoms, the Babylonians’ pride—</p>
<p>will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.</p>
<p>20Nobody will ever live there;</p>
<p>no nomad will pitch his tent inside it;</p>
<p>no shepherd will bed down his flock in it.</p>
<p>21Desert animals will rest there;</p>
<p>howling creatures will shelter in its abandoned houses;</p>
<p>owls will nest in it;</p>
<p>shaggy goats will frolic there.</p>
<p>22Hyenas will howl in its fortified towers,</p>
<p>and jackals in its luxurious palaces;</p>
<p>its fate is soon to come.					Is 13:19-22</p>
<p>A Taunt for the King of Babylon</p>
<p>14:1When Yahveh will have mercy on Jacob, choose Israel again, and settle them in their own land, foreigners will join Jacob’s house. 2The nations will help bring them home. Israel will possess them as an inheritance in Yahveh’s land, as male and female servants. They’ll capture their captors and rule their rulers. 3When Yahveh gives them relief from their pain, turmoil, and harsh slavery, 4they’ll taunt the king of Babylon:</p>
<p>“How the big bully has ceased bullying</p>
<p>and stopped his insolence!</p>
<p>5Yahveh has broken the staff of the corrupt,</p>
<p>the scepter of rulers</p>
<p>6that struck people in fury with endless blows,</p>
<p>that ruled nations with unrestrained tyranny.</p>
<p>7The whole region is resting and quiet now;</p>
<p>the people are breaking out into shouts of joy.</p>
<p>8The cypress trees are celebrating over you;</p>
<p>the cedars of Lebanon say,</p>
<p>‘Since you were laid low,</p>
<p>no lumberjacks have come to cut us down.’	Is 14:1-8</p>
<p>9Sheol below you is excited to welcome you;</p>
<p>the spirits of dead leaders rouse to see you;</p>
<p>the nations’ kings rise from their thrones.</p>
<p>\	10They welcome you and say,</p>
<p>‘You’ve become as weak as we are;</p>
<p>you’re like us now.</p>
<p>11Your pomp and the music of your lyres</p>
<p>have come down to Sheol;</p>
<p>maggots are your bed;</p>
<p>worms are your covers.’	Is 14:9-11</p>
<p>12How you’ve fallen from the sky,</p>
<p>Morning Star, son of the dawn!</p>
<p>You that overthrew nations</p>
<p>have been thrown to the ground!</p>
<p>13You told yourself</p>
<p>you’d ascend to the sky</p>
<p>and raise your throne above God’s stars</p>
<p>and preside over the mount of assembly</p>
<p>in the distant north;</p>
<p>14you’d rise above the clouds</p>
<p>and be like the Most High.</p>
<p>15But, you’ll be thrust down to Sheol,</p>
<p>to the depths of the Pit. 		Is 14:12-15</p>
<p>16Those who see you will gape and wonder,</p>
<p>‘Is this the king that made the ground shake</p>
<p>and kingdoms tremble,</p>
<p>17that turned the world into a wasteland,</p>
<p>overthrew cities,</p>
<p>and didn’t let his prisoners go home?’	Is 14:16-17</p>
<p>18The kings of earth lie in honor</p>
<p>in their magnificent tombs;</p>
<p>19but you’ll be thrown out of your sepulcher</p>
<p>like a gross miscarriage,</p>
<p>dumped with the slain in a mass grave,</p>
<p>with those pierced by the sword,</p>
<p>who go down into a cistern</p>
<p>like trampled corpses.</p>
<p>20No one will give you a proper burial</p>
<p>because you’ve ruined your own country</p>
<p>and slain your own people.</p>
<p>21Slaughter his descendants for their father’s guilt</p>
<p>so they won’t grow up and conquer the world</p>
<p>like he did.”	Is 14:18-21</p>
<p>22Yahveh of hosts says,</p>
<p>“I’ll attack Babylon and destroy its reputation, children, and posterity. 23I’ll make a marsh out of it, a haunt for hedgehogs, and sweep it with a broom of destruction.”</p>
<p>24Yahveh of Hosts has sworn,</p>
<p>“It will happen the way I planned;</p>
<p>it’ll stand like I intended.</p>
<p>25I’ll break Assyria when it comes into my land</p>
<p>and trample it underfoot on my mountains.</p>
<p>I’ll remove its yoke from my people</p>
<p>and its burden from their backs.</p>
<p>26That’s what I’ve planned for the whole region,</p>
<p>a judgment that reaches out across the nations.”</p>
<p>27Yahveh of Hosts has a plan; who’s going to stop it?</p>
<p>Who can shove aside his raised fist?	Is 14:22-27</p>
<p>Oracle Against Philistia</p>
<p>28The year King Ahaz died, this oracle came:</p>
<p>29“You that live in Philistia, don’t celebrate</p>
<p>because the rod that struck you is broken;</p>
<p>from that serpent’s stock</p>
<p>a more poisonous snake will come.</p>
<p>30I’ll pasture the firstborn of my poor,</p>
<p>and their needy will lie down safely;</p>
<p>but I’ll starve your root to death</p>
<p>and kill off any survivors.	Is 14:28-30</p>
<p>31Wail, gates; cry, city;</p>
<p>melt away, Philistia;</p>
<p>because an army is drifting in like smoke from the north,</p>
<p>and every soldier in it rushes to the fight.”</p>
<p>32What should we tell any messengers the Philistines send?</p>
<p>“Yahveh founded Zion;</p>
<p>the stricken among his people</p>
<p>will find refuge there.”				Is 14:31-32</p>
<p>15:1Oracle About Moab</p>
<p>Moab will be ruined</p>
<p>because Ar and Kir will be wiped out overnight.</p>
<p>2The people of Dibon will go up to their temple</p>
<p>and high places to weep.</p>
<p>Moab will mourn over Nebo and Medeba;</p>
<p>everyone’s head will be bald, and their beard shaved off.</p>
<p>3They’ll put on burlap</p>
<p>in the streets and squares and on the housetops.</p>
<p>Everyone will be wailing, melting in tears.</p>
<p>4The outcries of Heshbon and Elealeh</p>
<p>will echo all the way to Jahaz;</p>
<p>the armed men of Moab will cry out in panic;</p>
<p>their souls will tremble inside them.	Is 15:1-4</p>
<p>5My heart weeps for Moab;</p>
<p>its refugees are fleeing as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah;</p>
<p>they’re going up to Luhith sobbing.</p>
<p>All along the road to Horonaim,</p>
<p>they’re crying out in distress over their ruin.</p>
<p>6The water at Nimrim has dried up;</p>
<p>the tender grass has withered;</p>
<p>there’s nothing green anywhere.</p>
<p>7The abundance they stored up</p>
<p>is being carried away across Wadi Arabim.</p>
<p>8Their distress cry has gone all over Moab;</p>
<p>their wail as far as Eglaim and Beer-elim.</p>
<p>9The stream near Dibon is running red with blood;</p>
<p>I’ll bring yet more anguish on Dibon:</p>
<p>a lion on the refugees from Moab</p>
<p>and the remnant that’s still in the land.	Is 15:5-9</p>
<p>16:1Send tribute lambs to the ruler of the land,</p>
<p>from Sela through the desert to Mount Zion.</p>
<p>2At the Arnon fords the women of Moab will be</p>
<p>left fluttering like birds or homeless nestlings.	Is 16:1-2</p>
<p>3“Give us advice, grant us justice;</p>
<p>cast your shadow on us like night at noon</p>
<p>to hide us outcasts; don’t betray us fugitives.</p>
<p>4Let our refugees from Moab stay among you;</p>
<p>hide us from the destroyer.”</p>
<p>When oppression and destruction end</p>
<p>and raiders have left the land,</p>
<p>God will establish one of David’s descendants as king;</p>
<p>5he will set up a throne in enduring love,</p>
<p>and a faithful judge will sit on it in David’s tent.</p>
<p>He’ll rule with mercy and truth,</p>
<p>strive for justice,</p>
<p>and measure out goodness in timely fashion. 	Is 16:3-5</p>
<p>6We’ve heard about Moab’s excessive pride,</p>
<p>its arrogance and fury;</p>
<p>its idle boasts have proved to be false.</p>
<p>7So everyone in Moab will moan</p>
<p>for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth</p>
<p>like people completely stricken.</p>
<p>8The fields of Heshbon will wither;</p>
<p>the vineyards of Sibmah too.</p>
<p>The lords of the nations will tramp on its choice clusters</p>
<p>whose tendrils reach out as far as Jazer</p>
<p>and spread to the eastern desert,</p>
<p>whose shoots have grown westward even across the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>Is 16:6-8</p>
<p>9So I’ll weep bitterly for Jazer and the wine of Sibmah;</p>
<p>I’ll drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh,</p>
<p>because the happy shouts over your summer fruits</p>
<p>and harvest have died out.</p>
<p>10Happiness will be gone from the productive fields;</p>
<p>there’ll be no joyful shouting in the vineyards.</p>
<p>Nobody will be treading out wine in the wine presses;</p>
<p>I’ll make the shouting stop.</p>
<p>11So my heart moans for Moab like a dirge on a harp;</p>
<p>my heart aches for Kir-hareseth.</p>
<p>12When the people of Moab</p>
<p>wear themselves out in worship at their shrines</p>
<p>and come to their sanctuary to pray,</p>
<p>it won’t do them any good.	Is 16:9-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh spoke that message earlier about Moab. 14Now he says, “In three years, like a hired hand under contract would count them, I’ll humble Moab’s pride and decimate its sizeable population. Its survivors will be few and feeble.”	Is 16:13-14</p>
<p>17:1Oracle About Damascus</p>
<p>“Damascus will stop being a city,</p>
<p>and become a pile of ruins.</p>
<p>2The villages around Aroer will be deserted;</p>
<p>flocks will bed down in them,</p>
<p>with no one to chase them away.</p>
<p>3Fortified towns will disappear from Ephraim,</p>
<p>sovereignty from Damascus</p>
<p>and the remnant from Syria;</p>
<p>they’ll be like Israel’s departed glory,”</p>
<p>Yahveh of hosts says.        Is 17:1-3</p>
<p>4“At that time, Jacob’s glory will fade;</p>
<p>his robust body will grow frail.</p>
<p>5It will look like a grainfield after harvest,</p>
<p>like someone gleaning grain heads one at a time</p>
<p>in the Valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>6Yet some gleanings will be left—</p>
<p>like shaking an olive tree,</p>
<p>two or three olives on the highest branch,</p>
<p>four or five on a fruitful limb,”</p>
<p>Yahveh God of Israel says. Is 17:4-6</p>
<p>7At that time, people will finally care about their Maker and look to the Holy One of Israel. 8They won’t care about the altars, the work of their hands, or rely on what their fingers have made, the Asherah poles, and incense stands. 9Their largest towns will be like places the Hivites and Amorites deserted when the Israelites came. Desolation will prevail. 	Is 17:7-9</p>
<p>10You’ve forgotten the God who can save you,</p>
<p>the Rock where you could hide.</p>
<p>So, though you plant nice plants</p>
<p>and set them as seedlings from a foreign god,</p>
<p>11though you make them sprout the day you plant them,</p>
<p>put a hedge around them</p>
<p>and get them to blossom the same morning —</p>
<p>you won’t pick any grapes from them;</p>
<p>harvest time will be a time of grief and unrelieved pain.</p>
<p>Is 17:10-11</p>
<p>12Ah, the uproar of many nations</p>
<p>like the roar of the ocean,</p>
<p>like the rumbling of a flash flood!</p>
<p>13The nations rumble on like flooding water,</p>
<p>but he’ll rebuke them,</p>
<p>and they’ll flee like chaff in the mountain wind,</p>
<p>like whirling dust ahead of a storm.</p>
<p>14In the evening Israel will wait in terror,</p>
<p>but by morning its enemies will be dead!</p>
<p>That’s what will happen to the ones that plunder us,</p>
<p>a proper end for those who pillage us.	Is 17:12-14</p>
<p>An Oracle About Nubia</p>
<p>18:1Ah, land of fluttering wings,</p>
<p>land beyond the headwaters of the Nile in Nubia,</p>
<p>2that sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats—</p>
<p>go swiftly, ambassadors, to a nation tall and smooth,</p>
<p>a people feared far and wide,</p>
<p>a powerful, oppressive nation</p>
<p>crisscrossed by rivers.</p>
<p>3All of you that live in the world,</p>
<p>look when I raise the signal on the mountains,</p>
<p>listen when I blow the ram’s horn,</p>
<p>4because Yahveh has told me:</p>
<p>“I’ll watch quietly from my Temple,</p>
<p>as quietly as a cloud forming in the summer sunshine,</p>
<p>like dew condensing at harvest time.” 	Is 18:1-4</p>
<p>5Before harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms</p>
<p>and the flowers start turning into grapes,</p>
<p>he’ll snip off the new shoots with pruning shears</p>
<p>and lop off the spreading branches.</p>
<p>6Your huge army will be left dead for the mountain buzzards</p>
<p>and wild animals on the ground.</p>
<p>The buzzards will spend the summer picking at the corpses;</p>
<p>the wild animals will spend the winter gnawing on them till harvest time.</p>
<p>7At that time, a nation tall and smooth</p>
<p>will pay homage to Yahveh of Hosts—</p>
<p>a people feared far and wide,</p>
<p>a powerful, oppressive nation</p>
<p>crisscrossed by rivers.</p>
<p>They’ll bring their gifts to Mount Zion,</p>
<p>the place that wears the name Yahveh of Hosts. 	Is 18:5-7</p>
<p>19:1Oracle About Egypt</p>
<p>Yahveh is riding a swift cloud to Egypt;</p>
<p>Egypt’s idols tremble in his presence;</p>
<p>the Egyptians’ hearts melt.</p>
<p>2“I’ll pit the Egyptians against one another,</p>
<p>brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor;</p>
<p>city against city, district against district.</p>
<p>3They’ll be demoralized;</p>
<p>I’ll confuse their strategy</p>
<p>so they’ll resort to their idols and spirits of the dead,</p>
<p>to mediums and spiritists.</p>
<p>4I’ll deliver them to a cruel master;</p>
<p>a powerful king will rule them,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh of Hosts says. Is 19:1-4</p>
<p>5The Nile will dry up;</p>
<p>its riverbed will be parched and dry.</p>
<p>6The canals from the Nile will get foul;</p>
<p>the braiding streams in the delta will trickle and dry up;</p>
<p>reeds and rushes will rot.</p>
<p>7Bulrushes by the Nile and the sown fields beside it</p>
<p>will dry up and disappear.</p>
<p>8Fishermen will chant a dirge;</p>
<p>the ones that cast lines in the Nile will mourn;</p>
<p>those who spread nets on the water will lose heart.</p>
<p>9The ones that manufacture linen from combed flax</p>
<p>or weave white cloth will despair.</p>
<p>10Business owners will go bankrupt;</p>
<p>their hired laborers will grieve.	Is 19:5-10</p>
<p>11The officials in Zoan are simply fools;</p>
<p>Pharaoh’s best advisors give stupid advice.</p>
<p>How can you brag to Pharaoh</p>
<p>that you’re wise, descendants of ancient kings?</p>
<p>12Where are your wise men, Pharaoh?</p>
<p>Let them understand, have them tell you</p>
<p>what Yahveh of Hosts has planned for Egypt.</p>
<p>13The officials in Zoan are simply fools;</p>
<p>the nobles in Memphis are deluded;</p>
<p>the cornerstones of its tribes have misled the country.</p>
<p>14Yahveh has stirred up confusion in them,</p>
<p>they’ve led Egypt astray in everything it’s doing,</p>
<p>like a drunk staggering in his vomit.</p>
<p>15There’s nothing helpless Egypt can do</p>
<p>with its head or tail, palm branch or reed.	Is 19:11-15</p>
<p>16The Egyptians will be like women then, cringing with fear as the fist of Yahveh of Hosts shakes over them. 17Judah will terrorize Egypt. They’ll dread hearing Judah mentioned because Yahveh has laid out his purpose against them.</p>
<p>18At that time, five cities in Egypt will start speaking Hebrew and swear allegiance to Yahveh of Hosts—Heliopolis for one. 19There’ll be an altar to him in Egypt and a monument to him at its border, 20a sign and witness. When they call out to him against oppressors, he’ll send them a champion to rescue them. 21That’s how he’ll make himself known to them. They’ll even worship with sacrifice and offering, take vows to him and keep them. 22He’ll strike Egypt, striking then healing them, so they’ll come back to him. 23-24A highway then will run from Egypt to Assyria, and people will travel to each other and worship together. Israel will be the third member in an alliance with Egypt and Assyria, with Yahveh’s blessing located between the two. 25“Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, Israel my permanent possession.”</p>
<p>Is 19:16-25</p>
<p>A Sign Against Egypt and Nubia</p>
<p>20:1Sargon, king of Assyria, sent his general to attack Ashdod. 2That year Yahveh spoke through Isaiah Ben-Amoz, “Take the burlap off your waist and remove your sandals.” So he went around naked and barefoot. 3Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as an omen to Egypt and Nubia. 4The king of Assyria will lead captives away from there, young and old, naked and barefoot with their butts showing, to Egypt’s humiliation. 5People will be disgraced and disappointed by Nubia their hope and Egypt their pride. 6The people along the coast will say, ‘Look at what’s happened to them! How can we escape who fled there for protection from the king of Assyria?!’”			Is 20:1-6</p>
<p>21:1Oracle About the Sandy Wastes Beside the Sea</p>
<p>Like a haboob sweeping in from the Negev,</p>
<p>catastrophe will sweep in through the desert from a terrible land.</p>
<p>2I see a harsh vision:</p>
<p>plunderers plundering; destroyers destroying.</p>
<p>Go on, Elam; lay siege, Media.</p>
<p>I’m going to put an end to the groaning Babylon’s caused.</p>
<p>3My body’s in agony;</p>
<p>pangs have seized me like a woman in labor.</p>
<p>I’m so faint I can’t hear,</p>
<p>so scared I can’t see.</p>
<p>4My mind is reeling, the horror is overwhelming;</p>
<p>I longed for the twilight;</p>
<p>now I’m afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>5The people are setting tables and spreading rugs to sit on;</p>
<p>they’re eating and drinking. But—</p>
<p>“Get up, captains; oil the shields for battle!”	Is 21:1-5</p>
<p>6Then Yahveh said to me,</p>
<p>“Station a sentry to report what he sees.</p>
<p>7When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,</p>
<p>a donkey train, a camel caravan,</p>
<p>he needs to stay alert.”</p>
<p>8Then the sentry shouted like a lion,</p>
<p>“Yahveh, every day I’ve manned my station on the tower;</p>
<p>every night I’ve stood at my post.</p>
<p>9Now at last, here come riders, horsemen in pairs.</p>
<p>They’re reporting, ‘Fallen! Babylon’s fallen!</p>
<p>its images shattered on the ground.’”</p>
<p>10My threshed people, winnowed on the threshing floor!</p>
<p>I’m reporting what I’ve heard</p>
<p>from Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel.	Is 21:6-10</p>
<p>11Oracle About Edom</p>
<p>Someone keeps calling to me from Seir,</p>
<p>“Watchman, what time is it?</p>
<p>How long till morning?”</p>
<p>12The watchman answers,</p>
<p>“Morning is coming, but night will soon return;</p>
<p>if you want updates, come back later</p>
<p>and ask again.”	Is 21:11-12</p>
<p>13Oracle About Arabia</p>
<p>Caravans of Dedanites, you have to spend the night</p>
<p>hiding in the deserts of Arabia.</p>
<p>14People in Tema, bring water for these thirsty refugees;</p>
<p>meet them with food,</p>
<p>15because they’re running from the drawn sword,</p>
<p>the bent bow, the press of battle.</p>
<p>16This is what Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“A year from now, as a hired hand’s contract would read, Kedar’s splendor will end. 17Its surviving archers and strong men will be few;</p>
<p>I, Yahveh God of Israel, have spoken. Is 21:13-17</p>
<p>22:1Oracle About the Valley of Vision</p>
<p>What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p>Why are you all running up to the housetops?</p>
<p>2You noisy, exuberant city in an uproar,</p>
<p>your dead weren’t slain in battle,</p>
<p>but by famine and disease.</p>
<p>3Your rulers all fled together</p>
<p>and were captured without resistance;</p>
<p>your people were discovered and taken captive too,</p>
<p>though they’d tried to escape.	Is 22:1-3</p>
<p>4So I said, “Leave me alone to weep bitterly;</p>
<p>don’t try to comfort me about the destruction of my people.”</p>
<p>5The Lord Yahveh of Hosts has in mind</p>
<p>a day of panic, trampling, and confusion</p>
<p>in the Valley of Vision,</p>
<p>a day of battering down walls</p>
<p>and outcries echoing off the mountains.</p>
<p>6Elam will take up the quiver</p>
<p>with chariots, infantry, and cavalry;</p>
<p>Kir will uncover the shield.</p>
<p>7Chariots will fill your beautiful valleys;</p>
<p>cavalry will storm the gates.</p>
<p>8God will take down Judah’s defenses.	Is 22:4-8a</p>
<p>At that time, you depend on the weapons in the House of the Forest</p>
<p>9when you see how many breaches were in the wall of David’s city;</p>
<p>you store up water from the lower pool;</p>
<p>10you tear down some of the houses to get materials to fortify the wall;</p>
<p>11you create a reservoir between the walls to hold water from the old pool;</p>
<p>but you don’t ask for help from the One that made all this</p>
<p>or consider the One that planned it long ago.</p>
<p>12The Lord Yahveh of Hosts had called for you to weep, wail, shave your head, and put on burlap. 13Instead, you’ve celebrated with revelry, butchering cattle and sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink; tomorrow we die.” 14Yahveh of Hosts revealed this to me, “I won’t forgive that sin as long as you live.”  	Is 22:8b-14</p>
<p>An Oracle for Shebna</p>
<p>15The Lord Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“Go ask Shebna, the palace administrator, 16‘Who are you that you’ve hewn out a monumental tomb for yourself here high in the rock? 17-19Arrogant man! I’m going to depose you from your office, wad you into a ball, and throw you away into a large country to die there with your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master’s house.</p>
<p>20-21I’ll put your robe on my servant Eliakim Ben-Hilkiah and tie your sash around him. I’ll entrust him with your authority, and he’ll become a father to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 22I’ll hang on his shoulder the key to David’s house. When he opens, no one will shut; when he shuts, nobody will open. 23I’ll drive him like a stake in solid ground. He’ll become famous, 24and they’ll place on him the prestige of his family, from offspring and issue to the least items of bowls and jars. 25But then the peg driven in solid ground will break off, and the load hanging on it will fall to the ground. I, Yahveh, have said so.’”	         Is 22:15-25</p>
<p>23:1Oracle About Tyre</p>
<p>Wail, you merchant ships of Tarshish,</p>
<p>because Tyre’s destroyed without home or harbor,</p>
<p>just like the rumor you heard all the way over at Cyprus.</p>
<p>2Be quiet, you people on the coast, merchants of Sidon;</p>
<p>your traders crossed the sea</p>
<p>3and sailed on many bodies of water.</p>
<p>Grain from the Nile, harvest from the Shihor was your revenue;</p>
<p>you were the international marketplace.</p>
<p>4But now be disgraced, Sidon,</p>
<p>because the fortress by the sea says,</p>
<p>“I’m childless, without young men and virgins.”</p>
<p>5When the report reaches Egypt,</p>
<p>they’ll agonize over Tyre.</p>
<p>6Pass the news on to Tarshish;</p>
<p>wail, people in distant places.</p>
<p>7Is this your joyous city</p>
<p>that originated in antiquity</p>
<p>and colonized distant lands?		Is 23:1-7</p>
<p>8Who planned this against Tyre, the granter of crowns,</p>
<p>whose merchants were princes,</p>
<p>whose traders the world honored?</p>
<p>9Yahveh of Hosts planned it to dampen the pride of all beauty,</p>
<p>to humble the honored in the world.</p>
<p>10Tyre’s land has been flooded like the Nile, Tarshish;</p>
<p>its defenses are gone.</p>
<p>11Yahveh has stretched out his hand over the sea</p>
<p>and shaken the kingdoms;</p>
<p>he has commanded to demolish Phoenicia’s fortresses.</p>
<p>12He said, “You won’t celebrate anymore,</p>
<p>crushed virgin of Sidon;</p>
<p>even if you escape to Cyprus,</p>
<p>you won’t find rest.”		Is 23:8-12</p>
<p>13Look at the land of the Babylonians; it’s gone. The Assyrians delivered it to the desert animals; they erected siege ramps, stripped its palaces, and reduced it to ruins.</p>
<p>14Wail, ships of Tarshish;</p>
<p>the harbor you sailed to has been destroyed.</p>
<p>15Tyre will pass from memory for 70 years, the lifetime of one king. Then it will come back to life like the woman in “The Song of the Prostitute”:</p>
<p>16“Take your harp and walk the streets,</p>
<p>forgotten prostitute;</p>
<p>pluck the strings skillfully and sing your songs</p>
<p>so they’ll remember you again.”</p>
<p>17After 70 years Yahveh will revisit Tyre. It’ll go back to playing the prostitute with kingdoms everywhere. 18In the end, her pay won’t be saved up or hoarded; it will be set aside to feed and dress the Yahveh’s priests.	        Is 23:13-18</p>
<p>Devastation of the Earth</p>
<p>24:1Yahveh is laying the earth waste, defacing its surface, scattering its residents. 2People and priests, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors—everyone will be affected. 3The earth will be completely despoiled because Yahveh said so. 4The earth withers, and its people waste away, even its high-ranking ones, 5because they’ve polluted it by sinning against God’s laws, statutes, and everlasting covenant. 6So a curse devastates the earth, and its people have to pay for their guilt. They’re burned; there aren’t many left.                        	   Is 24:1-6</p>
<p>7There’s no new wine to drink;</p>
<p>the grapevines have dried up;</p>
<p>the light-hearted sigh.</p>
<p>8Celebrating with tambourines has stopped;</p>
<p>the noise from revelers has ceased;</p>
<p>happiness with harps has disappeared.</p>
<p>9They don’t drink wine and sing;</p>
<p>alcohol tastes bitter.</p>
<p>10The city in chaos has broken-down walls;</p>
<p>its houses are boarded up to keep intruders out.	Is 24:7-10</p>
<p>11Stragglers in the streets holler for wine;</p>
<p>joy has turned to gloom;</p>
<p>happiness has vanished.</p>
<p>12The city’s in ruins;</p>
<p>its gates are battered down.</p>
<p>13That’s the way it is in the rural areas too—</p>
<p>as when they shake the olive tree</p>
<p>or glean for grapes.	Is 24:11-13</p>
<p>14But a few raise their voices and shout for joy;</p>
<p>they shout from the west about the majesty of Yahveh.</p>
<p>15So honor him in the east,</p>
<p>the God of Israel in lands beyond the sea.</p>
<p>16In the distance we hear singing,</p>
<p>“Honor to the Righteous One.” 			Is 24:14-16</p>
<p>But I say, “Misfortune awaits me! Misfortune awaits me!</p>
<p>The devious deal deviously, so deviously!”</p>
<p>17Terror, pit, and snare threaten you,</p>
<p>people of the earth;</p>
<p>18the one that runs from terror</p>
<p>falls into a pit;</p>
<p>the one that climbs out of the pit</p>
<p>gets caught in a snare.					Is 24:17-18a</p>
<p>The windows in the sky rain down destruction;</p>
<p>the foundations of the earth quake.</p>
<p>19The earth breaks into pieces;</p>
<p>earthquakes split it apart</p>
<p>and shake it violently.</p>
<p>20It staggers like a drunk;</p>
<p>it leans like a shack</p>
<p>because its sins press heavily against it;</p>
<p>it will fall over permanently.</p>
<p>21At that time, Yahveh will punish the gods in the sky above</p>
<p>and the kings on the earth below.</p>
<p>22They’ll be rounded up together</p>
<p>like prisoners in a dungeon</p>
<p>and finally be punished,</p>
<p>23The moon will fade,</p>
<p>and the sun will lose its brightness,</p>
<p>compared to Yahveh of hosts,</p>
<p>who will reign on Zion</p>
<p>and display his glory to his people’s leaders.	Is 24:18b-23</p>
<p>Praise for Judgment and Salvation</p>
<p>25:1Yahveh, you’re my God.</p>
<p>I’ll honor and thank you</p>
<p>for doing the wonderful things you planned long ago.</p>
<p>2You’ve reduced fortified towns to ruble;</p>
<p>the foreigners’ palaces will never be rebuilt.</p>
<p>3So strong people will honor you;</p>
<p>towns in ruthless nations will come to revere you,</p>
<p>4because you’ve defended the helpless</p>
<p>and needy in their despair;</p>
<p>you’re a shelter from the storm and a shade from heat,</p>
<p>because the breath of ruthless people</p>
<p>is like a storm beating on a wall</p>
<p>5or stifling heat in drought.</p>
<p>You weaken the threats of foreigner powers</p>
<p>like a cloud’s shadow lessens heat;</p>
<p>the raucous war songs of the ruthless fall silent. 	Is 25:1-5</p>
<p>6On this mountain Yahveh of Hosts will hold a lavish banquet for everybody in the world, a banquet of aged wine and choice meat. 7Here he’ll remove the shadow that lies over every country, the veil that covers the nations. 8He’ll swallow up death for all time, wipe away everyone’s tears, and remove the abuse of his people everywhere. Yahveh has said so.</p>
<p>9At that time, people will say, “This is the God we’ve waited for to save us. He’s Yahveh; let’s celebrate and be glad he’s done it.” 10His hand will rest on this mountain, and Moab will be trodden down like straw in the urine of a manure pit. 11He’ll subdue Moab like a swimmer pushes down water. He’ll end its pride and slight-of-hand. 12He’ll bring down its impregnable fortifications and throw them on the ground.	Is 25:6-12</p>
<p>A Song of Praise to the LORD</p>
<p>26:1At that time, they’ll sing a song in Judah:</p>
<p>We have an impregnable city;</p>
<p>it’s set up with secure walls and ramparts.</p>
<p>2Open the gates so a good nation can enter,</p>
<p>one that stays faithful.</p>
<p>3You keep steadfast minds in perfect peace</p>
<p>because they trust in you.</p>
<p>4Trust in Yahveh forever</p>
<p>because in him we have an everlasting Rock.</p>
<p>5He brings down low the ones that live up high</p>
<p>in their “safe city”;</p>
<p>he throws it to the ground.</p>
<p>6The poor and helpless trample it.				Is 26:1-6</p>
<p>7The road for the righteous is not rough;</p>
<p>Righteous One, level out our path.</p>
<p>8We conform our way to your judgments, Yahveh;</p>
<p>with all our heart we want to honor you.</p>
<p>9At night I long for you;</p>
<p>my spirit looks for you earnestly;</p>
<p>when the earth experiences your judgments,</p>
<p>its people learn goodness.</p>
<p>10Even if sinners receive grace,</p>
<p>they don’t learn goodness;</p>
<p>they keep dealing unjustly in an unjust land</p>
<p>and don’t sense Yahveh’s majesty. 	Is 26:7-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh, you’re holding up your fist, but they don’t see it;</p>
<p>show them your zeal for your people;</p>
<p>humble your adversaries;</p>
<p>consume them with fire.</p>
<p>12You’ll establish peace for us,</p>
<p>since you’re the One that actually does for us</p>
<p>everything we try to do.</p>
<p>13Other lords have ruled us before,</p>
<p>but you’re the only one we acknowledge.</p>
<p>14Those dead rulers won’t live again;</p>
<p>their departed spirits won’t rise.</p>
<p>You’ve punished them with destruction</p>
<p>and wiped out any memory of them.</p>
<p>15You’ve made this nation great</p>
<p>and extended its borders; we honor you.	Is 26:11-15</p>
<p>16We looked to you in distress,</p>
<p>able only to whisper a prayer,</p>
<p>because you were disciplining us.</p>
<p>17Like a pregnant woman at delivery time,</p>
<p>she writhes and cries out in labor pains;</p>
<p>that’s how we were before you, Yahveh.</p>
<p>18We’ve been pregnant, writhing in labor,</p>
<p>but nothing came of it;</p>
<p>we couldn’t save the world</p>
<p>or bring life into it.</p>
<p>19But even your dead will live again; their corpses will rise;</p>
<p>those who lie in the dust will wake up and sing for joy.</p>
<p>Your light will fall on them like dew,</p>
<p>and the ground will give birth to their departed spirits.</p>
<p>Is 26:16-19</p>
<p>Deliverance for Israel</p>
<p>20Go home, my people,</p>
<p>and lock the doors behind you;</p>
<p>hide for a while</p>
<p>till Yahveh’s anger has run its course.</p>
<p>21Yahveh is coming from heaven</p>
<p>to punish people for their sin;</p>
<p>the ground will show those whose blood’s been shed;</p>
<p>it won’t any longer be able to hide its slain.	Is 26:20-21</p>
<p>27:1At that time, Yahveh will punish Leviathan with his fierce, big strong sword, Leviathan the swift, slithering snake. He’ll kill the dragon that’s in the sea.</p>
<p>2Then,</p>
<p>“There’ll be a delightful vineyard to sing about!</p>
<p>3I, Yahveh, will be its keeper;</p>
<p>I’ll water it constantly</p>
<p>and guard it day and night so no one harms it.</p>
<p>4I won’t be angry anymore.</p>
<p>If anybody gives me briars and thorns in battle,</p>
<p>I’ll trample and burn them completely</p>
<p>5unless they rely on me for protection.</p>
<p>Let them make peace with me;</p>
<p>let them make peace with me.”	Is 27:1-5</p>
<p>6In time to come, Jacob will take root;</p>
<p>Israel will sprout and blossom,</p>
<p>and fill the world with fruit.</p>
<p>7Has Yahveh struck Israel</p>
<p>the way he struck Israel’s strikers?</p>
<p>Has he slain Israel</p>
<p>the way he slew Israel’s slayers?</p>
<p>8No, he contended with Israel by banishing them,</p>
<p>expelling them with his fierce east wind.</p>
<p>9So that’s how he’ll purge Jacob’s iniquity;</p>
<p>that’s what pardoning its sin will cost,</p>
<p>when God makes pagan altar stones like pulverized chalk,</p>
<p>when he leaves no Asherah pole or incense altar standing.</p>
<p>10The fortified towns will be deserted,</p>
<p>their houses empty as in open country;</p>
<p>calves will graze there and bed down;</p>
<p>they’ll chew on brush and branches there.</p>
<p>11When those branches dry up, they’ll break off</p>
<p>and women will gather them for kindling;</p>
<p>this nation doesn’t use any sense;</p>
<p>so their Maker won’t show them any mercy;</p>
<p>their Creator won’t be gracious to them.	Is 27:6-11</p>
<p>12Yet in time, Israel, Yahveh will start gleaning from the Euphrates River to the River of Egypt and gather you up one by one. 13A large trumpet will blow, and the exiles who were perishing in Assyria and Egypt will come to Jerusalem to worship Yahveh on his holy mountain.</p>
<p>Is 27:12-13</p>
<p>An Oracle About Samaria</p>
<p>28:1Misfortune awaits the proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks,</p>
<p>the fading flower of its glorious beauty,</p>
<p>Samaria, that’s at the head of the fertile valley</p>
<p>of those drunk with wine.</p>
<p>2Yahveh has a strong and powerful military agent;</p>
<p>he’ll throw Samaria down on the ground</p>
<p>like a hail storm, destructive gale, overwhelming flood.</p>
<p>3The proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks will get tramped on;</p>
<p>4the fading flower of its glorious beauty</p>
<p>that’s at the head of the fertile valley,</p>
<p>will be like the first-ripe fig of summer:</p>
<p>as soon as it’s seen, it’s picked and eaten.	Is 28:1-4</p>
<p>5At a later time, Yahveh of Hosts will finally become Israel’s crown instead,</p>
<p>a beautiful diadem for his remnant people.</p>
<p>6He’ll give their judges a desire to render justice</p>
<p>and their soldiers the courage to repel onslaughts at the gates.</p>
<p>7But for now the priests and prophets</p>
<p>reel with wine and stagger from alcohol,</p>
<p>reeling while having visions,</p>
<p>staggering while rendering verdicts.</p>
<p>8Their tables are covered with vomit;</p>
<p>there’s filth everywhere.	Is 28:5-8</p>
<p>9Yet they say, “Who’s Yahveh think he’s going to teach?</p>
<p>Who’s he going to explain the message to?</p>
<p>Are we little kids just weaned from milk,</p>
<p>just taken from the breast?</p>
<p>10They say that because he tells them over and over,</p>
<p>“Precept on precept,</p>
<p>line on line;</p>
<p>here a little, there a little.”</p>
<p>11So instead, he’ll have to speak to his people</p>
<p>in a foreigner’s language.</p>
<p>12He told them, “Here’s a place for the weary to rest,”</p>
<p>but they ignored him.</p>
<p>13So Yahveh will keep on lining out his message to them,</p>
<p>“Precept on precept,</p>
<p>line on line;</p>
<p>here a little, there a little”;</p>
<p>till they stumble and fall backward,</p>
<p>broken, snared, and captured.	Is 28:9-13</p>
<p>14So listen to Yahveh’s message,</p>
<p>you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>15“You try to tell yourselves,</p>
<p>‘We’ve made a deal with death,</p>
<p>a treaty with Sheol;</p>
<p>the overwhelming scourge won’t trample us</p>
<p>when it comes along;</p>
<p>we can lie our way out of danger</p>
<p>and hide behind deceit.’”</p>
<p>16But the Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone,</p>
<p>a precious cornerstone for a firm foundation;</p>
<p>nothing that’s built on it will shift out of place.</p>
<p>17I’ll make justice the measuring line</p>
<p>and goodness the level;</p>
<p>hail will sweep away your refuge in lies,</p>
<p>and water will flood your hiding place.</p>
<p>18I’ll undo your deal with death</p>
<p>and annul your treaty with Sheol;</p>
<p>when the overwhelming scourge comes along,</p>
<p>it will trample you. 	Is 28:14-18</p>
<p>19It’ll seize you again and again;</p>
<p>morning after morning it will come through</p>
<p>and at any time day or night.</p>
<p>That will mean pure terror for you</p>
<p>once you get what that means.”</p>
<p>20The bed you’ve built is too short to stretch out on;</p>
<p>your blanket’s too narrow to cover up with.</p>
<p>21Yahveh will come like he did at Mount Perazim;</p>
<p>he’ll show his anger like he did in the Valley of Gibeon.</p>
<p>He’ll do his unexpected task</p>
<p>and accomplish his extraordinary work.</p>
<p>22Don’t carry on like scoffers;</p>
<p>he’ll tighten your bonds even more.</p>
<p>I’ve heard from the Lord Yahveh of hosts</p>
<p>about his decree to destroy the whole region. Is 28:19-22</p>
<p>23Listen to my question.</p>
<p>24When it’s planting time,</p>
<p>does a farmer keep on plowing,</p>
<p>keep breaking up ground and harrowing it?</p>
<p>25Doesn’t he smooth it out,</p>
<p>sow dill and scatter cummin,</p>
<p>plant wheat in rows,</p>
<p>and broadcast barley and rye in their plots</p>
<p>26because his God has taught him how to do it?</p>
<p>27A farmer doesn’t thresh dill with a sledge</p>
<p>or drive a cart wheel over cummin;</p>
<p>he beats out dill and cummin with a stick.</p>
<p>28Does he crush grain for bread?</p>
<p>No, he doesn’t keep threshing it over and over;</p>
<p>the cart wheel and horses’ hooves would ruin it.</p>
<p>29That goes for Yahveh of Hosts too,</p>
<p>who made his advice wonderful</p>
<p>and his wisdom great. 			Is 28:23-29</p>
<p>An Oracle About Jerusalem</p>
<p>29:1“Misfortune awaits you, Ariel, city where David camped!</p>
<p>Year after year, you observe the festivals on schedule.</p>
<p>2Yet I’ll bring disaster on you, Ariel;</p>
<p>you’ll lament and mourn;</p>
<p>you’ll be to me what Ariel means [blood-covered altar].</p>
<p>3I’ll camp against you all the way around</p>
<p>and set up siege works and battle towers.</p>
<p>4You’ll be brought low;</p>
<p>you’ll speak from the ground</p>
<p>where you lie prostrate;</p>
<p>you’ll speak like a spirit conjured up from the dirt,</p>
<p>like a whisper from the grave.	Is 29:1-4</p>
<p>5“But suddenly your many enemies</p>
<p>will be like fine dust blown away,</p>
<p>ruthless attackers like chaff</p>
<p>gone with a gust of wind.</p>
<p>6Yahveh of Hosts will visit you</p>
<p>with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise,</p>
<p>with whirlwind, storm, and consuming fire.</p>
<p>7The nations that carry on war with you, Ariel,</p>
<p>that attack your fortresses,</p>
<p>will vanish like a dream at night.</p>
<p>8They’ll be like hungry people that dream they’re eating,</p>
<p>but wake up still hungry;</p>
<p>or thirsty people that dream they’re drinking,</p>
<p>but wake up fainting from thirst.</p>
<p>That’s how it will be with the countries</p>
<p>that attack Mount Zion.”		Is 29:5-8</p>
<p>9But you linger and wait and blind yourselves.</p>
<p>You’re drunk, but not with wine;</p>
<p>you’re staggering, but not from alcohol;</p>
<p>10that’s because Yahveh has poured a sleeping spirit over you;</p>
<p>he’s shut your eyes, prophets,</p>
<p>and covered your heads, seers.</p>
<p>11-12This whole vision won’t mean much to you, either because it’s a sealed scroll to you or because you can’t read. Literate or not, you won’t get it.	         Is 29:9-12</p>
<p>13So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“These people come near with their mouth</p>
<p>and honor me with their lips,</p>
<p>but their hearts are somewhere else;</p>
<p>their respect for me consists of</p>
<p>memorizing human rules.</p>
<p>14So I’ll surprise these hypocrites once again</p>
<p>with something awesome and amazing;</p>
<p>the wisdom of the wise will perish;</p>
<p>the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear. Is 29:13-14</p>
<p>15“Misfortune awaits people that try to hide</p>
<p>their intentions from me,</p>
<p>who do things in the dark</p>
<p>and think I can’t see them.</p>
<p>16You’ve got things turned around!</p>
<p>Is a potter treated like clay</p>
<p>so that what’s made says to its maker,</p>
<p>‘You didn’t make me’;</p>
<p>or what’s formed says to the one that formed it,</p>
<p>“You don’t know what you’re doing’”?	Is 29:15-16</p>
<p>17Isn’t it just a little while</p>
<p>till Lebanon becomes a fertile field</p>
<p>and the fertile field becomes a forest?</p>
<p>18At that time, the deaf will hear the message from the scroll;</p>
<p>the blind will see through the gloom and darkness;</p>
<p>19the humble will have fresh happiness in Yahveh;</p>
<p>the needy will celebrate in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>20Ruthless people will come to nothing;</p>
<p>scoffers won’t scoff anymore;</p>
<p>those intent on creating disorder will be destroyed—</p>
<p>21people that slander,</p>
<p>that try to entrap the judge in court,</p>
<p>that defraud the innocent with sophistry. 	Is 29:17-21</p>
<p>22So Yahveh that redeemed Abraham says of Jacob’s houseouseHou,</p>
<p>“They won’t be ashamed anymore,</p>
<p>or turn pale with fear.</p>
<p>23When they see their descendants around them,</p>
<p>the work of my hands,</p>
<p>they’ll treat me as holy</p>
<p>and stand in awe of me.</p>
<p>24The ignorant will know the truth;</p>
<p>the stubborn will accept instruction.” 	Is 29:22-24</p>
<p>No Help from Egypt</p>
<p>30:1Yahveh says, “Misfortune awaits rebellious children</p>
<p>that carry out plans, but not mine,</p>
<p>that make alliances, but not by my Spirit,</p>
<p>and thereby pile sin on top of error;</p>
<p>2children that go down to Egypt to get help instead of consulting me,</p>
<p>to take refuge in Pharaoh’s safety,</p>
<p>to look for shelter under Egypt’s shadow.</p>
<p>3The safety that comes from Pharaoh will humiliate them;</p>
<p>the shelter under Egypt’s shadow will disgrace them.</p>
<p>4Their princes may be at Zoan,</p>
<p>their ambassadors may arrive at Hanes,</p>
<p>5but they’ll all be disgraced</p>
<p>by a people that can’t help them,</p>
<p>but bring shame and dishonor.”	Is 30:1-5</p>
<p>6Oracle About Animals in the Negev</p>
<p>Through a land of distress and anguish—</p>
<p>where lions and lionesses,</p>
<p>vipers and poisonous snakes live—</p>
<p>a caravan transports their wealth on the backs of donkeys,</p>
<p>their treasure on the humps of camels.</p>
<p>They’re taking tribute to a nation that can’t help them,</p>
<p>7to Egypt, “Harmless Rahab [Dragon],” as I describe it.</p>
<p>Is 30:6-7</p>
<p>Warning to Judah</p>
<p>8Go write this on a scroll,</p>
<p>so it can serve as a lasting testimony.</p>
<p>9This is a rebellious nation,</p>
<p>unfaithful children that refuse to hear Yahveh’s instruction;</p>
<p>10that say to seers, “Don’t see visions,”</p>
<p>that tell prophets, “Don’t prophesy what’s true.</p>
<p>Say pleasant things;</p>
<p>prophesy illusions.</p>
<p>11Get off the road, turn away from the beaten path;</p>
<p>we don’t want to hear any more</p>
<p>about the Holy One of Israel.”                      Is 30:8-11</p>
<p>12This is what the Holy One of Israel says,</p>
<p>“Since you’ve rejected that message</p>
<p>and relied on oppression and perversion,</p>
<p>13your sin is like a bulge in a wall</p>
<p>that’s ready to collapse.</p>
<p>14It will fall like a smashed clay pot</p>
<p>so completely shattered that not a sherd of it</p>
<p>can take coals from a hearth</p>
<p>or dip water from a well.”	Is 30:12-14</p>
<p>Blessings for Yahveh’s People</p>
<p>15This is what the Lord Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel, says,</p>
<p>“Only in repenting and resting in me will you be saved;</p>
<p>your strength lies in quietness and trust.</p>
<p>But you didn’t want to do that.</p>
<p>16You said, ‘No, we’ll flee on horses brought from Egypt.’</p>
<p>You’ll flee all right!</p>
<p>‘We’ll ride on fast horses.’</p>
<p>Your pursuers will ride fast too!</p>
<p>17A thousand will flee at the threat of one;</p>
<p>you’ll all run at the threat of five,</p>
<p>till you’re abandoned like a flagpole on a mountaintop,</p>
<p>like a signal on a hill.”	Is 30:15-17</p>
<p>18Yahveh wants to be gracious to you;</p>
<p>he waits on high to show you mercy</p>
<p>because he’s a just God.</p>
<p>How blessed they are who wait for him to help.	Is 30:18</p>
<p>19People in Zion, residents of Jerusalem, don’t cry; he’ll be gracious to you. When he hears you cry out to him for help, he’ll answer. 20Although he’s given you adversity for food and suffering for water, your Teacher won’t hide any longer; you’ll see him. 21When you swerve to left or right, you’ll hear a voice behind you, “This is the way; walk here.” 22You’ll defile your carved images overlaid with silver, your molten images plated with gold. You’ll throw them out like filthy rags and say, “Get them out of here!”</p>
<p>23Then he’ll give you rain for the seed you sow and bread from the yield. It’ll be rich and abundant. Your livestock will have plenty of pasture. 24Your oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder winnowed with fork and shovel. 25After the great slaughter when the towers fall, on every tall mountain and tall hill, there’ll be streams of water running down. 26Moonlight will be like sunlight, and sunlight will be seven times brighter—a week’s worth a day—when Yahveh sets his people’s fractures and heals the bruises he’s inflicted on them.        							                                                                                    Is 30:19-26</p>
<p>27Yahveh will come from a remote place</p>
<p>with burning anger and thick smoke.</p>
<p>His lips will be full of indignation,</p>
<p>his tongue a consuming fire,</p>
<p>28his breath an overflowing torrent neck deep.</p>
<p>He’ll sift out the nations in his sieve</p>
<p>and put a bridle in their mouths to ride them to ruin.</p>
<p>29But you’ll sing songs at night like you do at the holy festivals. You’ll celebrate like you do when you march to a flute as pilgrims and go up to the mountain of Yahveh, the Rock of Israel. 30HeY will make his majestic voice heard and bring down his arm in lightning, cloudbursts, and downpours with hailstones. 31The Assyrians will panic when they hear him strike with his rod. 32Every punishing blow he lays on them will be to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps. He’ll fight them in battles and brandish his weapons. 33Topheth has long been ready, prepared for the Assyrian king. Yahveh has made it deep and wide, a pyre with plenty of wood. His breath like a lava stream of sulfur will light it.      	                                                                    Is 30:27-33</p>
<p>Warning to Those Who Rely on Egypt</p>
<p>31:1Misfortune lies ahead for those who go down to Egypt for help,</p>
<p>who rely on horses,</p>
<p>that trust in chariots because they are many</p>
<p>and in horsemen because they are strong,</p>
<p>instead of looking to the Holy One of Israel,</p>
<p>instead of consulting Yahveh!</p>
<p>2He’s wise and brings disaster</p>
<p>and doesn’t take back what he says;</p>
<p>he rises up at the sinful and their helpers.</p>
<p>3Egyptians are people, not God;</p>
<p>their horses are flesh, not spirit.</p>
<p>So Yahveh will hold out his fist,</p>
<p>and the one that helps them will stumble,</p>
<p>the one that’s helped will fall.</p>
<p>They’ll meet their end together.	Is 31:1-3</p>
<p>4Yahveh says to me,</p>
<p>“Like a young lion growls over its prey</p>
<p>and shepherds’ shouts don’t scare it away,</p>
<p>I’llY come down</p>
<p>to wage war on Mount Zion.</p>
<p>5Like a hovering bird I’ll guard Jerusalem,</p>
<p>protect and deliver it,</p>
<p>spare and rescue it.”	Is 31:4-5</p>
<p>6Come back to the One you’ve rebelled against, Israel, 7and throw away the silver and gold idols you’ve made.</p>
<p>8“The Assyrians will fall by a sword that’s not human;</p>
<p>a sword that’s not human will devour them.</p>
<p>They won’t escape,</p>
<p>and their young soldiers will become slaves.</p>
<p>9Their ‘rock’ will pass away in panic;</p>
<p>their princes will desert the standard,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says, whose fire is in Zion,</p>
<p>whose furnace is Jerusalem.	Is 31:6-9</p>
<p>Israel’s Ultimate Deliverance</p>
<p>32:1A righteous king is coming;</p>
<p>his princes will rule honestly.</p>
<p>2Each will provide a refuge from the wind,</p>
<p>a shelter from the storm,</p>
<p>a stream of water in the desert,</p>
<p>the shade of a big tree in parched land.</p>
<p>3Then the seeing will perceive;</p>
<p>the hearing will listen.</p>
<p>4The rash will use good judgment;</p>
<p>stuttering tongues will speak fluently.	Is 32:1-4</p>
<p>5Fools won’t be called noble anymore;</p>
<p>rogues won’t be considered generous;</p>
<p>6because fools speak nonsense;</p>
<p>they’re inclined to practice ungodliness,</p>
<p>to lie about Yahveh,</p>
<p>to keep hungry people hungry,</p>
<p>and deprive the thirsty of a drink.</p>
<p>7Their methods are evil;</p>
<p>they design plots</p>
<p>to destroy the poor with slander</p>
<p>even when the plea of the needy is just.</p>
<p>8But the truly noble make noble plans</p>
<p>and stick with them.	Is 32:5-8</p>
<p>9Get up, women of leisure;</p>
<p>listen, complacent daughters.</p>
<p>10In a little over a year,</p>
<p>trouble will come, complacent daughters;</p>
<p>because the grapes will fail,</p>
<p>the fruit harvest won’t happen.</p>
<p>11Tremble, women of leisure;</p>
<p>shudder, complacent daughters.</p>
<p>Strip down to the skin</p>
<p>and wrap burlap around your waist.	Is 32:9-11</p>
<p>12Beat your breasts for pleasant fields and fruitful vines,</p>
<p>13for joyful houses and happy towns,</p>
<p>for my people’s land, where thorns and thistles grow;</p>
<p>14because the palace will be abandoned,</p>
<p>the populated towns will be empty,</p>
<p>hill and watchtower will become permanent dens,</p>
<p>a delight for wild donkeys,</p>
<p>a pasture for flocks;</p>
<p>15till the Spirit is poured out on us from on high,</p>
<p>till the desert becomes a fertile field,</p>
<p>and the fertile field becomes a forest.	Is 32:12-15</p>
<p>16Then justice will thrive in the countryside;</p>
<p>goodness will grow in the fertile field.</p>
<p>17Goodness will lead to peace</p>
<p>and bring extended calm and confidence.</p>
<p>18Then my people will live undisturbed</p>
<p>in safe houses and peaceful retreats.</p>
<p>19Though hail flattens the forest</p>
<p>and the city’s leveled,</p>
<p>20you’ll still be blessed who sow near water,</p>
<p>who let livestock and donkeys range free.	Is 32:16-20</p>
<p>An Oracle About Assyria</p>
<p>33:1Misfortune awaits you, destroyers</p>
<p>who haven’t been destroyed yourselves;</p>
<p>misfortune awaits you, treacherous people</p>
<p>that others haven’t treated treacherously.</p>
<p>As soon as you’re done destroying, you’ll be destroyed;</p>
<p>as soon as you’ve finished your treachery,</p>
<p>others will deal treacherously with you.</p>
<p>2Yahveh, be gracious to us; we’ve waited for you;</p>
<p>be our strength each morning,</p>
<p>our deliverer when trouble comes.</p>
<p>3Let people run from the turmoil you bring;</p>
<p>let nations scatter when you threaten.</p>
<p>4Gather spoil like caterpillars gather</p>
<p>and locusts strip the countryside.</p>
<p>5Honor Yahveh because he lives on high;</p>
<p>he’s filled Zion with justice and goodness.</p>
<p>6Later he’ll provide you stability,</p>
<p>a wealth of salvation, knowledge, and wisdom;</p>
<p>respect for him will be your treasure.	Is 33:1-6</p>
<p>7But for now, your brave men cry in public;</p>
<p>your ambassadors for peace weep bitterly.</p>
<p>8The roads are empty; travel is at a standstill</p>
<p>because the enemy has broken the treaty,</p>
<p>despised towns,</p>
<p>and doesn’t care about their inhabitants.</p>
<p>9The land mourns and pines away;</p>
<p>Lebanon shrivels up with shame.</p>
<p>Sharon has become a desert;</p>
<p>Bashan and Carmel are losing their leaves.</p>
<p>10“So now I’ll stand up and be honored,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>11“You’ve conceived chaff and given birth to stubble;</p>
<p>my breath will consume you like a flame.</p>
<p>12I’ll burn the nations to lime</p>
<p>and destroy cut thorns with fire.	Is 33:7-12</p>
<p>13You that are far off, pay attention to what I’ve done;</p>
<p>you that are near, acknowledge my power.”</p>
<p>14Sinners in Zion have panicked; the godless tremble,</p>
<p>“Who among us can live in this consuming fire</p>
<p>and continual burning?”</p>
<p>15You that conduct yourselves justly and speak truthfully,</p>
<p>who refuse to profit from fraud</p>
<p>and pull your hand back from bribes,</p>
<p>who stop your ears from listening to murderous plots</p>
<p>and shut your eyes from watching evil—</p>
<p>16you’ll live on high;</p>
<p>your refuge will be an impregnable cliff;</p>
<p>you’ll have food enough to eat</p>
<p>and water you can rely on.	Is 33:13-16</p>
<p>17You’ll see the King in his splendor</p>
<p>and look at a land that stretches far and wide.</p>
<p>18You’ll remember your fears from before, and ask,</p>
<p>“Where are the Assyrians that counted our defenses,</p>
<p>numbered our towers,</p>
<p>and added up the spoil?”</p>
<p>19You won’t see those fierce people anymore</p>
<p>whose language nobody could understand.	Is 33:17-19</p>
<p>20Look at Zion that hosts your appointed festivals;</p>
<p>you’ll see that Jerusalem offers a safe place to live,</p>
<p>a tent that won’t blow over,</p>
<p>whose stakes won’t pull up,</p>
<p>whose guy ropes don’t snap.</p>
<p>21Yahveh, the Majestic One, will be there for you,</p>
<p>a place with streams and canals,</p>
<p>where no galley will come</p>
<p>or big ship can sail;</p>
<p>22because Yahveh your judge, lawgiver, and king</p>
<p>will protect you.	Is 33:20-22</p>
<p>23Your enemies’ tackle is hanging loose;</p>
<p>it can’t hold the mast in place</p>
<p>or keep the sail spread.</p>
<p>As God’s people, you’ll divide the abundant spoil;</p>
<p>even the lame will gather plunder.</p>
<p>24You that live here won’t say, “We’re weak and sick,”</p>
<p>because God will forgive your sin.	Is 33:23-24</p>
<p>An Oracle for the Nations</p>
<p>34:1Come close, nations, and listen!</p>
<p>world and everything in it, pay attention.</p>
<p>2Yahveh is furious with the nations and their armies;</p>
<p>he’ll destroy them and deliver them to slaughter.</p>
<p>3Their slain will be thrown out;</p>
<p>their corpses will reek;</p>
<p>their blood will soak the hillsides.</p>
<p>4The stars will fade out;</p>
<p>the sky will roll up like a scroll.</p>
<p>it’ll wither away</p>
<p>like leaves on a grapevine or fig tree.	Is 34:1-4</p>
<p>5“My sword has drunk its fill in the sky;</p>
<p>it will come down in condemnation on Edom,</p>
<p>a nation I’ve devoted to complete destruction.</p>
<p>6My sword will be bloody,</p>
<p>covered with the blood of lambs and goats,</p>
<p>with the fat on the kidneys of rams;</p>
<p>because I’ll hold a sacrifice in Bozrah,</p>
<p>a great slaughter in Edom.</p>
<p>7Wild oxen will fall with them,</p>
<p>male calves and great bulls;</p>
<p>Its ground will be soaked with blood;</p>
<p>its dust will be greasy from fat.”	Is 34:6-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh will have a day of vengeance,</p>
<p>a year of payback for what Edom did to Zion.</p>
<p>9Edom’s wadis will run with pitch;</p>
<p>its dirt will become sulfur;</p>
<p>its ground will be covered with burning tar.</p>
<p>10It won’t go out day or night;</p>
<p>its smoke will rise endlessly.</p>
<p>Generation after generation it won’t be inhabited;</p>
<p>nobody will ever travel through it.</p>
<p>11Hawks and hedgehogs will take it over;</p>
<p>owls and ravens will roost there.</p>
<p>God will measure it for desolation,</p>
<p>hold a plumb line on it for chaos.	Is 34:8-11</p>
<p>12There won’t be anyone to call king;</p>
<p>no princes, or nobles.</p>
<p>13Thorns will grow in its fortresses;</p>
<p>nettles and thistles will come up in its forts.</p>
<p>It’ll be a haunt for jackals,</p>
<p>a home for owls.</p>
<p>14Desert animals will mix with hyenas;</p>
<p>hairy goats will bleat to one another;</p>
<p>the night monster [Lilith] will settle down to rest there.</p>
<p>15Owls will make nests and lay their eggs there;</p>
<p>they’ll hatch them and gather the brood under their shadow.</p>
<p>Buzzards will gather there in nesting pairs.			Is 34:12-15</p>
<p>16Read about them in the Book of Yahveh;</p>
<p>every one is mentioned there with its mate</p>
<p>because he has commanded,</p>
<p>and his Spirit will gather them by kinds in pairs.</p>
<p>17He has surveyed the land</p>
<p>and deeded it over to them forever. 			Is 34:16-17</p>
<p>Joy for the Redeemed</p>
<p>35:1-2The desert wilderness will be happy;</p>
<p>the Arabah will blossom profusely with crocuses,</p>
<p>and sing and celebrate.</p>
<p>It will be as glorious as Lebanon,</p>
<p>as majestic as Carmel and Sharon.</p>
<p>They’ll see the glory of Yahveh,</p>
<p>the majesty of our God.</p>
<p>3Strengthen feeble hands;</p>
<p>steady weak knees.</p>
<p>4Say to those with pounding hearts,</p>
<p>“Be strong and not afraid;</p>
<p>your God will avenge you and save you.”</p>
<p>5He’ll open the eyes of the blind</p>
<p>and unplug the ears of the deaf.	Is 35:1-5</p>
<p>6The lame will leap like a deer,</p>
<p>and the mute will shout for joy,</p>
<p>because water will gush out into the wilderness,</p>
<p>and streams will water the desert.</p>
<p>7Parched land will become a marsh;</p>
<p>springs will moisten the thirsty ground;</p>
<p>The jackals’ dens will become a swamp.</p>
<p>grass will give way to reeds and rushes.</p>
<p>8There’ll be a new highway there</p>
<p>called The Highway of Holiness.</p>
<p>9Lions won’t lurk along it;</p>
<p>vicious animals won’t hunt by it.</p>
<p>Such as those won’t live there,</p>
<p>but the redeemed will walk on it.</p>
<p>10The ones Yahveh ransoms will return to Zion</p>
<p>with happy shouts and crowned with everlasting joy.</p>
<p>They’ll find happiness and joy;</p>
<p>sorrow and sighing will fade away.	Is 35:6-10</p>
<p>Sennacherib Invades Judah</p>
<p>36:1In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked the fortified towns in Judah and took them. 2He sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large army. They took position by the aqueduct to the upper pool on the road to the Fuller’s Field. 3Eliakim Ben-Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the court secretary; and Joah Ben-Asaph, the royal historian, went out to meet them.</p>
<p>4The Rabshakeh said,</p>
<p>“Tell Hezekiah the great king of Assyria says, ‘What’s this confidence you claim to have? 5Empty talk can’t substitute for military strategy and power. Who are you depending on when you rebel against me? 6Are you depending on Egypt as a staff? If you lean on that splintering reed, it’ll puncture your hand. That’s the way Pharaoh operates with everybody that depends on him. 7If you tell me you’re trusting in Yahveh your God, isn’t he the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has closed down, and made Judah and Jerusalem worship at this altar in Jerusalem? 8Come on, make a deal with my master: I’ll give you 2,000 horses if you can put riders on them. 9Can you drive off even the least of my master’s contingents even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and cavalry? 10Anyway, haven’t I actually come up at Yahveh’s behest to destroy this place? He’s told me to attack this land and destroy it.’”           	  Is 36:1-10</p>
<p>11Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the Rabshakeh, “Speak in Aramaic; we understand it. Don’t speak in Hebrew. There are people listening on the wall.”</p>
<p>12But he shouted in Hebrew,</p>
<p>“Has my master just sent me to you and your master with this message? Hasn’t he also sent me to those people sitting on the wall that are doomed to eat their own feces and drink their own urine with you?           	Is 36:11-12</p>
<p>13“Listen to what the great king of Assyria says, 14‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; he can’t deliver you. 15Don’t let him make you trust in Yahveh, “Yahveh will deliver us. This city won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria.” 16Don’t listen to him.  Surrender and come out to me. Eat from your own grapevines and fig trees, and drink water from your own cisterns, 17till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards. 18Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you. Have any of the nations’ gods delivered their lands from the king of Assyria? 19Where are the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from me? 20Will Yahveh deliver Jerusalem from me?’”</p>
<p>21But they didn’t answer him; the king told them not to. 22They went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in despair and told him what the Rabshakeh said. 	Is 36:13-21</p>
<p>Hezekiah Seeks Isaiah’s Help</p>
<p>37:1When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and went to the Temple. 2He sent Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah. 3They went to him and said,</p>
<p>“Hezekiah says, ‘This is a distressing, discouraging, dejecting day. Babies have come due, but there’s no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe Yahveh your God has heard the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God. Maybe he’ll reprove him for it. Pray for the remnant that’s left.’” [5]</p>
<p>6Isaiah said,</p>
<p>“Tell your master Yahveh says, ‘You don’t need to be afraid of what the Assyrian king’s messengers have blasphemed. 7I’ll make him believe a rumor and go back home. He’ll fall by the sword there.’”	Is 37:1-7</p>
<p>8Meantime the Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he’d heard he’d left Lachish. 9The king had heard that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him. When the Rabshakeh heard it, he sent ambassadors back to Hezekiah:</p>
<p>10“Don’t let the god you trust in deceive you into thinking Jerusalem won’t fall. 11You’ve heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the Edenites in Telassar? 13Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Hena, Ivvah, or the city of Sepharvaim?”	Is 37:8-13</p>
<p>14Hezekiah read the letter, then went up to the Temple and unrolled it in Yahveh’s presence. 15He prayed,</p>
<p>16“Yahveh of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 17Incline your ear and hear, open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God. 18Assyria’s kings have devastated all the nations and their lands. 19They’ve thrown their gods into the fire because they were just hand-made pieces of wood and stone. 20But now, Yahveh our God, deliver us from the one that destroyed those kingdoms so the world can know that you alone are God.”</p>
<p>Is 37:14-20</p>
<p>Isaiah Predicts Israel’s Deliverance</p>
<p>21Then Isaiah sent word to Hezekiah,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘Because you prayed to me about Sennacherib, 22 I have this to say to him:</p>
<p>“The virgin daughter of Zion</p>
<p>despises you and laughs at you;</p>
<p>the young woman of Jerusalem</p>
<p>shakes her head as you flee,	Is 37:21-22</p>
<p>23“Who’ve you been mocking and blaspheming?</p>
<p>Who’d you raise your voice at</p>
<p>and roll your eyes about?</p>
<p>The Holy One of Israel!</p>
<p>24You mocked the Lord through your messengers:</p>
<p>‘I came up</p>
<p>to the highest mountains with many chariots,</p>
<p>to the most remote parts of Lebanon;</p>
<p>I cut down its tall cedars, its best cypress;</p>
<p>I reached its highest peak, its deepest forests.</p>
<p>25I’ve dug wells and refreshed myself with their water</p>
<p>and dammed up the rivers in Egypt with my feet.’	Is 37:23-25</p>
<p>26“Haven’t you heard?</p>
<p>I decided that very thing long ago;</p>
<p>I planned it ages back;</p>
<p>now I’m letting you do it</p>
<p>so you’ll turn fortified towns into piles of rubble.</p>
<p>27That’s why the people in them are</p>
<p>so weak, scared, and confused;</p>
<p>they’re as weak as plants in a field,</p>
<p>as grass sprouting on housetops</p>
<p>that’s scorched before it’s grown.</p>
<p>28I know when you sit down,</p>
<p>when you come and go,</p>
<p>when you rage at me.</p>
<p>29Because you raged at me</p>
<p>and I heard your arrogance myself,</p>
<p>I’ll put my hook in your nose,</p>
<p>my bridle in your lips,</p>
<p>and turn you back the way you came.”	Is 37:26-29</p>
<p>30“Hezekiah, I’ll show you what I mean: this year you’ll only eat what volunteers, next year what volunteers from that, but the third year you’ll sow and harvest, tend vineyards and eat their fruit. 31The surviving remnant of the siege in Judah will again take root down and bear fruit up. 32A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahveh of Hosts will make it happen.”</p>
<p>33Yahveh says, “The king of Assyria and his army won’t come into this city or shoot an arrow here. He won’t approach it with a shield or throw a mound up against its walls. 34He’ll go back home the way he came. 35I’ll save this city for my sake and my servant David.”</p>
<p>36The angel of Yahveh went out that night and struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early the next morning, the Assyrians were all dead. 37So Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 38As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrock, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him.			Is 37:30-38</p>
<p>Hezekiah’s Sickness and Recovery</p>
<p>38:1Around that time, Hezekiah got deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, “Yahveh says to set your house in order; you’re going to die.”</p>
<p>2Hezekiah turned to the wall and prayed, 3“Yahwh, please remember how I’ve followed you honestly with all my heart and done what you consider good.” He cried bitterly.</p>
<p>4Then a message from Yahveh came to Isaiah:</p>
<p>5“Go back and tell Hezekiah that Yahveh God of your ancestor David says, ‘I’ve heard your prayer and seen your tears. I’ll give you 15 more years to live 6and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. 7This is the sign that I’ll do what I’ve said: 8I’ll make the shadow on Ahaz’s stairway go back up 10 steps.’”</p>
<p>So it went back up 10 steps. 	              	Is 38:1-8</p>
<p>9A Writing by Hezekiah, King of Judah,</p>
<p>After His Illness and Recovery</p>
<p>10“In the prime of life,</p>
<p>I was headed for the gates of Sheol,</p>
<p>deprived of the rest of my life.</p>
<p>11I wouldn’t see Yahveh again while I was alive</p>
<p>or people in this world.</p>
<p>12Where I live was being blown away</p>
<p>like a shepherd’s tent.</p>
<p>I’ve been rolling up my life like a weaver;</p>
<p>he was cutting me off the loom,</p>
<p>ending my life in one day.</p>
<p>13I called out for help all night;</p>
<p>like a lion he was breaking all my bones,</p>
<p>ending my life.</p>
<p>14I chattered like a swallow and a crane</p>
<p>and moaned like a pigeon;</p>
<p>my weary eyes look up wistfully,</p>
<p>‘Help me, Yahveh, I’m oppressed.’”	Is 38:9-14</p>
<p>15“What could I say?</p>
<p>You let me know what you’d do and did it;</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep because of the bitterness.</p>
<p>16Yahveh, people gain life by hard experiences;</p>
<p>spiritual life comes from them all;</p>
<p>now restore my health so I can live!</p>
<p>17My deep anguish was for my own good;</p>
<p>you’ve kept me from the Pit of destruction.</p>
<p>18Sheol doesn’t thank you; death doesn’t praise you;</p>
<p>those who go down to the Pit</p>
<p>can’t experience hope from your faithfulness.</p>
<p>19Only the living can thank you, as I do today;</p>
<p>from parent to child, they tell about your faithfulness.</p>
<p>20Yahveh will surely save me;</p>
<p>so we’ll play my songs on stringed instruments</p>
<p>the rest of our lives in his Temple.”</p>
<p>21Isaiah had said, “Apply fig salve to the boil so he can recover.” 22Hezekiah had asked, “What’s the sign that I’ll go up to Yahveh’s Temple?”	  Is 38:15-22</p>
<p>Envoys from Babylon</p>
<p>39:1Soon after this, Merodach-baladan Ben-Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah because he’d heard he’d been sick and had recovered. 2That pleased Hezekiah, and he showed the ambassadors everything in his treasure house, the silver and gold, the spices and precious oil, his whole armory, and everything in his royal treasuries. There wasn’t anything in his palace or kingdom that he didn’t show them.        	  Is 39:1-2</p>
<p>3Then Isaiah came to ask him, “What did those men say? Where’d they come from?”</p>
<p>“From a distant country, Babylon.”</p>
<p>4“What have they seen in your palace?”</p>
<p>“Everything.”</p>
<p>5Then Isaiah said,</p>
<p>“Listen to a message from Yahveh of Hosts: 6‘The time’s coming when everything in your palace, everything your ancestors have stored up, will be carried off to Babylon. 7Some of your sons will be taken and made officials in the palace of its king.’”</p>
<p>8Hezekiah told Isaiah, “That’s a good message you’ve brought from Yahveh.” (He was thinking, “At least there’ll be peace and truth in my time.”)	 Is 39:3-8</p>
<p>Comfort for God’s People</p>
<p>40:1“Comfort, comfort my people,” your God says.</p>
<p>2“Speak graciously to Jerusalem;</p>
<p>tell it that its warfare’s over,</p>
<p>its iniquity’s removed,</p>
<p>it’s received from Yahveh</p>
<p>double for its sins.”	Is 40:1-2</p>
<p>3A voice is calling,</p>
<p>“Build a road for Yahveh in the desert;</p>
<p>make a smooth highway for our God.</p>
<p>4Fill every pothole,</p>
<p>level off every bump and high spot.</p>
<p>Smooth the rough ground</p>
<p>and make rugged terrain like a wide valley.</p>
<p>5Then the glory of Yahveh will come;</p>
<p>everyone will see it together.”</p>
<p>Yahveh has said so.           Is 40:3-5</p>
<p>6A voice said, “Shout.”</p>
<p>I answered, “Shout what?”</p>
<p>“People are like grass;</p>
<p>their beauty is like a flower in a field.</p>
<p>7Grass withers and flowers fade</p>
<p>when Yahveh blows on them;</p>
<p>people are like that.</p>
<p>8Grass withers and flowers fade,</p>
<p>but Yahveh’s word stands forever.”	Is 40:6-8</p>
<p>9Climb a high mountain,</p>
<p>Zion, messenger with good news;</p>
<p>shout it out;</p>
<p>shout it louder;</p>
<p>don’t hold back;</p>
<p>tell the towns in Judah, “Your God is coming!”</p>
<p>10He’ll come with power</p>
<p>to rule with his strong arm;</p>
<p>he’ll bring his reward with him.</p>
<p>11He’ll tend his flock like a shepherd;</p>
<p>he’ll pick up the lambs in his arms</p>
<p>and carry them against his chest,</p>
<p>and gently lead the nursing ewes.	Is 40:9-11</p>
<p>12Who else has measured the ocean in the palm of his hand</p>
<p>or the sky with a span,</p>
<p>or counted the dust?</p>
<p>Who else has weighed the mountains in a scales</p>
<p>or the hills in a balance?</p>
<p>13Who has directed Yahveh’s Spirit</p>
<p>or instructed him as his advisor?</p>
<p>14Who did he consult for enlightenment?</p>
<p>Who taught him what’s good?</p>
<p>15The nations are just a drop in the bucket,</p>
<p>a piece of sand on a scales;</p>
<p>he picks up islands like specks of dust.</p>
<p>16Lebanon couldn’t provide enough wood</p>
<p>or its animals be sufficient for a burnt offering.</p>
<p>17All the nations amount to nothing in front of him;</p>
<p>they’re of no consequence compared to him.	Is 40:12-17</p>
<p>18Who can we compare God to?</p>
<p>What’s he like?</p>
<p>19An idol is something an artisan makes,</p>
<p>a goldsmith plates with gold,</p>
<p>a silversmith makes silver chains for.</p>
<p>20People too poor for such an offering</p>
<p>select wood that won’t rot</p>
<p>and find a skilled craftsman</p>
<p>to prepare an idol that won’t fall over.	Is 40:18-20</p>
<p>21Haven’t you heard? Don’t you know?</p>
<p>Didn’t anybody tell you at the beginning of the earth that</p>
<p>22the One who sits above the circle of the earth,</p>
<p>whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers to him—</p>
<p>he’s the One that stretches out the sky like a curtain,</p>
<p>spreads it out like a tent to live under.</p>
<p>23He’s the One that dethrones rulers</p>
<p>and unseats judges.</p>
<p>24They’ve hardly been planted,</p>
<p>hardly sown, hardly taken root,</p>
<p>when he blows on them and they wither,</p>
<p>and the wind carries them off like chaff.</p>
<p>25Who can you compare him with;</p>
<p>who’s his equal?</p>
<p>26Look up and see who created those stars,</p>
<p>who leads the host of them out in full number</p>
<p>and calls each one by name;</p>
<p>because of his great power and strength,</p>
<p>not a one of them is missing.	Is 40:21-26</p>
<p>27Jacob, why do you think</p>
<p>Yahveh can’t see what you’re going through,</p>
<p>that he doesn’t notice the justice you deserve?</p>
<p>28Don’t you know? Haven’t you heard?</p>
<p>The eternal God, Yahveh,</p>
<p>the creator of the earth, doesn’t get tired;</p>
<p>no one can measure his intelligence.</p>
<p>29He gives stamina to the tired</p>
<p>and increases strength in the weak.	Is 40:27-29</p>
<p>30Even youths get weary;</p>
<p>young men collapse exhausted;</p>
<p>31but those who trust in Yahveh</p>
<p>keep finding new strength;</p>
<p>they walk and don’t get weary;</p>
<p>they run and don’t get tired;</p>
<p>they soar up on wings like eagles.	Is 40:30-31</p>
<p>God’s Help for Israel</p>
<p>41:1“Lands beyond the sea, come to order and listen;</p>
<p>prepare your case;</p>
<p>step forward and present it;</p>
<p>your case is next on the docket.</p>
<p>2Who has stirred up the king in the east</p>
<p>that he rightly called to his service,</p>
<p>who delivers up nations and subdues kings;</p>
<p>who makes them like dust with his sword,</p>
<p>like wind-driven chaff with his bow;</p>
<p>3who chases them away and passes along safely</p>
<p>on paths he hasn’t walked before?</p>
<p>4Who does such momentous deeds</p>
<p>generation after generation from the beginning till now?</p>
<p>I, Yahveh, am the One, 				Is 41:1-4</p>
<p>5“The islands have seen it and fear;</p>
<p>far-off places tremble;</p>
<p>they’re coming; they’re getting close.</p>
<p>6Each one encourages the other, ‘Be strong!’</p>
<p>7So the carver encourages the goldsmith;</p>
<p>the one that shapes with the hammer</p>
<p>encourages the one that beats the anvil,</p>
<p>and says of the soldering, ‘It’s good’;</p>
<p>he fastens it down with nails</p>
<p>so it won’t rock.	Is 41:5-7</p>
<p>8“But you, Israel my servant,</p>
<p>Jacob my chosen,</p>
<p>descendant of Abraham my friend,</p>
<p>9you that I took from a far-off place</p>
<p>and called from the most remote parts</p>
<p>and said, ‘You’re my servant;</p>
<p>I’ve chosen you—</p>
<p>10don’t be afraid, I’m with you;</p>
<p>don’t look around discouraged; I’m your God;</p>
<p>I’ll encourage you and help you;</p>
<p>you can count on me to hold you up</p>
<p>with my righteous right hand.’	Is 41:8-10</p>
<p>11All who are incensed at you will be disgraced;</p>
<p>anybody that opposes you will perish.</p>
<p>12You’ll look around for people in conflict with you</p>
<p>and won’t find any;</p>
<p>any who attack you won’t exist anymore,</p>
<p>13because I’m Yahveh your God</p>
<p>that holds you up,</p>
<p>that tells you,</p>
<p>‘Don’t be afraid, I’ll help you.’	Is 41:11-13</p>
<p>14So don’t be afraid, Jacob you worm, you people in Israel;</p>
<p>I’ll help you,” Yahveh says;</p>
<p>“Your rescuer is the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>15I’ll make you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with teeth;</p>
<p>you’ll thresh the mountains and pulverize them</p>
<p>and grind the hills into chaff.</p>
<p>16You’ll winnow them, the wind will blow them away,</p>
<p>the storm will scatter them;</p>
<p>but you’ll celebrate in Yahveh</p>
<p>and take pride in the Holy One of Israel.	Is 41:14-16</p>
<p>17“The poor and needy are looking for water,</p>
<p>but there isn’t any;</p>
<p>their tongues are parched with thirst;</p>
<p>I, Yahveh, will answer them myself;</p>
<p>as the God of Israel, I won’t abandon them.</p>
<p>18I’ll make creeks run in the barren hills</p>
<p>and open up springs in the valleys below;</p>
<p>I’ll make the desert a lake of water</p>
<p>and turn dry land into fountains.	Is 41:17-18</p>
<p>19In the desert I’ll put cedars and acacia trees,</p>
<p>myrtles and olive trees;</p>
<p>I’ll plant junipers there</p>
<p>along with box trees and cypress trees.</p>
<p>20I’ll do that so people can recognize</p>
<p>that I’ve done it;</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel has created it.	Is 41:19-20</p>
<p>21“Present your case for your idols,” Yahveh says;</p>
<p>“bring forward your strong proofs,”</p>
<p>the King of Jacob says.</p>
<p>22“Predict for us what’s going to happen;</p>
<p>tell us what happened before</p>
<p>so we can connect them with their outcome</p>
<p>and learn what those outcomes will be.</p>
<p>23State what the future holds</p>
<p>so we can tell you are gods;</p>
<p>do anything—good or bad—</p>
<p>so we can look around and be scared together.</p>
<p>24 You aren’t anything; you can’t do anything;</p>
<p>anybody that chooses you is pathetic.	Is 41:21-24</p>
<p>25“I’ve stirred up a leader from the north;</p>
<p>he answers me from the rising sun;</p>
<p>he’ll come on rulers like on mortar,</p>
<p>like a potter treading clay.”</p>
<p>26Who predicted this from the start,</p>
<p>so we could know about it?</p>
<p>Who said it in former times,</p>
<p>so we could say, ‘He was right’?</p>
<p>Nobody said anything;</p>
<p>nobody heard any god say a word.	Is 41:25-26</p>
<p>27“I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Help’s coming,’</p>
<p>and Jerusalem, ‘I’ve got good news.’</p>
<p>28But when I look,</p>
<p>there’s no advisor among them;</p>
<p>if I ask them, who can answer?</p>
<p>29They’re all fake;</p>
<p>they don’t do anything;</p>
<p>molten images are wind and hot air.	Is 41:27-29</p>
<p>The Servant of Yahveh</p>
<p>42:1“My Servant that I uphold,</p>
<p>my Chosen One I delight in,</p>
<p>I’ve put my Spirit on him;</p>
<p>he’ll bring righteousness to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2He won’t holler or be boisterous;</p>
<p>he won’t make a racket in the streets.</p>
<p>3He won’t break a bruised reed</p>
<p>or put out a flickering wick;</p>
<p>he’ll faithfully render justice.</p>
<p>4He won’t falter or lose heart;</p>
<p>he’ll establish justice on earth;</p>
<p>distant lands will rely on his instruction.” 	Is 42:1-4</p>
<p>5God Yahveh says—</p>
<p>who created the sky and stretched it out,</p>
<p>who made the earth and what comes from it,</p>
<p>who gives breath to the people on it</p>
<p>and spirit to those who walk in it—</p>
<p>6“I’m Yahveh; I’ve called you to demonstrate my goodness;</p>
<p>I’ll hold you by the hand and watch over you.</p>
<p>I’ll appoint you to be a covenant for the people,</p>
<p>a light for the Gentiles</p>
<p>7to open the eyes of the blind,</p>
<p>to free prisoners from dungeons</p>
<p>and those living in darkness from prison.</p>
<p>8I’m Yahveh; that’s my name.</p>
<p>I won’t share my honor with anyone else</p>
<p>or my praise with carved images.</p>
<p>9My former prophecies have already happened;</p>
<p>now I’m prophesying new ones;</p>
<p>I’ll tell you about them before they occur.” 	Is 42:5-9</p>
<p>A Song of Praise to Yahveh</p>
<p>10Sing a new song to Yahveh;</p>
<p>sing his praise from the ends of the earth,</p>
<p>you that sail the ocean,</p>
<p>you distant lands and people that live there!</p>
<p>11Let the desert towns join the chorus,</p>
<p>the villages where Kedar lives;</p>
<p>let the people of Sela sing for joy</p>
<p>and shout from the mountaintops.</p>
<p>12Let them honor Yahveh</p>
<p>and declare his praise in distant lands.</p>
<p>13HeY will rush out like a soldier</p>
<p>and stir up his fury like a warrior;</p>
<p>he’ll raise his battle cry</p>
<p>and prevail over his enemies.	Is 42:10-13</p>
<p>14“I’ve kept quiet,” God says, “and restrained myself for a long time;</p>
<p>now like a woman in labor, I’ll groan and gasp and pant.</p>
<p>15I’ll make mountains and hills desolate</p>
<p>and wither their vegetation;</p>
<p>I’ll turn rivers into wadis</p>
<p>and dry up the ponds.</p>
<p>16I’ll lead the blind on a new road,</p>
<p>guide them in unfamiliar paths;</p>
<p>I’ll make darkness into light ahead of them</p>
<p>and make rough places smooth;</p>
<p>I’ll do these things;</p>
<p>I won’t leave them undone.</p>
<p>17I’ll drive back and completely disgrace</p>
<p>those who trust in idols</p>
<p>and say to molten images, ‘You’re our gods.’	Is 42:14-17</p>
<p>Israel Deaf and Blind</p>
<p>18“Listen, you deaf;</p>
<p>look, you blind.</p>
<p>19Who is as blind as my servant,</p>
<p>as deaf as my messenger?</p>
<p>Who is as blind as my chosen people,</p>
<p>as blind as Yahveh’s servant?</p>
<p>20You look at many things, but don’t see;</p>
<p>your ears are open, but you don’t listen.”</p>
<p>21Because he’s good, Yahveh was pleased</p>
<p>to make his Law great and glorious.</p>
<p>22But his people have been robbed and plundered,</p>
<p>trapped in caves and hidden in prisons;</p>
<p>they’ve become prey with no savior,</p>
<p>spoil with nobody to demand, “Give them back!”</p>
<p>Is 42:18-22</p>
<p>23Who among you will learn from the past?</p>
<p>Who will listen about the future?</p>
<p>24Who gave Jacob up for spoil and Israel to plunderers?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it Yahveh that you’ve sinned against,</p>
<p>whose ways you wouldn’t follow,</p>
<p>whose Law you didn’t obey?</p>
<p>25So he poured out his hot anger on you in fierce warfare</p>
<p>and enveloped you in flames;</p>
<p>you didn’t catch on, and it burned you;</p>
<p>you didn’t take it to heart.	Is 42:23-25</p>
<p>Israel’s Only Savior</p>
<p>43:1But this is what Yahveh your creator says, Jacob,</p>
<p>the One that formed you, Israel,</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be afraid, because I’ve redeemed you</p>
<p>and called you by name. You’re mine!</p>
<p>2When you pass through the sea, I’m with you;</p>
<p>when you cross rivers, they won’t flood over you;</p>
<p>when you walk through fire, the flame won’t burn you;</p>
<p>3because I’m Yahveh your God,</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.</p>
<p>I’ve given Egypt to ransom you,</p>
<p>Nubia and Seba in exchange for you.	Is 43:1-3</p>
<p>4Since you’re precious to me,</p>
<p>since you’re honored and I love you,</p>
<p>I’ll trade other people in return for you,</p>
<p>others in exchange for your life.</p>
<p>5You don’t need to be afraid, because I’m with you;</p>
<p>I’ll bring your offspring from the east and west.</p>
<p>6I’ll say to the north, ‘Give them up!’</p>
<p>and to the south, ‘Quit holding onto them.’</p>
<p>Bring my sons and daughters from distant countries—</p>
<p>7everyone that wears my name,</p>
<p>that I’ve created for my honor.”		Is 43:4-7</p>
<p>8Bring out the blind, though they have eyes,</p>
<p>and the deaf, though they have ears.</p>
<p>9Gather the nations; assemble the peoples.</p>
<p>Which of their idols can tell about the past?</p>
<p>They need to present witnesses to justify themselves</p>
<p>that what they say is true.</p>
<p>10“You’re my witnesses, Israel,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“the servant I’ve chosen</p>
<p>so you can know me and believe me,</p>
<p>and understand that I’m the only One;</p>
<p>no god ever existed before me;</p>
<p>none will exist after me.</p>
<p>11I’m Yahveh;</p>
<p>there’s no Savior but me.</p>
<p>12I’m the One that predicted it, did it, and proclaimed it</p>
<p>before there was any foreign god among you;</p>
<p>so you’re my witnesses,” Yahveh says;</p>
<p>“I’m God.</p>
<p>13From eternity I’m God;</p>
<p>No one can take anyone away from me;</p>
<p>no one can undo what I do.”	Is 43:8-13</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Promised Victory</p>
<p>14This is what Yahveh your Rescuer says,</p>
<p>“To help you, I’ll dispatch an army against Babylon</p>
<p>to drive them out as refugees</p>
<p>in the ships they’re proud of;</p>
<p>the Babylonians’ celebration will turn into mourning.</p>
<p>15I’m your King, Israel’s Creator,</p>
<p>16who made a path through the Red Sea,</p>
<p>a road through the flood,</p>
<p>17who brought out in Egypt horse and chariot,</p>
<p>army and soldier.</p>
<p>They all lay down at the same time, drowned,</p>
<p>snuffed out like a flickering wick. 	Is 43:14-17</p>
<p>18But don’t just recall those former things</p>
<p>or ponder the past.</p>
<p>19Duly note something new I’m doing now;</p>
<p>it’s happening; see it?</p>
<p>I’m making, like before, a highway in the wilderness,</p>
<p>streams in the desert.</p>
<p>20Wild animals will honor me,</p>
<p>jackals and owls;</p>
<p>because I’ve put water in the wilderness</p>
<p>and streams in the desert</p>
<p>so my people can drink.</p>
<p>21The people I created for myself at that time</p>
<p>will one day declare my praise worldwide.	Is 43:18-21</p>
<p>22“Yet recently you haven’t called on me for help, Jacob;</p>
<p>you’re tired of me, Israel.</p>
<p>23You haven’t brought me the sheep for your burnt offerings</p>
<p>or honored me with your sacrifices,</p>
<p>though I haven’t burdened you down with offerings</p>
<p>or worn you out with incense.</p>
<p>24You haven’t bought any calamus for me</p>
<p>or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.</p>
<p>Instead, you’ve burdened me down with your sins;</p>
<p>I’m tired of your iniquities.	Is 43:22-24</p>
<p>25“I, yes, I am the One that will erase</p>
<p>your transgressions for my own sake</p>
<p>and not hold onto your sin against me.</p>
<p>26Remember me; let’s debate our case together;</p>
<p>state your evidence for being innocent.</p>
<p>27But from the time of your first ancestor</p>
<p>through your subsequent leaders,</p>
<p>you’ve sinned against me.</p>
<p>28So I profaned the priests of the sanctuary;</p>
<p>I delivered Jacob to total destruction</p>
<p>and Israel to lasting contempt.	Is 43:25-28</p>
<p>44:1“But listen now, Jacob my servant,</p>
<p>Israel my chosen one.</p>
<p>2This is what Yahveh says who created you</p>
<p>and formed you from the womb,</p>
<p>who will help you:</p>
<p>‘Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant,</p>
<p>Jeshurun my chosen one.</p>
<p>3As I’ll pour out water on thirsty ground</p>
<p>to make streams on desert land,</p>
<p>I’ll also pour out my Spirit on your offspring</p>
<p>and bless your descendants;</p>
<p>4they’ll thrive like well-watered grass,</p>
<p>like poplars beside streams.</p>
<p>5This one will say, “I belong to Yahveh”;</p>
<p>that one will wear Jacob’s name;</p>
<p>others will write on their hand, “Belonging to Yahveh,”</p>
<p>and name Israel’s God with honor.’”	Is 44:1-5</p>
<p>The Folly of Idols</p>
<p>6This is what the King of Israel saysY,</p>
<p>its Redeemer, Yahveh of Hosts,</p>
<p>“I’m the first and last;</p>
<p>there’s no God but me.</p>
<p>7Who is like me? Speak up;</p>
<p>recount things to me in sequence</p>
<p>from the time I created this ancient nation;</p>
<p>then tell that nation what’s going to happen to them.</p>
<p>8 Don’t tremble in fear;</p>
<p>haven’t I announced it to you long ago?</p>
<p>You’re my witnesses.</p>
<p>Is there any God but me?</p>
<p>Is there any other Rock?</p>
<p>I don’t know of a one.”	Is 44:6-8</p>
<p>9Those who carve idols don’t accomplish anything because their precious objects can’t do anything. Their worshippers don’t know that; so they’ll be put to shame. 10Who but fools make their own gods and then worship them? 11The craftsmen are mere mortals. They’ll all gather with the worshipers, take their stand, and go down in terror and infamy.</p>
<p>12A blacksmith shapes iron into a cutting tool over coals in his forge. He beats it with hammers till he gets hungry and weak, thirsty and tired. 13Then a carver shapes a block of wood, stretches out a measuring line on it, and draws a pattern on it with red chalk. He works it with chisels and planes to look like a beautiful human figure to set in a little shrine in somebody’s house. 14He cuts down a cedar, takes a cypress or oak, and plants a fir tree in the woods, and the rain makes it grow. 15-16It becomes something he can burn. So he burns half of it to warm himself up and say “Ah, I’m warm; the heat feels good.” Or he bakes bread and eats a roast and is satisfied. 17He carves the other half into an image, his god. He falls down to it, worships it, and prays to it, “Deliver me, my god.” 		   Is 44:9-17</p>
<p>18They don’t understand because God has glazed over their eyes so they can’t see, and closed their minds so they can’t think. 19The one that made it doesn’t stop to reflect,</p>
<p>“I burned half of it to bake bread and roast meat;</p>
<p>I worshiped the other half!”</p>
<p>20He eats ashes and trusts something that can’t help him. He doesn’t ask, “Am I holding something fake in my hand?”</p>
<p>Restoration for Jerusalem</p>
<p>21“Remember, Jacob and Israel; you’re my servant;</p>
<p>I made you; I won’t forget you.</p>
<p>22I’ve wiped out your transgressions like a dark cloud,</p>
<p>your sins like a heavy morning fog;</p>
<p>come back to me; I’ve redeemed you.”</p>
<p>23Shout for joy, sky, because Yahveh made you!</p>
<p>Make a joyful sound, depths of the earth.</p>
<p>Break into singing, mountains, forest, and every tree in them;</p>
<p>Yahveh has redeemed Jacob and taken pride in Israel.</p>
<p>Is 44:18-23</p>
<p>24This is what Yahveh your Redeemer says</p>
<p>who formed you in the womb,</p>
<p>“I’m the One that made everything:</p>
<p>I stretched out the sky by myself</p>
<p>and spread out the earth.</p>
<p>Who helped me?</p>
<p>25I expose false prophets’ omens</p>
<p>and make fools out of fortunetellers;</p>
<p>I force the wise to eat their words</p>
<p>and turn their “knowledge” into nonsense.	Is 44:24-25</p>
<p>26I carry out my prophets’ predictions</p>
<p>and perform my messengers’ advice;</p>
<p>I’m the One that says Jerusalem will be inhabited</p>
<p>and the towns in Judah will be rebuilt!</p>
<p>27I’m the One that tells the deep ocean to dry up</p>
<p>and its currents will be dry.</p>
<p>28I say about Cyrus, ‘He’s my shepherd!</p>
<p>He’ll do everything I tell him’;</p>
<p>he’ll decree that Jerusalem will be rebuilt</p>
<p>and the Temple foundations will be laid again.”</p>
<p>Is 44:26-28</p>
<p>Cyrus, Yahveh’s Chosen One</p>
<p>45:1This is what Yahveh says to Cyrus his anointed</p>
<p>whose right hand he’ll empower</p>
<p>to subdue nations and dethrone kings,</p>
<p>to open fortress gates so they won’t be shut:</p>
<p>2“I’ll go ahead of you to level out the mountains,</p>
<p>shatter bronze gates, and cut through their iron bars.</p>
<p>3I’ll give you treasures stored in the dark</p>
<p>and wealth hidden in secret places,</p>
<p>so you’ll know it’s me,</p>
<p>Yahveh God of Israel, who calls you by name.</p>
<p>4For the sake of Jacob my servant,</p>
<p>Israel my chosen one,</p>
<p>I’ve called you by name</p>
<p>and given you an honorable title</p>
<p>even though you didn’t know me.	Is 45:1-4</p>
<p>5I’m Yahveh; there’s no other;</p>
<p>there’s no God but me.</p>
<p>I’ll arm you for war though you don’t know who I am,</p>
<p>6so people from sunrise to sunset</p>
<p>can know there’s no God but me.</p>
<p>I’m Yahveh; there’s no other,</p>
<p>7Yahveh that creates light and makes darkness,</p>
<p>that sends peace and brings catastrophe—</p>
<p>I’m Yahveh that does all of that.	Is 45:5-7</p>
<p>8“Sky, shower from above;</p>
<p>clouds, rain down goodness;</p>
<p>ground, open up so salvation can sprout</p>
<p>and goodness can spring up from you.</p>
<p>I’m Yahveh your creator.	Is 45:8</p>
<p>9“Misfortune awaits the ones that fuss at their Maker</p>
<p>like a clay pot fussing at a potter!</p>
<p>Will a pot say to a potter, ‘What are you doing?’</p>
<p>or ‘What you’re making doesn’t have any handles’?</p>
<p>10Misfortune awaits the baby that says to its father,</p>
<p>‘Why did you beget me?’</p>
<p>or its mother, ‘Why did you have me?’”	Is 45:9-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel and your Maker, says</p>
<p>“Will you question me about my children</p>
<p>or tell me how to do my work?</p>
<p>12I’m the One that made the world and created people in it;</p>
<p>I stretched out the sky and hung the stars there.</p>
<p>13I’ll stir up Cyrus for my righteous purposes</p>
<p>and smooth his paths;</p>
<p>he’ll rebuild my city and free my exiles</p>
<p>without payment or reward.” 			Is 45:11-13</p>
<p>Yahveh, the Only Savior</p>
<p>14Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Egyptians, Nubians, and Sabeans—men of stature—</p>
<p>will come in chains and fall down in front of you;</p>
<p>their wealth and merchandise will be yours.</p>
<p>They’ll say to you,</p>
<p>‘God is with you for sure;</p>
<p>there’s nobody else, no other God.’”</p>
<p>15Truly you’re a God that works in mysterious ways,</p>
<p>God of Israel, Savior!</p>
<p>16They’ll be disgraced who manufacture idols;</p>
<p>they’ll go away together in humiliation.</p>
<p>17Yahveh will deliver Israel permanently;</p>
<p>Israel won’t ever be put to shame.	Is 45:14-17</p>
<p>18Yahveh says—who created the sky,</p>
<p>who made the earth and shaped it,</p>
<p>who didn’t make it waste and void,</p>
<p>but shaped it to be lived in—</p>
<p>“I’m Yahveh; there’s no other.</p>
<p>19I haven’t spoken secretly in some dark corner;</p>
<p>I didn’t tell Jacob’s descendants</p>
<p>to look for me in a desolate place;</p>
<p>I’m straightforward</p>
<p>and declare what makes sense.	Is 45:18-19</p>
<p>20“Get together and return;</p>
<p>come near together, refugees from the nations around.</p>
<p>They don’t know what they’re doing</p>
<p>who carry around wooden idols</p>
<p>and pray to gods that can’t save.</p>
<p>21Consult together and set forth your case.</p>
<p>Who predicted those things from of old?</p>
<p>What idol has proclaimed it for so long?</p>
<p>Am I not the One, Yahveh?</p>
<p>There’s no God but me,</p>
<p>an upright God and Savior;</p>
<p>there’s none but me.</p>
<p>22Turn to me and be saved, people everywhere,</p>
<p>because I’m God, there’s no other.	Is 45:20-22</p>
<p>23I’ve sworn by myself;</p>
<p>I won’t take back the reliable message,</p>
<p>the message that every knee will bow to me</p>
<p>and every tongue will swear allegiance.</p>
<p>24They’ll say about me,</p>
<p>‘Godliness and strength are only in Yahveh.’</p>
<p>People will come to me;</p>
<p>everyone that’s been mad at me will be put to shame.”</p>
<p>25Israel’s offspring will be justified</p>
<p>and honored in Yahveh.	Is 45:23-25</p>
<p>Babylon’s False Gods</p>
<p>46:1Bel bows down, Nebo stoops over;</p>
<p>their images, loaded on beasts of burden and livestock,</p>
<p>are too heavy for their tired animals to bear.</p>
<p>2The idols themselves are stooped over;</p>
<p>their owners are bowed down too;</p>
<p>the people couldn’t keep the burden</p>
<p>from going into captivity with them.	Is 46:1-2</p>
<p>3“Listen to me, House of Jacob,</p>
<p>remnant of Israel, you that I’ve carried from birth,</p>
<p>4till your graying years I’ll do the same;</p>
<p>I’ve made you, and I’ll take care of you,</p>
<p>carry you along, and save you. 	Is 46:3-4</p>
<p>5“What can you compare me with?</p>
<p>Who’s my equal?</p>
<p>6Those who lavish gold from the purse</p>
<p>and weigh silver on the scale,</p>
<p>hire a goldsmith to make a god out of it;</p>
<p>then they bow down to worship it.</p>
<p>7They lift it up on their shoulder and carry it around;</p>
<p>they set it in its place, and it doesn’t move.</p>
<p>If they call out to it, it can’t answer</p>
<p>or deliver them from their trouble.	Is 46:5-7</p>
<p>8“Remember this and be confident about it, sinners.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the things from long ago,</p>
<p>because I’m God; there’s no one like me.</p>
<p>10I predict the end from the beginning,</p>
<p>from ancient times what hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>I say, ‘My purpose will come about;</p>
<p>I’ll accomplish what I delight in.’</p>
<p>11I’ll call a bird of prey from the east,</p>
<p>a leader from a distant country to do my bidding.</p>
<p>I’ve said truthfully what I’d do,</p>
<p>and I’ll do it.	Is 46:8-11</p>
<p>12“Listen to me, stubborn people</p>
<p>who are so far from being good;</p>
<p>13I’m willing to bring my goodness now;</p>
<p>my salvation is not something distant</p>
<p>that will take a long time to get here;</p>
<p>I’ll show Zion my salvation</p>
<p>and Israel my glory now.				Is 46:12-13</p>
<p>Prediction of the Fall of Babylon</p>
<p>47:1“Come sit in the dirt,</p>
<p>virgin daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p>Sit on the ground without a throne;</p>
<p>you won’t be treated honorably anymore.</p>
<p>2Grind meal with heavy millstones;</p>
<p>take off your veil, strip off your skirt,</p>
<p>uncover your legs and cross the rivers.</p>
<p>3Your nakedness will show;</p>
<p>your shame will be exposed;</p>
<p>in my revenge I won’t spare you or anybody else.”	Is 47:1-3</p>
<p>4Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;</p>
<p>Yahveh of Hosts is his name.</p>
<p>5“Sit silently in the dark,</p>
<p>daughter of Babylon;</p>
<p>you won’t be called</p>
<p>the queen of kingdoms anymore.</p>
<p>6I was angry with my people</p>
<p>and punished them by letting them fall to you.</p>
<p>But you didn’t show them any mercy;</p>
<p>you put a heavy yoke even on the elderly.</p>
<p>7Yet you said, ‘I’ll be queen forever’;</p>
<p>you were thoughtless about these things</p>
<p>and didn’t consider the consequences.	Is 47:4-7</p>
<p>8“Listen to this, you that love pleasure,</p>
<p>that live securely and tell yourselves,</p>
<p>‘I exist and nobody can harm me;</p>
<p>I’ll never be a widow or lose my children.’</p>
<p>9But both will happen to you suddenly the same day—</p>
<p>losing your children and becoming a widow;</p>
<p>those disasters will come on you in full measure</p>
<p>despite your many sorceries and powerful spells.”</p>
<p>Is 47:8-9</p>
<p>10“You felt secure in your sinfulness and said,</p>
<p>‘Nobody can see me.’</p>
<p>Your ‘wisdom and knowledge’ have misled you;</p>
<p>you’ve told yourself,</p>
<p>‘I exist and nobody can harm me.’</p>
<p>11But misfortune will come on you</p>
<p>that you can’t charm away;</p>
<p>disaster will fall on you</p>
<p>that you can’t buy off;</p>
<p>destruction will meet you suddenly</p>
<p>that you’re not prepared for. 	Is 47:10-11</p>
<p>12“Stick with your spells and sorceries</p>
<p>that you’ve labored under since you were young;</p>
<p>maybe you can scare somebody.</p>
<p>13You’re tired of all the advice you’ve received;</p>
<p>let the astrologers—who prophesy by the stars,</p>
<p>and predict by the new moon—</p>
<p>stand up and save you from what’s coming.</p>
<p>14They’re like chaff in a fire;</p>
<p>they can’t deliver themselves from the flames;</p>
<p>there won’t be any good place for you to sit and keep warm.</p>
<p>15That’s the way it is for the ones you’ve worked with</p>
<p>and done business with from your youth;</p>
<p>each one will go off in their own direction;</p>
<p>nobody can save you.	Is 47:12-15</p>
<p>Stubborn Israel</p>
<p>48:1“Listen to this, Jacob called ‘Israel,’</p>
<p>that came from Judah’s family,</p>
<p>that swear by Yahveh and invoke Israel’s God,</p>
<p>but not sincerely and rightly,</p>
<p>2that call yourself The Holy City</p>
<p>and depend on Yahveh of Hosts:	Is 48:1-2</p>
<p>3long ago, I told you what was going to happen;</p>
<p>all at once it has; my prediction has come true.</p>
<p>4I know how stubborn you are,</p>
<p>that your neck is as stiff as iron,</p>
<p>and your head is as hard as bronze.</p>
<p>5I made my prediction long ago</p>
<p>so you couldn’t say your idol did it,</p>
<p>that your carved image, your molten god commanded it.’</p>
<p>Is 48:3-5</p>
<p>6“You’ve heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled,</p>
<p>but you still won’t own up to them;</p>
<p>now I’ll tell you things you haven’t heard.</p>
<p>7They’re not things from long ago;</p>
<p>so you can’t claim you knew them all along.</p>
<p>8I know what traitors you are;</p>
<p>you’ve been rebels from birth.</p>
<p>9Yet for my name’s sake, I’ve delayed expressing my anger;</p>
<p>for my honor I’ve restrained it</p>
<p>to keep from wiping you out.</p>
<p>10I’ve refined you, but not like silver;</p>
<p>I’ve refined you in the furnace of suffering.</p>
<p>11For my own sake—yes, I’ll do it for my own sake—</p>
<p>I won’t let my reputation be tarnished;</p>
<p>I won’t share my honor with idols.	Is 48:6-11</p>
<p>Israel Freed from Babylon</p>
<p>12“Listen to me, Jacob, Israel that I’ve chosen;</p>
<p>I’m the only One, the first and the last.</p>
<p>13I’m the One that founded the earth</p>
<p>and spread out the sky;</p>
<p>when I call out the stars, they come out in force.</p>
<p>14Come here, all of you, and listen!</p>
<p>Which of your idols has told you this?</p>
<p>I’ve set my regard on Cyrus;</p>
<p>he’ll carry out my intentions on Babylon;</p>
<p>he’ll oppose the Babylonians.</p>
<p>15There I’ve said it; I’ve called him;</p>
<p>I’ve brought him; he’ll succeed.</p>
<p>16Come close and listen:</p>
<p>from the beginning I’ve spoken plainly</p>
<p>about what would happen.”</p>
<p>Already the Lord Yahveh and his Spirit have sent me with that message.</p>
<p>Is 48:12-16</p>
<p>17This is what Yahveh says,</p>
<p>your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:</p>
<p>“I’m Yahveh your God</p>
<p>that teaches you how to be succeed</p>
<p>and leads you the way you should go.</p>
<p>18If only you’d paid attention to what I told you,</p>
<p>you’d have had peace like a river</p>
<p>and goodness like ocean waves washing over you.</p>
<p>19Your descendants would have been too numerous to count,</p>
<p>like grains of sand by the seashore;</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have needed to cut them off</p>
<p>or destroy them out of my presence.”	Is 48:17-19</p>
<p>20“Get out of Babylon! Escape from the Babylonians!</p>
<p>Shout the news everywhere with joy:</p>
<p>Yahveh has rescued his servant Jacob!</p>
<p>21They weren’t thirsty while he led them through the desert;</p>
<p>he made water gush out of rock for them to drink;</p>
<p>22“But there’s no peace for the wicked,” Yahveh says.	Is 48:20-22</p>
<p>The Servant of the LORD</p>
<p>49:1Listen, far off lands;</p>
<p>pay attention, distant nations.</p>
<p>Yahveh called me before I was born;</p>
<p>he named me inside my mother’s body.</p>
<p>2He made my mouth like a sharp sword</p>
<p>and hid me under his hand;</p>
<p>he made a polished arrow out of me</p>
<p>and put me in his quiver.</p>
<p>3He told me, “You’re my servant, Israel;</p>
<p>I’ll demonstrate my glory in you.”</p>
<p>4But I replied, “I haven’t really accomplished anything;</p>
<p>I’ve just worn myself out for nothing;</p>
<p>yet surely my just due is in Yahveh’s hands;</p>
<p>I’ll have to trust him for my reward.”	Is 49:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh says,</p>
<p>who formed me in the womb to be his servant</p>
<p>and bring Jacob back to him</p>
<p>(because Yahveh values me and strengthens me):</p>
<p>6“It’s not a minor thing to serve me</p>
<p>and restore the remnant in Israel;</p>
<p>I’ll also make you a light to the Gentiles,</p>
<p>to take the news about my salvation all over the world.”</p>
<p>7This is what Israel’s Redeemer says</p>
<p>to the despised nation,</p>
<p>the one that other nations abhor,</p>
<p>the servant of rulers:</p>
<p>“Kings will stand at attention when they see you;</p>
<p>officials will bow</p>
<p>because of Yahveh, who is faithful,</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel that has chosen you.” Is 49:5-7</p>
<p>The Restoration of Israel Promised</p>
<p>8Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll respond to you at an appropriate time</p>
<p>and help you when you need deliverance.</p>
<p>I’ll offer you as a covenant to the people</p>
<p>to restore Israel’s land,</p>
<p>to parcel out its deserted territories,</p>
<p>9to say to the ones in bonds, ‘Be free,’</p>
<p>and to those in darkness, ‘Come out into the light.’</p>
<p>My ‘sheep’ will graze along the roads</p>
<p>and pasture on the former barren hills.	Is 49:8-9</p>
<p>10They won’t be hungry or thirsty;</p>
<p>the scorching heat won’t oppress them,</p>
<p>because the One that shows them mercy</p>
<p>will lead them to springs of running water.</p>
<p>11I’ll make my mountains a level road</p>
<p>and raise my highways above the valleys.</p>
<p>12They’ll come from a long way off,</p>
<p>some from the north and west,</p>
<p>some from the region of Sinim.”</p>
<p>13Shout for joy, earth; celebrate, sky!</p>
<p>Break out into singing, mountains!</p>
<p>Yahveh will comfort his people</p>
<p>and shown mercy to his suffering ones.	Is 49:10-13</p>
<p>14Yet Zion says, “Yahveh has abandoned me;</p>
<p>he’s forgotten about me.”</p>
<p>15But Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Can a mother forget her nursing child</p>
<p>or withhold mercy from the son she bore?</p>
<p>Even if you forget, I won’t.</p>
<p>16I’ve written your name on my palms;</p>
<p>your fallen walls are always on my mind.</p>
<p>17Those who rebuild you will soon return to start their work;</p>
<p>the ones that want to destroy you will leave.</p>
<p>18Look up and around;</p>
<p>your people are gathering to you.</p>
<p>As I live,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“you’ll put them all on</p>
<p>like a bride attaches jewels to her wedding gown.</p>
<p>Is 49:14-18</p>
<p>19In place of your empty spaces,</p>
<p>you’ll be overrun with residents;</p>
<p>your enemies that swallowed you will be long gone.</p>
<p>20The children born in exile will tell you</p>
<p>it’s too crowded here.</p>
<p>21You’ll ask yourselves.</p>
<p>‘Who was their father?</p>
<p>I was bereaved and barren,</p>
<p>wandering in exile;</p>
<p>I was alone; who had all these children?</p>
<p>Who raised them?’”			Is 49:19-21</p>
<p>22The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll signal to the nations</p>
<p>to bring back your boys in their arms</p>
<p>and to carry your little girls on their shoulders.</p>
<p>23Kings will be your foster fathers;</p>
<p>queens will be your nurses.</p>
<p>They’ll bow to you,</p>
<p>and lick the dust off your feet.</p>
<p>You’ll know I’m Yahveh;</p>
<p>the ones that trust me won’t be disappointed.	Is 49:22-23</p>
<p>24Can anybody steal prey back from a warrior</p>
<p>or rescue captives from a tyrant?</p>
<p>25But Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll even retrieve the captives of the strong</p>
<p>and rescue the tyrant’s prey.</p>
<p>I’ll combat anybody that combats you,</p>
<p>and save your children.</p>
<p>26I’ll make your oppressors eat their own flesh</p>
<p>and get drunk on their own blood.</p>
<p>Everyone will know I’m Yahveh, your Savior,</p>
<p>your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”	Is 49:24-26</p>
<p>Israel’s Sin and the Servant’s Obedience</p>
<p>50:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Did I put your mother away with divorce papers?</p>
<p>Did I sell you as slaves to pay my debts?</p>
<p>No, I sold you because of your transgressions</p>
<p>and divorced your mother for her sins.</p>
<p>2When I came, why wasn’t anybody home?</p>
<p>When I knocked, why didn’t anyone answer the door?</p>
<p>Am I too poor to pay a ransom;</p>
<p>don’t I have the strength to rescue?</p>
<p>I can dry up the sea with a word,</p>
<p>make rivers empty and the fish in them die and stink.</p>
<p>3I dress the sky in darkness</p>
<p>and cover it with burlap.”	Is 50:1-3</p>
<p>4The Lord Yahveh has given me a disciple’s tongue,</p>
<p>so I can comfort the weary with a message.</p>
<p>He wakes me up morning after morning</p>
<p>to help me understand his will.</p>
<p>5He’s cleaned out my ears,</p>
<p>and I haven’t pulled away.</p>
<p>6I ‘ve turned my back to the ones who scourge me</p>
<p>and my cheeks to those who pull out my beard.</p>
<p>I haven’t covered my face from being spitting on.</p>
<p>7He helps me so I’m not disgraced.</p>
<p>I set my face like flint</p>
<p>and know I won’t feel ashamed.	Is 50:4-7</p>
<p>8The One that vindicates me is close at hand;</p>
<p>who wants to fight me?</p>
<p>Let’s stand up to each other.</p>
<p>Who wants to take me to court?</p>
<p>Go on, sue me!</p>
<p>9The Lord helps me;</p>
<p>who can condemn me?</p>
<p>Adversaries will wear out like old, moth-eaten clothes.</p>
<p>10Who among you respects Yahveh,</p>
<p>obeys his servant,</p>
<p>and still lives in the dark?</p>
<p>Trust Yahveh and rely on him.</p>
<p>11You that live by the light of the fires you set</p>
<p>will fall into them in torment.				Is 50:8-11</p>
<p>Everlasting Salvation for Israel</p>
<p>51:1“Listen to me, you that want to be good,</p>
<p>that look to Yahveh,</p>
<p>the Rock you were hewn from,</p>
<p>the quarry you came from.</p>
<p>2Look to Abraham your ancestor,</p>
<p>to Sarah who bore you in pain;</p>
<p>he was just one man when I called him;</p>
<p>then I blessed him and multiplied him.”</p>
<p>3Indeed, Yahveh will comfort Zion again</p>
<p>and have mercy on its desolate places;</p>
<p>he’ll make its wilderness like Eden,</p>
<p>its desert like Yahveh’s orchard.</p>
<p>Joy and happiness will be there,</p>
<p>thanksgiving and songs.	Is 51:1-3</p>
<p>4“Listen, my people;</p>
<p>pay attention, my nation,</p>
<p>because my law will go out from me;</p>
<p>my justice will shine like a light for the nations,</p>
<p>to distant lands that wait for me.</p>
<p>5My goodness will come soon</p>
<p>to set my deliverance in motion,</p>
<p>my arms will bring justice to the nations;</p>
<p>the distant lands will look to me.</p>
<p>6Look up at the sky;</p>
<p>then look at the earth below it,</p>
<p>because the sky will dissipate like smoke,</p>
<p>the earth will wear out like a garment</p>
<p>the people in it will die like gnats;</p>
<p>but my deliverance will be permanent,</p>
<p>my goodness won’t end.	Is 51:4-6</p>
<p>7Listen, you that know goodness</p>
<p>and have my Law in your heart;</p>
<p>don’t worry about criticism</p>
<p>or be intimidated by scorn;</p>
<p>8moths will eat away at your adversaries like a cloak;</p>
<p>worms will consume them like wool;</p>
<p>but my goodness will last forever,</p>
<p>my deliverance will continue to all generations.”</p>
<p>9Wake up, wake up, show your strength, arm of Yahveh;</p>
<p>wake up as in the old days, generations ago;</p>
<p>wasn’t it you that cut Rahab in pieces,</p>
<p>that pierced the dragon?	Is 51:7-9</p>
<p>10Wasn’t it you that dried up the sea,</p>
<p>the water in the great deep,</p>
<p>that made it a path</p>
<p>for the rescued to pass through?</p>
<p>11The ones Yahveh has ransomed will return</p>
<p>to Zion with happy shouts,</p>
<p>crowned with everlasting joy;</p>
<p>sorrow and sighing will disappear.	Is 51:10-11</p>
<p>12“I’m the One that gives you assurance.</p>
<p>Why be afraid of mortals</p>
<p>that wither like grass?</p>
<p>13Why forget Yahveh your Maker</p>
<p>that stretched out the sky</p>
<p>and laid the foundations for the world?</p>
<p>Why constantly fear your enemies’ fury</p>
<p>when they threaten to destroy you?</p>
<p>Where’s the fury of those oppressors now?</p>
<p>14Exiles will soon be free;</p>
<p>they won’t starve to death in dungeons,</p>
<p>15because I’m Yahveh your God</p>
<p>that stirs up the sea and makes its breakers roar.</p>
<p>(“Yahveh of Hosts” is my title.)</p>
<p>16I’ve put my message in your mouth</p>
<p>and covered you with my hand</p>
<p>to establish the sky,</p>
<p>to found the earth,</p>
<p>to tell Zion, ‘You’re my people.’”	Is 51:12-16</p>
<p>17Wake up! Jerusalem;</p>
<p>get up, you that drank from Yahveh’s hand</p>
<p>the cup of his anger,</p>
<p>that drank to the dregs the chalice</p>
<p>that made you stagger.</p>
<p>18Out of all the children you’ve borne and raised,</p>
<p>there’s no one to take you by the hand and guide you.</p>
<p>19Two things have happened to you:</p>
<p>devastation and destruction, sword and famine.</p>
<p>Who’s going to mourn for you?</p>
<p>How can I comfort you?</p>
<p>20Your children have fainted;</p>
<p>they lie helpless at the head of every street</p>
<p>like an antelope in a net,</p>
<p>full of Yahveh’s anger, your God’s rebuke.	Is 51:17-20</p>
<p>21So listen to this, oppressed people,</p>
<p>drunk but not with wine;</p>
<p>22this is what your Lord says, Yahveh your God</p>
<p>that contends for his people:</p>
<p>‘I’ve taken out of your hand</p>
<p>the cup filled with my anger,</p>
<p>the chalice that made you stagger;</p>
<p>you won’t have to drink it anymore.</p>
<p>23I’ll hand it to your tormentors to drink</p>
<p>who told you to lie down so they could walk on you.</p>
<p>You made your back like the ground,</p>
<p>like a street for them to tread.”	Is 51:21-23</p>
<p>Deliverance for Jerusalem</p>
<p>52:1Wake up, wake up;</p>
<p>dress yourself with strength, Zion;</p>
<p>put on your beautiful clothes, Jerusalem the holy city;</p>
<p>defiled, godless people won’t invade you anymore.</p>
<p>2Get up, shake off the dust, captive Jerusalem;</p>
<p>take the chains off your neck, resident in Zion,</p>
<p>3because Yahveh says:</p>
<p>“You were sold for nothing;</p>
<p>you’ll be redeemed without money.</p>
<p>4In the beginning my people went down to Egypt to live;</p>
<p>now the Assyrians oppress them for no reason.</p>
<p>5Why are my people enslaved for nothing</p>
<p>and their rulers wail and blaspheme me all the time?</p>
<p>6Now my people will know my name;</p>
<p>they’ll know I’m the one that’s talking to them.”         Is 52:1-6</p>
<p>7How welcome on the mountains</p>
<p>is the messenger that brings good news,</p>
<p>that announces peace and happiness,</p>
<p>that declares salvation and says to Zion,</p>
<p>“Your God reigns!”</p>
<p>8Listen! Your watchmen are happy and singing;</p>
<p>they can see that Yahveh is restoring Zion.</p>
<p>9Break out in joyful song together,</p>
<p>you laid-waste places in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>because Yahveh has comforted his people;</p>
<p>he’s redeemed Jerusalem.</p>
<p>10He’s bared his holy arm</p>
<p>so the nations can witness the deliverance he’s bringing.</p>
<p>11Leave, leave there; don’t hang onto anything defiled;</p>
<p>purify yourselves, you that bring back Yahveh’s sacred objects.</p>
<p>12You won’t go out quickly like fleeing refugees;</p>
<p>Yahveh will lead you out;</p>
<p>the God of Israel will be your rear guard.	Is 52:7-12</p>
<p>The Suffering Servant Poem (52:13-53:12)</p>
<p>13My servant will succeed;</p>
<p>he’ll be looked up to and highly honored.</p>
<p>14But, even as many were astonished at you, my people,</p>
<p>so his astonishing appearance was marred beyond human resemblance;</p>
<p>his form mutilated beyond recognition.</p>
<p>15He’ll cleanse many nations;</p>
<p>kings will shut their mouths in his presence.</p>
<p>They’ll see what they had no one to tell them</p>
<p>and understand what they hadn’t heard.	Is 52:13-15</p>
<p>53:1Who has believed our message?</p>
<p>Who has Yahveh shown his arm to?</p>
<p>He grew up before Yahveh like a tender sprout,</p>
<p>like a shoot out of parched ground.</p>
<p>2He wasn’t particularly handsome or noble</p>
<p>to draw our attention to him</p>
<p>or have the looks that would attract us to him.</p>
<p>3People despised and abandoned him,</p>
<p>a pained man, acquainted with grief;</p>
<p>like someone people look the other way from,</p>
<p>we looked down on him and didn’t respect him.	Is 53:1-3</p>
<p>4Actually though, he was shouldering our weaknesses</p>
<p>and carrying our pains,</p>
<p>but we considered him</p>
<p>someone God struck and made suffer.</p>
<p>5But he was pierced for our sins,</p>
<p>crushed for our iniquities.</p>
<p>The discipline that was for our welfare fell on him,</p>
<p>and by his scourging we are healed.</p>
<p>6We’ve all wandered off like sheep</p>
<p>and turned to our own way;</p>
<p>but Yahveh laid on him the sinfulness of us all.	Is 53:4-6</p>
<p>7He was oppressed and suffering,</p>
<p>but he didn’t say anything;</p>
<p>like a lamb they led to slaughter</p>
<p>or a sheep silent before its shearers,</p>
<p>he didn’t open his mouth.</p>
<p>8He was taken away by oppression and condemnation;</p>
<p>who realized at the time</p>
<p>that he was being cut off from the living</p>
<p>for the sins of my people, who deserved the stroke?</p>
<p>9They assigned his grave with criminals</p>
<p>though he hadn’t deceived or been violent;</p>
<p>yet he was associated with a rich man in his death.	Is 53:7-9</p>
<p>10But it was Yahveh’s plan to crush him,</p>
<p>to put him to grief;</p>
<p>when he offers himself as a guilt offering,</p>
<p>he’ll see his offspring and extend his life,</p>
<p>and Yahveh will accomplish his good pleasure in him.</p>
<p>11He’ll see what results from his anguish and feel fulfilled;</p>
<p>by his experience, my servant the upright one,</p>
<p>will justify many by shouldering their sins.</p>
<p>12So God will assign him a place among the great,</p>
<p>and he’ll divide the spoil with the strong</p>
<p>because he poured out his life</p>
<p>when they treated him like a transgressor.</p>
<p>But he was shouldering many other people’s sins</p>
<p>and interceding for them.	Is 53:10-12</p>
<p>The Future Glory for Zion</p>
<p>54:1“Shout for joy, childless woman;</p>
<p>break into joyful shouting and cry out,</p>
<p>you that have never had birth pangs;</p>
<p>because the woman that’s by herself</p>
<p>will have more children than a married woman,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.</p>
<p>2“Make a bigger space for your tent;</p>
<p>stretch out its curtains—don’t hold back;</p>
<p>lengthen your guy ropes and drive your pegs deeper.</p>
<p>3You’ll spread out left and right;</p>
<p>your descendants will live in the nations</p>
<p>and resettle the ruined towns.	Is 54:1-3</p>
<p>4“Don’t be afraid, you won’t be disgraced;</p>
<p>don’t feel humiliated, you won’t feel ashamed.</p>
<p>You’ll forget the shame of your youth;</p>
<p>you won’t remember the disgrace of your widowhood;</p>
<p>5because your husband is your Maker;</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh of Hosts;</p>
<p>your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,</p>
<p>the God of the whole world.	Is 54:4-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh has called to you</p>
<p>like a wife abandoned and grieving,</p>
<p>like a young woman divorced.</p>
<p>7For a short time I separated from you,</p>
<p>but I’ll bring you back with mercy.</p>
<p>8To show you my anger,</p>
<p>I withdrew from you awhile;</p>
<p>but with enduring love,</p>
<p>I’ll have mercy on you now,”</p>
<p>Yahveh your Redeemer says. Is 54:6-8</p>
<p>9“This is like Noah’s time to me,</p>
<p>when I swore that water like he saw</p>
<p>wouldn’t flood the world again;</p>
<p>In that same way I swear now</p>
<p>that I won’t be angry with you or rebuke you.</p>
<p>10Mountains may quake and hills may shake,</p>
<p>but I won’t remove my enduring love from you</p>
<p>or break my covenant for peace with you,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says who has mercy for you.</p>
<p>Is 54:9-10</p>
<p>11“Suffering city, storm-tossed and uncomforted,</p>
<p>I’ll rebuild you with stones set in antimony</p>
<p>and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>12I’ll make your battlements out of rubies,</p>
<p>your gates out of carbuncles,</p>
<p>your entire wall out of precious stones.</p>
<p>13All your descendants will be Yahveh’s disciples;</p>
<p>they’ll prosper greatly.</p>
<p>14You’ll be established in goodness</p>
<p>far from fear and oppression;</p>
<p>terror won’t get near you.</p>
<p>15If anybody assaults you, it won’t be because I sent them;</p>
<p>whoever attacks you will fall in defeat.</p>
<p>16I’ve created blacksmiths that blow the burning coals</p>
<p>and make weapons for their purpose;</p>
<p>I’ve also created destroyers that ruin them.</p>
<p>17No weapon designed to oppose you will achieve its aim;</p>
<p>you’ll refute whoever brings charges against you in court.</p>
<p>I’ll vindicate you,” 	Yahveh says.                      Is 54:11-17</p>
<p>Invitation to Yahveh’s Salvation</p>
<p>55:1“Everyone that’s thirsty, come to the water;</p>
<p>you that don’t have any money, come, buy, and eat;</p>
<p>get wine and milk for free.</p>
<p>2Why spend money on what’s not food,</p>
<p>wages on what doesn’t satisfy?</p>
<p>3Come and listen so you can live;</p>
<p>I’ll make an everlasting covenant with you</p>
<p>like the faithful mercies I showed David.</p>
<p>4I’ve appointed him as a witness to the nations,</p>
<p>a leader and commander for them.</p>
<p>5You too will call nations you don’t know;</p>
<p>nations that don’t know you will hurry to you</p>
<p>because of Yahveh your God,</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel,</p>
<p>because he has honored you.”	Is 55:1-5</p>
<p>6Look for Yahveh while you can find him;</p>
<p>call on him while he’s near.</p>
<p>7Sinners need to change the way they act;</p>
<p>the unjust have to abandon selfish intentions.</p>
<p>They must return to Yahveh</p>
<p>so he’ll have mercy on them,</p>
<p>come back to their God</p>
<p>because he’ll generously pardon.</p>
<p>8“I don’t think like you do;</p>
<p>I don’t do like you do,” Yahveh says.</p>
<p>9“As high as the sky is above the earth,</p>
<p>my ways are above your ways</p>
<p>and my thoughts above your thoughts.	Is 55:6-9</p>
<p>10As rain and snow fall from the sky</p>
<p>and don’t go back there without watering the ground,</p>
<p>making it sprout and produce,</p>
<p>and providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater—</p>
<p>11so my message won’t come back to me</p>
<p>without accomplishing what I sent it to do.</p>
<p>12You’ll go out with joy</p>
<p>and be led forth in peace;</p>
<p>the mountains and hills</p>
<p>will break out in singing;</p>
<p>the trees in the field will clap their hands.</p>
<p>13Cypress trees will come up in place of thorns;</p>
<p>myrtles will grow instead of nettles;</p>
<p>they’ll be a memorial to Yahveh,</p>
<p>an everlasting sign that won’t be destroyed.”	Is 55:10-13</p>
<p>Blessings for All Nations</p>
<p>56:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Maintain righteousness and be godly</p>
<p>because my salvation’s coming;</p>
<p>my deliverance will arrive.</p>
<p>2They are fortunate who do that,</p>
<p>who hold onto it,</p>
<p>who honor my Sabbath</p>
<p>and don’t do anything sinful.</p>
<p>3Foreigners that join themselves to Yahveh shouldn’t say,</p>
<p>‘He’ll surely make a difference between me and his people’;</p>
<p>eunuchs shouldn’t say, ‘I’m a dead tree.’”</p>
<p>4Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths holy,</p>
<p>choose to do what pleases me,</p>
<p>and keep my covenant—</p>
<p>5I’ll erect a memorial inside my Temple walls</p>
<p>and inscribe on it a name that’s better than heirs.	 Is 56:1-5</p>
<p>6“Foreigners that join me</p>
<p>to minister to me, love and serve me,</p>
<p>observe my Sabbaths, and keep my covenant—</p>
<p>7I’ll bring to my holy mountain</p>
<p>and make happy in my Temple for prayer;</p>
<p>I’ll accept their sacrifices and burnt offerings on my altar;</p>
<p>I’ll make my Temple a house for prayer for all nations.”</p>
<p>8The Lord Yahveh who brings back the dispersed from Israel, says,</p>
<p>“Still others I’ll bring to those I’ve already gathered.”</p>
<p>Is 56:6-8</p>
<p>Sinful Leaders Condemned</p>
<p>9All you wild animals in the field and forest,</p>
<p>come and devour my people.</p>
<p>10The watchmen are blind;</p>
<p>they don’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p>They’re dogs that can’t bark,</p>
<p>always lying around asleep, dreaming.</p>
<p>11They have huge appetites they can never satisfy;</p>
<p>they’re shepherds that don’t know how to shepherd.</p>
<p>They’ve all turned to their selfish interests,</p>
<p>looking for personal profit.</p>
<p>12“Come on,” they say, “let’s get some wine</p>
<p>and drink lots of alcohol;</p>
<p>tomorrow let’s do it again—and more so.”	Is 56:9-12</p>
<p>57:1Good people perish and nobody notices;</p>
<p>the devout disappear without anyone realizing it,</p>
<p>because God removes good people out of harm’s way.</p>
<p>2They who take the godly road</p>
<p>go to peace and rest in their graves.</p>
<p>Idolatrous Worship Condemned</p>
<p>3“But come here, you sons of sorcerers,</p>
<p>you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.</p>
<p>4Who are you making fun of?</p>
<p>Who are you mouthing off to?</p>
<p>Who are you sticking out your tongue at?</p>
<p>Aren’t you rebellious brats, lying cads</p>
<p>5that worship your idols with lust among the terebinths</p>
<p>under every green tree,</p>
<p>that slaughter your children in the wadis</p>
<p>on the jagged rocks beneath the cliffs?	Is 57:1-5</p>
<p>6Your destiny is among those smooth-stone fertility symbols</p>
<p>that you worship in those wadis; they’re your fate;</p>
<p>you pour out liquid offerings to them</p>
<p>and make grain offerings;</p>
<p>am I supposed to be appeased by stuff like that?</p>
<p>7You’ve committed adultery on every high mountain</p>
<p>and gone up there to offer sacrifice to your idols.</p>
<p>8You’ve put pagan symbols on the back of your doors</p>
<p>and on your doorposts;</p>
<p>you’ve deserted me and uncovered yourself</p>
<p>to your temple prostitutes;</p>
<p>you’ve loved their bed</p>
<p>and looked at their nakedness.			Is 57:6-8</p>
<p>9You’ve gone to Molech with olive oil</p>
<p>and lots of perfume;</p>
<p>you’ve sent your messengers far and wide,</p>
<p>even to Sheol.</p>
<p>10You’ve worn yourselves out by your long search,</p>
<p>but you didn’t give up;</p>
<p>you found renewed strength and didn’t faint.	Is 57:9-10</p>
<p>11“Who were you worried about and fearful of</p>
<p>when you lied and didn’t think about me?</p>
<p>12I’ll tell everybody about your so-called good deeds,</p>
<p>but they won’t do you any good.</p>
<p>13When you appealed for help,</p>
<p>did your collection of idols deliver you?</p>
<p>A gust of wind can pick them up;</p>
<p>a breath can blow them over.</p>
<p>But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land</p>
<p>and possess my holy mountain.”	Is 57:11-13</p>
<p>Comfort for the Contrite</p>
<p>14God says,</p>
<p>“Fix the road; rebuild it;</p>
<p>get rid of every obstacle to my people.”</p>
<p>15This is what the high and lofty One says</p>
<p>that lives forever, whose name is Holy:</p>
<p>“I live in a high and holy place</p>
<p>to revive the courage of the humble</p>
<p>and the heart of the repentant.</p>
<p>16I won’t oppose you forever or always be angry;</p>
<p>the spirit and breath of the ones I’ve created</p>
<p>would lose spirit and give up.</p>
<p>17I was angry and struck them</p>
<p>for their sinful, unjust gain;</p>
<p>I hid from them and was angry,</p>
<p>and they went on turning away in heart.	Is 57:14-17</p>
<p>18I’ve seen their ways, but I’ll heal them anyway;</p>
<p>I’ll lead them, comfort their mourners,</p>
<p>19and create praise from them.</p>
<p>Peace to the near and far;</p>
<p>I’ll heal them,”	Yahveh says.</p>
<p>20“But sinful people are like a tossing sea;</p>
<p>it can’t relax;</p>
<p>it stirs up debris and mud.</p>
<p>21There’s no peace for them,” my God says.                      	Is 57:18-21</p>
<p>False and True Worship</p>
<p>58:1“Shout; don’t hold back;</p>
<p>raise your voice like a ram’s horn;</p>
<p>tell my people their transgressions.</p>
<p>2They look to me daily and seem to delight to know my ways,</p>
<p>as if they’re a good nation that hasn’t left my ordinances;</p>
<p>they ask for favorable verdicts</p>
<p>and act like they delight in drawing near to me.</p>
<p>3Then they wonder, ‘Why have we fasted, and you haven’t noticed?</p>
<p>Why have we humbled ourselves, and you haven’t acknowledged it?’</p>
<p>It’s because you fast to get what you want</p>
<p>(meanwhile overworking your workers)!	Is 58:1-3</p>
<p>4You fast only to win disputes and fist fights—</p>
<p>not to be heard on high.</p>
<p>5Is that the kind of fast I had in mind for humbling yourselves?</p>
<p>Isn’t that just going through the motions of bowing your head like a reed</p>
<p>and spreading out burlap and ashes under you?</p>
<p>Do you call that penance, a fast that’s acceptable to Yahveh?</p>
<p>6Isn’t this the kind of fast I had in mind:</p>
<p>loosening the bonds of people you falsely imprisoned,</p>
<p>undoing the straps of their yoke,</p>
<p>freeing the oppressed,</p>
<p>and breaking every tie that binds people?	Is 58:4-6</p>
<p>7Isn’t it sharing your food with the hungry,</p>
<p>bringing the homeless into your house,</p>
<p>dressing the naked when you see them,</p>
<p>not hiding from relatives that need you?</p>
<p>8Then your light will break forth like the dawn;</p>
<p>your wounds will heal quickly.</p>
<p>Your good reputation will precede you;</p>
<p>the glory of Yahveh will have your back.</p>
<p>9You’ll call and he’ll answer;</p>
<p>you’ll appeal to him, and he’ll say, ‘I’m here.’</p>
<p>If you remove oppression from among you,</p>
<p>the finger pointing and vicious gossip,</p>
<p>if you feed the hungry</p>
<p>and satisfy the needs of the suffering—</p>
<p>10then you’ll be a light shining in the dark;</p>
<p>the gloom around you will turn to noonday light.	Is 58:7-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh will always guide you,</p>
<p>quench your thirst,</p>
<p>and restore your strength;</p>
<p>he’ll make you like an irrigated garden,</p>
<p>like a year-round spring.</p>
<p>12Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins</p>
<p>on foundations from long ago;</p>
<p>you’ll repair the breaches in the walls</p>
<p>and fix the streets you live on.	Is 58:11-12</p>
<p>13“If you turn around from the direction you’re headed,</p>
<p>stop doing just whatever you please on my holy day,</p>
<p>consider the Sabbath a delight,</p>
<p>honor Yahveh’s day by what you do that day,</p>
<p>step aside from your own pursuits</p>
<p>and seeking your own pleasure and talking idly—</p>
<p>14then you’ll be delighting in Yahveh.</p>
<p>He’ll give you honor on the earth</p>
<p>and satisfy you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob.”</p>
<p>Yahveh has spoken.        	 Is 58:13-14</p>
<p>Warnings Against Sin</p>
<p>59:1It’s not that Yahveh’s hand is not too weak to save</p>
<p>or his ear too deaf to hear you call.</p>
<p>2It’s your iniquities that have separated you from him;</p>
<p>your sins have shut him off from you,</p>
<p>so he ignores you.</p>
<p>3You’ve defiled your hands with blood,</p>
<p>your fingers with sin,</p>
<p>your lips with lying,</p>
<p>your tongues with gossip.</p>
<p>4None of you brings just suits or argues cases honestly;</p>
<p>you hide behind double talk and perjury;</p>
<p>you conceive schemes and give birth to sin.	Is 59:1-4</p>
<p>5You hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs;</p>
<p>whoever eats the eggs dies;</p>
<p>snakes hatch from the cracked eggs.</p>
<p>6Your webs can’t become clothes;</p>
<p>you can’t dress yourselves with what you’ve made.</p>
<p>Your deeds are sinful;</p>
<p>you use your hands for violence.</p>
<p>7You hurry to do harm,</p>
<p>run to shed blood,</p>
<p>and think sinful things;</p>
<p>destruction lies scattered along your highways.</p>
<p>8You don’t know any road that leads to peace;</p>
<p>you give the wrong directions;</p>
<p>whoever follows them gets lost.	Is 59:5-8</p>
<p>9So justice is a long way off from you;</p>
<p>right living doesn’t help you.</p>
<p>You hope for light, but it’s dark here;</p>
<p>you look for sunny days but live in gloom.</p>
<p>10You grope along the wall like the blind</p>
<p>and fumble around like people without eyes;</p>
<p>you stumble around as much at noon as you do at dusk,</p>
<p>like the dead among the living.</p>
<p>11You growl like bears and moan like pigeons;</p>
<p>you look for justice, but it doesn’t come;</p>
<p>you want salvation, but it’s a distant prospect.	Is 59:9-11</p>
<p>12You’ve multiplied your sins right in God’s face;</p>
<p>they testify against you.</p>
<p>You know you’re sinful;</p>
<p>13you transgress and deny Yahveh</p>
<p>and turn your backs on him.</p>
<p>You advocate oppression and rebellion,</p>
<p>conceive and tell lies from the heart.</p>
<p>14The courts oppose justice;</p>
<p>it’s nowhere near;</p>
<p>truth stumbles in the streets;</p>
<p>honesty is illegal.</p>
<p>15aThere is no truth;</p>
<p>those who turn from sin become victims. 		Is 59:12-15a</p>
<p>15b-16Yahveh was amazed;</p>
<p>it displeased him that there was no justice.</p>
<p>Nobody was intervening to help the oppressed;</p>
<p>so he brought about salvation himself</p>
<p>and sustained it with his goodness.</p>
<p>17He put on goodness like a breastplate,</p>
<p>and a helmet of salvation on his head;</p>
<p>he dressed himself in vengeance</p>
<p>and wrapped himself with zeal like a mantle.</p>
<p>18He’ll repay his adversaries according to their deeds,</p>
<p>recompense his enemies with his anger,</p>
<p>and carry out retribution to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>19So they’ll fear Yahveh in the west</p>
<p>and honor him from the rising of the sun,</p>
<p>because he’ll come like a rushing tide</p>
<p>that he drives with the wind.</p>
<p>20“A redeemer will come to Zion,</p>
<p>to those who turn from sin in Jacob,” Yahveh says.    Is 59:15b-20</p>
<p>21“This is my covenant with you:</p>
<p>my Spirit that’s on you,</p>
<p>my message that’s in you</p>
<p>won’t leave you, your children,</p>
<p>or grandchildren from now on.” 			Is 59:21</p>
<p>Israel’s Future Glory</p>
<p>60:1“Arise, shine; your light has come;</p>
<p>the glory of Yahveh has risen on you.</p>
<p>2Darkness will cover the earth;</p>
<p>thick blackness will blanket the nations;</p>
<p>but Yahveh will shine on you;</p>
<p>his glory will appear on you.</p>
<p>3Nations will come to your light,</p>
<p>kings to the brightness of your rising.	Is 60:1-3</p>
<p>4“Look all around you;</p>
<p>they’re all gathering home to you.</p>
<p>Your little boys will come from a long way off;</p>
<p>your girls will be carried in arms.</p>
<p>5Then your eyes will be radiant;</p>
<p>you’ll be thrilled and happy,</p>
<p>because commerce from the sea will return to you,</p>
<p>and the nations’ wealth will be available to you.</p>
<p>6Caravans of camels will cover you,</p>
<p>young camels from Midian and Ephah.</p>
<p>The ones from Sheba will bring gold and frankincense,</p>
<p>and good news about the praises of Yahveh.</p>
<p>7The flocks of Kedar will gather to you;</p>
<p>the rams of Nebaioth will serve you.</p>
<p>I’ll accept them on my altar</p>
<p>and honor my Temple.</p>
<p>8Who are these that fly like a cloud,</p>
<p>like pigeons to their windows?	Is 60:4-8</p>
<p>9The distant lands will learn to trust in me;</p>
<p>the ships from Tarshish will come first,</p>
<p>bringing your descendants home from afar</p>
<p>and their silver and gold with them</p>
<p>for Yahveh your God,</p>
<p>for the Holy One of Israel,</p>
<p>because he’s honored you.	Is 60:9</p>
<p>10“Foreigners will rebuild your walls;</p>
<p>their kings will be your servants.</p>
<p>Though I struck you in my anger,</p>
<p>now I’ll have mercy on you in my favor.</p>
<p>11Your gates will stay open day and night</p>
<p>so nations can bring their wealth to you,</p>
<p>and their kings can be led as captives</p>
<p>in the victory procession.</p>
<p>12Nations that won’t serve you will perish.</p>
<p>13The splendor of Lebanon will come on you,</p>
<p>the juniper, box tree, and cypress tree together,</p>
<p>to beautify the place for my feet in my sanctuary.</p>
<p>14The descendants of your oppressors will come bowing to you;</p>
<p>your despisers will prostrate themselves at your feet.</p>
<p>They’ll call you The City of Yahveh,</p>
<p>Zion of the Holy One of Israel.	Is 60:10-14</p>
<p>15“Whereas you’ve been hated, shunned, and abandoned,</p>
<p>I’ll make you something to be proud of forever,</p>
<p>a joy for endless generations.</p>
<p>16You’ll nurse on the milk of nations, breasts of kings;</p>
<p>you’ll know that I’m Yahveh, your Savior,</p>
<p>your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p>
<p>17I’ll bring gold for bronze,</p>
<p>bronze for wood,</p>
<p>silver for iron,</p>
<p>iron for stone.</p>
<p>I’ll make peace your administrators</p>
<p>and goodness your overseers.	Is 60:15-17</p>
<p>18Violence will disappear from your land,</p>
<p>war from inside your borders;</p>
<p>you’ll call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.</p>
<p>19You won’t need the sun for daylight</p>
<p>or the moon to be bright.</p>
<p>You’ll have Yahveh for an everlasting light;</p>
<p>he’ll be your glory.</p>
<p>20Your sun won’t set anymore;</p>
<p>your moon won’t have phases.</p>
<p>You’ll have Yahveh for an everlasting light;</p>
<p>your mourning will be over.</p>
<p>21Your people will be good;</p>
<p>they’ll own their land forever,</p>
<p>the branch I planted with my own hands will honor me.</p>
<p>22The smallest will become a clan;</p>
<p>the least will be a nation.</p>
<p>I, Yahveh, will hurry it along when the time comes.”	Is 60:18-22</p>
<p>The Year of Yahveh’s Favor</p>
<p>61:1The Spirit of the Lord Yahveh is on me;</p>
<p>he’s anointed me to bring good news to the downtrodden.</p>
<p>He’s sent me to bandage up the brokenhearted,</p>
<p>to liberate captives,</p>
<p>to free prisoners,</p>
<p>2to announce that this is</p>
<p>the year Yahveh shows blessing,</p>
<p>the day he sets things right,</p>
<p>to comfort anyone that’s grieving,</p>
<p>3to give to the sad in Zion</p>
<p>a crown in place of ashes,</p>
<p>the oil of happiness instead of mourning,</p>
<p>the mantle of praise rather than a fainting spirit</p>
<p>so they’ll be like Terebinths of Goodness</p>
<p>Yahveh has planted to demonstrate his glory.	Is 61:1-3</p>
<p>4Then they’ll rebuild the ancient ruins,</p>
<p>set back up what was torn down,</p>
<p>repair destroyed towns deserted for generations.</p>
<p>5Foreigners will pasture your flocks,</p>
<p>do your farming, and tend your vineyards.</p>
<p>6But you’ll be Yahveh’s priests;</p>
<p>people will speak of you as his ministers.</p>
<p>You’ll feed on the wealth of nations</p>
<p>and take pride in their prosperity.</p>
<p>7Instead of humiliation you’ll have a double portion;</p>
<p>rather than dishonor you’ll celebrate over your lot.</p>
<p>You’ll have everlasting joy in your land.</p>
<p>8“I, Yahveh, love justice</p>
<p>and despise short-changing in burnt offering;</p>
<p>I’ll make an everlasting contract with you</p>
<p>and faithfully pay you for your work.</p>
<p>9Then the nations will honor your offspring worldwide;</p>
<p>everyone will recognize you as the offspring Yahveh blessed.”</p>
<p>Is 61:4-9</p>
<p>10I’m really happy in Yahveh;</p>
<p>I celebrate over my God</p>
<p>because he’s dressed me in salvation</p>
<p>and wrapped me in goodness like a robe,</p>
<p>like a groom dresses himself in a garland,</p>
<p>and a bride adorns herself with jewels.</p>
<p>11As the ground produces seeds</p>
<p>and a garden makes sprouts grow,</p>
<p>so the Lord Yahveh makes goodness and praise</p>
<p>spring up for all the world to see.	Is 61:10-11</p>
<p>Isaiah’s Prayer for Jerusalem</p>
<p>62:1For Zion’s sake I’ll speak to God;</p>
<p>for Jerusalem’s sake I won’t keep still,</p>
<p>until your goodness glows brightly,</p>
<p>and your salvation radiates like a burning torch;</p>
<p>2so the nations can witness your goodness</p>
<p>and kings can gaze at your glory.</p>
<p>Yahveh himself will give you a new name.</p>
<p>3You’ll be a beautiful crown in his hand,</p>
<p>a royal diadem he holds up high.</p>
<p>4You won’t be called Abandoned [Azubah] anymore</p>
<p>or your land be named Desolate [Shemamah];</p>
<p>you’ll be My Delight Is in It [Hephzibah],</p>
<p>and your land will be Married [Beulah],</p>
<p>because he delights in you,</p>
<p>and your land will be married to him.</p>
<p>5Like a young man marries a virgin,</p>
<p>your sons will marry you, Jerusalem;</p>
<p>like a groom is happy over a bride,</p>
<p>your God will be happy over you.	Is 62:1-5</p>
<p>6I’ve stationed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem,</p>
<p>not to be silent day or night,</p>
<p>but to remember you to Yahveh</p>
<p>7till he makes you something worth praising in the world.</p>
<p>8He has sworn by his right hand and strong arm,</p>
<p>“I’ll never again let your enemies eat your grain</p>
<p>or foreigners drink the new wine you labored for.</p>
<p>9But the ones that put the grain in the granary</p>
<p>will eat it and praise me;</p>
<p>the ones that pick the grapes</p>
<p>will drink the wine in the courts of my sanctuary.”	Is 62:6-9</p>
<p>10Go out through the gates;</p>
<p>clear the way for my people.</p>
<p>Build a highway so they can return;</p>
<p>get the loose rocks off the road.</p>
<p>Hoist a flag the nations can see.</p>
<p>11Yahveh has declared all over the world,</p>
<p>“Tell Zion its salvation’s coming;</p>
<p>he’s bringing his reward with him.”</p>
<p>12They’ll call you The Holy People [Ha‘am Haggadosh],</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Redeemed [Ge’ule-adonai],</p>
<p>The Sought For, A City No Longer Forsaken.  	 Is 62:10-12</p>
<p>Vengeance Against Israel’s Enemies</p>
<p>63:1Who is this that’s coming from Edom</p>
<p>in crimson clothes from Bozrah,</p>
<p>one majestic in attire</p>
<p>and marching with such power?</p>
<p>“The One that’s announcing vindication,</p>
<p>that has the strength to save.”</p>
<p>2Why are your clothes stained red</p>
<p>like those who tread out grapes?</p>
<p>3“Ineed, I’ve been treading in a winepress—alone;</p>
<p>nobody from the nations could help me;</p>
<p>so I tramped down my foes in my fury;</p>
<p>their life blood spattered my garments</p>
<p>and stained my clothes.</p>
<p>4I’ve had a day for payback on my mind;</p>
<p>a year for redemption to come.</p>
<p>5But I looked, amazed</p>
<p>that there was no one to intervene for the oppressed;</p>
<p>so my own arm did the saving;</p>
<p>anger sustained me.</p>
<p>6I tramped down nations in my fury</p>
<p>and made them drunk in my wrath;</p>
<p>I poured out their blood on the ground.”	Is 63:1-6</p>
<p>Praise for Deliverance</p>
<p>7I’ll recount the praises and tell about Yahveh’s enduring love</p>
<p>in proportion to everything he has granted us;</p>
<p>I’ll declare the great goodness he has shown</p>
<p>in proportion to his mercy and kindness toward Israel.</p>
<p>8He said, “They’re my people,</p>
<p>offspring that surely won’t betray me again;</p>
<p>so he saved them.</p>
<p>9In all their adversity he felt their suffering;</p>
<p>so he sent the angel from his presence to save them.</p>
<p>In his love and mercy, he redeemed them;</p>
<p>he picked them up and carried them</p>
<p>like he’d done in the past.</p>
<p>10But they did rebel and grieve his Holy Spirit;</p>
<p>so he became their enemy and opposed them.	Is 63:7-10</p>
<p>11Then his people remembered the past at Moses’ time.</p>
<p>“Where’s the One that brought them up from the sea</p>
<p>with the shepherds of his flock?</p>
<p>Where is the One that put his Holy Spirit among them,</p>
<p>12that showed his power when Moses raised his right hand,</p>
<p>that divided the water for them to make an eternal name for himself,</p>
<p>13that led them through the deep sea?</p>
<p>Like a horse in open country, they didn’t stumble;</p>
<p>14like livestock that goes down to a sheltered valley,</p>
<p>the Spirit of Yahveh gave them rest;</p>
<p>that’s the way he led his people</p>
<p>to make a glorious name for himself.”	Is 63:11-14</p>
<p>Prayer for Pardon</p>
<p>15Look down from heaven,</p>
<p>from your holy house;</p>
<p>where are your zeal and powerful deeds?</p>
<p>I don’t sense the mercy</p>
<p>you used to have toward us.</p>
<p>16Even if Abraham would disown us</p>
<p>and Israel wouldn’t recognize us,</p>
<p>you’d still be our Father and Redeemer.</p>
<p>17Yahveh, why let us stray from your ways</p>
<p>and harden our hearts against you?</p>
<p>For our sake, bring us back as your special possession.</p>
<p>18Your holy people had your sanctuary for a while,</p>
<p>but our adversaries have tramped it down.</p>
<p>19We’ve become like a nation you never ruled,</p>
<p>like people that never wore your name.	Is 63:15-19</p>
<p>64:1Oh that you’d open the sky and come down</p>
<p>and the mountains would quake in your presence—</p>
<p>2like a flame that burns brush and boils water—</p>
<p>to show yourself to your adversaries</p>
<p>so they’d tremble in your presence!</p>
<p>3When you did awesome things we didn’t expect,</p>
<p>you came down and the mountains quaked in your presence.</p>
<p>4No one has ever heard of a God like you</p>
<p>that acts on behalf of people that wait for him.</p>
<p>5You visit those who enjoy doing good,</p>
<p>who remember you and your ways.</p>
<p>You were angry because we kept sinning for a long time;</p>
<p>can we ever be saved?</p>
<p>6We’ve all become unclean;</p>
<p>our best efforts are like menstrual rags.</p>
<p>We wither like leaves;</p>
<p>our sins blow us away like the wind.</p>
<p>7No one calls on you or reaches out to you</p>
<p>because you’ve hid from us</p>
<p>and delivered us to the consequences of our sins. Is 64:1-7</p>
<p>8But now, Yahveh, you’re our Father;</p>
<p>we’re the clay, you’re the potter;</p>
<p>you’ve made us.</p>
<p>9Don’t be angry beyond measure;</p>
<p>don’t hold our sin against us forever;</p>
<p>look now, we’re all your people.</p>
<p>10Your holy cities have become a desert;</p>
<p>Zion is a wasteland;</p>
<p>Jerusalem is desolate.</p>
<p>11Our holy, beautiful Temple,</p>
<p>where our ancestors praised you,</p>
<p>has been burned;</p>
<p>all our precious things lie in ruins.</p>
<p>12Will you limit yourself to this much retribution,</p>
<p>or will you keep disciplining us no end?	Is 64:8-12</p>
<p>Judgment and Final Salvation</p>
<p>65:1“I let people look for me who weren’t asking about me;</p>
<p>people that weren’t looking for me found me.</p>
<p>I said, ‘I’m here! Over here!’</p>
<p>to people that didn’t call on me.</p>
<p>2All day long I spread out my hands to a rebellious nation</p>
<p>that follows its own ideas,</p>
<p>3that continually angers me to my face</p>
<p>by offering sacrifices to idols in sacred gardens</p>
<p>and burning incense on pagan altars,</p>
<p>4that sit in tombs and spend the night in secret places,</p>
<p>that eat pig meat</p>
<p>and have broth from unclean meat in their pots,</p>
<p>5that say, ‘Stay away from me;</p>
<p>don’t touch me;</p>
<p>I’m holier than you are!’</p>
<p>They’re smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all day.	Is 65:1-5</p>
<p>6I’ve written it out in front of me:</p>
<p>I won’t stand idly by; I’ll repay.</p>
<p>I’ll pay back into their laps</p>
<p>7the sins they and their ancestors committed;</p>
<p>since they’ve burned incense on the mountains</p>
<p>and scorned me on the hills,</p>
<p>I’ll measure out their former deeds into their arms,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.</p>
<p>8“As new wine comes from clusters</p>
<p>and somebody says,</p>
<p>‘Don’t ruin it; it’s useful’;</p>
<p>that’s what I’ll do with my servants</p>
<p>and not destroy them all.</p>
<p>9I’ll preserve a remnant from Jacob and Judah</p>
<p>to inherit my mountains;</p>
<p>my chosen ones will inherit it;</p>
<p>my servants will live there. 	Is 65:6-9</p>
<p>10Sharon will be a pasture for flocks;</p>
<p>the Valley of Achor will be a resting place for herds—</p>
<p>for my people that look to me.</p>
<p>11-12But I’ll destine for the sword</p>
<p>you that leave me,</p>
<p>that forget my holy mountain,</p>
<p>that set a table for Fortune</p>
<p>and fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny.</p>
<p>You’ll bow down to slaughter,</p>
<p>because I called, but you didn’t answer;</p>
<p>I spoke, but you ignored me;</p>
<p>you did what I consider sinful;</p>
<p>you chose what I don’t delight in.”	Is 65:10-12</p>
<p>13So the Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“My servants will eat, but you’ll be hungry;</p>
<p>my servants will drink, but you’ll be thirsty;</p>
<p>my servants will celebrate, but you’ll be humiliated;</p>
<p>14my servants will make a joyful sound with a happy heart,</p>
<p>but you’ll cry with a heavy heart</p>
<p>and wail with a broken spirit.</p>
<p>15The name you leave behind will be a curse to my chosen ones,</p>
<p>and the Lord Yahveh will slay you;</p>
<p>but I’ll call my servants another name</p>
<p>16because those who bless themselves on earth</p>
<p>will bless themselves by the true God;</p>
<p>the ones that take an oath in the land</p>
<p>will swear by the true God;</p>
<p>because I’ll forget the former troubles</p>
<p>and hide them from me.	Is 65:13-16</p>
<p>New Earth and Sky</p>
<p>17“I’m creating a new earth and sky;</p>
<p>people won’t think about previous things anymore.</p>
<p>18Be happy and celebrate forever in what I create,</p>
<p>because I’ll create Jerusalem for celebrating</p>
<p>and its people for happiness.</p>
<p>19I’ll celebrate over Jerusalem</p>
<p>and be happy with my people;</p>
<p>they won’t hear weeping and crying anymore.</p>
<p>20No longer will babies live just a few days,</p>
<p>or adults die young;</p>
<p>they’ll die when they’re 100;</p>
<p>anybody that dies young will be considered cursed.</p>
<p>21They’ll build houses and live in them,</p>
<p>plant vineyards and eat their fruit.	Is 65:17-21</p>
<p>22They won’t build and someone else occupy them;</p>
<p>they won’t plant and somebody else eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The lifetime of my people will be like the lifetime of a tree;</p>
<p>my chosen ones will enjoy what they make.</p>
<p>23They won’t work to no end</p>
<p>or have children that face catastrophes;</p>
<p>they’ll be the offspring of people Yahveh has blessed—</p>
<p>their descendants as well.</p>
<p>24Before they call, I’ll answer;</p>
<p>while they’re speaking, I’ll listen.</p>
<p>25Wolf and lamb will graze together;</p>
<p>a lion will eat straw like an ox,</p>
<p>but snakes will eat dust.</p>
<p>They won’t hurt anything in all my holy mountain,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.                     Is 65:22-25</p>
<p>Judgment and Hope</p>
<p>66:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Heaven is my throne; earth is my footstool;</p>
<p>where are you going to build me a Temple to rest in?</p>
<p>2I made all this;</p>
<p>that’s why it’s here.</p>
<p>But the ones I especially love</p>
<p>are humble with a repentant spirit</p>
<p>and respect what I say.	Is 66:1-2</p>
<p>3“But for the ones who’ve chosen their own way</p>
<p>and delight in detestable things,</p>
<p>offering an ox will be like human sacrifice,</p>
<p>sacrificing a lamb will be like breaking a dog’s neck,</p>
<p>offering a grain offering will be like offering pig’s blood,</p>
<p>burning incense will be like blessing an idol.</p>
<p>4I’ll carry out their punishments</p>
<p>and bring on them what they dread;</p>
<p>because I called, but nobody answered;</p>
<p>I spoke, but they ignored me.</p>
<p>They did what I consider sinful</p>
<p>and chose what I don’t delight in.”	Is 66:3-4</p>
<p>5Listen to this message from Yahveh,</p>
<p>you that respect what he says,</p>
<p>“Your brothers that hate you and exclude you</p>
<p>because you’re loyal to me, have scoffed,</p>
<p>‘Honor Yahveh so we can see how happy he makes you!’</p>
<p>But they’re the ones that will be humiliated.</p>
<p>6The uproar in the city and the Temple</p>
<p>is Yahveh paying back his enemies.	Is 66:5-6</p>
<p>7“Before she travailed, she brought forth;</p>
<p>before her pain came, she had a boy.</p>
<p>8Who ever heard of such a thing?</p>
<p>Who has seen anything like that?</p>
<p>Can a country be born in a day?</p>
<p>Can a nation be brought forth all at once?</p>
<p>But as soon as Zion’s travail began,</p>
<p>she brought forth her children.</p>
<p>9Would I bring to term and not deliver?</p>
<p>Would I that give delivery shut the womb?</p>
<p>10Be joyful over Jerusalem, you that love her;</p>
<p>be happy with her, you that mourn for her;</p>
<p>11so you can be satisfied by her consoling breasts,</p>
<p>nurse and be delighted by her bountiful bosom.”	 Is 66:7-11</p>
<p>12This is what Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I extend peace to her like a river,</p>
<p>the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream.</p>
<p>She’ll nurse you and carry you on her hip,</p>
<p>and play with you on her lap.</p>
<p>13I’ll comfort you like a mother does;</p>
<p>I’ll comfort you in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>14When you experience it, you’ll be happy;</p>
<p>you’ll flourish like new grass.</p>
<p>Yahveh’s servants will realize what he’s doing;</p>
<p>his enemies will experience his indignation.	Is 66:12-14</p>
<p>15He will come in fire;</p>
<p>his chariots will rush in like a windstorm</p>
<p>to render his anger with fury,</p>
<p>to rebuke with flames.</p>
<p>16He’ll condemn by fire and sword;</p>
<p>the number he slays will be countless.	Is 66:15-16</p>
<p>17“Those who ‘sanctify and purify’ themselves to enter sacred gardens with idols in the center, that eat pig meat and disgusting things like mice, will all come to their end at the same time. 18I know what they’re thinking; I can see what they’re doing. The time’s coming to gather all nations to see my glory. 19I’ll perform a sign among them and send survivors out from them to the nations—to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and distant lands that have never heard of me. 20From all the countries they’ll bring me your people as a grain offering. On horses, mules, and camels; in chariots and litter wagons they’ll bring them to my holy mountain Jerusalem,” 	Yahveh says.</p>
<p>Is 66:17-20</p>
<p>21“1’ll make some of them priests and Levites.”</p>
<p>22As surely as the new earth and sky will last,</p>
<p>your descendants and name will endure.</p>
<p>23-24Every new moon and Sabbath,</p>
<p>all humanity will come to bow to me.</p>
<p>When they leave, they’ll see the corpses of those</p>
<p>who’ve rebelled against me.</p>
<p>The maggots won’t die;</p>
<p>the fire won’t go out.</p>
<p>They’ll be repulsive to everybody that sees them,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.	Is 66:21-24</p>
