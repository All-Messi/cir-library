            <p>REVELATION:  GOOD AND EVIL IN ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p>Good triumphs over evil.</p>
<p>Good and evil are not equal opposites in power or legitimacy.</p>
<p>Good and evil are not equally eternal. Evil has a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>Evil is allowed.</p>
<p>Evil does not simply take over and “bully” people around undeterred.</p>
<p>Evil is temporary (limited in length).</p>
<p>In comparison to good, individual evils are short-lived along the way.</p>
<p>Death removes it from the scene.</p>
<p>God intervenes when he decides to do so.</p>
<p>General, over-all evil is limited in the end because God overthrows it.</p>
<p>Evil is limited in degree.</p>
<p>Evil is limited, not only because it is contrary to nature and so tends to self-destruct, but because it is weaker than good and is subject to the curbing and staying hand of God.</p>
<p>Evil can be limited by transformation.</p>
<p>Evil among men is first given reason and opportunity to convert into good.</p>
<p>Evil is overcome first by influence before authority and force are brought to bear.</p>
<p>Influence is exerted by proclamation and faithfulness on the part of good.</p>
<p>God himself in Christ participates with us in the suffering that evil directs toward people.</p>
<p>There is a connection between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>God is aware of what is going on here.</p>
<p>God has a hand in history to curb and stay evil as well as to instigate and promote good.</p>
<p>Evil is not necessarily rectified during this life.</p>
<p>What happens in an individual’s lifetime is not the whole story.</p>
<p>What happens during history is not the whole story either.</p>
<p>The conquest of good over evil involves resources from outside this realm.</p>
<p>Humankind will not deliver itself from the grips of evil; that is where evil lies.</p>
<p>Things are not out of control just because they are out of our control.</p>
<p>Evil comes to a final, irreversible end.</p>
