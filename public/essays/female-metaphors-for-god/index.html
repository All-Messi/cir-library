            <p>FEMALE METAPHORS FOR GOD</p>
<p>Genesis 1:27 Women and Men created in God’s image</p>
<p>“Humankind was created as God’s reflection: in the divine image God created them; female and male, God made them.”</p>
<p>Hosea 11:3-4 God described as a mother</p>
<p>God: “Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I who took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.”</p>
<p>Hosea 13:8 God described as a mother bear</p>
<p>“Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and tear them asunder…”</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 32:11-12 God described as a mother eagle</p>
<p>“Like the eagle that stirs up its nest, and hovers over its young, God spreads wings to catch you, and carries you on pinions.”</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 32:18 God who gives birth</p>
<p>“You were unmindful of the Rock that bore you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.”</p>
<p>Isaiah 66:13 God as a comforting mother</p>
<p>God: “As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>Isaiah 49:15 God compared to a nursing mother</p>
<p>God: “Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.”</p>
<p>Isaiah 42:14 God as a woman in labor</p>
<p>God: “For a long time I have held my peace, I have kept myself still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor, I will gasp and pant.”</p>
<p>Psalm 131:2 God as a Mother</p>
<p>“But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.”</p>
<p>Psalm 123:2-3 God compared to a woman</p>
<p>“As the eyes of a servant looks to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to you, YHWH, until you show us your mercy!”</p>
<p>Matthew 23:37 and Luke 13:34 God as a Mother Hen</p>
<p>Jesus: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!”</p>
<p>Luke 15:8-10 God as a woman looking for her lost coin</p>
<p>Jesus: “Or what woman having ten silver coins, is she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</p>
