<p>In contrast to an adult/full-grown man, one who is a beginner in spiritual instruction</p>

<p>Babylon</p>
<p>A cryptogram for Rome (1 Peter 5:13; Revelation 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21)</p>
<p>Baptism</p>
<p>a. 	Cleansing (1 Corinthians 6:11?; Ephesians 5:26?; Titus 3:5; Hebrews 10:22)</p>
<p>b.	Being overwhelmed</p>
<p>Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11 = Mark 1:8 = Luke 3:16 = John 1:33)</p>
<p>Baptism of suffering (Matthew 20:22-23 = Mark 10:38-39; Luke 12:50;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:29?)</p>
<p>Baptism is a burial, picturing the death-resurrection of Jesus Christ, the most distinctive event in his life. Inasmuch as baptism is immersion it pictures burial—burial of the old way of life based in the flesh and the way of life that derives from values based only in fleshly considerations (Romans 6).</p>
<p>Baptism is done in water, symbolizing cleansing.</p>
<p>In baptism a person is passive, correlating with salvation as grace by the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>In baptism the eyes are shut, breathing stops, hearing stops, as in death.</p>
<p>c.	Represents the Spirit</p>
<p>John the Baptist uses his baptism in water as an analogy for baptism in the Holy</p>
<p>Spirit.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 3:21 water saves, gives life, as it did to Noah (via buoyancy), so it does now because water gives life: Jesus is a life-giving Spirit (1 Corinthians 15). “Water of Life”</p>
<p>Barren</p>
<p>Fruitless (James 2)</p>
<p>Before/behind</p>
<p>Being “behind” someone means letting him be in charge (Matthew 16:23)</p>
<p>Being “ahead” of someone means being superior or being in charge of (John 1:30).</p>
<p>Beget</p>
<p>Incarnation</p>
<p>Resurrection</p>
<p>Enthronement</p>
<p>Conversion</p>
<p>(Binding/Loosing; see “Keys”)</p>
<p>Birds</p>
<p>“Birds gathering around a carcass” is a picture of people gathered around a center of</p>
<p>attention, as at Christ’s return (Luke 17:37 = Matthew 24:28).</p>
<p>Birth images</p>
<p>Born</p>
<p>Paul speaks of himself as born out of due season, by which he means he was not part of the original cluster of Christ’s appearances. In that respect he is like a lamb or other animal born at the wrong time of the year. It is doubtful that he means premature birth since he compares it to being “later” than expected.</p>
<p>*“Born of woman” means “human being” (Luke 7:28; Matthew 11:11).</p>
<p>Travail represents extreme suffering (Isaiah 13:8; 21:3-4; 26:17-18; Matthew 24:8 =</p>
<p>Mark 13:8).</p>
<p>Travail represents extreme suffering in a loving God’s universe (Proverbs 3:6 &gt;</p>
<p>Hebrews 12).</p>
<p>Travail in birth is overshadowed by the joy of the child born (John 16:21-22; Isaiah</p>
<p>66:[7-]10-14).</p>
<p>*Travail in childbirth is something that cannot be escaped (1 Thessalonians 5:3; Hosea</p>
<p>13:13; Micah 4:9-10).</p>
<p>The conversion of someone that a person yearns hard to see change. Paul is in travail</p>
<p>again till Christ be formed in the Galatians (Galatians 4:19).</p>
<p>Israel’s rebirth as a nation was quick as a woman delivering before her travail begins</p>
<p>(Isaiah 66:7-9).</p>
<p>The whole creation suffers waiting for deliverance (Romans 8:22).</p>
<p>“Born again,” new birth, regeneration</p>
<p>John 3:3-7, being “born again” (or “from above”) is being born of the water and the</p>
<p>spirit; it represents beginning again from a different starting point.</p>
<p>Titus 3:5, a statement associated with baptism, called a “washing of regeneration”</p>
<p>Compare Matthew 19:28, an end-time statement about the restoration of all things</p>
<p>Paul calls (re)converting someone giving birth to them (Galatians 4:19).</p>
<p>James 1:18 says, “Christ gave us birth by the word of truth.”</p>
<p>Christ needs to be reformed in the Galatians, and Paul is in travail till they are</p>
<p>reborn in Christ (Galatians 4:19).</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:3 says, “Christ has begotten us again to a living hope.”</p>
<p>(Blindness; see “Sight,” “Eyes”)</p>
<p>Blood</p>
<p>Blood being on someone’s head means his taking responsibility for his death (Matthew</p>
<p>27:25, Acts 5:28).</p>
<p>Drinking Jesus’ blood represents internalizing his values, power, identity (John 6:51-</p>
<p>58).</p>
<p>“Born of blood” is an expression for physical birth (John 1:13).</p>
<p>(Blow on; see “Breathe on”)</p>
<p>Body figure</p>
<p>Matthew 5:29-30</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:12-30; 10:16-17</p>
<p>Romans 12:3-8</p>
<p>Ephesus 3:6; 4:4, 16-17</p>
<p>Comparisons involved between the church (a group of people) and a body</p>
<p>a. 	All the parts are needed; there are no jobless organs (no nascent or vestigial</p>
<p>organs)</p>
<p>b.	All the parts are not equally important</p>
<p>c.	All the parts do not do the same things</p>
<p>d.	Some parts are not essential for the existence of the organism although their absence may make it less efficient and effective; not equally important but equally necessary.</p>
<p>e.	Some of the less important parts may nevertheless require more attention to keep them functional. They are parts that we must deliberately do something for (cp. weaker brother)</p>
<p>f.	Unity and harmoniousness of the parts ideally and intentionally</p>
<p>g.	Interdependency</p>
<p>h.	Compenetration</p>
<p>i.	Reciprocal interaction</p>
<p>j.	Diversity</p>
<p>k.	What affects one affects them all; when one hurts they all hurt, so to speak.</p>
<p>l.	The body is a self-(re-)generating system; it “builds itself up.”</p>
<p>m.	We should not take the members of the body and make them members of a harlot (1 Corinthians 6:15-18). Paul calls for sanctity of the one relative to the other in contrast to foreign identification (1 Corinthians 7:14).</p>
<p>n.	When an eye or hand “offends” you, it is better to amputate it than let it ruin the whole body (Matthew 5:29-30). Applicable to church discipline (“a little leaven leavens the whole lump”) or perhaps divorce in the home setting.</p>
<p>o.	Weakness or loss of a member can be compensated for to some extent by the intensification of other capacities. The loss of sight increases the sensitivity of hearing and touch. Compensation</p>
<p>p.	The basis of worth lies in making a contribution to the operation of the body, which amounts to love; and that is where Paul moves to in 1 Corinthians 13, having mentioned the body figure in 12:12-31. Love is the giving of oneself, or action for the welfare of others—the whole (body). In 1 Corinthians 12 the attributes of the individual members are tied in with the gifts a member has. Those “gifts” are “given” specifically for ministry to the rest. The approach to worth contrasts with competition, as demonstrated in the attitude, “I don’t need you.” The idea is not to get worth by setting others at naught. Worth is (1) a matter of action that fulfills purpose. Worth is also (2) a matter of belonging in contrast to the feeling, “I am not part of the body.” The basic problem among the Corinthians was the competitive mentality that manifested itself in the division problem (Chronicles 1-4) and in the aberrant use of spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>q.	It is possible to get rid of a part of the body rather than let it ruin the rest.</p>
<p>example of the one and the many</p>
<p>r.	No one organ is the whole thing.</p>
<p>s.	Body figure measures worth in a complementary framework; a person has worth by making the contribution God wants a heart to make (as shown by the way he made it), not by being better than a knee or more indispensable than a fingernail.</p>
<p>t.	Body members do not act for themselves (hence, tongues are not for the</p>
<p>person?).</p>
<p>u.	Some body parts function for/in the body itself; some function for purposes</p>
<p>beyond it.</p>
<p>Body parts</p>
<p>Feet: putting someone under your feet/footstool means subjecting them (Psalm 110:1; Matthew 22:44; 26:64; Mark 12:36; 16:19; Luke 20:42; Acts 2:25 (Psalm 16:8), 34; Hebrews 1:13; 1 Corinthians 15:25, 27)</p>
<p>Eye represents awareness.</p>
<p>Ear represents paying attention to something.</p>
<p>Tongue represents communication.</p>
<p>Face to face/mouth to mouth represents direct contact rather than through an</p>
<p>intermediary.</p>
<p>Hand represents agency;</p>
<p>“Not letting one hand know what the other one is doing” represents doing</p>
<p>something in secret rather than for show.</p>
<p>Right hand represents preferred or privileged position (Psalm 110:1 &lt; Matthew 22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42; Acts 2:25 (Psalm 16:8), 34; Hebrews 1:13; 10:12; 1 Peter 3:22)</p>
<p>Heart</p>
<p>“Being troubled” means a person is uncertain/fearful/worried (John 14:1, 27)</p>
<p>= “soul being troubled” (John 12:27).</p>
<p>= “troubled in spirit” (John 13:21).</p>
<p>Hebrew idiom has a general fondness for “body parts” imagery: “every eye will see him” (vs. everyone will see him); “by the hand of” = agency; “face/mouth to mouth/face” = directly; etc.</p>
<p>Boxing</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 9:26</p>
<p>Bread</p>
<p>Food serves as an image for spiritual sustenance (John 6:27; Matthew 4:3-4 = Luke 4:3-</p>
<p>4). (See also “Blood,” “Flesh,” “Communion.”)</p>
<p>Breathing on someone</p>
<p>Jesus “breathed on” the disciples in John 20:22 as a symbolic act that represented the</p>
<p>giving of the Spirit to them (“insufflation,” ἐνεφύσησεν, enephysēsen)</p>
<p>(Bridegroom; see “Weddings”)</p>
<p>*Bridle</p>
<p>Restrain or direct the tongue (James 1:26; 3:2)</p>
<p>Building figures</p>
<p>Cornerstone</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the cornerstone for the church (Psalm 11:22; 118:22-23 + Isaiah 28:16 &lt; Matthew 21:42-44; Luke 20:17-18; Acts 4:11; Romans 9:32-33; 1 Peter 2:6-8; cp. Ephesians 2:10)</p>
<p>Foundation</p>
<p>Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders (Matthew 7:24-27 = Luke 6:46-49)</p>
<p>Christ as the foundation of the church (1 Corinthians 3:9-15)</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 the foundation emphasizes salvation.</p>
<p>In Matthew/Luke Sermon on the Mount/Plain, the foundation emphasizes Christ’s</p>
<p>Lordship.</p>
<p>The apostles and prophets as the foundation of the church with Christ as the</p>
<p>cornerstone (Ephesians 2:19d-22; cp. Romans 15:20)</p>
<p>Jesus nicknames Simon as Peter/Cephas (Matthew 10:2 = Mark 3:16 = Luke 6:14;</p>
<p>cp. John 1:42; 2 Timothy 2:19).</p>
<p>Represents the first principles of Christianity (Hebrews 5:1)</p>
<p>The fact that Jesus is the Messiah is the foundation on which Christ builds his</p>
<p>church (Matthew 18:17-18).</p>
<p>Peter’s name meant “rock,” and he was so named by Jesus (Matthew 4:18; 10:2; John 1:40-42) as a picture of a good foundation like the large rock that Caesarea was built on (Matthew 16:13ff.).</p>
<p>Prominent people in the church are like pillars* in a building (Galatians 2:9; cp.</p>
<p>Revelation 3:12; cp. 1 Timothy 3:15, where the church is the pillar of truth.</p>
<p>Habitation/temple/house/tabernacle</p>
<p>Church as the habitation of God in the Spirit (Ephesians 3:22; 1 Corinthians 3:16-</p>
<p>17; 6:19? [probably a reference to an individual’s body]; 1 Peter 2:4-8)</p>
<p>The individual’s body is the temple of the Spirit (John 2:19-22; Mark 14:58;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 16:19)</p>
<p>See also “Tabernacle/Temple.”</p>
<p>A fire reveals how well the building is built (1 Corinthians 3) as comparable to</p>
<p>judgment in the end or trials along the way.</p>
<p>The outward body decays but the inner man is renewed daily; it does not get old</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 4:16-5:1ff.).</p>
<p>Dying is like losing the body and having another one replace it (2 Corinthians</p>
<p>5:2ff.).</p>
<p>The body is like a tabernacle, a temporary and movable dwelling (2 Corinthians 5:1,</p>
<p>4; 2 Peter 1:13-14).</p>
<p>Going to heaven is like going home, where the Lord is (2 Corinthians 5:6-8).</p>
<p>An abandoned house represents Israel when God gave up the nation to the Romans</p>
<p>(Matthew 23:37)</p>
<p>Examples texts</p>
<p>Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders (Matthew 7:24-27)</p>
<p>Paul’s Preaching to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 3:10-15)</p>
<p>Paul, as the preacher, is a wise master builder (foreman?).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the foundation.</p>
<p>A man’s work is like different kinds of building materials that differ in their durability. The different materials are thought by some interpreters to represent acts of life, but it seems more likely that they represent persons won by a worker’s missionary activities.</p>
<p>Other workers’ additions to Paul’s original foundation work may be destroyed without the workman himself “suffering loss,” which probably means that those converted may not have a faith that stands the tests of time and temptation but that does not destroy the worker’s own status. (Peter speaks of individual Christians as living stones in the building/temple of God: 1 Peter 2:5)</p>
<p>Other workmen are working on the same project—on one foundation, an</p>
<p>implication for unity in the work.</p>
<p>Consider ahead of time whether you have enough money to finish what you</p>
<p>start (Luke 14:28-30).</p>
<p>Burden</p>
<p>People that mooch off other people are like burdens to the other people</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 11:9; 12:14).</p>
<p>*Buying</p>
<p>A picture for God’s activity in saving man (Revelation 5:9; 14:3, 4; 1 Corinthians 6:20;</p>
<p>7:23; 2 Peter 2:1)</p>
<p>Compare “Redemption”</p>
<p>Camel</p>
<p>Easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter</p>
<p>the kingdom of God (Matthew 19:24 = Mark 10:25 = Luke 18:25)</p>
<p>Capture (see “Warfare Imagery”)</p>
<p>Chicken</p>
<p>A hen gathering her chicks under her wings represents God’s gathering his people under his protection and provision; but like chicks that want to run around and not come under the hen, Jerusalem did not want to accept God’s protection.</p>
<p>Child (see also “Family Relations”)</p>
<p>A child is resilient; he bounces back from adversity very well in comparison to adults.</p>
<p>Children do not bear grudges; they are forgiving.</p>
<p>Jesus set a child in the midst of the disciples as a model of attitude for leadership</p>
<p>(Matthew 18:1ff.).</p>
<p>Jesus used the child as an example of humility in being in the kingdom (“except you</p>
<p>enter as a child”; Matthew 18:1; 19:14 [= Mark 10:14-15; Luke 18:16-17]).</p>
<p>A child tends to be “innocent,” tends to trust, changes more easily than an adult.</p>
<p>Child is a term of endearment applied to a person’s converts (both τέκνον and υἱός,</p>
<p>teknon and huios; Proverbs 3:11-12 &lt; Hebrews 12:5-8).</p>
<p>Children that do not want to play anything picture the people of Israel that God could</p>
<p>not please no matter what he did (Luke 7:32-35).</p>
<p>Child as a beginner in the study of spiritual things as opposed to an adult (1 Corinthians</p>
<p>13:11; cp. “baby,” “milk”)</p>
<p>Discipline of Children</p>
<p>Circumcision</p>
<p>“Circumcision not made with hands”</p>
<p>“Circumcision of the heart”</p>
<p>The idea of purging away what defiles or is filthy</p>
<p>Circumcision as simply trimming/adjusting a small aspect of system of things in</p>
<p>contradiction to a whole new body/creation (Galatians 6:15)</p>
<p>Citizenship</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:11-19a: belonging</p>
<p>Cleansing</p>
<p>Cleansing is a picture for getting rid of sin (John 13:2).</p>
<p>Ceremonial cleansing (the removal of “taint” in our mind’s eye) is like getting rid of</p>
<p>sin.</p>
<p>See also (“Unclean/Uncleanness”)</p>
<p>Clothes</p>
<p>The body is like clothes that will be changed for another set of clothes (2 Corinthians</p>
<p>5:2-4).</p>
<p>When we die, we do not become, so to speak, “naked,” but we receive another body.</p>
<p>Nakedness represents the sense of shame (Genesis 3?; Revelation 3:18).</p>
<p>Nakedness represents having our inner thoughts brought out in the open (Hebrews</p>
<p>4:13).</p>
<p>Putting on and taking off clothes (changing clothes) serves as a picture for changing</p>
<p>from one way of living to another (Ephesians 1:22-24? Colossians 3:9-10).</p>
<p>Changing from old clothes to new is a figure for the renewal of the universe (Hebrews</p>
<p>1:11-12 = Psalm 102:25-27).</p>
<p>Cloth</p>
<p>A person does not put an unSanforized patch on Sanforized cloth as a way of saying,</p>
<p>“unlike things can’t be mixed” (Matthew 9:16 = Mark 2:21 = Luke 5:36).</p>
<p>Cloud</p>
<p>Clouds without water represent leaders that do not have anything to offer (Jude 12).</p>
<p>These clouds are carried around by the wind, implying they do not have stability to</p>
<p>them (Jude 12).</p>
<p>An immense number (Hebrews 12:1)</p>
<p>(Comforter; see “Advocate”)</p>
<p>Communion (Cross reference to Passover elements that are re-interpreted)</p>
<p>The one loaf and one cup represent the one object of identification–Christ–in contrast</p>
<p>to polytheism and idolatry (2 Corinthians 10:14-22).</p>
<p>Eating from the one loaf symbolizes identifying with what it represents (cp. eating from</p>
<p>the Old Testament sacrifices; 2 Corinthians 10:18)</p>
<p>Eating the bread symbolizes eating the flesh of Christ (Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19;</p>
<p>Corinthians 11:23-24).</p>
<p>Drinking grape juice symbolizes drinking His blood (Mark 14:23-25; Luke 22:20;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:25-26)</p>

<p>(Cornerstone; see “Building Figures.”)</p>
<p>Covenant/covenant (διαθήκη, diathēkē)</p>
<p>The establishment of a covenant/testament requires death/blood (Hebrews 9:11-22).</p>
<p>The testament does not go into effect until the testator dies (Hebrews 9:16-22).</p>
<p>Creation</p>
<p>The idea that man was created in the “image” of God gets extended in Paul and the New Testament from a natural to ethical usage. Being ethical in the image/likeness of God paves the way then for calling our becoming righteous through Christ a “creation” (Ephesians 2:10—“created in Christ Jesus for good works”; 2:15; 4:24; 1:24; Galatians 6:15; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Colossians 3:10).</p>

<p>conjointly (Romans 6:4-11ff.)</p>
<p>Crucifixion (Galatians 2:20)</p>
<p>“Crucifying the flesh” represents leaving a fleshly orientation of consciousness and</p>
<p>values.</p>
<p>We crucify the world to ourselves when we identify with Christ. Something has to be crucified. The only question is whether it is us, the world or Christ. Crucifixion is a vivid way of amplifying the death figure as a way of speaking of separating ourselves from something (Galatians 6:14).</p>
<p>“Let him take up his cross and follow me” is a call to total commitment (Mark 8:34;</p>
<p>Matthew 10:38; 16:24; Luke 9:23; 14:27).</p>
<p>Jesus was crucified outside the Jerusalem gate, which pictures his not being part of</p>
<p>the national Jewish order (Hebrews 13:11-13ff.).</p>
<p>“Nailing Jesus to the cross” is like nailing the Law to the cross (Colossians 2:14).</p>
<p>“Re-crucifying Christ” as a common criminal in nakedness is what we do when we reject him/drift away from him later (Hebrews 6:6). It involves the same insensitivity to spiritual things that caused the Jews to kill him before.</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>As a picture of getting out from under law (Romans 7:1-6; 10:4; Galatians 2:18-</p>

<p>3:1-11ff.)</p>

<p>“Drink a cup” means passing through an ordeal (Matthew 20:22 = Mark 10:38; Matthew 26:39, [42], [44] = Luke 22:42; John 18:11; Mark 14:36; Isaiah 51:17; Jeremiah 49:12).</p>
<p>“Clean the inside of the cup and the outside will be clean, too” (Luke 11:39; Matthew</p>
<p>23:25-26).</p>
<p>Cut off</p>
<p>A way of getting rid of something that could ruin the whole self: hand, foot (Mark</p>
<p>9:43-44; Matthew 18:8)</p>

<p>Diaspora/dispersion</p>
<p>Serves as a picture for the temporary nature of the Christian staying in the world and its</p>
<p>essentially alien nature as an environment</p>
<p>See also “Sojourners”</p>
<p>Doctor</p>
<p>A doctor is for the sick, not the well—a principle Jesus used to explain his presence</p>
<p>among 	publicans and sinners (Matthew 9:12 = Mark 2:17 = Luke 5:31-32).</p>
<p>“Physician, heal yourself” means what you claim to do for others you ought to be able to do for yourself (Luke 4:23; cp. Mark 15:29-32; Matthew 27:39-44; Luke 23:35-37).</p>
<p>Door</p>
<p>“Shutting the door” means opportunity is over or taken away (Luke 13:25-27; Matthew</p>
<p>25:10).</p>

<p>Revelation 3:8).</p>

<p>“Knocking at the door” means wanting to establish relationship (Revelation 3:20)</p>

<p>Shaking dust from the feet is a gesture of rejection (Mark 6:11; Matthew 10:14; Luke</p>
<p>9:5; 10:11; Acts 13:5).</p>
<p>Earnest</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 1:22; 5:5; Ephesians 1:14</p>
<p>Eating imageries (see also “Food”)</p>
<p>Eating and drinking with someone represents closeness, mutual acceptance (Mark</p>
<p>14:18; Luke 5:30; 10:7; 13:26; 22:30).</p>
<p>Eating and drinking together implies acceptance (Luke 15:2; Acts 10:41; 11:3;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 5:11).</p>
<p>Eating and drinking means carrying on life normally (Matthew 11:18-19 = Luke 7:33-</p>
<p>34; Matthew 24:38; 24:49; Luke 12:45; 17:27-28; 1 Corinthians 15:32).</p>
<p>“Drink a cup” (see “Cup”)</p>
<p>Bread: Jesus’ Bread-of-Life Sermon (John 6:41-65)</p>
<p>Food is essential.</p>
<p>Food applies to everyone.</p>
<p>The person has to put out some effort to have the consequences (nourishment).</p>
<p>Eating is a way of expressing internalizing something (Revelation 10:9-10?; John</p>
<p>6:51-58).</p>
<p>Food gives us energy and strength.</p>
<p>Milk as Christian teaching for those young in the faith (Hebrews 5:13)</p>
<p>Solid food as Christian teaching for those mature in the faith (Hebrews 5:14)</p>
<p>Rocks in your love feasts (Jude 12)</p>
<p>Spewing something out of one’s mouth because it is lukewarm (Revelation 3:15-16)</p>
<p>Tasting is used to express the idea of acutely perceived involvement.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate to take the kids’ food and give it to the household pets (Matthew</p>
<p>15:26), but they can get the crumbs (Matthew 15:27).</p>
<p>Parable of the Slighted Invitation to the Feast (Luke 14:16-24; Matthew 22:2-14)</p>
<p>Emptying</p>
<p>Paul’s figure (κενῶσις, kenōsis) in Philippians 2:7 for what Christ did in becoming</p>

<p>Enter Into</p>
<p>Satan’s entering into someone is a figure for their deciding to do an evil thing (Luke</p>
<p>22:3; John 3:27).</p>
<p>Epistle</p>
<p>The Corinthians are Paul’s epistle that all people can read (2 Corinthians 3:1-7ff.).</p>
<p>Their hearts—rather than stone—are what the new covenant is written on</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 3:1-7ff.).</p>
<p>The Spirit–rather than ink–is what the gospel is written with (2 Corinthians 3:3).</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 10:1-11ff.; Hebrews 3:7-4:11</p>
<p>Manna (1 Corinthians 10:3)</p>
<p>The veil on Moses’ Face (2 Corinthians 3:7-11)</p>
<p>The fading glory represents the fading glory of the Law he gave from God</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 3:7).</p>
<p>The Israelites put a veil on Moses, resembling their not understanding what the</p>
<p>Law was ultimately for (2 Corinthians 3:13-15).</p>
<p>When a person turns to the Lord Jesus, the veil of mystery is removed regarding</p>
<p>that ultimate purpose of the Law (2 Corinthians 3:16-18).</p>
<p>The law was written on stone tables (2 Corinthians 3:2-6; cp. Jeremiah 31:31-34).</p>
<p>The rock in the wilderness (1 Corinthians 10:4)</p>
<p>After having saved a people out of Egypt, God destroyed the ones that did not believe</p>
<p>(Jude 5).</p>
<p>Moses’ lifting up the serpent in the wilderness is a picture of Christ’s being lifted up on a cross. (See What the Bible Says About Salvation, 206-7, five characteristics of a conditionality-vs.-merit situation.)</p>

<p>Family relations serve as a picture of the closeness between Jesus and those who do his Father’s will, whether mother, brothers, sisters (Matthew 12:46-50 = Mark 3:31-35 = Luke 8:19-21).</p>
<p>“Son” is a term of endearment (Matthew 9:2 = Mark 2:5).</p>
<p>“Father of something” means the originator of it (John 8:44, “father of lies”).</p>
<p>Discipline of children equals a model for suffering (Revelation 3:19; Proverbs 3:5 &gt;</p>
<p>Hebrews 12).</p>
<p>Fattening</p>
<p>People who exploit the poor for their own luxuries are fattening themselves up for</p>
<p>slaughter (James 5:5).</p>
<p>Feet</p>
<p>Putting something under one’s feet is making it subject to him (Hebrews 1:13; 10:13 = Acts 2:35; [Matthew 22:44 = Mark 12:36 = Luke 20:43] &lt; Psalm 110:1; Psalm 8:6 &gt; Hebrews 2:8-9).</p>

<p>Satan filled the heart of Ananias to lie (Acts 5:3).</p>
<p>*Fire (punishment, destruction, purification, divine presence)</p>
<p>Retrieving an apostate is like snatching something out of the fire; the person who tries it</p>
<p>can himself get burnt (Jude 22).</p>
<p>A little spark of fire can create a large result (cp. the mustard seed; James 3:6).</p>
<p>Fire represents purification/refinement (1 Corinthians 3:12-15; 1 Peter 1:7).</p>

<p>In combination with purification, if something is of good enough quality, fire does not destroy it; it purifies. The same process does both to different parts of the one mix: it destroys the worthless parts (people) and purifies the ones not fully developed.</p>
<p>Fire represents turmoil (James 3:5-6).</p>
<p>Fire represents the presence of God.</p>
<p>The burning bush in Exodus (Exodus 3:2ff.)</p>

<p>in the wilderness</p>

<p>Represents overwhelming opposition or trials</p>
<p>Food</p>

<p>Pictures the punishment of the wicked (Matthew 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33;</p>
<p>Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; cp. James 3:6?)</p>
<p>Gentile</p>
<p>Someone outside the group (Matthew 18:17)</p>
<p>Girding oneself up</p>
<p>An expression for getting serious about actively trying to do something in dead earnest</p>
<p>(Luke 12:35; 1 Peter 5:5)</p>
<p>Gladiatorial images</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:32</p>
<p>(Grafting; see “Trees.”)</p>
<p>Graves</p>
<p>Hidden graves are compared to hidden evil influences that defile (Luke 11:44).</p>
<p>Whitewashed graves full of dead men’s bones picture good outward appearances and concern for ceremonial cleansing without changing the heart (Matthew 23:25-26; Luke 11:39-41).</p>
<p>“Gates of the grave” (Matthew 16:18) pictures the grave as something to be conquered</p>
<p>like a city with huge protective gates.</p>
<p>Hair</p>
<p>The multiplicity of hair represents something yet knowable to God.</p>
<p>The width of a hair represents a very small variance.</p>
<p>Hand (See “Body Parts.”)</p>
<p>Hardness</p>
<p>Represents insensitivity (Isaiah 6:10; John 12:40)</p>
<p>Head</p>
<p>Head of the corner (See “Building Figures: Cornerstone.”)</p>
<p>(See also “Body Parts.”)</p>
<p>Heart</p>
<p>“Keeping something in the heart” means remembering it (fondly?; Luke 2:51; cp.</p>
<p>2:19).</p>
<p>“Putting something in the heart” means influencing someone or giving a person the</p>
<p>idea to do something (John 13:2).</p>
<p>Heel</p>
<p>“To lift up the heel against” means to desert or reject (Psalm 41:9 &lt; John 13:18).</p>
<p>Housetop</p>
<p>“Shouting something from the housetop” means making it public.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Paul uses “image” (of God) in an ethical sense, which means that the original nature terminology is being bent into the behavioral sense. In Romans 8:29 the expression is specialized to mean going through the same pattern of suffering before glorification that Christ went through.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament it is used in a natural sense (also in the New Testament at 1 Corinthians 11:7 and James 3:9). That same terminology is adjusted to an ethical usage in Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18; and Colossians 3:10.</p>
<p>Christ is called the image of God (2 Corinthians 4:24; Colossians 1:15).</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Identified with</p>
<p>a-in-b-in-a (See Holy Spirit notes.)</p>
<p>Indwelling</p>
<p>A figure that communicates closeness of relationship</p>
<p>An invisible cause of (changed) behavior</p>
<p>An all-pervasive influence that goes all the way down to the inside</p>
<p>Inheritance/heir</p>
<p>Receiving a benefit is like being an heir (Acts 20:32; Romans 8:17; Galatians 4:7; Titus</p>
<p>3:7).</p>
<p>(You receive something that you did not earn)</p>
<p>(Cp. other images for consequences/effects like “reward,” “wages,” “fruit,” “harvest.”)</p>
<p>Jacob’s ladder</p>
<p>Jesus pictures himself as a ladder to heaven with divine messengers ascending and</p>
<p>descending on him (John 1:51 &lt; Genesis 28:12).</p>
<p>Job</p>
<p>a symbol of patience (James 5:11)</p>
<p>*Jonah</p>
<p>His being swallowed by a great fish for three days pictures Jesus’ three-day burial</p>
<p>followed by resurrection (Matthew 12:39-41 = Mark 11:29-30; Matthew 16:4).</p>
<p>Jot and tittle</p>
<p>The horns and the Hebrew letter yod ( י ) are small parts of writing that symbolize the tiny aspects of the Law.</p>
<p>Judge</p>
<p>As a person may beg a disinterested judge till he takes his case, so God is much more</p>
<p>susceptible to the prayer of his people in need (Luke 18:1-8).</p>
<p>Keys/binding/loosing (= locking/unlocking?)</p>
<p>“Bound/loosed” means being locked in and held down or prohibited (Job 12:14;</p>
<p>Revelation 9:14; Luke 13:16).</p>
<p>“Taking away the keys” means making something inaccessible (Luke 11:52).</p>
<p>Making something accessible (?): Matthew 18:18-20; having access to something that</p>
<p>other people do not have access to.</p>
<p>Determining a conclusion (? Matthew 18:18-20)</p>
<p>Enacting legislation on doctrine or practice (? Matthew 18:18-20)</p>
<p>Having the keys means having responsibility, control and authority (Matthew 16:19;</p>
<p>18:18; Revelation 1:18; 3:7; cp. Isaiah 22:22).</p>
<p>King</p>
<p>God is like a king and his people like a kingdom.</p>
<p>Jesus’ going to heaven to receive a kingdom is like a nobleman going to a far country to</p>
<p>receive a kingdom (Luke 19:11-27 = Matthew 25:14-30).</p>
<p>Knock (See “Door”; Matthew 7:8; Luke 11:9.)</p>
<p>Ladder</p>
<p>Jesus Christ pictured himself in terms of Jacob’s ladder (John 1:51; cp. Genesis 28:10-</p>
<p>22).</p>
<p>Lay</p>
<p>“Lay hands on”:</p>
<p>To capture someone physically (Matthew 26:50 = Mark 14:46; Luke 20:19; 21:12;</p>
<p>John 7:30, 44; Acts 4:3; 5:18; 21:27)</p>
<p>To appoint (Acts 6:6; 13:3; 1 Timothy 5:22)</p>
<p>To symbolize healing (Matthew 9:18; Mark 5:23; 6:5; 16:18; Luke 4:40; 13:13;</p>
<p>Acts 28:8)</p>
<p>To bless (Matthew 19:15)</p>
<p>To give the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17, 19; 19:6)</p>
<p>Leaven</p>
<p>A figure for influence</p>
<p>Matthew 16:5-12 = Mark 8:14-21; cp. Luke 12:1-3 (evil influence)</p>
<p>Matthew 13:33 = Luke 13:21 (good influence)</p>
<p>A little leaven leavens a whole lump (1 Corinthians 5:6 = Galatians 5:9). (evil</p>
<p>influence)</p>
<p>Old leaven is the previous values, no longer good, that influenced our previous way of</p>
<p>thinking (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8).</p>
<p>Life</p>
<p>In Christ is life (John 1:4).</p>
<p>Physical life (vs. death) became a symbol for spiritual life (John 5:21-26).</p>
<p>Life means meaningful existence.</p>
<p>“Laying down one’s life” means dying for something (John 10:11, 15, 17, 18; 1 John</p>
<p>3:162; John 15:13; 13:37, 38; Romans 16:4).</p>
<p>Lift</p>
<p>Being lifted up signifies crucifixion (John 12:32, 34; 3:14; 8:28).</p>
<p>Light/darkness</p>
<p>Light (Matthew 5:14-16)</p>
<p>Light and darkness are incompatible (2 Corinthians 6:14).</p>
<p>Light always immediately dispels darkness (2 Corinthians 4:6).</p>
<p>Light is self-authenticating.</p>
<p>Light attracts and draws (moths, flies, etc.).</p>
<p>Light stimulates vision; if a person lives continuously in the dark, he will eventually</p>
<p>become blind (cp. 1 John 2:11).</p>
<p>Light raises people’s spirits; some people become depressed when they are deprived of light. Seasonal depression/moodiness has been identified as a syndrome that especially bothers some people.</p>
<p>Christ is said to be the effulgence (direct shining) of God’s glory (Hebrews 1:3).</p>
<p>“Walking in the light/daytime” means that a person does not stumble (John 11:9-10).</p>
<p>The gospel shining in our hearts is like God calling light out of darkness in the</p>
<p>beginning (2 Corinthians 4:6).</p>
<p>People do not put a lamp under a bushel basket (Matthew 5:15-16; Mark 4:21-22; Luke</p>
<p>11:33);</p>
<p>—or under a bed (Luke 8:16);</p>
<p>—or in the cellar (Luke 11:33).</p>
<p>A city set on a hill cannot be hid (the lights of the city? Matthew 5:14).</p>
<p>*Light as a symbol for the truth/enlightenment (Matthew 4:16; 5:14, 16; 6:23; Luke 2:32; 11:35; 16:8; John 1:4-5, 7-9; 3:19-21; 5:35; 8:12; 9:5; 11:9-10; 12:35-36, 46; Acts 13:47; 26:18, 23; 2 Peter 1:19).</p>
<p>Darkness as a symbol for:</p>
<p>Ignorance [σκότος] (Matthew 4:16; 6:232 [=Luke 11:34-36]; Luke 1:79; Acts 26:18; Romans 2:19; I Peter 5:4, 5; [σκοτία] = John 1:5; I John 1:5; 1:8, 9a, 11a &amp; c; [σκοτίζομαι] = Romans 1:21; 11:10; Ephesians 4:18)</p>
<p>Confusion: walking in darkness, a person can get hurt.</p>
<p>Darkness as a symbol for sinfulness/evil [σκότος (Luke 22:53; John 3:19; Romans 13:12; 1 Corinthians 4:5; Ephesians 5:8, 11; 6:12; Colossians 1:13; 1 Peter 2:9; 1 John 1:6; [σκοτία] John 8:12; 12:352, 46; 1 John 2:11b)</p>
<p>Darkness as a symbol for hill [σκότος] (Matthew 8:12; 22:13; 25:30; 2 Peter 2:17; Jude</p>
<ol start="13">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Darkness as a symbol for privacy (Matthew 10:27; Luke 12:3)</p>
<p>Churches/people are called lampstands (“candlesticks”; Philippians 2:15; Revelation</p>
<p>1:12-13; 2:5.).</p>
<p>Light does not come from nowhere; it begins at a source and connects to another point. Christ 	is the source of light and Christians are at least reflectors of that light to connect it with people who work in the dark. It has no effect unless it leaves its source and “touches” some object. It is different from the rest of what is.</p>
<p>Lightning</p>
<p>Divine destruction</p>
<p>Lightning cracking to the earth represents Satan’s fall (Luke 10:18).</p>
<p>As lightning flashes all the way across the sky, so will the coming of Christ be</p>
<p>(Matthew 23:27 = Luke 17:24).</p>
<p>Loins (*Girding up the loins)</p>
<p>Preparation/readiness for action (Luke 12:35; Ephesians 6:14; 1 Peter 1:13 &lt; Exodus</p>
<p>12:11; 1 Kings 18:46; 2 Kings 4:29; 9:1; Jeremiah 1:17)</p>
<p>Lord’s Supper, The (See “Communion.”)</p>
<p>*Manna (See also “Bread.”)</p>
<p>Physical sustenance in the wilderness becomes an image for spiritual sustenance in the</p>
<p>material world (John 6:31-35, 41, 48-58; Revelation 2:17).</p>
<p>Marriage (See also “Weddings.”)</p>
<p>The church is the bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:22-33).</p>
<p>*Adultery is a symbol of unfaithfulness or mixing irreconcilable commitments</p>
<p>(Matthew 12:39; 16:4; Mark 8:38; James 4:4; Revelation 2:22).</p>
<p>Meal</p>
<p>People will return your grace like meal pressed down, shaken together and running over</p>
<p>(Luke 6:38; cp. Matthew 7:2; Mark 4:24).</p>
<p>Meat (See “Food.”)</p>
<p>Melchizedek</p>
<p>Genesis 14:18-20 + (cp. Zechariah 6:13) + Psalm 110:4; Hebrews 5:6, 10 + 6:20-8:6</p>
<p>without mother or father (as far as the record goes; 7:3)</p>
<p>without birth or death (as far as the record goes; 7:3); cp. virgin birth and resurrection over death to serve continuously as priest (7:23-24); hence, one priest rather than a series of priests (7:23-25)</p>
<p>greater than Abraham because Abraham paid tithes to him from the spoils of war</p>
<p>(7:4-8)</p>
<p>King of righteousness (“Melchizedek”; 7:2)</p>
<p>King of peace (“Salem”; 7:2)</p>
<p>Messiah as High-priest-King</p>
<p>A different priesthood from that of Levi-Aaron (7:9); hence, the change of</p>
<p>law/covenant (7:12ff.), it being a better covenant/place of officiating (8:4, 7), and so on.</p>
<p>Men</p>
<p>A full-grown man in contrast to a baby or a child represents someone who has matured in the faith rather than someone who is still working only with the first level of doctrinal matters (Hebrews 5:14; 1 Corinthians 13:11; cp. 1 Peter 2:2).</p>
<p>Millstone</p>
<p>Putting a millstone around a person’s neck and throwing him into the ocean is a picture</p>
<p>of inescapable destiny (Matthew 18:6; Mark 9:42; Luke 17:2).</p>
<p>Milk</p>
<p>Preliminary Christian teachings in contrast to solid food (Hebrews 5:12-14;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3:2; 1 Peter 2:20).</p>
<p>Mirror</p>
<p>The word is like a mirror that allows us to see what we look like (James 1:23-25).</p>
<p>Mote</p>
<p>A picture of weakness or small negative influence (Matthew 7:3-5; Luke 6:41-42)</p>
<p>Mountain</p>
<p>Moving a mountain as a statement of great effect (Matthew 17:20; 21:21; Mark 11:23;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 13:2)</p>
<p>Naaman</p>
<p>There were many lepers in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet, but none were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian, which illustrates God’s concern for more than just Israel.</p>
<p>(Nakedness; see “Clothes.”)</p>
<p>National imagery</p>
<p>King/Lord/Prince/Governor</p>
<p>Serves as an image for Jesus Christ as head of the church</p>
<p>Naturalization</p>
<p>A picture of being brought into what is not naturally yours. This is a particularly apt expression because God’s nation Israel serves as a picture of the group of God’s people the church.</p>
<p>Needle</p>
<p>“Easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye . . .” (Matthew 19:24 = Mark 10:25 =</p>
<p>Luke 18:25)</p>
<p>(New creation; see “Re-creation.”)</p>
<p>(Nobleman; see “King.”)</p>
<p>Offerings</p>
<p>Paul says his life is “poured out like a drink offering”—a kind of emptying (2 Timothy</p>
<p>4:6).</p>
<p>Opening</p>
<p>An opportunity made available is an open door (1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians</p>
<p>2:12; Colossians 4:3; Revelation 3:7, 8).</p>
<p>Explaining something: opening the scripture (Luke 24)</p>
<p>Opening the eyes (see “Eyes”)</p>
<p>“Opening the mind” means causing to understand (Luke 24:32, 45).</p>

<p>Plant imagery</p>
<p>Vine and the branches (John 15:1-8ff)</p>
<p>Old Testament references where Israel is called a vine.</p>
<p>Pruning represents getting rid of what hinders productivity: 15:2.</p>
<p>Christ is the vine; the disciples are the branches; the Father is the husbandman</p>
<p>(15:1, 5).</p>
<p>The branches have to stay on the vine to bear fruit (15:4-8ff.).</p>
<p>If the branches leave the vine, they wither.</p>
<p>If the branches are cut out of the vine, they are thrown into the fire and destroyed</p>
<p>(15:6).</p>
<p>There is no value to a branch if it does not bear fruit.</p>
<p>Sowing/seed as expressions for cause (cp. “Fruit” for “result”)</p>
<p>Fruit* as a word for result or product (cp. “Seed” for cause; Matthew 3:8 = Luke 3:8; Matthew 7:16-20; 12:33; 13:8, 26; 21:18-22 = Mark 11:12-14, 2-24, 33-43; Mark 7:16-20; 13:23; 4:20; Luke 8:15; Romans 1:13; 6:21-22; 7:4-5; 15:28; 7:5; Galatians 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:9; Philippians 1:11, 22; 4:17; Colossians 1:6, 10; 2 Timothy 2:6; Hebrews 12:11; 13:15; James 3:17-18; Jude 12)</p>
<p>Plants that God has not planted will be uprooted (Matthew 15:13; cp. Isaiah 60:21;</p>

<p>The judicial processes serve to illustrate how inevitable consequences are if we do not</p>
<p>take care of the problem when it comes along (Matthew 5:23-26; Luke 12:57-59).</p>
<p>Fines and imprisonment represent consequences.</p>
<p>Pottery</p>
<p>Isaiah 45:9 + Jeremiah 18:1-8ff. &lt; Romans 9:19-23; 2 Timothy 2:20-21</p>

<p>Publican</p>

<p>Paul calls it “robbery” to take support from other churches in ministering elsewhere</p>

<p>Christ’s being equal with God was not robbery (Philippians 2:6).</p>

<p>Salt</p>
<p>Matthew 5:13; Mark 9:49</p>
<p>If salt loses its saltiness, there is nothing else you can use to make it salty again.</p>
<p>If salt loses its saltiness, it is useless except perhaps as pavement for a path.</p>
<p>(Salt seasons food; it is what makes food/life tasty/meaningful; it improves the</p>
<p>flavor.)</p>
<p>(Salt is made up of two chemicals that separately are deadly poisons. When we dogmatically overemphasize one part of the faith, we make Christianity fatal.)</p>
<p>(Salt can be used to put out fires; in former times when a chimney would get on fire from wood burning, etc., a person would go up on the roof and pour salt down the chimney to put out the fire.)</p>
<p>(Salt can be used as a preservative; it prevents or retards putrefaction.)</p>
<p>(Salt sterilizes and purifies; no gargle is better than salt-water gargle.)</p>
<p>(Salt is a healing agent.)</p>
<p>(Salt is essential to life; it keeps people alive and healthy.)</p>
<p>(Salt has the ability to permeate.)</p>
<p>(Salt is not affected by age, moisture, temperature, or time; it has no expiration</p>
<p>date.)</p>
<p>(Salt can lose its flavor only by being polluted or diluted.)</p>
<p>(Salt creates thirst and hunger. I bet you can’t eat just one.)</p>
<p>(Salt melts ice.); when people are cold or the love of many grows cold, Christians</p>
<p>have the responsibility of “melting” that insensitivity.</p>
<p>(Not a lot of salt is needed to do its work.)</p>
<p>(Salt can be used in heavy water solution to unplug drains.)</p>
<p>(In water solution or vaporized salt-water solution salt can be used as a nasal</p>
<p>decongestant.)</p>
<p>Having salt in yourself becomes a picture for internal source of flavoring and worth/meaning vs. being like food that gets its flavoring from something else (Matthew 9:50).</p>
<p>Being the salt of the world implies that if Christians lose their saltiness, there is no way to make them salty because there is no other source of saltiness than salt itself.</p>
<p>Salvation</p>
<p>An image for reconciliation to God</p>
<p>Samaritan</p>
<p>A person outside the group (cp. Gentile, publican)</p>
<p>Sandals</p>
<p>John the Baptist compared the superiority of Messiah over himself to his own unworthiness to undo Messiah’s sandal straps (Mark 1:7 = Luke 3:16 = John 1:27)* or carry his sandals (Matthew 3:11).</p>
<p>Satan (NT)</p>
<p>In general, Satan stands for the whole system of things alternative to Christ (Luke</p>
<p>10:18; Matthew 12:26 = Mark 3:23, 26 = Luke 11:18; Acts 26:16).</p>
<p>Jesus called Peter “Satan” when he did as Satan did (Matthew 16:23 = Mark 8:3).</p>
<p>Satan entering into someone represents that person’s deciding to do something that corresponds with Satan’s will (John 13:27 = Luke 22:3; Acts 5:3); cp. the “devil” entering the heart of someone (John 13:2).</p>
<p>Excommunicating someone from the fellowship is called “delivering to Satan”		(1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Timothy 1:20).</p>
<p>Turning away from Christ is called “turning to Satan” (1 Timothy 5:15).</p>
<p>What works against Christ is said to be Satan’s working against Christ (1 Peter 2:18;</p>
<p>2 Peter 2:9).</p>
<p>The identity alternate to Christ (Revelation 2:9, 132, 24; 3:9).</p>
<p>Evil experiences/operations are called Satan’s operation (2 Corinthians 2:11;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 7:5; Luke 13:16).</p>
<p>(Satan is put directly for his indirect operations.)</p>

<p>Seafaring imagery</p>
<p>Shipwreck concerning the faith (1 Timothy 1:19)</p>
<p>Christ is our anchor for the soul (Hebrews 6:19).</p>
<p>The tongue is like the rudder of a ship, which is very small compared to a ship in</p>
<p>storm-driven seas; yet it is used to direct the ship (cp. bridle, spark; James 3:4).</p>
<p>Wild waves of the sea that foam up shame (Jude13)</p>
<p>Seal</p>
<p>The converts in Corinth are the seal of Paul’s apostleship. (2 Corinthians 9:2; see also</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:2, where they are called Paul’s “epistle.”)</p>
<p>Represents a statement of approval (John 3:33)</p>
<p>Seed</p>
<p>Mustard seed especially emphasizes the small beginning that leads to a large result</p>
<p>(Matthew 13:312 = Mark 4:30-32 = Luke 13:18-19; Matthew 17:20 = Luke 17:6).</p>
<p>(Serpents; see “Vipers.”)</p>
<p>Servant</p>
<p>See also “slave.”</p>
<p>Is “Servant of the Lord” an analogy to Jesus or a prediction of Jesus (cp. Hagar-Sarah,</p>
<p>First-Second Adam, Jonah, temple, etc.)?</p>
<p>Shepherd/pastor-sheep</p>
<p>Lambs among wolves represents innocent/harmless people among dangerous ones</p>
<p>(Luke 10:3; Matthew 10:16).</p>
<p>A label for the leadership/eldership/apostleship in the church (John 21:15-17; 20:28-29;</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11; Acts 20:28-30).</p>
<p>Three roles come off the shepherd image</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Feeding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protecting (Acts 20:29)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Leaders teaching is like shepherds feeding sheep (John 21:15-17).</p>
<p>Christ is the Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36; Acts 8:32; 1 Peter 1:19, no spot or blemish).</p>
<p>Flock/sheep as a label for the followers of Jesus (Luke 12:32)</p>
<p>Sheep are highly dependent animals; they have no way to defend themselves against predators.</p>
<p>If sheep get lost, the shepherd has the responsibility of going after them; ministers have a responsibility for taking the initiative in going after Christians who stray from the group/flock.</p>
<p>Sheep will not follow someone besides their own shepherd; they recognize his voice over other voices (John 10:5, 14; cp. 16, 27).</p>
<p>“I am a good shepherd” (John 10:7-18); Christ is the chief shepherd (1 Peter 5:4; cp.</p>
<p>Psalm 23).</p>
<p>A shepherd is different from a thief:</p>
<p>He goes in at the door rather than climb in some other way (John 10:1).</p>
<p>A shepherd is different from a hireling:</p>
<p>He does not run when he sees wolf coming, but protects the flock—he lays</p>
<p>down his life in so doing (John 10:11b-13).</p>
<p>He cares for the sheep (John 10:13; 21:15-17).</p>
<p>He knows his sheep; even though sheep look a lot alike, the person that is</p>
<p>around them all the time can tell them apart (John 10:14).</p>
<p>A shepherd is different from a wolf.</p>
<p>He does not scatter them (John 10:12).</p>
<p>He does not snatch them to harm them (John 10:12).</p>
<p>There are other sheep that Jesus wants to bring into one flock (John 10:16).</p>
<p>The one who feeds a flock drinks the milk from the flock, illustrating the idea that those</p>
<p>who minister to the church are supported by the believers (2 Corinthians 9:7c).</p>
<p>False shepherds use the flock to feed themselves, comparable to leaders that see the</p>
<p>church as a place to benefit themselves (Jude 12).</p>
<p>As killing the shepherd scatters the sheep, so killing Jesus disperses his disciples</p>
<p>(Matthew 26:31 = Mark 14:27 &lt; Zechariah 13:7; John 16:32).</p>
<p>Going out and looking for the lost minority while leaving the majority in safety represents the idea that there is greater joy over conversion than continued goodness (Luke 15:3-7 = Matthew 18:12-14).</p>
<p>Disoriented, confused people are like sheep without a shepherd (Matthew 9:36; Mark</p>
<p>6:34; Numbers 27:17; Ezekiel 34:5; Zachariah 10:2; 1 Kings 22:17).</p>
<p>Christ was not sent to the Gentiles in his first coming, but only to the lost sheep of the</p>
<p>house of Israel (Matthew 15:24; 10:5-6).</p>
<p>Sickness</p>
<p>Spiritually weak (1 Corinthians 11:30)</p>
<p>*Sifting</p>
<p>A picture for putting someone through trials (Luke 22:31; Amos 9:9; Isaiah 30:28)</p>
<p>Sight/blindness</p>
<p>Physical blindness is compared to spiritual blindness (John 9:35-41; note context of the</p>
<p>healing of the man born blind). (“To see” means “to understand.”)</p>
<p>Being cross-eyed is like trying to operate by two frames of reference (Matthew 6:22-</p>
<p>23).</p>
<p>Being in the dark so long that they cannot see anymore (1 John 2:11)</p>
<p>Blind leading the blind are like teachers that do not know what they are talking about</p>
<p>(Matthew 15:14; Luke 6:39).</p>
<p>(See also “Eyes.”)</p>
<p>Sky (See also “Weather.”)</p>
<p>Slave/slavery</p>
<p>Irresponsible slaves were scourged in proportion to their irresponsibility (Luke 12:46-</p>
<p>48).</p>
<p>Romans 1:1; 2 Corinthians 4:5; Philippians 1:1; 2 Timothy 2:24; Titus 1:1</p>
<p>Parable of the Unmerciful Servant (Matthew 18:23-25)</p>
<p>A follower of Jesus Christ turns over everything to the master.</p>
<p>A slave cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13).</p>
<p>Judaizers were, so to speak, making slaves out of the Gentiles (Galatians 2:4).</p>
<p>Being under law is like being in slavery (Galatians 4:3, 9; 5:1).</p>
<p>Aggressive, pushy, overbearing, presumptuous people make slaves out of other people</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 11:10).</p>
<p>John the Baptist did not consider himself worthy to carry Jesus’ shoes (Matthew 3:11).</p>
<p>John the Baptist did not consider himself worthy to untie Jesus’ sandals for him (Luke</p>
<p>3:16; John 1:27).</p>
<p>Someone addicted to sin or in the sin state is pictured as a slave to sin (John 8:32-36).</p>
<p>A servant who is faithful while his master is not around is like a disciple of Jesus faithful at the time of Christ’s unpredictable return (Matthew 24:42-51 = Luke 12:41-48).</p>
<p>(See also “Stewards.”)</p>
<p>A steward to be relieved of his stewardship might make preparations for the future as</p>
<p>the unrighteous steward did (Luke 16:1-13).</p>
<p>A slave’s work is first for the master and then for himself (Luke 17:7-10).</p>
<p>A slave can never do enough; he has to take the attitude that he is unprofitable no</p>
<p>matter what (Luke 17:7-10).</p>
<p>What a slave is given to work with does not belong to him, but to his master and what</p>
<p>he produces more also belongs to the master (Luke 19:11-27). (cp. “Stewards”)</p>
<p>Servants are supposed to be responsible while the master is gone (Luke 19:11-27; 20:9-</p>
<p>18).</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>(See essay on “Soul-Sleeping.”)</p>
<p>As a picture for death (1 Kings 2:10; Daniel 12:2; Matthew 27:52; [Mark 5:39?]; Mark 13:33-37; John 11:11-14; Acts 7:60; 13:36; 1 Corinthians 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Peter 4:13-18; 2 Peter 3:4)</p>
<p>There is no movement; the person is not accomplishing anything—he is “resting.”</p>
<p>The eyes are shut.</p>
<p>The person is in a prone position.</p>
<p>The person is unaware of what is going on around him.</p>
<p>Lost condition(?): 1 Corinthians 11:30 (“and not a few are asleep”)</p>
<p>(Snakes; see “Vipers.”)</p>
<p>Sojourners</p>
<p>A picture of the temporary and essentially foreign nature of the world’s environment for</p>
<p>Christian people (1 Peter 2:11)</p>
<p>(See also “Diaspora/Dispersion.”)</p>
<p>(Soldier; see “Warfare Imagery.”)</p>
<p>Solomon</p>
<p>Jesus is greater than Solomon, whom the Queen of Sheba/the South came to see (Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31). Jesus uses this example along with that of Naaman and the widow of Sarepta/Zarephath to illustrate God’s concern for more than just the Jews.</p>
<p>Sowing-reaping/seed</p>
<p>The law of harvest: you reap what you sow (Galatians 6:7-8; cp. Matthew 7:16-20;</p>
<p>12:33; 7:43-44; Luke 6:43-45; James 3:12).</p>
<p>Harvesting is like converting people (Luke 10:2).</p>
<p>“Preaching the Word” is like sowing seed and “hearing it and taking it to heart” is like</p>
<p>having 	it planted in you (James 1:21).</p>
<p>The seed and its plant is compared to resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:35-38).</p>
<p>The seed itself has to cease existing before the plant can become.</p>
<p>The thing sown differs from what comes from it.</p>
<p>A seed has to “die” to produce the plant.</p>
<p>A person has to give up autonomous identity in order to amount to anything for</p>
<p>God: John 12:24-25.</p>
<p>Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:3-23; Mark 4:3-20)</p>
<p>Different kinds of soil represent different degrees of readiness to accept the word and different levels of productivity from it. Shallow (rocky) soil represents short-lived enthusiasm for the gospel, but it does not last because the wheat does not have enough root to keep it from being scorched by the hot sun. Hard soil represents the disinterested. Birds represent other influences that remove the word from the situation. Thorny soil represents good potential that is choked out by distracting interests. Good soil produces different amounts.</p>
<p>Parable of the Tares</p>
<p>Weed seeds (or briars) grow also among the blades of wheat because they have been planted in the soil by contrary influences in the field (enemies of the landowner).</p>
<p>Good and evil people grow together until the harvest, which occurs at the end.</p>
<p>Good and evil are not separated during the growing season because their intertwined roots mean that any effort to extract the weeds now would end up destroying some of the wheat in the process.</p>
<p>The field represents the world.</p>
<p>Angels are the reapers.</p>
<p>The good seed are sons of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The bad seed are sons of the evil one.</p>
<p>The enemy is the devil.</p>
<p>The harvest is the end of the world.</p>
<p>The tares are gathered up at the end and burned (Matthew 13:40-42).</p>
<p>Parable of Sowing-Reaping (Mark 4:26-28)</p>
<p>Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31-32; Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)</p>
<p>From something very small comes something comparatively large.</p>
<p>Firstfruits (Romans 11:16; 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:15)</p>
<p>(Serves as a picture for many situations where one example will be followed by many more and serve as the epitome for the rest) (Cp. “firstborn.”)</p>
<ol>
<li>Christian converts are firstfruits from among people (James 1:18).</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, the household of Stephanus was the firstfruits of Achaia</p>
<p>(1 Corinthians 16:15), and Epaenetus was the firstfruits of Asia (Romans 16:5).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>“Firstfruits” conveys a sense of specialness and especially valued (Revelation 14:4) speaks of the saved as firstfruits without implying necessarily that the rest will also be saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20, 23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spirit is the firstfruits of salvation in anticipation of the redemption of the body at the resurrection (Romans 5:23; cp. the Holy Spirit as an “earnest” in Ephesians 1:14).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The one who sows eats some of the produce from the harvest, illustrating supporting those who minister to the believers (2 Corinthians 9:10-11ff.). Not muzzling the ox while threshing represents living on the basis of your work.</p>
<p>The one who threshes eats some of what he produces, illustrating supporting those</p>
<p>who minister to the believers (2 Corinthians 9:10-11ff.).</p>
<p>Various ones contribute different activities to the planting-reaping process.</p>
<p>Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the increase (1 Corinthians 3:6-8).</p>
<p>God is the most important because he gives the increase (1 Corinthians 3:7).</p>
<p>People are paid according to their labor (1 Corinthians 3:8).</p>
<p>Jesus was sending his apostles to reap that on which they had not bestowed any</p>
<p>labor (John 4:38).</p>
<p>“White unto harvest” symbolizes readiness to hear the gospel (John 4:35).</p>
<p>Wages are paid to those who labor in the harvest. (Harvesting is not just to protect the</p>
<p>grain or get God’s work done)</p>
<p>Land that grows briars and thistles instead of the crops it was sown to bear will be burned off, symbolizing the trials, sufferings, punishments that come to those disobedient to the message they have received (Hebrews 6:7-8).</p>
<p>Threshing with oxen on a threshing floor</p>
<p>The chaff represents worthless material that is unstable (the wind can be used to</p>
<p>blow it away); winnowing (Luke 3:17 = Matthew 3:12).</p>
<p>Large harvest needs lots of laborers; many people to be converted need many workers</p>
<p>in the kingdom and there are so few of them (Matthew 9:37-38).</p>
<p>See also “Plant Imagery” and “Trees.”</p>
<p>Mustard-seed parable (Luke 13:18-19 = Matthew 13:31-32 = Mark 4:30-32). The</p>
<p>mustard seed illustrates a large consequence from a small cause.</p>
<p>(Speck; see “Mote.”)</p>
<p>Stars</p>
<p>Wandering stars (Jude 13)</p>
<p>Stone</p>
<p>A stone’s throw becomes a loose measure of distance (Luke 22:41).</p>
<p>(See also “Building Figures.”)</p>
<p>Stumbling</p>
<p>Means to be/cause a problem (Matthew 5:29; 11:6; 13:21, 57; 24:10; 26:31; Mark 6:3;</p>
<p>John 6:61; 16:1)</p>
<p>Sinning is like stumbling; it “trips you up” (James 2:10).</p>
<p>Stumbling represents a minor incident that brings up a problem for someone. The angels would take care of the Messiah to the extent that they would catch him in such cases so he would not fall (Psalm 91:12 &lt; Luke 4:11 = Matthew 4:6).</p>
<p>Stumbling can mean to get someone confused or cause them to doubt and perhaps act</p>
<p>accordingly (John 16:1).</p>
<p>Stumbling can contrast with falling down completely (Romans 11:11).</p>
<p>Stumbling block</p>
<p>Psalm 59:22; Isaiah 28:16; John 11:9-10; Romans 9:32-33; 11:9, 11; 14:13, 21; 1 Corinthians 1:23; 8:9, 13; 10:32; Galatians 5:11; 1 Peter 2:6, 8; Jude 24; Revelation 2:14</p>
<p>Something that throws people “off the track”</p>
<p>Messiah proved to be a stumbling block to the Jews (Isaiah 8:14; Romans 9:32-33;</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:8; cp. Jeremiah 6:21).</p>
<p>Suffering</p>
<p>**Weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke</p>
<p>13:28)</p>
<p>Woman in travail</p>
<p>Gnawing their tongues for pain (Revelation 16:10)</p>
<p>Sword</p>
<p>Represents turmoil and division (Matthew10:34)</p>
<p>Tabernacle/temple</p>
<p>The veil in the tabernacle signified that the way into the true Holy of Holies was not yet</p>
<p>made known while the first tabernacle was still standing (Hebrews 9:6-10).</p>
<p>The wall between the Court of the Men of Israel and the Court of the Gentiles</p>
<p>represents a separation that has been torn down in Christ (Ephesians 2:14).</p>
<p>Our bodies are tabernacles of the self (1 Corinthians 5:1; 2 Peter 1:13-14).</p>
<p>Our bodies are tabernacles of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19; John 2:19-22; Mark</p>
<p>14:58).</p>
<p>The body of Jesus is a functional equivalent for the Jerusalem temple (John 2:19-22).</p>
<p>Tearing it down and rebuilding it became an image for getting rid of the old system and</p>
<p>replacing it with a new one.</p>
<p>Changing over from the Old Covenant to the New is pictured as destroying the temple (and rebuilding it in three days; Matthew 26:61 = Mark 14:58; Matthew 27:40 = Mark 15:29; John 2:19-22; Acts 6:14).</p>
<p>*Taste</p>
<p>Acute experience</p>
<p>taste of death (Matthew 16:28; Mark 9:1; Luke 9:27; John 8:52; Hebrews 2:9)</p>
<p>benefits of salvation (Hebrews 6:4-5; 1 Peter 2:3)</p>
<p>Temperature imagery</p>
<p>Lukewarmness represents unsavory taste (Revelation 3:15-16).</p>
<p>Coldness is a loss of a characteristic like love (Matthew 24:12).</p>
<p>(Testament; see “Covenant.”)</p>

<p>“Whitewashed tombs” represent outer appearance of goodness with inner evil.</p>
<p>“Hidden tombs” represent hidden sources of defilement (Luke 11:44).</p>
<p>Touch</p>
<p>A euphemism for sexual intercourse (1 Corinthians 7:1)</p>

<p>The beginning of good things is often in pain.</p>
<p>The subsequent joy overshadows the previous pain.</p>
<p>Unescapable coming things</p>
<p>Travel imagery</p>
<p>Gates (Matthew 7:13-14)</p>
<p>Wide and narrow path (Matthew 7:13-14)</p>
<p>Walking* as an image for living life, conducting oneself (Mark 7:15; Luke 1:6; John 6:66; 8:12; 11:9-10; 12:35; Acts 9:31; 14:16; 21:21, 24; Romans 4:12; 6:4; 8:1, 6; 13:13; 14:15; 1 Corinthians 3:3; 7:17; 2 Corinthians 4:2; 5:7; 10:2-3; 12:18; Galatians 2:14; 5:6, 25; 6:16; Ephesians 2:2, 10; 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15; Philippians 3:16-18; Colossians 1:10; 2:6; 3:7; 4:5; 1 Peter 2:12; 4:1, 12; 2 Peter 3:6, 11; 1 Peter 4:3; 2 Peter 2:10; 3:3; 1 John 1:6-7; 2:6, 11; 2 John 4, 62; 3 John 3-4; Jude 16, 18)</p>
<p>Leading</p>
<p>Following</p>
<p>Treading</p>
<p>“To be tread on” or “trodden down” means “to be run over” (Luke 21:24; Revelation</p>
<p>11:2).</p>
<p>Treasure</p>
<p>A householder brings out of his treasure things new and old (Matthew 13:51-52).</p>
<p>Bringing things out of one’s treasure is like the mouth speaking out of the things stored</p>
<p>in the heart (Matthew 12:35).</p>
<p>The gospel is a treasure, as Paul says, carried in clay pots, God’s messengers (2</p>
<p>Corinthians 4:7).</p>
<p>The contrast between the value of the contents and the value of the containers</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 4:7)</p>
<p>The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price (Matthew 13:45-46)</p>
<p>A person ought to sell everything lesser that he has in order to get this one treasure.</p>
<p>The Parable of the Treasure in a Field (Matthew 13:44)</p>
<p>“Laying up treasure” means putting your concerns in something or relying on something</p>
<p>(Matthew 6:19-21; Luke 12:33-34; 18:22).</p>
<p>Earthly treasure deteriorates/rusts; thieves steal it; moths ruin it; heavenly treasure</p>
<p>does not have these weaknesses.</p>
<p>Where your treasure is your heart will also be; that is, where you put what you consider important (mental activity) is where your affections will be centered (emotions; Matthew 6: ?; Luke 12:34).</p>
<p>Tree</p>
<p>Being under one’s fig tree or eating from one’s fig tree refers to a situation of stability,</p>
<p>peace (Micah 4:4; 1 Kings 4:25; Zechariah 3:10; 2 Kings 18:31; Isaiah 36:16).</p>
<p>Romans 11:16b-24: The Olive Tree</p>
<p>Wild branches have been grafted into the Abrahamic olive tree.</p>
<p>If the branches wild or natural do not bear fruit, they will be trimmed out of the tree.</p>
<p>Gentiles are to see themselves as brought into the Abrahamic tree because its root</p>
<p>nourishes the branches; the branches do not nourish the root.</p>
<p>Trees that do not bear fruit are cut down and thrown into the fire (Matthew 3:10 = Luke</p>
<p>3:9).</p>
<p>Fruitless trees (Jude 12), blown over by the wind and uprooted, represent false leaders.</p>
<p>The measure of a good or bad fruit tree is only whether it has good or bad fruit, not whether it is pretty (as a decorative tree might be, or goodness on the basis of Abraham’s origin; Matthew 7:17-18 = Luke 6:45; 12:33 = Luke 6:43-44, particularly). It is not what they look like or sound like; those are things that “don’t count.”</p>
<p>The cursing of the fig tree was evidently an object lesson about fruitlessness despite a “show” of fruitfulness (by putting out leaves; Matthew 21:18-20 = Mark 11:12-14, 20-21).</p>
<p>A fig tree puts out leaves before summer; hence, its leaves become a way of predicting</p>
<p>the future—the near future at least (Mark 13:28-30; Matthew 24:32; Luke 21:30).</p>
<p>As a fig tree loses its fruit in a storm, so will the elements be moved in the end times</p>
<p>(Revelation 6:13; cp. Isaiah 34:4).</p>
<p>Laying an ax at the foot of a tree represents impending destruction.</p>
<p>Green tree represents a time of relative prosperity (vs. dry? Luke 23:31)</p>

<p>Evil behavior (Romans 1:24; 6:19)</p>
<p>Parable of Laborers in a Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16)</p>
<p>Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen (Matthew 21:33-46; Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)</p>
<p>The one that plants a vineyard eats from the fruit of it (1 Corinthians 9:7b, 8-10ff.).</p>
<p>Patience is needed for the result (conclusion of the matter) even as a husbandman has to</p>
<p>wait a long time for the harvest (James 5:7)</p>
<p>Parable of the Two Sons (Matthew 21:28-32)</p>
<p>Workers in a vineyard complement each other’s work of ministry. They work together</p>
<p>for the same project; hence, a comment against division.</p>
<p>God is the most prominent member in this effort; the ministers take no credit for the</p>
<p>results any more than a gardener causes plants to grow.</p>
<p>Vipers</p>
<p>Represent wisdom (Matthew 10:16)</p>
<p>(See also “Sons/Offspring of Vipers” and “Family Relations Imagery.”)</p>
<p>Vultures</p>
<p>As they are gathered around a carcass, so will the center of attention be at Christ’s</p>
<p>coming (Matthew 24:28).</p>
<p>Wages</p>
<p>Wages stand for the consequences of actions.</p>
<p>“The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23; cp. 2 Peter 2:15).</p>
<p>Support for ministry is called “wages” (2 Corinthians 11:8).</p>
<p>John 4:36</p>
<p>Walk</p>
<p>Conduct of life. Walking is something that a person continuously does; especially would this have been the case in the ancient world. Furthermore, walking is an image that corresponds with way or path. Way is a typical picture for a pattern of belief or living. Walking the way refers then to the active conduct of life according to such a pattern.</p>
<p>Warfare imagery</p>
<p>*War of words (2 Timothy 2:14 [λογομαχέω, logomacheō, a once-used word];</p>
<p>1 Timothy 6:4 [λογομαχία, a once-used word])</p>
<p>Armor (Ephesians 6:10-20; 1 Peter 5:8 &lt; Wisdom 5:17ff.).</p>
<p>Soldier (2 Timothy 2:3-4)</p>
<p>Soldiers do not get entangled in the affairs of public life (2 Timothy 2:4).</p>
<p>Soldiers do not serve at their own expense (2 Corinthians 9:7a).</p>
<p>Being captured by Satan (2 Timothy 2:26; 3:6)</p>
<p>Lording it over people—or, bringing them under law—is like capturing them</p>
<p>(2 Corinthians 11:10).</p>
<p>Considering ahead of time whether you have the strength to wage this war (Luke 14:31-</p>
<ol start="32">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Water</p>
<p>John 4:10-15</p>
<p>Water as a symbol for the word</p>
<p>a) a “life-giving” message</p>
<p>b) quenches thirst</p>
<p>Water as a symbol for the Holy Spirit (John 7:38-39)</p>
<p>Water as a symbol for cleansing/purification</p>
<p>Water as a symbol for life-giving resource</p>
<p>Water as a symbol for vast numbers of people (Revelation)</p>
<p>Way/Road</p>
<p>A way/road represents a way of life.</p>
<p>*The Way became a term for early Christianity: Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22</p>
<p>Preparing the road for someone means getting ready for him (Malachi 3:1; Isaiah 40:3-</p>
<p>5 &lt; Matthew 3:3 = Mark 1:2-3 = Luke 3:4-6 = John 1:23).</p>
<p>Weather</p>
<p>We use the way the sky looks as a way of predicting the weather; so also we use the</p>
<p>way things are going as a way to project the future (Matthew 16:2-4; Luke 12:54-56).</p>
<p>Boanerges: Jesus nicknamed James and John “Sons of Thunder” because of their</p>
<p>temperament (? Mark 3:16; cp. Luke 9:54; Mark 9:38).</p>
<p>Weddings</p>
<p>Parable of the Ten Virgins</p>
<p>The sons of the bridegroom cannot be sad (hence, fast) while the bridegroom is around</p>
<p>(Matthew 9:14-16 = Mark 2:18-20 = Luke 5:33-35).</p>
<p>Parable of the Marriage Feast and the Slighted Invitation (Matthew 22:2-14; Luke</p>
<p>14:16-24)</p>
<p>Jesus had the bride, not John because the latter was not the Messiah (John 3:29).</p>
<p>John called himself a friend of the Bridegroom/Jesus (John 3:29) to indicate his</p>
<p>secondary position and his joy at seeing the other person’s importance.</p>
<p>*Weeping and gnashing of teeth</p>
<p>As a standard phrase it stands for (extreme) suffering (Matthew 24:51; 8:12; 13:42, 50;</p>
<p>22:13; 25:30; Luke 13:28).</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Sifting someone like wheat means putting him through hard experiences (Luke 22:31;</p>
<p>Amos 9:9; Isaiah 30:28).</p>
<p>Widow of Zarephath/Sarepta</p>
<p>In Luke 4:26 Jesus uses the help Elijah gave to this widow during the 3½ years of drought as a picture of God’s concern for non-Jews. (See also “Jonah,” “Solomon,” “Naaman.”).</p>
<p>*Wind</p>
<p>Represents the trials and tests of life (Matthew 7:25, 27; cp. James 3:4?)</p>
<p>Represents the Spirit (John 3)</p>
<p>Winds blowing in different directions represent contrary influences on people that</p>
<p>confuse them (Ephesians 4:14).</p>
<p>Wind on the threshing floor is used to blow the chaff—profitless, unstable material—</p>
<p>out of the seed.</p>
<p>“The four winds” refers to “all directions” (Matthew 24:31 = Mark 13:27; Revelation</p>
<p>7:1; Daniel 7:2; Zechariah 2:6).</p>
<p>Wine</p>
<p>A person that has old wine does not want to go to new, which is comparable to observing that a person who experiences the better does not want to go back to the lesser (Luke 5:39).</p>
<p>Wineskins</p>
<p>You do not put new wine into old wineskins as compared to trying to put certain contents into containers unnatural to hold those contents (Matthew 9:12 = Mark 2:22 = Luke 5:37-38).</p>
<p>Compare re-creation, born-again vs. circumcision.</p>
<p>(Winnowing; see “Sowing-Reaping/Harvesting-Seed.”)</p>
<p>Womb</p>
<p>Opening the womb means being the firstborn (Luke 2:23).</p>
<p>Source</p>
<p>Word</p>
<p>Christ is called the word of God because he declared him (John 1:18; John 1:1, 14).</p>
<p>World</p>
<p>The material realm in contrast to heaven</p>
<p>The typical evil society of people (John 15:18-19; 16:8)</p>
<p>Political/material</p>
<p>The (a) world has people as its content, and (b) people are generally evil; hence, the</p>
<p>connection between the creation and evil.</p>
<p>Yeast (See “Leaven.”)</p>
<p>*Yoke</p>
<p>Fellow workers are yoke fellows (Philippians 4:3).</p>
<p>Christians should not yoke themselves together with unbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14).</p>
<p>Accepting Christ’s way of living is like taking an easy yoke on yourself (Matthew</p>
<p>11:29-30).</p>
<p>Putting circumcision and obedience to the law of Moses on Gentiles is like putting too</p>
<p>big a yoke on them that they cannot handle (Acts 15:10; Galatians 5:1).</p>
<p>Being a slave is like being under a yoke (1Timothy 6:1).</p>
<p>Part II: The Ideas Represented by Images</p>
<p>Agency</p>
<p>The arm of God</p>
<p>The finger of God (Luke 11:20; Exodus 8:19)</p>
<p>The hand of God</p>
<p>Invisible agency like what causes the wind to blow (John 3:8)</p>
<p>Abrogating the law</p>
<p>Nailing it to the cross</p>
<p>Tearing down the temple and rebuilding a temple in its place</p>
<p>Dying to get out from under Mosaism (death-resurrection)</p>
<p>Animal imagery</p>
<p>Dove: harmlessness</p>
<p>Fox: slyness (Luke 13:32)</p>
<p>Lion: strength, destruction</p>
<p>Scorpion: surprising harm/pain</p>
<p>Sheep: dependency</p>
