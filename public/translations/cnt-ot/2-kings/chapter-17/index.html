<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the twelfth year of Ahaz, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 9 years. 2He did evil, but not as bad as the previous kings of Israel. 3Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, attacked him, and he had to pay tribute to Assyria. 4But the king of Assyria discovered a plot he was laying. He&rsquo;d sent ambassadors to So, king of Egypt, and withheld the annual tribute to Assyria; so Shalmaneser shut him up bound in prison. 5Then he invaded the whole country and went up to Samaria and laid siege to it for 3 years. 6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria conquered the city and took Israel into exile in Assyria. He settled them in Halah and Habor on the Gozan River and in towns of the Medes.  	2 Kg 17:1-6</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> That happened because they sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from Egypt from under Pharaoh. They&rsquo;d feared other gods, 8followed the customs of the nations the LORD had originally driven out, and the customs Israel&rsquo;s kings had brought in. 9Israel secretly did what wasn&rsquo;t right: 10they put sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They served idols the LORD told them not to serve, 13even though he warned Israel and Judah through his prophets and seers, &ldquo;Turn from your sins and keep my commandments, my statutes—the whole Law I&rsquo;ve commanded your ancestors through the prophets.&rdquo; 14But they ignored him. They stiffened their necks like the ancestors who didn&rsquo;t believe in the LORD. 15They rejected the statutes and the covenant he made with their ancestors and dismissed his warnings. They became vain and followed the nations around them that he commanded them not to be like.	2 Kg 17:7-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They made molten images, that is, two calves and an Asherah pole. They worshiped the host of heaven and served Baal. 17They burned their sons and daughters as offerings, and practiced fortunetelling and sorcery. They provoked the LORD by selling themselves to sinning. 18He was angry with them and removed them away from him. None were left except the tribe of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Judah didn&rsquo;t keep his commandments either, but followed the customs Israel brought in. 20The LORD rejected Israel&rsquo;s descendants, oppressed them, and delivered them to plunderers till he&rsquo;d thrown them out. 21When he&rsquo;d torn Israel away from David&rsquo;s dynasty, they made JeroboamI son of Nebat king. He drove them away from the LORD and got them to commit a great sin. 22Israel continued to follow in his sins 23till the LORD removed Israel away from him. Israel has been in exile in Assyria ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the towns in Samaria in place of the Israelites. 25When they first started living there, they didn&rsquo;t respect the LORD. He sent lions among them and killed some of them. 26They spoke to the king of Assyria, &ldquo;The nations you exiled into the towns in Samaria don&rsquo;t know the Law of the god of the land. He has sent lions among them to kill them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then the king commanded, &ldquo;Bring one of the priests you exiled, and have him live there and teach them the Law of the god of the land.&rdquo; 	2 Kg 17:16-27</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> One of the priests they&rsquo;d exiled came and lived at Bethel and taught them how to respect the LORD. 29But every nation in the towns where they lived still made gods of their own and put them at the pagan shrines the people of Samaria had made. 30The people from Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima, 31the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech their gods. 32They also feared the LORD and appointed priests for the high places, who acted for them in the shrines there. 33They feared the LORD and served their own gods like they did where they came from.                                                                          	2 Kg 17:18-33</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> They&rsquo;ve kept the earlier customs ever since. They don&rsquo;t respect the LORD or follow his statutes, ordinances, Law, or commandments to Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, that he named Israel 35and made a covenant with, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear other gods, bow to them, serve them, sacrifice to them. 36Fear the LORD that brought you out of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Bow to him and sacrifice to him. 37Observe forever the statutes, ordinances, Law, and commandment he wrote for you. [38] 39Fear the LORD your God, and he&rsquo;ll deliver you from your enemies.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> They didn&rsquo;t listen; 41while they feared the LORD, they also served their idols. Their children and grandchildren still do that.       	2 Kg 17:34-41</span></p>
