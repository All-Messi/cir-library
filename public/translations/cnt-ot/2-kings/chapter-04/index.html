When he comes, he can turn in there.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When the boy was growing up, he went out to his father and the harvest crew one day, 19and told him, &ldquo;My head hurts! my head hurts!&rdquo; He told his servant, &ldquo;Carry him to his mother.&rdquo; 20When he got him to her, the boy sat on her lap till noon and died. 21She went up and laid him on the man of God&rsquo;s bed, shut the door, and went out. 22She called her husband, &ldquo;Send me a servant and a donkey so I can go quick to the man of God and back.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo; 24She saddled the donkey and told her servant, &ldquo;Drive the animal! Don&rsquo;t slow down unless I tell you.&rdquo; 25She went to the man of God on Mount Carmel.

<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When she came to the man of God on the hill, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came to pull her away, but he said, &ldquo;Let her alone; she&rsquo;s upset. The LORD hasn&rsquo;t revealed it to me.&quot;</span></p>

Lay my staff on the boy&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; 30The mother swore, &ldquo;As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won&rsquo;t leave without you.&rdquo; He went along. 31Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy&rsquo;s face, but he didn&rsquo;t make a sound or respond. Gehazi went back and told him, &ldquo;The boy hasn&rsquo;t woken up.&rdquo; 32When Elisha went into the house, the boy was dead on the bed. 33He went in, shut the door, and prayed to the LORD. 34He went and lay down on the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands, and stretched out on him. The child&rsquo;s body got warm. 35He came back and paced back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched out on him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 36He called Gehazi, &ldquo;Call her.&rdquo; When she came in, he said, &ldquo;Pick up your boy.&rdquo; 37She fell at his feet and bowed to the floor. She picked up the boy and went out.  	2 Kg 4:28-37</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> When Elisha got back to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As men from the company of prophets were sitting with him, he told Gehazi, &ldquo;Put on a large pot and heat stew for them.&rdquo; 39One of them went out into the field to gather plants, found a wild vine, and gathered his lap full of gourds from it. He came and sliced them into the pot of stew. They didn&rsquo;t know what they were. 40They poured it out for the people to eat. After they&rsquo;d eaten a little, they cried out, &ldquo;Man of God, there&rsquo;s poison in this stew!&rdquo; 41He said, &ldquo;Bring some meal.&rdquo; He threw it into the pot and said, &ldquo;Pour it out for the people to eat.&rdquo;  Then there wasn&rsquo;t anything harmful in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> A man came from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of God bread in a sack from the first fruit of his harvest: 20 barley loaves made from fresh grain. Elisha said, &ldquo;Give them to the people to eat.&rdquo; 43His attendant said, &ldquo;What? How can I feed 100 men with this?&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;Give it to them; the LORD says they&rsquo;ll eat and have some left over.&rdquo; 44He set it in front of them, and they ate and had some left over.	 2 Kg 4:38-44</span></p>
