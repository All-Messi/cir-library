He told messengers to go ask Baal-zebub, Ekron&amp;rsquo;s god, if he&amp;rsquo;d recover. 3But the angel of the LORD told Elijah the Tishbite, &amp;ldquo;Go meet the king&amp;rsquo;s messengers and say, &amp;lsquo;Are you asking Baal-zebub because there&amp;rsquo;s no God in Israel?&amp;rsquo; 4So the LORD says you won&amp;rsquo;t get out of bed. You&amp;rsquo;ll die.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Will you help me fight Moab?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If we sit here, we&amp;rsquo;ll die.&amp;rdquo; 5As it was getting dark, they went to the Arameans&amp;rsquo; camp.

They told one another, &amp;ldquo;The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.&amp;rdquo; 7They ran for their lives in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses and donkeys, and the camp just like it was. 8When the lepers got to the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothes, and hid them. They went back into another tent and carried things away and hid them.         &#x9;2 Kg 7:1-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Gehazi said, &amp;ldquo;My lord the king, that&amp;rsquo;s the woman, and that&amp;rsquo;s her son!&amp;rdquo; 6When the king asked her, she told him about it.

The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. 5As soon as the kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 6He didn&amp;rsquo;t execute their sons, as the Law said that the LORD commanded Moses, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person&amp;rsquo;s sin.&amp;rdquo; 7He killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt, took Sela, and changed its name to Joktheel to this day.    &#x9;2 Kg 14:1-7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 3He did what was good like his father, 4but he didn&amp;rsquo;t take away the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. 5The LORD made him a leper till he died. He lived in a separate house while his son Jotham managed the palace and judged the people. 6The rest of the acts of Azariah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 7He died and they buried him in The City of David, and Jotham became king.&#x9;2 Kg 15:1-7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He&amp;rsquo;d sent ambassadors to So, king of Egypt, and withheld the annual tribute to Assyria; so Shalmaneser shut him up bound in prison. 5Then he invaded the whole country and went up to Samaria and laid siege to it for 3 years. 6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria conquered the city and took Israel into exile in Assyria. He settled them in Halah and Habor on the Gozan River and in towns of the Medes.  &#x9;2 Kg 17:1-6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His mother was Abi daughter of Zechariah. 3He did what was right like David did. 4He removed the high places, broke down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke in pieces the bronze &amp;ldquo;serpent&amp;rdquo; Moses had made, because the Israelites had been burning incense to it; they called it Nehushtan. 5He trusted in the LORD God of Israel so that no king in Judah was like him before or after. 6He held to the LORD and kept the commandments he gave Moses. 7The LORD was with him and he prospered wherever he went. He revolted against the king of Assyria 8and defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its territory, from outpost to fortified city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Babies have come to term, but there&amp;rsquo;s no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe the LORD your God will hear the message from the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria has sent to disparage the living God.

He worshiped and served the host of heaven, 4built altars in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s Temple where the LORD had said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll identify myself with Jerusalem.&amp;rdquo; 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s Temple. 6He burned his son as an offering, practiced witchcraft, used sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did so much evil and made the LORD angry. 7He put a carved image of Asherah in the Temple where the LORD told David and his son Solomon, &amp;ldquo;Forever I&amp;rsquo;ll identify with this Temple and with Jerusalem, which I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen from the tribes of Israel. 8I won&amp;rsquo;t make Israel wander anymore from the country I gave their ancestors—if only they&amp;rsquo;ll observe the whole Law that I&amp;rsquo;ve commanded them through Moses.&amp;rdquo; &#x9;2 Kg 21:1-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
