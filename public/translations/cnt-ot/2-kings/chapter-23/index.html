He read to them the covenant they&rsquo;d found. 3He stood by the pillar and made a covenant with the LORD to keep his commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all his heart and soul—to carry out the covenant written in that scroll. The people entered into the covenant.    2 Kg 23:1-3</span></p>

He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields by the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> But the LORD didn&rsquo;t withdraw his fierce anger against Judah that Manasseh had provoked, 27&quot;I&rsquo;ll remove Judah from me like I did Israel.
