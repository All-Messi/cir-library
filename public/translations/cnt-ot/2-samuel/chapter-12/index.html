<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the LORD sent Nathan to David to say, &ldquo;Two men were in a town, one rich, the other poor. 2The rich man had lots of flocks and herds, 3but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb that he&rsquo;d bought and raised. It grew up with him and his children; it used to eat his bread and drink from his cup and lie in his lap; it was like a daughter to him. 4A traveler came to the rich man, and he wasn&rsquo;t willing to take one of his own flock or herd to fix a meal for him. He took the poor man&rsquo;s lamb and fixed it.&rdquo; David was mad, and swore to Nathan, &ldquo;As sure as the LORD lives, that man deserves to die. 6He&rsquo;ll restore the lamb fourfold because he did that without mercy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Nathan told David, &ldquo;This is what the LORD God of Israel, says, &lsquo;I anointed you king, and delivered you from Saul. 8I gave you your master&rsquo;s family, his wives, and Israel and Judah. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, I would have doubled it. 9Why have you despised my message and done what I consider evil? You&rsquo;ve killed Uriah with the Ammonites&rsquo; sword and took his wife to be your wife. 10The sword will never leave your family because you&rsquo;ve despised me by taking her. 11I&rsquo;ll raise up evil against you in your own family. I&rsquo;ll take your wives in your presence and give them to your neighbor. He&rsquo;ll lie with them in broad daylight. 12You did it secretly, but I&rsquo;ll do it in front of all Israel right out in the sun.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sinned against the LORD.&rdquo; Nathan said, &ldquo;The LORD has set your sin aside; you won&rsquo;t die. 14But by doing this, you&rsquo;ve completely scorned him. The child will die.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Nathan left.	 2 Sam 12:7-15a The LORD struck the child, and it got sick. 16David asked God for the child and fasted. He went in and lay all night on the floor. 17The elders in his palace stood beside him, trying to get him up off the floor. But he wouldn&rsquo;t get up and didn&rsquo;t eat with them. 18The seventh day, the baby died. David&rsquo;s advisors were afraid to tell him. They said, &ldquo;While the child was still alive, we talked to him and he didn&rsquo;t listen. How can we tell him the child has died? He may harm himself.&rdquo; 19But when he saw them whispering, he sensed that the child had died, &ldquo;Is he dead?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then David got up off the floor, took a bath, anointed himself, and changed clothes. He went to the LORD&rsquo;s Tabernacle and worshiped and went home. When he asked, they gave him some food and he ate. 21His advisors said, &ldquo;What have you done? You fasted and cried about the child while he was alive; but when he died, you got up and ate.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He said, &ldquo;While he was still alive, I fasted and cried because I didn&rsquo;t know if the LORD would be gracious to me and let the child live. 23But now that he&rsquo;s dead, why fast? Can I bring him back? He won&rsquo;t come back to me, but I&rsquo;ll go to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and had relations with her. She had a son he named Solomon. The LORD loved him 25and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah [Beloved of the LORD] for the LORD&rsquo;s sake.       	2 Sam 12:15b-25</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Joab fought the Ammonites in Rabbah and captured the royal city. 27He sent messengers to David, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve attacked Rabbah and seized the city&rsquo;s water supply. 28Gather the rest of the army and capture the city so I won&rsquo;t, and people name it after me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> David gathered the rest of the army, went to Rabbah, and captured it. 30He took their king&rsquo;s crown off his head. It weighed 75½ lbs one talent of gold and was set with precious stones. They put it on David&rsquo;s head. He brought large amounts of spoil out of the city. 31He also brought out its people, and put them under saws, iron picks and axes; and made them pass through the brick kilns. That&rsquo;s what he did to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the whole army went back to Jerusalem.</span></p>
