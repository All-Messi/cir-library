He prostrated himself to David.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; SAMUEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; David said, &amp;ldquo;Where have you come from?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.&amp;rdquo; 6&amp;quot;I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coming up on him. 7When he looked back, he called out to me, 8&amp;rsquo;Who are you?&amp;rsquo; 10&amp;quot;So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn&amp;rsquo;t live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll make you as famous as anyone that&amp;rsquo;s ever lived in the world. 10I&amp;rsquo;ll appoint a place to plant my people so they can live there undisturbed, and sinful people won&amp;rsquo;t oppress them anymore. 11Like when I appointed judges over them, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you rest from your enemies.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;The LORD also says he&amp;rsquo;ll make a dynasty from you. 12-13&amp;rsquo;When you die, I&amp;rsquo;ll raise up your descendant and establish his kingdom permanently.  13He&amp;rsquo;ll build me a temple. 14I&amp;rsquo;ll be his father, and he&amp;rsquo;ll be my son. When he sins, I&amp;rsquo;ll correct him with rods like people do. 15But my enduring love won&amp;rsquo;t leave him like it did Saul, that I removed before you. 16Your family and kingdom will endure.

When anybody had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Then Absalom would say, &amp;ldquo;Your claims are right, but everybody with the king is ignoring you. 4If only somebody would appoint me judge in the land, everyone that has a suit could come to me for justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If Absalom was alive and all of us dead, you&amp;rsquo;d be pleased. 7Get up; go speak graciously to them. I swear by the LORD, if you don&amp;rsquo;t, not a man will spend the night with you. This will be worse than all the bad things that have come on you since you were young.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
