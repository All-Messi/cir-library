<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> One day Jonathan said to his young armor bearer, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t tell his father, 2who was staying with about 600 men on the outskirts of Gibeah around the pomegranate tree in Migron. 3Among Saul&rsquo;s men was Ahijah wearing an ephod—son of Ahitub (Ichabod&rsquo;s brother) son of Phinehas son of Eli the LORD&rsquo;s priest at Shiloh. The people didn&rsquo;t know Jonathan had gone. 4Between the passes Jonathan was planning to use to cross over to the Philistines&rsquo; outpost, there were steep cliffs on two sides named Bozez and Seneh. 5One went up to the north toward Michmash, the other one on the south toward Geba.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jonathan said to his armor bearer, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to those uncircumcised Philistines. Maybe the LORD will work for us. He&rsquo;s not limited to saving by many or few.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jonathan said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go let them know we&rsquo;re here. 9If they say, &lsquo;Wait till we come to you,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll stay put. 10If they say, &lsquo;Come on up,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll go up. The LORD will deliver them to us. That will be our sign.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When they let the outpost know they were there, the Philistines said, &ldquo;The Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they&rsquo;ve been hiding.&rdquo; 12The men in the outpost shouted, &ldquo;Come on up! We&rsquo;ll show you a thing or two!&rdquo; Jonathan told his armor bearer, &ldquo;Come on; the LORD will deliver them to Israel.&rdquo; 13Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armor bearer behind him, and they fell to Jonathan. His armor bearer killed some behind him. 14That first slaughter was about 20 men on a half-acre. 15There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among the people. Even the garrison and raiding parties trembled, and the ground shook.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Saul&rsquo;s watchmen in Gibeah saw the camp scattering, running here and there. 17Saul told the people with him, &ldquo;Count and see who&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo; They counted, and Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. 18Saul said to Ahijah, &ldquo;Bring God&rsquo;s Ark here.&rdquo; At that time, it was with the people in Israel. 19While he was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew, so Saul told the priest not to worry about it then. 20Saul and his people rallied and joined the battle. The Philistines were killing one another in total chaos. 21The Hebrews that had been going around with the Philistine camp joined the people with Saul and Jonathan. 22When people hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also chased them in the battle. 23The LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread past Beth-aven.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The men in Israel were totally exhausted because Saul had put them under oath, &ldquo;Accursed is the man that eats before evening, until I&rsquo;ve avenged myself of my enemies.&rdquo; So nobody had eaten anything. 25-26When they went into the forest, they&rsquo;d found honeycomb on the ground, but nobody put any in his mouth out of respect for the oath. 27But Jonathan hadn&rsquo;t heard about his father&rsquo;s oath. He dipped the end of his staff in the honeycomb, and put some in his mouth, and he was refreshed. 28One of the people said, &ldquo;Your father strictly put the people under oath, &lsquo;The man that eats today is under a curse.&rsquo;&rdquo; The people were exhausted. 29Jonathan said, &ldquo;My father has created a problem. See how I&rsquo;ve been refreshed because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much more if the people had eaten freely from the spoils! As it is, the slaughter among the Philistines wasn&rsquo;t that great.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were completely exhausted. 32After dark, they rushed ravenously on the spoil, butchered sheep, cattle, and calves on the ground, and ate them with the blood. 33People told Saul, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve acted deviously. Roll a large rock to me. 34Go out among the people and tell them to bring their ox or sheep, butcher it here and eat. Don&rsquo;t sin by eating the meat with the blood.&rsquo;&rdquo; The people that night brought their cattle or sheep and butchered them there. 35Saul built an altar to the LORD, his first.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then Saul said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down after the Philistines at night and take spoil till daylight. Don&rsquo;t leave one survivor.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Saul asked God, &ldquo;Should we go down after the Philistines? Will you give them to Israel?&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t answer him that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;Come here, you chiefs of the people, and find out how this sin happened today. 39As sure as the LORD lives who delivers Israel, even if it&rsquo;s Jonathan, he&rsquo;ll die.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Then he said to them, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on one side; Jonathan and I are on the other.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Saul told the LORD, &ldquo;Give a clear answer.&rdquo; The lot fell on Jonathan and Saul.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;Cast lots between me and Jonathan.&rdquo; The lot fell on Jonathan.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> He said to Jonathan, &ldquo;What did you do?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;God do this to me and more also because you&rsquo;ll surely die, Jonathan.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> But the people said to Saul, &ldquo;Does Jonathan have to die who brought about this great deliverance? Far from it! As sure as the LORD lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground; he&rsquo;s worked with God today.&rdquo; The people rescued him. 46Saul quit chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went home.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> When Saul took over the kingship, he fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He inflicted punishment wherever he went. 48He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and delivered Israel from plunderers.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Saul&rsquo;s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> His wife was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz. 51His father was Kish; 52During Saul&rsquo;s whole life, he was constantly at war with the Philistines. Whenever he saw a strong or brave man, he&rsquo;d attach him to his staff.</span></p>
