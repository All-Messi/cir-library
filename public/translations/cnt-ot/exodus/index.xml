They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians were afraid of them [13] 14and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When she saw he was such a handsome baby, she hid him for three months. 3When she couldn&amp;rsquo;t hide him anymore, she got a papyrus reed basket and covered it with tar. She put him in it and set it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 4His sister stood a distance away to see what would happen to him. 5Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s daughter came down to bathe at the Nile with her attendants. As she walked along the river, she saw the basket in the reeds and had her maid bring it to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Moses looked up and saw the bush on fire, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t burn up. 3He said, &amp;ldquo;I have to go over and see this curious thing. Why isn&amp;rsquo;t it burning up?&amp;rdquo; 4When the LORD saw him coming to look, he called from the bush, 5&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t come any closer. Take your sandals off. You&amp;rsquo;re standing on sacred ground. 6I&amp;rsquo;m the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;quot; 7&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my people&amp;rsquo;s suffering in Egypt and paid attention to their outcry because of the taskmasters. 8I&amp;rsquo;ve come down to deliver them and bring them out to a good land with lots of room, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. 9I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10Go; I&amp;rsquo;ll send you to Pharaoh so you can bring my people out of Egypt.&amp;quot; 12&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ll be with you. This will be the sign that I&amp;rsquo;ve sent you: when you&amp;rsquo;ve brought them out, you&amp;rsquo;ll worship me at this mountain.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;ll become blood.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t make myself known to them by my name &amp;lsquo;Yahveh.&amp;rsquo; 4I made a covenant with them to give them Canaan, where they were living as nomads. 5I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the Israelites&amp;rsquo; groaning because the Egyptians are holding them in slavery, and I&amp;rsquo;ve remembered my covenant. 6Tell the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll take you out from under Egyptian bondage and redeem you with power and great acts of judgment. 7I&amp;rsquo;ll take you to be my people and be your God. You&amp;rsquo;ll know I&amp;rsquo;m the LORD your God who brought you out from under the burdens the Egyptians put on you. 8I&amp;rsquo;ll take you to the land I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Take it from the sheep or goats. 6Keep it till the fourteenth of the month. &amp;ldquo;The whole community is to kill it in the evening. 7Put some of its blood on the doorposts and lintel of the house where you eat it. 8Eat the meat that same night, roasted with fire. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 9Don&amp;rsquo;t eat any of it raw or boiled. Roast the head, legs, and entrails. 10In the morning, burn what&amp;rsquo;s left over. 11Eat it in a hurry, dressed, with sandals on your feet and staff in hand. It&amp;rsquo;s the LORD&amp;rsquo;s Passover. 12I&amp;rsquo;ll go all over Egypt that night and strike down the firstborn people and animals. I&amp;rsquo;ll execute judgment on Egypt&amp;rsquo;s gods. I&amp;rsquo;m the LORD. 13The blood on your houses will be a sign. When I see it, I&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;lsquo;pass over&amp;rsquo; you. No plague will fall on you when I strike Egypt. 14&amp;quot;Today will serve as a memorial day for you. Celebrate it as a festival to the LORD, a permanent ordinance. 15Eat bread without yeast for a week. On the first day, take the yeast out of your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first till seventh day will be excluded from Israel. 16On the first day, hold a holy assembly. On the seventh day, hold another one. Don&amp;rsquo;t work on those days except for what needs to be eaten by each person that only you can fix. 17Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread throughout your generations; that&amp;rsquo;s the day I brought your hosts out of Egypt. 18In the first month, eat bread without yeast from the fourteenth in the evening till the twenty-first in the evening. 19For a week, no yeast can be in your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it will be excluded from the community of Israel, foreign or native. 20Eat bread without yeast in all your houses.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a strong hand the LORD took you out of here. Don&amp;rsquo;t eat anything with yeast in it. 4Today in the month Abib, you&amp;rsquo;re about to leave. 5When the LORD takes you to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Hivite, and Jebusite—the land he swore to your ancestors he&amp;rsquo;d give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—observe this rite in this month. 6Eat bread without yeast for a week. The seventh day, observe a feast to the LORD. 7Don&amp;rsquo;t have anything with yeast in it among you or in your territory. 8Tell your son that day, &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.&amp;rsquo; 9It will serve as a sign to you on your hand, a reminder on your forehead, that the Law of the LORD may be in your mouth, because he brought you out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 10Keep this ordinance every year at its scheduled time. 11&amp;quot;When the LORD takes you to the territory of the Canaanites, 12devote to him every woman&amp;rsquo;s male firstborn and the first male firstborn male of every animal you own. They belong to himY. 13But use a lamb to redeem every firstborn donkey. If you don&amp;rsquo;t redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn son. 14&amp;quot;When your son asks what this means, tell him, &amp;lsquo;With a great demonstration of power, the LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt. 15When Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, the LORD killed every firstborn male of people and animals in Egypt; so I sacrifice the firstborn males to the LORD, but I redeem every firstborn son.&amp;rsquo; 16It will serve as a reminder on your hand and bands on your forehead that the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a tremendous demonstration of power.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They caught up with them camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth across from Baal-zephon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for them to drink.&amp;rdquo; Moses did that. 7He named the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites &amp;ldquo;quarreled&amp;rdquo; with him and put the LORD on trial, &amp;ldquo;Is the LORD among us or not?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He sent word that he was bringing them. 7Moses went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. 8Moses told him what all the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel&amp;rsquo;s sake, the hardships they&amp;rsquo;d had on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. 9Jethro/Reuel was overjoyed at the LORD&amp;rsquo;s goodness to Israel. 10He said, &amp;ldquo;Bless the LORD that delivered you from Pharaoh and the Egyptians&amp;rsquo; control. 11Now I know he&amp;rsquo;s greater than all other gods.

If he has a wife, they&amp;rsquo;ll go out together. 4If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and the slave will go out alone. 5But if the slave says he loves his master, his wife and children, and won&amp;rsquo;t leave them to be a free man, 6his master is to take him to the judges—to the door or doorpost—and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he&amp;rsquo;ll serve him permanently. 7&amp;quot;If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she&amp;rsquo;s not to go free as the male slaves do. 8If she&amp;rsquo;s not pleasing to her master who designated her for himself, he is to let her be bought back. He can&amp;rsquo;t sell her to a foreigner; he&amp;rsquo;d be treating her unfairly. 10If he marries another woman, he can&amp;rsquo;t reduce her food, clothing, or conjugal rights. 11If he won&amp;rsquo;t do these things for her, she&amp;rsquo;ll go out without being paid for. 9If he designates her for his son, he is to treat her like a daughter. 12&amp;quot;Execute anyone that assaults and kills someone. 13If it was an accident, I&amp;rsquo;ll designate a safe place the slayer can flee to. 14But take even from the horns of my altar anyone that does premeditated murder. 16&amp;quot;Executef kidnappers whether they hold in possession or sell the one they kidnapped. 18&amp;quot;If men are fighting and one strikes the other with a stone or his fist and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t die, but is laid up, 19if he gets up and walks around outside with his staff, then don&amp;rsquo;t punishf the one that hit him. He&amp;rsquo;ll pay for the man&amp;rsquo;s loss of time and take care of him till he fully recovers. 20&amp;quot;If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies, punish him. 21If the slave survives a day or so, there&amp;rsquo;s no punishment; he&amp;rsquo;s his property. 22&amp;quot;If men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she miscarries without further injury, fine him as her husband requires and the judges determine. 23But if there&amp;rsquo;s further harm, punishf life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. 26&amp;quot;If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he&amp;rsquo;ll free the slave for the eye. 27If he knocks out his male or female slave&amp;rsquo;s tooth, he&amp;rsquo;ll free the slave for the tooth. 28&amp;quot;If an ox gores a man or woman to death, stone it, don&amp;rsquo;t eat it, and don&amp;rsquo;t punish the owner. 29But if it has gored before and its owner knew it and didn&amp;rsquo;t pen it up, if it kills somebody, stone the ox and execute the owner. 30If a ransom is demanded from him, he&amp;rsquo;ll give whatever the relatives demand for loss of life. 31If it gores a son or daughter, the same rule applies. 32If it gores a male or female slave, the owner has to give the slave&amp;rsquo;s master 12 oz 30 shekels of silver. Stone the ox. 33&amp;quot;If someone digs a pit without covering it up and an ox or donkey falls in it, 34the pit&amp;rsquo;s owner has to pay the animal&amp;rsquo;s owner for the loss, and the dead animal becomes his. 35&amp;quot;If one man&amp;rsquo;s ox kills another man&amp;rsquo;s ox, sell the live ox, divide the sale price, and divide the dead ox between them. 36If it was previously known to gore and its owner didn&amp;rsquo;t pen it up, the owner will pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The one the judges find guilty will pay double to the other. 10&amp;quot;If you give someone a donkey, cow, sheep, or other animal for safekeeping and it dies, gets hurt, or wanders off unnoticed, 11the two of you will swear in the LORD&amp;rsquo;s presence that neither has taken it. You&amp;rsquo;ll accept the judge&amp;rsquo;s verdict, no compensation required. 12But if it was stolen, the thief will pay its owner for it. 13If wild animals got it, the remains are evidence, no compensation required. 14&amp;quot;If you borrow something that gets injured or dies while its owner&amp;rsquo;s absent, you&amp;rsquo;ll make full compensation. 15If its owner&amp;rsquo;s present, you won&amp;rsquo;t make compensation. If you rented it, it came for the rent. 16&amp;quot;If a man seduces a virgin that&amp;rsquo;s not engaged and lies with her, he has to pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 17If her father refuses to give her to him, he&amp;rsquo;ll still pay money equal to the dowry for virgins. 22&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t abuse a widow or orphan in any way. 23If you do and the person cries out to me, 24my anger will flare. I&amp;rsquo;ll kill you with the sword and make yoursg wives widows and your children orphans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In a dispute, don&amp;rsquo;t join other people to pervert justice. 3Don&amp;rsquo;t be partial toward a poor person in a dispute. 4&amp;quot;If you run onto your enemy&amp;rsquo;s ox or donkey wandering around, return it. 5If you see a donkey that belongs to someone that hates you lying helpless under its load, free it. 7&amp;quot;Avoid making false charges. Don&amp;rsquo;t execute an innocent or good person. I won&amp;rsquo;t acquit you. 8&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t take a bribe; it blinds the clear-sighted and undercuts what good people are trying to do. 9&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t oppress a foreigner; you know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be one; you were foreigners in Egypt. 10&amp;quot;Plant and harvest your ground for six years. 11Let it lie fallow the seventh year so the needy among your people can eat what grows volunteer. Whatever they leave, the wild animals can have. Do the same thing with your vineyard and olive trees. 12&amp;quot;Work six days. On the seventh, stop working so your ox and donkey can rest, so the son of your female slave and the foreigner that&amp;rsquo;s with you can refresh themselves. 13Pay attention to everything I&amp;rsquo;ve told you. 14&amp;quot;Celebrate three festivals to me each year. 15Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. Eat bread without yeast for a week at the scheduled time in the month Abib, the month you came out of Egypt. Nobody is to come to me empty-handed. 16Observe the Festival of the Harvest, the first part of the harvest from what you sow. Observe the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year at harvest time. 17Three times a year all males are to appear in front of the Lord GOD. 18&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast. The fat from my feast is not to remain till morning. 19Bring the best of the first harvest from your ground to the house of the LORD your God. 20&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ll send an angel to take you safely to the place I&amp;rsquo;ve designated. 21Be sure to obey him. He won&amp;rsquo;t pardon your sins because he wears my name. 22If you sincerely obey him in everything I say, I&amp;rsquo;ll be an enemy to your enemies, an adversary to your adversaries. 23My angel will take you to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Canaanite, Hivite, and Jebusite; and I&amp;rsquo;ll destroy them. 24&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t worship and serve other gods or do what they do. Overthrow them completely and break their sacred pillars to pieces. 25Serve the LORD your God, and he&amp;rsquo;ll bless your bread and water, and keep you from getting sick. 26There won&amp;rsquo;t be any miscarriages or barrenness in your country, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have long lives. 27I&amp;rsquo;ll spread fear in front of you, and throw into confusion the people you invade, and make your enemies flee. 28I&amp;rsquo;ll send hornets ahead of you to drive out the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites. 29I won&amp;rsquo;t drive them out in a single year; the land would grow wild and wild animals would take over. 30I&amp;rsquo;ll drive them out little by little till you gain possession of it all and make it productive. 31&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ll set your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea beside the Philistines, from the desert to the River Euphrates. I&amp;rsquo;ll deliver the people to you to drive out. 32Don&amp;rsquo;t make any treaty with them or their gods. 33Don&amp;rsquo;t let them live in your country and end up making you sin against me. If you serve their gods, they&amp;rsquo;ll be a snare to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll do what the LORD has said.&amp;rdquo; 8Moses sprinkled the blood on them, &amp;ldquo;This is the blood of the covenant the LORD has made with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From between the two cherubs, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the commandments to give Israel. 23&amp;quot;Make a table out of acacia wood 36 x 18 x 27ins high. 24Overlay it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 25Make a rim around it a hand&amp;rsquo;s width and a gold border for the rim. 26Make four gold rings and put them on the four bottom corners. 27Put the rings close to the rim to hold the poles that carry the table. 28Make the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 31&amp;quot;Make a lampstand out of pure gold with a base and shaft. Its cups, bulbs, and flowers will be one piece. 32It&amp;rsquo;ll have 6 branches, 3 on a side. 333 cups shaped like almond blossoms will be on one branch—a bulb and flower, and 3 cups shaped like almond blossoms on the other branch—a bulb and flower, 34and on the lampstand 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms—its bulbs and flowers. 35Put a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches—coming out of it. That makes 6 branches coming out of the lampstand. 36The whole thing will be one piece of hammered pure gold. 37Make its lamps so they shine forward. 38Its snuffers and their trays will be pure gold. 39Make it from 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold, with all its utensils. 40Be sure to make them in the design I showed you on the mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Make them with cherubs, a skilled weaver&amp;rsquo;s work. 2All the curtains will be 42 x 6ft. 3Make 2 sets of 5 joined curtains. 4Make blue loops on the edge of the outer curtain in the first set; do the same with the second set. 5Make 50 loops in the one curtain, and 50 loops on the edge of the second set. Put the loops across from each other. 6Make 50 gold clasps and join the curtains together with them so the Tabernacle makes a unit. 7-8&amp;quot;Make 11 curtains out of goats&amp;rsquo; hair for a covering over the Tabernacle. Make them 45 x 6ft. 9Join 5 curtains in one set, and 6 curtains in another set. Double the sixth curtain at the front of the tent. 10Make 50 loops on the edge of the outside curtain in the two sets. 11Make 50 bronze clasps, put them into the loops, and join the tent together to make one unit. 12The overlapping part that&amp;rsquo;s left over in the curtains of the tent—the half curtain—will lap over the back of the Tabernacle. 13The 18ins on each side of what&amp;rsquo;s left over in the length of the curtain, will lap over the back of the sides of the Tabernacle to cover each side. 14Make a covering for the tent out of rams&amp;rsquo; and dolphin skins dyed red. 15&amp;quot;Make vertical boards out of acacia wood for the Tabernacle. 16Make them 15ft x 27in. 17With all the boards, make a mortise and tenon on each board, so they fit together. 18Make 20 boards for the south side of the Tabernacle. 19Make 40 silver bases under the 20 boards, 2 bases under each board for its mortise and tenon. 20-21Do the north side of the Tabernacle the same as the south side. 22For the back of the Tabernacle, the west end, make 6 boards. 23For the two back corners make 2 boards. 24They&amp;rsquo;ll double on top of each other; together they&amp;rsquo;ll be complete to the top to the first ring. Make both corners alike. 25There will be 8 boards with their 16 silver bases, 2 bases under each board. 26&amp;quot;Make 5 braces out of acacia wood for the boards on one side of the Tabernacle, 275 braces for the boards on the other side, and 5 braces for the rear, west end. 28The middle brace in the center of the boards will go from one end to the other. 29Overlay the boards with gold and make their gold rings into holders for the braces. Overlay the braces with gold too. 30Build the Tabernacle by the plan I showed you on the mountain.&amp;quot; 31&amp;quot;Make a curtain out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen. Put cherubs on it, a skilled weaver&amp;rsquo;s work. 32Hang it on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold, having gold hooks, and set on four silver sockets. 33Hang the curtain under the clasps and bring the Ark of Testimony inside the curtain that separates the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. 34Mount the mercy seat on the Ark. 35Outside the curtain, set the table on the north side of the Tabernacle and the lampstand on the south side. 36For the doorway of the tent, make a screen out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine linen, a weaver&amp;rsquo;s work. 37For the screen, make five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold, having gold hooks, and set on 5 bronze sockets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Make them one piece with the altar and overlaid with bronze. 3&amp;quot;Make bronze pails for removing the ashes, bronze shovels, basins, forks, and fire pans. 4&amp;quot;Make a network of bronze grating for it, and on the network put four bronze rings at the corners. 5Put the grating under the ledge of the altar so it reaches halfway up the altar. 6&amp;quot;For the altar make acacia poles overlaid with bronze. 7Insert the poles into the rings on the two sides of the altar for carrying it. 8Make it hollow with planks like you saw on the mountain. 9&amp;quot;Make a court for the Tabernacle. Its south side will have curtains made out of finely twined linen 150ft long for one side. 10It&amp;rsquo;ll have 20 posts with 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts will be silver. 11Make the north side of the court the same way. 12The west end of the court will have 75ft of curtains with 10 posts with their 10 bases. 13The east end of the court will be 75ft wide. 14The curtains for one side of the entrance will be 22½ft long with 3 posts and their 3 bases. 15Make the other side of the entrance the same way. 16The entrance to the court will be a screen 30ft wide woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material with finely twined linen; with 4 posts and their 4 bases. 17The posts around the court will have silver bands with silver hooks and bronze bases. 18The court will be 150 x 75ft with curtains 7½ft high and bronze bases under its posts. 19Make out of bronze the Tabernacle&amp;rsquo;s utensils of service, its pegs, and the pegs in the court. 20&amp;quot;Charge the people to bring pure oil from pressed olives for a continually burning light in the lamp. 21In the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will keep the light burning from evening to morning in front of the LORD—a permanent statute for Israel&amp;rsquo;s descendants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Aaron will carry them on his two shoulders as a memorial of the people of Israel. 13Make delicate gold settings 14and 2 pure gold chains. Make them out of twined cordage and put the corded chains on the delicate settings. 15&amp;quot;Make a Pouch of Judgment, an artisan&amp;rsquo;s work. Make its design match the ephod—with blue, purple, scarlet material, and finely twined linen. 16It will be 9ins 1 span square and folded double. 17Mount four rows of gemstones on it: a ruby, topaz, and emerald on the first row; 18a turquoise, sapphire, and diamond on the second; 19a jacinth, agate, and amethyst on the third; 20and a beryl, onyx, and jasper on the fourth—all set in delicate gold decorations. 21Set the precious stones in the birth order of Israel&amp;rsquo;s 12 sons. Engrave their names as on a seal. 22On the pouch put pure gold chains of twined cordage. 23Put 2 gold rings on the 2 ends of the pouch, 24and put the 2 gold cords on the rings. 25Put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 decorative settings and attach them to the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 26Make 2 gold rings and put them on the 2 ends of the pouch, on the edge of the inner side of the ephod. 27Make 2 gold rings and put them at the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front close to where it joins together, above the skillfully woven band. 28Use a blue cord to tie the rings of the pouch to the ephod rings, so it will be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch won&amp;rsquo;t come loose from the ephod. 29Aaron will carry the names of Israel&amp;rsquo;s sons in the Pouch of Judgment over his heart when he goes into the Holy Place, for a memorial in front of the LORD continually. 30Put the Urim and Thummim in the pouch. 31&amp;quot;Make the whole ephod robe blue 32with an opening for the head in the middle. Around the opening put an edging made of woven work—as with a coat of mail—so it won&amp;rsquo;t tear. 33-34All around the hem, put pomegranates made out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and alternate gold bells with them. 35Aaron will wear it when he performs service, and other people can hear it tinkling when he goes in and leaves the Holy Place in case he dies while he&amp;rsquo;s in front of the LORD. 36&amp;quot;Make a pure gold plate and engrave it &amp;lsquo;Holy to the LORD&amp;rsquo;—as on a seal. 37Use a blue cord to fasten it to the front of the turban. 38Aaron will always wear it on his forehead to take away the sin from all holy gifts the Israelites consecrate, to make them acceptable to the LORD. 39Weave the tunic out of checkered work of fine linen and make a turban and sash out of fine linen. 40&amp;quot;For Aaron&amp;rsquo;s sons make tunics, sashes, and caps, bright and beautiful. 41Put them on him and his sons; anoint, ordain, and consecrate them to serve me as priests. 42Make linen pants to cover their bare skin, pants that reach from their waist to their thighs. 43They&amp;rsquo;ll wear them in the Tent of Meeting and when they go to the altar to perform service in the Holy Place so they won&amp;rsquo;t incur guilt and die—a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ll exercise the priesthood by permanent statute. 10&amp;quot;Then take the bull to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 11and slaughter it. 12Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger. Pour out the rest at the base of the altar. 13Take the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that&amp;rsquo;s on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar. 14Burn the meat, hide, and manure outside the camp as a sin offering. 15&amp;quot;Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on one ram&amp;rsquo;s head. 16Slaughter it and sprinkle its blood around the altar. 17Then butcher it, wash its entrails and legs, and put them on the altar with the pieces and head. 18Offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar—a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma. 19&amp;quot;Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on the other ram&amp;rsquo;s head. 20Slaughter it, put some of its blood on Aaron and his sons&amp;rsquo; right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. Sprinkle the rest around on the altar. 21Take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, his sons, and their vestments. That will consecrate them and their vestments. 22Take the fat from the ram—fat from its tail, fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh (it&amp;rsquo;s a ram for ordination)—23one cake of bread, one cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that sits in front of the LORD. 24Put them in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave offering in front of the LORD. 25Take them and offer them up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering for an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 26&amp;quot;Then take the breast of Aaron&amp;rsquo;s ram for the ordination, and wave it as a wave offering; it will be your portion. 27Consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering that was waved and offered from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and the one that was for his sons. 28It will be for Aaron and his sons their permanent portion from the Israelites. It&amp;rsquo;s a heave offering from the Israelites&amp;rsquo; peace offerings, that is, their heave offering to the LORD. 29&amp;quot;Aaron&amp;rsquo;s holy vestments will go to his descendants so they can be anointed and ordained in them. 30For one week his descendant that succeeds him as priest will wear them when he enters the Tent of Meeting to perform service in the Holy Place. 31&amp;quot;Take the ram for the ordination and boil its meat in a holy place. 32At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons will eat the ram&amp;rsquo;s meat and the bread in the basket. 33They&amp;rsquo;ll eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration. A layman can&amp;rsquo;t eat them because they&amp;rsquo;re holy. 34Burn any meat or bread that&amp;rsquo;s left over till morning. 35&amp;quot;This is how you&amp;rsquo;ll ordain Aaron and his sons over the course of a week. 36Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, to purify the altar when you atone for it. Anoint it to consecrate it. 37For 7 days atone for the altar to consecrate it. Then it will be most holy; whoever touches it will be holy. 38&amp;quot;Offer on the altar two one-year-old lambs each day, 39one in the morning and another in the evening. 40Mix 4½ pecks 1 ephah of fine flour with 3pts ¼ hin of pressed olive oil and 3pts ¼ hin of wine for a liquid offering for the lamb. 41Offer the other lamb in the evening, like the grain offering in the morning, with its liquid offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 42It will be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in front of me. I&amp;rsquo;ll meet you there and speak to you. 43I&amp;rsquo;ll meet there with the descendants of Israel, and it will be consecrated by my glory. 44I&amp;rsquo;ll consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, as well as Aaron and his sons to minster as priests to me. 45I&amp;rsquo;ll live among the descendants of Israel and be their God. 46They&amp;rsquo;ll know I&amp;rsquo;m the LORD their God who brought them out of Egypt to live among them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Burn incense to me continuously throughout your generations. 9Don&amp;rsquo;t offer foreign incense, burnt offering, or meal offering on this altar. Don&amp;rsquo;t pour any liquid offering on it. 10Throughout your generations, Aaron will make atonement on its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering. It&amp;rsquo;s most holy to me. [11] 12&amp;quot;When you take a census of the Israelites, each one will give a ransom for himself to the LORD so there won&amp;rsquo;t be any plague among them. 13-14Each person that&amp;rsquo;s counted from 20 years up will give .2 oz a half-shekel of the sanctuary as a contribution to the LORD (20 gerahs to a shekel). 15Rich and poor will contribute the same .2 oz a half-shekel of to make atonement. 16Give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to the LORD. [17] 18&amp;quot;Make a bronze laver with a bronze base, put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 19Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet from it 20when they go into the Tent of Meeting so they won&amp;rsquo;t die when they approach the altar to offer up in smoke a sacrifice by fire to me.  21That will be an ongoing statute for Aaron and his descendants. [22] 23&amp;quot;Take the finest spices: 12½ lbs 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 2412½ lbs 500 shekels of cassia, and 1½ gallons hin of olive oil. 25From them, make a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, a perfumer&amp;rsquo;s work. 26With it, anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, 27the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28the altar of burnt offering and its instruments, and the laver and its stand. 29Consecrate them so they&amp;rsquo;ll be holy. Whatever touches them will be holy. 30Anoint Aaron and his sons to consecrate them for performing service to me as priests. 31Tell the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;This will be an anointing oil holy to me throughout your generations. 32Don&amp;rsquo;t make any oil in the same proportions or pour it on anybody else. It&amp;rsquo;s holy, reserved for you. 33Whoever mixes any oil like it or puts any of it on a layman, will be excluded from the community.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot; 34&amp;quot;Take the spices stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense in equal amounts 35to make incense, a perfumer&amp;rsquo;s work—salted, pure, and holy. 36Beat some of it very fine and put part of it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I&amp;rsquo;ll meet you. It will be most holy to you. 37Any incense you make for yourselves can&amp;rsquo;t have the same proportions. My incense will be exclusively for the LORD. 38Whoever makes any perfume like it will be excluded from the community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the hearts of everybody that&amp;rsquo;s skilled, I&amp;rsquo;ve put the skill to make everything: [12] 13&amp;quot;Tell the Israelites to observe my Sabbaths. They&amp;rsquo;re a sign between you and me throughout your generations so you can know I&amp;rsquo;m the LORD who sanctifies you. 14The Sabbath is set aside for you. Execute anybody that profanes it. Exclude from the community whoever works on it. 15Work for six days, but the seventh day will be a complete rest set aside to me. 16Israelites will observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a continuing covenant. 17It&amp;rsquo;s a permanent sign between them and me, because I made earth and sky in six days, but stopped working on the seventh day and was refreshed.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
