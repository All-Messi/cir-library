<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is how you&rsquo;re to consecrate them as priests to me: take a young bull, two rams without blemish, 2bread without yeast, and cakes mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with oil and made out of fine wheat flour. 3Put them in a basket and bring them with the bull and two rams. 4Take Aaron and his sons to the door and give them a bath. 5Put on Aaron the tunic, ephod robe, ephod, chest pouch, and skillfully woven band of the ephod. 6Put the turban on his head, and the holy crown on the turban. 7Then pour the anointing oil on his head. 8Put tunics on his sons. 9Put sashes around him and his sons and tie the caps on them. They&rsquo;ll exercise the priesthood by permanent statute. 10&quot;Then take the bull to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 11and slaughter it. 12Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger. Pour out the rest at the base of the altar. 13Take the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that&rsquo;s on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar. 14Burn the meat, hide, and manure outside the camp as a sin offering. 15&quot;Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on one ram&rsquo;s head. 16Slaughter it and sprinkle its blood around the altar. 17Then butcher it, wash its entrails and legs, and put them on the altar with the pieces and head. 18Offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar—a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma. 19&quot;Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on the other ram&rsquo;s head. 20Slaughter it, put some of its blood on Aaron and his sons&rsquo; right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. Sprinkle the rest around on the altar. 21Take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, his sons, and their vestments. That will consecrate them and their vestments. 22Take the fat from the ram—fat from its tail, fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh (it&rsquo;s a ram for ordination)—23one cake of bread, one cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that sits in front of the LORD. 24Put them in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave offering in front of the LORD. 25Take them and offer them up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering for an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 26&quot;Then take the breast of Aaron&rsquo;s ram for the ordination, and wave it as a wave offering; it will be your portion. 27Consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering that was waved and offered from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and the one that was for his sons. 28It will be for Aaron and his sons their permanent portion from the Israelites. It&rsquo;s a heave offering from the Israelites&rsquo; peace offerings, that is, their heave offering to the LORD. 29&quot;Aaron&rsquo;s holy vestments will go to his descendants so they can be anointed and ordained in them. 30For one week his descendant that succeeds him as priest will wear them when he enters the Tent of Meeting to perform service in the Holy Place. 31&quot;Take the ram for the ordination and boil its meat in a holy place. 32At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons will eat the ram&rsquo;s meat and the bread in the basket. 33They&rsquo;ll eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration. A layman can&rsquo;t eat them because they&rsquo;re holy. 34Burn any meat or bread that&rsquo;s left over till morning. 35&quot;This is how you&rsquo;ll ordain Aaron and his sons over the course of a week. 36Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, to purify the altar when you atone for it. Anoint it to consecrate it. 37For 7 days atone for the altar to consecrate it. Then it will be most holy; whoever touches it will be holy. 38&quot;Offer on the altar two one-year-old lambs each day, 39one in the morning and another in the evening. 40Mix 4½ pecks 1 ephah of fine flour with 3pts ¼ hin of pressed olive oil and 3pts ¼ hin of wine for a liquid offering for the lamb. 41Offer the other lamb in the evening, like the grain offering in the morning, with its liquid offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 42It will be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in front of me. I&rsquo;ll meet you there and speak to you. 43I&rsquo;ll meet there with the descendants of Israel, and it will be consecrated by my glory. 44I&rsquo;ll consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, as well as Aaron and his sons to minster as priests to me. 45I&rsquo;ll live among the descendants of Israel and be their God. 46They&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m the LORD their God who brought them out of Egypt to live among them.</span></p>
