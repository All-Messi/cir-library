      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruth-chapter-1&#34;&gt;Ruth Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Judges were ruling when a famine came over the country. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went with his wife and sons to stay in Moab. 2His name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites. 3But Elimelech died and Naomi was left with her two sons. 4They married Moabite wives Orpah and Ruth. They lived there about 10 years, 5and Mahlon and Chilion died too. So Naomi lost her husband and both sons. 6-7With her daughters-in-law she started to go back from Moab, because she&amp;rsquo;d heard that the LORD had visited his people and given them food. 8She told them, &amp;ldquo;Both of you, go to your mother&amp;rsquo;s house. May the LORD deal graciously with you, as you have with the dead and with me. 9May he grant you to find a home in your husband&amp;rsquo;s house.&amp;rdquo; She kissed them. They cried 10and said to her, &amp;ldquo;No, we&amp;rsquo;ll go with you to your people.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruth-chapter-2&#34;&gt;Ruth Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Naomi&amp;rsquo;s husband Elimelech had a wealthy relative named Boaz. 2Ruth said to Naomi, &amp;ldquo;Let me go glean among the heads of grain after one that might take an interest in me.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; She went and gleaned behind the harvest crew. She happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. 4He came from Bethlehem and said to the crew, &amp;ldquo;The LORD be with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t make yourself known to him till he&amp;rsquo;s finished eating. 4Notice where he lies down and go uncover his feet and lie down. He&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&amp;rdquo; [5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruth-chapter-4&#34;&gt;Ruth Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Boaz went up to the gate and sat down, and the close relative went past. He said, &amp;ldquo;Come over here, my friend, and have a seat.&amp;rdquo; He went over and sat down. 2He had ten elders of the town sit down there. 3He told the closest relative, &amp;ldquo;Naomi is back from Moab and has to sell the ground that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 4I thought to inform you to buy it with my people sitting here as witnesses. If you&amp;rsquo;ll redeem it, redeem it. If not, tell me so I&amp;rsquo;ll know. There&amp;rsquo;s nobody but you to redeem it. I&amp;rsquo;m after you.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; 5&amp;quot;When you buy the field from Naomi, you also need to acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to maintain title to his inheritance.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
