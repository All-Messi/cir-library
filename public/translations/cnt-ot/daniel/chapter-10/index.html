<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The <strong>third year of Cyrus</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> king of Persia</strong>, a message came to Daniel (Belteshazzar) about great warfare. He understood that the vision was about future events.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>At that time, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three weeks. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I didn’t eat any tasty food or meat, drink any wine, or use any lotions that whole time. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The <strong>twenty-fourth of the first</strong> <strong>month</strong>, I was on the bank of the Tigris River. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen<em> </em><em>with</em> a <em>belt </em>of pure gold from Uphaz around his waist. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>His body was like beryl, his face flashed like lightning, his eyes flamed like torches, his arms and feet shined<em> </em>like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like<em> </em>an enormous crowd. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I was the only one that saw the vision, but such an overwhelming sense of dread came over the men that were with me that they ran and hid. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So I was alone. My strength was gone, and my healthy appearance grew deathly pale. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When I heard him start to speak, I passed out facedown on the ground.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	        </strong><strong>	        </strong></span></p>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 10:1-9</p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>After</em><em> some years they’ll form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will be given to the king of the North to make a </em>marriage<em> alliance. But she won’t retain her influence </em>there<em>. She and her father won’t last, and they’ll be given up along with her attendants and supporters.</em><strong>	</strong></span></p>

For some years he’ll refrain from attacking the king of the North. 9Then the latter will invade the realm of the king of the South, but he’ll soon go back to his own land. 10“But the sons of the king of the North will gather a group of large forces and wage war. They’ll keep on coming, overrun, pass through, and carry the war as far as his fortress. 11Then the king of the South will be angry and go to fight the king of the North. The latter will raise a large army, but he’ll fall to the other. 12When the enemy army is defeated, the king of the South will get proud and execute thousands, but he won’t prevail for long. 13The king of the North will raise a bigger army than before; and after some years, he’ll press on with that large army and lots of equipment.        	Dan 11:7-13 14“In those times, there’ll be an uprising against the king of the South. Violent men among your people will also lift themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they’ll fall. 15Then the king of the North will come, throw up a siege mound, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South won’t have the strength to stand their ground, not even their best troops. 16The one that comes against him will do as he pleases, and nobody will be able to withstand him. He’ll stay for a time in the Glorious Land and control it. 17He’ll be determined to come with the power of his whole kingdom and to bring a proposal for peace that he’ll put into effect. He’ll give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow the kingdom from within, but she won’t take a stand for him. 18Then he’ll turn his attention to the coastland and capture many cities. But a commander will put a stop to his insolence and repay him for it. 19So he’ll take refuge in the fortresses in his own land, but he’ll stumble and fall and fall out of the picture. 	Dan 11:14-19 20“Then in his place one will rise up and send a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. Yet within a short time he’ll die, though not in anger or in battle. 21In his place a despicable man will come to power who isn’t in line for royal succession. He’ll come in peace time and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 22He’ll sweep away armies, including the prince of the covenant. 23After he makes various alliances, he’ll act deceitfully and seize power with a small force. 24Without warning he’ll enter the richest parts of the realm and accomplish what his predecessors had never done. He’ll distribute plunder, booty, and possessions among them. He’ll plot against fortresses, but only for a while. 25He’ll stir up his courage against the king of the South with a large army. So the king of the South will mobilize a very big army, but he won’t stand because there’ll be plots against him. 26The members of his own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be slain. 27Both kings will be intent on evil and lie to each other at the conference table; but to no avail because the end will come at the appointed time.</h3>
