<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abimelech went to his mother&rsquo;s relatives in Shechem and said to her clan, 2&quot;Ask the leaders in Shechem which is better: for Jerubbaal&rsquo;s 70 sons to rule you or for one man to rule you. Remember, I&rsquo;m your flesh and bone.&quot; 3His mother&rsquo;s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him because he was their kin. 4They gave him 70 pieces of silver from Baal-berith&rsquo;s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows 5to go with him to his father&rsquo;s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal&rsquo;s youngest son, hid. 6The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When Jotham heard about it, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted, &ldquo;Listen, people of Shechem, so God will listen to you. 8The trees went out to anoint a king. They asked the olive tree to rule them. 9But the olive tree said, &lsquo;Should I leave my richness that honors gods and mortals, and go sway over the trees?&rsquo; 10The trees said to the fig tree, &lsquo;You come and rule us.&rsquo; 11But the fig tree said, &lsquo;Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go sway over the trees?&rsquo; 12The trees said to the grapevine, &lsquo;You come and rule us.&rsquo; 13But the grapevine said, &lsquo;Should I leave my wine that cheers gods and mortals, and go to sway over the trees?&rsquo; 14Then the trees said to the bramble, &lsquo;You come and rule us.&rsquo; 15The bramble said, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re anointing me king in good faith, then come and take refuge in my shade. If not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon. &ldquo;[16] 17My father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from Midian. 18You&rsquo;ve risen up against his family and killed his 70 sons on one rock. You&rsquo;ve made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king of Shechem because he&rsquo;s your relative. 19If you&rsquo;ve acted honorably in good faith with Jerubbaal and his family as his deeds deserved, then be happy with one another. 20If not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the people in Shechem and Beth-millo.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jotham fled to Beer and lived there for fear of his half-brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Abimelech ruled Israel for 3 years. 23God put animosity between him and the people in Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with him. 24That was so the violence done to Jerubbaal&rsquo;s 70 sons might come on Abimelech who murdered them and on the men who helped him. 25The men in Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops and robbed everybody that went by. Abimelech heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his relatives and gained the confidence of the people there. 27They went out and gathered grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and held a feast. They went to the temple of their god and ate and drank, and ranted about Abimelech. 28Gaal said, &ldquo;Who is Abimelech? Why should we serve him? Didn&rsquo;t the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him? 29If these people were under my command, I&rsquo;d remove Abimelech! I&rsquo;d tell him to muster an army and come out and fight.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> When Zebul the ruler of the city heard what Gaal said, he was mad 31and sent ambassadors to Abimelech at Arumah, &ldquo;Gaal and his relatives have come to Shechem; they&rsquo;re stirring up the city against you. 32So you and your men go during the night and lie in ambush in the fields. 33In the morning at sunup, rush on the city. When he and his men come out against you, do to them what you can.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Abimelech and his men got up during the night and laid in ambush against Shechem in four companies. 35Gaal went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and his men rose up from the ambush. 36When Gaal saw them, he told Zebul, &ldquo;Look, men are coming down from the mountains!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Gaal said again, &ldquo;Look, there are men are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the direction of the Diviners&rsquo; Oak.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then Zebul said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your bragging now, you that said, &lsquo;Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?&rsquo; Aren&rsquo;t these the men you despised? Go fight them.&rdquo; 39Gaal led the men out to fight him. 40Abimelech chased him and he fled. Many fell wounded all the way back to the entrance of the gate. 41Abimelech retreated to Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The next day the men went out to the fields. Abimelech heard about it. 43He divided his men into three companies and laid in wait there. When the men come out of the city, he attacked them and killed them. 44Abimelech and his company rushed up and stood at the entrance to the city gate while the two companies attacked and killed the ones in the fields. 45Abimelech fought the city all day and took it. He killed the people in it, tore it down, and scattered salt all over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> When people in the tower at Shechem heard about it, they withdrew into the fortress of El-berith&rsquo;s temple. 47When Abimelech found out they were in the tower, 48he and his men went up to Mount Zalmon. He cut a bundle of brush with an axe and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. 49Each one cut a bundle and followed him. He piled the bundles against the fortress and set it on fire over the ones inside. Everybody in the tower died, about 1,000 men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and took it. 51But the city had a strong tower. The men and women fled to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof. 52He attacked it and came to burn down the tower door. 53A woman threw an upper millstone down on him and cracked his skull. 54Right away he called to his young armor bearer, &ldquo;Draw your sword and kill me so people won&rsquo;t say a woman killed me.&rdquo; His young man thrust him through, and he died. 55When Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they went home. 56So God repaid him for his crime against his father in killing his 70 brothers. 57God also made the sinfulness of the men in Shechem come back on their heads and made Jotham&rsquo;s curse fall on them.</span></p>
