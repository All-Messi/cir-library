        <h2 id="judges-chapter-6">Judges Chapter 6</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel did what the LORD considered sin; so he gave them over to Midian for 7 years. 2Because of Midian, the Israelites made dens and caves and barricades in the mountains. 3Whenever they sowed anything, the Midianites, Amalekites, and people from the east would come up and attack them. 4They&rsquo;d camp against them and destroy their crops as far as the territory around Gaza. They wouldn&rsquo;t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. 5They&rsquo;d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land 6and brought Israel low. The people appealed to the LORD, &ldquo;The LORD God of Israel says, &lsquo;I led you out of slavery in Egypt 9and delivered you from other oppressors. I drove them out and gave you their land. 10I told you, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the LORD your God. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the Amorites&rsquo; gods where you&rsquo;re living.&rdquo; But you&rsquo;ve ignored me.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The angel appeared to him, &ldquo;The LORD is with you, brave soldier!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gideon said, &ldquo;Sir, if he&rsquo;s with us, why is this happening? Where are his wonderful deeds our ancestors talked about when he brought us up from Egypt? He&rsquo;s thrown us away now and delivered us to Midian.&rdquo; 15&quot;LORD, how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I&rsquo;m the least in my family.&rdquo; 17&quot;If I&rsquo;m pleasing to you, give me a sign that it&rsquo;s you speaking to me.  18Don&rsquo;t leave till I come back with your present.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Gideon went into the house and fixed a kid and cakes without yeast from 1.1 bushels           1 ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and took them to him under the terebinth tree. 20God&rsquo;s angel said, &ldquo;Put the meat and cakes on this rock and pour the broth over them.&rdquo;  When he did that, 21the angel touched the meat and cakes with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed them, and he vanished. 22Then Gideon surmised that he was the angel of the LORD, &ldquo;Lord GOD! I&rsquo;ve seen the angel of the LORD directly.&rdquo; 23But the LORD said, You don&rsquo;t have to be afraid. You won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo; 24Then Gideon built an altar to him and called it The LORD Is Peace [Yahveh Shalom]. It&rsquo;s still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That night the LORD told him, &ldquo;Take your father&rsquo;s bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down your father&rsquo;s altar to Baal. Cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 26Build an altar to the LORD your God on top of the fortress here, with stones laid in order. Offer the second bull as a burnt offering with the wood from the Asherah pole you cut down.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Gideon took ten servants and did that. He was too afraid of family and townspeople to do it in the daytime, so he did it at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When people in town got up early, Baal&rsquo;s altar was pulled down, the Asherah pole was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar Gideon built. 29They asked one another who did it. After they asked around, people said, &ldquo;Gideon son of Joash.&rdquo; 30They told Joash, &ldquo;Bring your son out to die. He pulled down Baal&rsquo;s altar and cut down the Asherah pole.&rdquo; 31Joash said to everybody lined up against him, &ldquo;Will you defend Baal or his cause? Whoever fights for him will be put to death by morning. If he&rsquo;s a god, he can defend himself. It&rsquo;s his altar that Gideon tore down!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That day he called him Jerubbaal (&ldquo;Let Baal Fight Him&rdquo;) because he tore down his altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then the Midianites, Amalekites, and people east of the Jordan joined forces, crossed the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 34The Spirit of the LORD stirred up Gideon. He blew the ram&rsquo;s horn and called the Abiezrites to follow him. 35He sent messengers all over Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to follow him too. They went up to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then Gideon said to God, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to deliver Israel by me, 37I&rsquo;m laying a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there&rsquo;s dew on it but the ground around it&rsquo;s dry, I&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ll deliver Israel by me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> That&rsquo;s what happened. When he got up early, he wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl. 39Then he said to God, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me. Let me test you one more time with the fleece. Let it be dry and the ground around it have dew on it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> That&rsquo;s what God did that night. It was dry just on the fleece; the ground was wet.</span></p>
