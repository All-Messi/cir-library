        <h2 id="nehemiah-chapter-9">Nehemiah Chapter 9</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the twenty-fourth of that month, the Israelites gathered with fasting in burlap and doused with dust. 2They separated from foreigners and confessed their and their ancestors&rsquo; sins. 3While they stood in their place, they read from the Law for a fourth of the day. For another fourth they confessed and worshiped Yahveh their God. 4On the Levites&rsquo; platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and appealed to Yahveh their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, &ldquo;Bless Yahveh your God forevermore! &ldquo;May your glorious name be blessed and regarded above all blessing and praise!</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You alone are Yahveh. You made earth and sky, the highest heavens with all their host, the earth and everything on it, the oceans and what&rsquo;s in them. The heavenly host bows to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You&rsquo;re Yahveh God who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldees, and named him Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You found him faithful and made a covenant with him to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. You fulfilled your promise because you&rsquo;re good. 9&quot;You saw our ancestors&rsquo; suffering in Egypt and heard their outcry by the Red Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. You knew they acted arrogantly toward them and made a name for yourself till now.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You separated the sea so they went through it on dry seabed; but you threw their pursuers into the depths like stones into raging water.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You led them during the day with a pillar of cloud and at night with a pillar of fire to light the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then you came down on Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven; you gave them just ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You told them about your holy Sabbath and laid down commandments, statutes, and law through your servant Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You gave them bread from the sky for their hunger and brought water out of rock for their thirst. You told them to go in and take possession of the land you swore to give them. 16&quot;But our ancestors acted arrogantly; they became stubborn and ignored your commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They didn&rsquo;t remember the awesome deeds you did among them. They became stubborn and appointed a leader to take them back to slavery in Egypt. But you&rsquo;re a forgiving God, gracious and merciful, slow to get angry and full of enduring love: you didn&rsquo;t abandon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Even when they made a calf out of molten metal and said, &lsquo;This is your God that brought you up from Egypt,&rsquo; and committed extreme blasphemies,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> in your great mercy you didn&rsquo;t abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud didn&rsquo;t leave them during the day to guide them on their way; the pillar of fire didn&rsquo;t leave them at night to light the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You gave them your good Spirit to teach them; you didn&rsquo;t withhold your manna from them; you gave them water for their thirst.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> For 40 years you provided for them in the desert, and they had what they needed. Their clothes didn&rsquo;t wear out, and their feet didn&rsquo;t swell.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You delivered kingdoms and nations to them and allotted every corner to them. They took the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You made their descendants as numerous as the stars and took them into the land you told their ancestors to possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So their descendants went in and took possession of it; you subdued its people, the Canaanites; you delivered them to your people along with their kings to do with them whatever they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They captured fortified towns and a fertile land; they took possession of houses full of every good thing: hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate their fill, got fat, and reveled in your great goodness. 26&quot;But they became disobedient, rebelled against you, tossed your Law aside, and killed the prophets that admonished them to come back to you; they committed great blasphemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So you delivered them to their oppressors; but when they appealed to you in their distress, you heard them from heaven, and with your great mercy, gave them deliverers to rescue them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But as soon as they got comfortable, they sinned again; so you abandoned them to their enemies, and they ruled over them. When they appealed to you again, you heard from heaven, and rescued them many times in your great mercy;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> and admonished them to return to your Law. But they acted arrogantly, ignored your commandments, sinned against your ordinances that if people observe, they&rsquo;ll live. They turned a stubborn shoulder, and stiffened their neck, and wouldn&rsquo;t listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> But you bore with them for many years and admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets; yet they wouldn&rsquo;t listen. So you delivered them to the nations that lived in the lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> But in your great mercy you didn&rsquo;t make an end to them or abandon them, because you&rsquo;re a gracious and merciful God. 32&quot;Now, great, powerful, awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love, don&rsquo;t consider the hardship insignificant that has come on us, our kings, officials, and priests, our prophets, ancestors, and all your people from the time of the kings of Assyria till now.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> You&rsquo;re justified in everything that&rsquo;s happened to us, because you&rsquo;ve dealt faithfully; but we&rsquo;ve acted sinfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors haven&rsquo;t kept your Law or paid attention to your commandments and admonitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But they, in their own kingdom, with your great goodness that you gave them, with the wide, rich land you set in front of them, did not serve you or turn from their sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> We&rsquo;re slaves today in the land you gave our ancestors to eat its fruit and bounty.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Its abundant produce is for the kings that you set over us because of our sins. They rule our bodies and our livestock as they please; we&rsquo;re in great distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Because of that, we&rsquo;re signing a covenant; and our officials, Levites, and priests have set their seal to it.&rdquo; People That Sealed the Covenant</span></p>
