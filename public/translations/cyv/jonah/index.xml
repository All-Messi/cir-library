      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jonah-chapter-1&#34;&gt;Jonah Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Yahveh told Jonah Ben-Amittai, 2&amp;quot;Go to Nineveh, that big city, and shout against it; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how sinful they are.&amp;quot; 3But Jonah ran away. 3He went down to Joppa, found a ship to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Yahveh hurled a gale on the sea, and it was about to break up the ship. 5The sailors were scared, and every man cried out to his god. They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Jonah had gone below and fallen sound asleep. 6The captain came and said, &amp;ldquo;How come you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll be concerned about us enough to keep us from dying.&amp;rdquo; 7They said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s cast lots to find out who caused this catastrophe to hit us.&amp;rdquo; They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. 8&amp;quot;Tell us, now! Why has this catastrophe fallen on us? What&amp;rsquo;s your job? What&amp;rsquo;s your country? Who are your people?&amp;quot; 9&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;m a Hebrew; I fear Yahveh God of heaven that made the land and sea.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jonah-chapter-3&#34;&gt;Jonah Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Yahveh told Jonah again, 2&amp;quot;Go to Nineveh, the big city, and deliver what I tell you.&amp;quot; 3So he went. It was a big city, a three-days&amp;rsquo; walk-through. 4He went through it one day&amp;rsquo;s walk and shouted, &amp;ldquo;God is going to overthrow Nineveh in 40 days.&amp;rdquo; 5The people believed him. They called for a fast and put on burlap from least to greatest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he got off his throne, laid his robe aside, covered himself with burlap, and sat on ashes. 7He issued a proclamation: &amp;ldquo;In Nineveh by decree of the king and his nobles: Don&amp;rsquo;t anybody—animal, herd, or flock—eat anything or drink water. 8People and animals have to wear burlap. Call on God earnestly so everyone will turn from sinfulness and violence. 9Who knows, maybe God will relent from his fierce anger and not destroy us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jonah 4</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/translations/cyv/jonah/chapter-04/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jonah-chapter-4&#34;&gt;Jonah Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; That really made Jonah mad. 2He told Yahveh, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I said back home and why I tried to run away to Tarshish. I knew you&amp;rsquo;re a gracious, merciful God, slow to get angry and full of enduring love, and relent from bringing catastrophe. 3So take my life; I&amp;rsquo;d be better off dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Yahveh asked, &amp;ldquo;What right do you have to be mad?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made a lean-to and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. 6Yahveh God had a plant grow up to shade him and give him relief. He was glad to see it. 7But at dawn the next day, God had a worm attack the plant, and it withered. 8When the sun came up, God had a scorching east wind blow and the sun beat down on Jonah&amp;rsquo;s head till he became faint and begged to die, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d be better off dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
