<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> King Nebuchadnezzar to the peoples, nations, and language groups that live all over the empire: &ldquo;Peace and prosperity!</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It has seemed good to me to tell about the signs and wonders the Most High God has done for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> How great his signs, how amazing his wonders! His kingdom&rsquo;s eternal, his dominion&rsquo;s forever!</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, living in prosperity in my palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> A dream terrified me; fantasies and visions alarmed me.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So I ordered the wise men in Babylon to come and explain what the dream meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers came. I told them the dream, but they couldn&rsquo;t interpret it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But finally Daniel (named Belteshazzar after my god), who has the spirit of the holy gods, came in, and I told him the dream, 9&rsquo;Belteshazzar, chief magician, since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell me what I was looking at and what it means.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I was in bed when I saw a really tall tree in the middle of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> It had grown tall and strong, as high as the sky, and visible all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, enough for everyone. Animals in the pasture lived in its shade; birds in the sky roosted in it; everyone fed themselves from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> As I kept watching, an angel watcher, a holy one, came down from the sky 14and shouted, &ldquo;Chop it down and cut off its limbs; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals run from under it and the birds fly from its branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, with an iron-bronze band around it in the new grass of the pasture. Let him be wet with the dew from the sky and share the grass with the animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Let his mind change from a man&rsquo;s to an animal&rsquo;s mind for seven periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> This sentence is by the angel watchers&rsquo; decree a command from the holy ones so the living can know that it&rsquo;s the Most High who rules the human realm, gives it to the one his chooses, and sets over it the lowliest of men.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> That&rsquo;s the dream I had. Tell me what it means, Belteshazzar. None of the wise men in my kingdom can do it. You can; you have the spirit of the holy gods in you.&rsquo; Daniel Interprets the Second Dream</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Daniel was distressed for a while as his thoughts about the meaning of the dream alarmed him. The king said, &lsquo;Belteshazzar, don&rsquo;t let the dream or its meaning alarm you.&rsquo; Belteshazzar answered, &lsquo;If only the dream applied to those who hate you, and its meaning applied to your enemies, my lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The tree you saw that grew tall and strong, as high as the sky and visible all over the world,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, enough for everybody, that animals in the pasture lived under, whose branches birds roosted in—</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> that&rsquo;s you, O King. You&rsquo;ve grown tall and strong; your majesty has become great and reached the sky; you exercise dominion everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The angel watcher you saw, a holy one, came down from the sky and shouted, &ldquo;Chop down the tree and destroy it; but leave the stump with its roots in the ground with an iron-bronze band around it in the new grass in the pasture. Let him be wet with the dew from the sky and share grass with wild animals till seven periods of time pass.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> That means it&rsquo;s a decree by the Most High that will happen to you:</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> you&rsquo;ll be driven from society and live with the animals in the pasture. You&rsquo;ll eat grass like a cow and be wet with the dew from the sky. Seven periods of time will pass till you recognize that it&rsquo;s the Most High that rules the human realm and gives it to the one he chooses.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The stump with its roots means you&rsquo;ll receive your empire back after you recognize that heaven rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So, O King, may my advice please you: break away now from your sins by doing good, from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, in case your prosperity can continue.&rdquo; The Dream&rsquo;s Fulfillment 28&quot;That all happened to Nebuchadnezzar. 29A year later, he was walking on his palace roof in Babylon 30an saying, &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Babylon the Great that I&rsquo;ve built as a royal residence by my power and splendor?&rsquo; 31While he was still saying it, a voice from heaven said, &lsquo;King Nebuchadnezzar, you&rsquo;ve lost your sovereignty.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> You&rsquo;ll be driven from society and live with the animals in the pasture. You&rsquo;ll eat grass like a cow, for seven periods of time till you recognize that it&rsquo;s the Most High that rules the human realm and gives it to the one he chooses.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> At once it happened. He was driven from society and began to eat grass like a cow. His body was wet from dew till his hair had grown like eagles&rsquo; feathers and his nails like birds&rsquo; claws. Nebuchadnezzar Restored 34&quot;But when that was past, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to the sky, my sanity came back, and I praised and honored the Most High who lives forever. His rule is everlasting; his kingdom continues to all generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> All people on earth amount to nothing, but he does what he decides in the host of heaven and among people on earth. Nobody can shove his hand away or say, &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; 36&quot;At the same time as my sanity returned my majesty and splendor came back to me for the glory of my empire; my advisors and nobles began to trust me, so I was secure again in my sovereignty and became greater than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, lift up, and honor the King of heaven; because everything he does is true, his ways are just, and he can humble the arrogant.&rdquo; The Handwriting on the Wall</span></p>
