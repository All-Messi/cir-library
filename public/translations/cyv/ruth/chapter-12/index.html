The Lybians, Sukkiim, and Nubians came with him without number. 4He captured the fortified towns in Judah and advanced to Jerusalem. 5Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and Judah&rsquo;s officials that had fled to Jerusalem to escape Shishak, &ldquo;Yahveh says you&rsquo;ve left him, so he&rsquo;s left you to Shishak.&rdquo; 6The officials of Israel and the king humbled themselves, &ldquo;Yahveh is good.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Kg 12:9-16</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They said, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t defrauded or oppressed us, or taken anything from anybody.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He said, &ldquo;Yahveh and his anointed are witnesses that you haven&rsquo;t found anything in my possession.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> By his twenty-third year, the priests still hadn&rsquo;t made the repairs. 7He said, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you repairing them? Don&rsquo;t take any more money from your acquaintances. Hand it over for the damages to the Temple.&rdquo; 8The priests agreed not to take any more money and to let others do the repairs.	 2 Kg 12:1-8</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When Yahveh saw that, he told Shemaiah, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve humbled themselves, so I won&rsquo;t destroy them. I&rsquo;ll grant them some measure of deliverance and not pour out my anger on Jerusalem by Shishak. 8But they&rsquo;ll become his slaves so they&rsquo;ll learn the difference between serving me and serving other countries.&rdquo; 	2 Ch 12:1-8</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> From Gad, brave soldiers came over to David in the stronghold in the open country. They were men trained in war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like lions&rsquo; faces. They were as fast as gazelles on the mountains. 9Numbered 1-11, they were Ezer, Obadiah, Eliab, 10Mishmannah, Jeremiah, 11Attai, Eliel, 12Johanan, Elzabad, 13Jeremiah, and Machbannai. 14They were commanders in the army. The least was worth 100; the best was worth 1,000. 15They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was flooding and put to flight everybody in the valleys to the east and the west.	1 Ch 12:1-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Shishak [Shoshenq I] came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures out of Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 10King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the commanders of the guard that guarded the king&rsquo;s palace. 11As often as the king went into Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple, the guards would carry them and then bring them back to the guard room. 12When he humbled himself, Yahveh turned his anger away, so he didn&rsquo;t destroy him completely. Conditions in Judah were tolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day. 13The king answered them harshly. He didn&rsquo;t take the elders&rsquo; advice 14and spoke to them according to the young men&rsquo;s advice, &ldquo;My father made your yoke heavy; I&rsquo;ll add to it. My father disciplined you with whips; I&rsquo;ll discipline you with scorpions.&rdquo; 15He ignored the people, a turn of affairs Yahveh let happen to bring about what he&rsquo;d told Jeroboam through Ahijah of Shiloh.	     1 Kg 12:1-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem. He was 41 when he began to rule, and he ruled for 17 years in the city where Yahveh had chosen to identify with. Rehoboam&rsquo;s mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 14He did evil because he didn&rsquo;t set his heart to look to Yahveh. 15The acts of Rehoboam, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and The Chronicles of Iddo the Seer by genealogical enrollment. There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam constantly. 16Rehoboam died and they buried him in The City of David, and his son Abijah became king.	2 Ch 12:9-16</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Nathan left.	 2 Sam 12:7-15a Yahveh struck the child, and it got sick. 16David asked God for the child and fasted. He went in and lay all night on the floor. 17The elders in his palace stood beside him, trying to get him up off the floor. But he wouldn&rsquo;t get up and didn&rsquo;t eat with them. 18The seventh day, the baby died. David&rsquo;s advisors were afraid to tell him. They said, &ldquo;While the child was still alive, we talked to him, and he didn&rsquo;t listen. How can we tell him the child has died? He may harm himself.&rdquo; 19But when he saw them whispering, he sensed that the child had died, &ldquo;Is he dead?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then some men from Benjamin and Judah came to David&rsquo;s stronghold. 17He went out to meet them, &ldquo;If you come peacefully to help me, my heart will be with yours. But if you&rsquo;ve come to betray me to my adversaries, since I haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong, may the God of our ancestors look at it and decide.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> At that time, Hazael, king of Aram, went and conquered Gath, then turned toward Jerusalem. 18Jehoash/Joash took the sacred things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated, along with his own sacred things and the gold in the treasuries in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s palace, and sent it to Hazael. So he let Jerusalem alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the 30,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> From Manasseh also some came over to David when he was going with the Philistines to fight Saul. (But he didn&rsquo;t end up helping them, because the lords of the Philistines conferred and sent him away, &ldquo;He might desert to his Saul and turn on us.&rdquo;) 20As he was going to Ziklag, these came over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, commanders of thousands in Manasseh. 21They helped him against the bands of raiders, because they were fearless soldiers and commanders in the army. 22Daily, men kept coming over to help David, till there was a large army like God&rsquo;s army.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then David got up off the floor, took a bath, anointed himself, and changed clothes. He went to Yahveh&rsquo;s Tabernacle and worshiped and went home. When he asked, they gave him some food and he ate. 21His advisors said, &ldquo;What have you done? You fasted and cried about the child while he was alive; but when he died, you got up and ate.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When Rehoboam got to Jerusalem, he gathered Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen soldiers, to fight Israel to restore the kingdom to himself. 22But a message from God came to Shemaiah, the man of God, 23&quot;Tell Rehoboam, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, 24Yahveh says not to fight their relatives the Israelites: go home; this thing has his approval.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He said, &ldquo;While he was still alive, I fasted and cried because I didn&rsquo;t know if Yahveh would be gracious to me and let it live. 23But now that he&rsquo;s dead, why fast? Can I bring him back? He won&rsquo;t come back to me, but I&rsquo;ll go to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> These are the divisions of armed troops that came to David in Hebron to turn Saul&rsquo;s kingdom over to him like Yahveh said: 29from Benjamin: 3,000 of Saul&rsquo;s relatives, the greater part previously allied with Saul&rsquo;s house. 32from Issachar: 200 chiefs that understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do; with their relatives at their command; 33from Zebulun: 50,000 seasoned troops, ready for battle and equipped with all kinds of weapons; who helped David wholeheartedly. 37from beyond the Jordan—Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe:  120,000 armed with all kinds of weapons.	 1 Ch 12:19-37</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and had relations with her. She had a son he named Solomon. Yahveh loved him 25and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah [Beloved of Yah] for Yahveh&rsquo;s sake.         	2 Sam 12:15b-25</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He went out from there and built Penuel. 26He said to himself, &ldquo;The kingdom will revert to David&rsquo;s descendants. 27If the people go up to offer sacrifices in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple at Jerusalem, their hearts will go back to Rehoboam, and they&rsquo;ll kill me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Joab fought the Ammonites in Rabbah and captured the royal city. 27He sent messengers to David, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve attacked Rabbah and seized the city&rsquo;s water supply. 28Gather the rest of the army and capture the city so I won&rsquo;t, and people name it after me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So he made two gold calves and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much trouble to go up to Jerusalem. Look, your gods, Israel, that brought you up from Egypt!&rdquo; 29He set one in Bethel and the other in Dan. 30That thing became a sin because the people went to worship at the one as far as Dan. 31He made houses on high places and appointed priests from among the people that didn&rsquo;t descend from Levi. 32-33He instituted a festival in Bethel on the fifteenth day, eighth month like the festival in Judah. He went up to burn incense on the altar there and sacrificed to the calves he&rsquo;d made. He stationed priests at the high places he&rsquo;d made there. 	1 Kg 12:25-33</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> David gathered the rest of the army, went to Rabbah, and captured it. 30He took their king&rsquo;s crown off his head. It weighed 75½ lbs one talent of gold and was set with precious stones. They put it on David&rsquo;s head. He brought large amounts of spoil out of the city. 31He also brought out its people, and put them under saws, iron picks and axes; and made them pass through the brick kilns. That&rsquo;s what he did to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the whole army went back to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> These battle-ready men came to Hebron fully intending to make David king over all Israel. The rest in Israel were also intent on making him king. 39They were there with him three days, eating and drinking, because their relatives had made preparations for them. 40People nearby and as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—great amounts of cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep. There was happiness in Israel.	1 Ch 12:38-40</span></p>
