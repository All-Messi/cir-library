The people will be in the courts of theY Temple. 6Don&rsquo;t let anybody go into theY Temple except the priests and servicing Levites. They can go in because they&rsquo;re holy. Have the people keep the charge of Yahveh. 7The Levites will surround the king with weapons in hand. Kill whoever comes into the Temple. Be with the king when he comes in and goes out.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He did away with the idolatrous priests Judah&rsquo;s kings had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the towns of Judah and around Jerusalem, those who burned incense to Baal, the sun, moon, and constellations—the host of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He removed the Asherah pole from Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple to the Kidron and burned it. He ground it to powder and threw it on the graves of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The Levites and Judah did what he said. Each one brought his men that were to come in on the Sabbath with the ones that were to go out on the Sabbath, because Jehoiada didn&rsquo;t dismiss any of the divisions. 9Jehoiada gave the commanders of hundreds King David&rsquo;s spears and large and small shields that were in the Temple. 10He stationed the men around the king from the south side of the Temple to the north, near the altar. 11Then they brought out the king&rsquo;s son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and declared him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; 	         2 Ch 23:1-11</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Three sons of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. 10-11The sons of Shimei were Jahath, first; Zina/Zizah, second. Jeush and Beriah didn&rsquo;t have very many sons, so they were all counted as one family. 	1 Ch 23:7-11</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When Athaliah heard people running and praising the king, she came into theY Temple. 13She saw the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the commanders and trumpeters beside him. The common people were celebrating and blowing trumpets. The singers with their musical instruments were leading the praise. She tore her clothes, &ldquo;Treason! Treason!&rdquo; 14Jehoiada brought out the commanders over the army and told them, &ldquo;Bring her out between the ranks and put to death with a sword anybody that tries to rescue her.&rdquo; The priests said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it in theY Temple.&rdquo; 15They seized her, and when she got to the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king&rsquo;s palace, they put her to death.	 2 Ch 23:12-15</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jehoiada made a covenant with the people and the king that they&rsquo;d be Yahveh&rsquo;s people. 17The people tore down Baal&rsquo;s temple, broke his altars and images into pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. 18He placed the officers of theY Temple under the Levitical priests that David had assigned over theY Temple, as written in the Law of Moses—with celebration and singing according to David&rsquo;s order. 19He stationed gatekeepers for theY Temple so nobody ceremonially unclean could go in. 20He took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, rulers of the people, and common people, and brought the king down from theY Temple through the upper gate to the king&rsquo;s palace and placed him on the throne. 21So the people celebrated, and the city grew quiet because they&rsquo;d put Athaliah to death with a sword. 	2 Ch 23:16-21</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Those were Levi&rsquo;s descendants by heads of families as counted in their census. They served in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple from 20 years old and up. 25David said, &ldquo;Yahveh God of Israel has given his people rest, and he lives in Jerusalem permanently. 26The Levites won&rsquo;t need to carry the Tabernacle and the utensils for its service.&rdquo; 27By David&rsquo;s last words, Levi&rsquo;s descendants were counted from 20 years old and up. 28They were to assist Aaron&rsquo;s descendants with the service in the courts and rooms in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple. They were to purify the holy things 29and help with the showbread, the fine flour for grain offerings, wafers without yeast, what&rsquo;s baked in the pan, or what&rsquo;s well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size. 30They were to stand each morning and evening to thank and praise Yahveh. 31They offered burnt offerings on Sabbaths, new moons, and scheduled festivals in the number set by the Law. 32They maintained the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place and helped Aaron&rsquo;s descendants with the service in Yahveh&rsquo;s house. 			1 Ch 23:24-32</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The rest of the acts of Josiah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 29During his reign, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up to the king of Assyria to the River Euphrates.
