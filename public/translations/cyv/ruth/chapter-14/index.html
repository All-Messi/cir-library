<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Asa did what was good. 3He removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the scared pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, 4and commanded Judah to look to Yahveh God of their ancestors and to observe the Law and the commandments. 5He removed the high places and incense altars from the towns in Judah. 6He built fortified towns in Judah since Yahveh had given the country rest. 7He said to Judah, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build these towns and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The country is still ours because we&rsquo;ve sought Yahveh, and he&rsquo;s given us rest all around.&rdquo; They built and prospered. 8Asa had a standing army of 300,000 from Judah that carried spears and large shields and 280,000 from Benjamin that carried shields and handled bows—fearless soldiers.	 2 Ch 14:1-8</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> She went to Ahijah&rsquo;s house at Shiloh. He couldn&rsquo;t see because of his age. 5Yahveh had told him, &ldquo;Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife is coming to ask about her son that&rsquo;s sick. Tell her such and such; when she gets here, she&rsquo;ll pretend to be another woman.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Ahijah heard her footsteps coming in the door, he said, &ldquo;Come in, Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife, why pretend to be another woman? I&rsquo;m sent to you with a harsh message. 7Tell Jeroboam that Yahveh God of Israel says, &lsquo;I lifted you up from among the people and made you Israel&rsquo;s leader. 8I tore the kingdom away from David&rsquo;s descendants and gave it to you. But you&rsquo;ve not been like David. He kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart and did only what I said was right. 9You&rsquo;ve done more evil than anybody before you. You&rsquo;ve made other gods and molten images and tossed me aside. 10So I&rsquo;ll bring catastrophe on your family: I&rsquo;ll eliminate from you every male, bond or free, and consume your family like a person burns up manure. 11Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field; I&rsquo;ve said so.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When the Philistines heard they&rsquo;d anointed David king over all Israel, they went up to look for him. He heard about it and went out against them. 9They&rsquo;d made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 10David asked God, &ldquo;Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?&rdquo; Yahveh said, &ldquo;Yes, go on up.&rdquo; 11They went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them. He said, &ldquo;God has used me to &lsquo;break through&rsquo; my enemies like a flash flood&rdquo;; so they named the place Baal-perazim. 12The Philistines abandoned their gods there; David had them burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now Zerah the Nubian came out against them at Mareshah with 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. 10Asa went out to engage him. They drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zaphathah at Mareshah. 11Asa called to Yahveh, &ldquo;No one but you can help us in this battle of the weak against the strong. You&rsquo;re our God. Help us against this army. Don&rsquo;t let any mortal prevail against you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, &ldquo;Bring me whoever says anything. He won&rsquo;t bother you again.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But Amaziah ignored him; Jehoash went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 12Israel defeated Judah and each man fled home. 13Jehoash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh, came to Jerusalem, and tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—600ft. 14He took the gold, silver, and utensils in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s treasuries, as well as hostages, and went back to Samaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh routed the Nubians in front of Asa and Judah. 13Asa and the people chased them as far as Gerar. So many Nubians fell that they couldn&rsquo;t recover. Yahveh and his army shattered them. Judah carried away a lot of plunder. 14They destroyed the towns around Gerar because the dread of Yahveh had fallen on them. They plundered them all, a lot of plunder. 15They also struck down the livestock owners and took away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem.  	     2 Ch 14:9-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 14David asked God again, and he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attack them head on. Circle around behind them and come at them across from the balsam trees. 15When you hear marching in the tops of the balsam trees, attack. God will have gone out ahead of you to strike their army.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The rest of the acts of Jehoash, the strength of his rule, and his war with Amaziah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 16He died and they buried him in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son JeroboamII became king.	2 Kg 14:8-16</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> David did that, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 17His fame went out to all the countries, and Yahveh made them afraid of him. 	1 Ch 14:8-17</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Amaziah lived 15 years after the death of Jehoash. 18The rest of the acts of Amaziah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 19A conspiracy against him in Jerusalem caused him to flee to Lachish, but they sent assassins and killed him there. 20-21The people in Judah took his son Azariah/Uzziah and made him king at 16. 22He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king died.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hide anything I&rsquo;m about to ask you. 19Is Joab involved in this with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;As sure as you&rsquo;re alive, nobody can stray away from anything you&rsquo;ve said. Joab told me to say that. 20He did it to change how things are going. But you are wise, like an angel of God. You know what&rsquo;s going on in the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The rest of the acts of Jeroboam—how he ruled and made war—are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 20He ruled for 22 years and died. His son Nadab reigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Rehoboam ruled in Judah. He was 41 when he became king and ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city Yahveh chose from the tribes of Israel to identify with. His mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22Judah provoked Yahveh more than their ancestors did. 23They built high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree. 24There were male cult prostitutes in the land. They did all the disgusting things the nations did that Yahveh originally drove out for Israel.	    1 Kg 14:21-24</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joab fell on his face and blessed him. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re pleased with me today. You&rsquo;ve done what I asked.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, JeroboamII Ben-Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria and ruled for 41 years. 24He didn&rsquo;t abandon the sins of JeroboamI Ben-Nebat that got Israel to sin. 25He restored Israel&rsquo;s border from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of Arabah in keeping with Yahveh&rsquo;s message through Jonah Ben-Amittai, prophet from Gath-hepher. 26Yahveh saw that Israel&rsquo;s suffering was bitter, whether bond or free, and there was nobody to help them. 27Since Yahveh hadn&rsquo;t yet said he&rsquo;d blot out Israel, he saved them by JeroboamII.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The men in Israel were totally exhausted because Saul had put them under oath, &ldquo;Accursed is the man that eats before evening, until I&rsquo;ve avenged myself of my enemies.&rdquo; So nobody had eaten anything. 25-26When they went into the forest, they&rsquo;d found honeycomb on the ground, but nobody put any in his mouth out of respect for the oath. 27But Jonathan hadn&rsquo;t heard about his father&rsquo;s oath. He dipped the end of his staff in the honeycomb, and put some in his mouth, and he was refreshed. 28One of the people said, &ldquo;Your father strictly put the people under oath, &lsquo;The man that eats today is under a curse.&rsquo;&rdquo; The people were exhausted. 29Jonathan said, &ldquo;My father has created a problem. See how I&rsquo;ve been refreshed because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much more if the people had eaten freely from the spoils! As it is, the slaughter among the Philistines wasn&rsquo;t that great.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, came up and attacked Jerusalem. 26He took away the treasures in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s palace, and everything Solomon had made, including the gold shields. 27Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard for the king&rsquo;s palace. 28Whenever he went to the Temple, the guards would carry them and bring them back to the guardroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The rest of the acts of JeroboamII, the strength of his rule, and how he fought and recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel (cities that had belonged to Judah), are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 29He died and his son Zechariah became king.	 2 Kg 14:17-29</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The rest of the acts of Rehoboam are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 30War went on constantly between him and Jeroboam. 31He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Abijam became king.	    1 Kg 14:25-31</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Joab went to Absalom&rsquo;s house and asked, &ldquo;Why did your servants burn my field?&rdquo; 32&quot;I sent for you so I could send you to ask the king why I&rsquo;ve come back from Geshur. It&rsquo;d be better for me to still be there. Let me see him. If I&rsquo;ve sinned, he can put me to death.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When Joab went to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. He came and prostrated himself, and the king kissed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then Saul said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down after the Philistines at night and take spoil till daylight. Don&rsquo;t leave one survivor.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Saul asked God, &ldquo;Should we go down after the Philistines? Will you give them to Israel?&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t answer him that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;Come here, you chiefs of the people, and find out how this sin happened today. 39As sure as Yahveh lives who delivers Israel, even if it&rsquo;s Jonathan, he&rsquo;ll die.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Then he said to them, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on one side; Jonathan and I are on the other.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Saul told Yahveh, &ldquo;Give a clear answer.&rdquo; The lot fell on Jonathan and Saul.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;Cast lots between me and Jonathan.&rdquo; The lot fell on Jonathan.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> He said to Jonathan, &ldquo;What did you do?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;God do this to me and more also because you&rsquo;ll surely die, Jonathan.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> But the people said to Saul, &ldquo;Does Jonathan have to die who brought about this great deliverance? Far from it! As sure as Yahveh lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground; he&rsquo;s worked with God today.&rdquo; The people rescued him. 46Saul quit chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went home.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> When Saul took over the kingship, he fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He inflicted punishment wherever he went. 48He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and delivered Israel from plunderers.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Saul&rsquo;s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> His wife was Ahinoam Bat-Ahimaaz. 51His father was Kish; 52During Saul&rsquo;s whole life, he was constantly at war with the Philistines. Whenever he saw a strong or brave man, he&rsquo;d attach him to his staff.</span></p>
