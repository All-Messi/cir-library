If you look for him, he&rsquo;ll let you find him. If you leave him, he&rsquo;ll leave you. 3For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, without law. 4But in their distress they turned to Yahveh and looked for him, and he let them find him. 5In those times, there wasn&rsquo;t any peace to the ones who traveled; disturbances troubled the people in many countries. 6Nation crushed nation, city crushed city, because God distressed them with all kinds of problems. 7But you, be strong. Don&rsquo;t lose courage; there&rsquo;s reward for your work.&quot;</span></p>

He stole away the hearts of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, &ldquo;Let me go pay the vow I made to Yahveh in Hebron. 8I took a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram that if Yahveh brought me back to Jerusalem, I&rsquo;d serve him.&rdquo; He went to Hebron. 10But he sent spies throughout the tribes and said, &ldquo;As soon as you hear the ram&rsquo;s horn, say, &lsquo;Absalom is king in Hebron!&rsquo;&rdquo; 11Then 200 men went with him from Jerusalem. They went innocently, not knowing what was going on. 12Absalom sent for Ahithophel, David&rsquo;s advisor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices.
