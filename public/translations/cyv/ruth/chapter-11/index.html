The Jebusites, natives in the land, lived there. 5They told David, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get in here&rdquo;; but he captured the fortress of Zion (The City of David). 6He had said, &ldquo;Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be general of the army.&rdquo; Joab Ben-Zeruiah went up first, so he became the general. 7David lived in the fortress; so they called it The City of David. 8He built the city all around from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Joab repaired the rest of Jerusalem. 9David became greater and greater because Yahveh was with him.	1 Ch 11:1-9</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The priests and Levites throughout Israel stood with him from all their districts. 14The Levites abandoned their pastures and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to Yahveh. 15He set up his own priests for the high places, satyrs, and calves he&rsquo;d made. 16People from all the tribes that set their hearts on looking to Yahveh God of Israel, followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahveh God of their ancestors. 17They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam for three years; they followed the way of David and Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh raised up Hadad the Edomite against Solomon.

(16Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he&rsquo;d killed every male in Edom.) 17Hadad fled to Egypt with some of his father&rsquo;s officials when he was a boy. 18They left Midian and went to Paran. They took people with them from Paran and went on to Pharaoh. He gave him a house and land and assigned him food. 19He came to like Hadad so much that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 20She had Hadad&rsquo;s son Genubath and weaned him in Pharaoh&rsquo;s palace. Genubath was in Pharaoh&rsquo;s palace with his sons. 21But when Hadad heard that David had died and Joab was dead, he said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Let me leave so I can go to my own country.&quot;</span></p>

But he wouldn&rsquo;t drink it; he poured it out to Yahveh. 19&quot;In the presence of my God, I can&rsquo;t do that. Should I, in effect, drink these men&rsquo;s blood who risked their lives to bring it?&rdquo; Those were exploits the three powerful men did.	1 Ch 11:10-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahveh, the king, and the people that they would be Yahveh&rsquo;s people. 18They tore down Baal&rsquo;s temple, broke his altars and images into small pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. The priest appointed officers over the Temple. 19He took the commanders of hundreds, the Carite mercenaries, the guards, and the people. They brought the king down from the Temple past the guards&rsquo; gate to the king&rsquo;s palace, and he took his seat on the throne. 20The people celebrated and the city grew quiet.</span></p>

She bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 21Rehoboam loved Maacah more than his other wives and concubines. He&rsquo;d married 18 wives and 60 concubines and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters. 22He appointed Abijah as leader among his brothers because he intended to make him king. 23He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified towns, and gave them food in abundance, and sought many wives for them.  	    2 Ch 11:13-23</span></p>
