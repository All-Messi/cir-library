<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> His son Jehoshaphat became king and secured his position against Israel. 2He placed troops in Judah&rsquo;s fortified towns and set garrisons in Judah and the towns in Ephraim his father had captured. 3Yahveh was with him because he followed his ancestor David&rsquo;s earlier days and didn&rsquo;t look to the images of Baal. 4He sought his father&rsquo;s God, followed his commandments, and didn&rsquo;t do like Israel. 5Yahveh secured the kingdom under him, Judah brought tributes to him, and he had great wealth and honor. 6He took pride in the ways of Yahveh and removed again the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 17:10-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> That same night, the message from God came to him, 4&quot;Go tell my servant David, &lsquo;Yahveh says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to build me a temple. 5I haven&rsquo;t lived in a temple since I brought Israel up. I&rsquo;ve gone from tent to tent and place to place. 6In all the places where I&rsquo;ve lived with Israel, have I asked any judge that I&rsquo;ve commanded to shepherd my people why he hasn&rsquo;t built me a cedar temple?&rdquo;&rsquo; 7Tell David, &lsquo;Yahveh of hosts says, &ldquo;I took you out of the pasture from behind sheep and made you a leader over Israel. 8I&rsquo;ve been with you wherever you&rsquo;ve gone and removed your enemies from you. I&rsquo;ll make you as famous as anyone that&rsquo;s ever lived in the world. 9I&rsquo;ll appoint you a place for my people, and plant them so they won&rsquo;t have to move anymore. Sinful people won&rsquo;t lay waste to them like they did before, 10including the time I put judges over them. I&rsquo;ll subdue your enemies and build you a dynasty. 11When your life&rsquo;s over and you&rsquo;ve gone to your ancestors, I&rsquo;ll set up one of your sons and secure his throne permanently. 12He&rsquo;ll build me a temple. 13I&rsquo;ll be his father, and he&rsquo;ll be my son. I won&rsquo;t take my enduring love away from him like I did with your predecessor. 14I&rsquo;ll settle him in my house and kingdom permanently.&rdquo;&rsquo;&quot;	1 Ch 17:1-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The plan pleased Absalom and Israel&rsquo;s elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He went to live by Brook Cherith. 6Ravens brought him bread and meat morning and evening, and he drank from the stream. 7After a while it dried up because it hadn&rsquo;t rained.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In his third year, he sent his officials Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the towns in Judah. 8He sent with them Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, who were Levites, and with them the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 9They taught the people throughout Judah, having the Book of the Law with them. 	2 Ch 17:1-9</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to him, 9&quot;Go to Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay. I&rsquo;ve commanded a widow there to provide for you.&quot; 10He went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, a widow was gathering sticks. He called to her, &ldquo;Please get me a little water in a jug to drink.&rdquo; 	1 Kg 17:1-10</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The kingdoms around Judah dreaded Yahveh; so they didn&rsquo;t start any wars with Jehoshaphat. 11Some Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute. The Arabians brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 12He grew greater and greater, and built fortresses and store towns in Judah. 13He had large supplies in the towns in Judah, and trained soldiers in Jerusalem. 14This was their muster according to their families: Judah had commanders of thousands; Adnah was the commander with 300,000 soldiers. 15Beside him was Johanan the commander with 280,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As she was going to get it, he called to her to bring him a piece of bread too.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They served idols Yahveh told them not to serve, 13even though he warned Israel and Judah through his prophets and seers, &ldquo;Turn from your sins and keep my commandments, my statutes—the whole Law I&rsquo;ve commanded your ancestors through the prophets.&rdquo; 14But they ignored him. They stiffened their necks like the ancestors who didn&rsquo;t believe in Yahveh. 15They rejected the statutes and the covenant he made with their ancestors and dismissed his warnings. They became vain and followed the nations around them that he commanded them not to be like.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Elijah told her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Do what you&rsquo;ve said but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out. Then you can make one for you and your boy. 14Yahveh God of Israel says the bowl of flour won&rsquo;t get empty, and the jug of oil won&rsquo;t go dry before it rains.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Absalom and the men of Israel said, &ldquo;Hushai&rsquo;s advice is better than Ahithophel&rsquo;s.&rdquo; That happened because Yahveh had ordained to thwart Ahithophel&rsquo;s good advice so Yahveh could bring catastrophe on Absalom.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Nathan told David everything in his vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Beside him was Amasiah Ben-Zichri, who volunteered for Yahveh, with 200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In Benjamin, Eliada a fearless soldier, had 200,000 armed with bow and shield.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Beside him was Jehozabad with 180,000 equipped for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Those served the king, not counting the ones he put in the fortified towns all around Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He called out, &ldquo;Yahveh my God, have you brought misfortune on the widow I&rsquo;ve been staying with by causing her son to die?&rdquo; 21He stretched out on the child three times and called out again, &ldquo;Please bring him back.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> After they left, the men came up out of the well and went to tell David. &ldquo;Quick, get up and cross the water because Ahithophel has advised against you.&rdquo; 22David and every person with him crossed the Jordan by sunup. 23When Ahithophel saw that Absalom hadn&rsquo;t followed his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his town. He set his house in order and hanged himself. They buried him in his father&rsquo;s grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh listened, and the child revived.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Elijah brought him down to his mother. &ldquo;See, he&rsquo;s alive.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the towns in Samaria in place of the Israelites. 25When they first started living there, they didn&rsquo;t respect Yahveh. He sent lions among them and killed some of them. 26They spoke to the king of Assyria, &ldquo;The nations you exiled into the towns in Samaria don&rsquo;t know the Law of the god of the land. He has sent lions among them to kill them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They said, &ldquo;Have you seen this man that keeps coming up to defy Israel? The king will greatly enrich the man that kills him. He&rsquo;ll give him his daughter and exempt his father&rsquo;s family from paying taxes in Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> David asked the men standing by him, &ldquo;What will the king do for the man that kills this Philistine and takes disgrace away from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then the king commanded, &ldquo;Bring one of the priests you exiled, and have him live there and teach them the Law of the god of the land.&rdquo; 	2 Kg 17:16-27</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> One of the priests they&rsquo;d exiled came and lived at Bethel and taught them how to respect Yahveh. 29But every nation in the towns where they lived still made gods of their own and put them at the pagan shrines the people of Samaria had made. 30The people from Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima, 31the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech their gods. 32They also feared Yahveh and appointed priests for the high places, who acted for them in the shrines there. 33They feared Yahveh and served their own gods like they did where they came from.   	2 Kg 17:18-33</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But David said, &ldquo;What have I done now? I just asked a question!&rdquo; 30Then he turned to someone else and asked the same thing and got the same answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When what David said was heard, they told Saul, and he sent for him. 32David told him, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s heart should fail over this Philistine. I&rsquo;ll fight him.&rdquo; 33&quot;You can&rsquo;t fight him; you&rsquo;re just a boy. He&rsquo;s been a soldier since he was your age.&rdquo; 34&quot;I&rsquo;ve tended my father&rsquo;s sheep. When a lion or bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 35I went after it and struck it and rescued the lamb from its mouth. When it attacked me, I grabbed its jaw and struck it and killed it. 36I&rsquo;ve killed a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has taunted the armies of the living God. 37Yahveh that delivered me from a lion and a bear, will deliver me from this Philistine.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> They&rsquo;ve kept the earlier customs ever since. They don&rsquo;t respect Yahveh or follow his statutes, ordinances, Law, or commandments to Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, that he named Israel 35and made a covenant with, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear other gods, bow to them, serve them, sacrifice to them. 36Fear Yahveh that brought you out of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Bow to him and sacrifice to him. 37Observe forever the statutes, ordinances, Law, and commandment he wrote for you. [38] 39Fear Yahveh your God, and he&rsquo;ll deliver you from your enemies.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Saul dressed David in his clothes, put a bronze helmet on his head, and put his armor on him. 39David bound his sword over his armor and tried to walk because he wasn&rsquo;t used to them. He told Saul, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go with these on. I&rsquo;m not used to them.&rdquo; He took them off. 40He took his staff and chose five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in his shepherd&rsquo;s pouch. With his sling in hand, he went toward the Philistine.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> They didn&rsquo;t listen; 41while they feared Yahveh, they also served their idols. Their children and grandchildren still do that.       	2 Kg 17:34-41</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> The Philistine came toward David behind his shield bearer. 42When he looked up and saw David, he sneered. He was just a handsome barefaced boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> The Philistine said, &ldquo;Am I a dog that you come to me with sticks?&rdquo; He cursed David by his gods. 44&quot;Come here; I&rsquo;ll give your body to the birds from the sky and the animals in the field.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> David told the Philistine, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I&rsquo;m coming to you in the name of Yahveh of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel that you&rsquo;ve taunted. 46He&rsquo;ll deliver you to me today. I&rsquo;ll strike you down and take off your head. I&rsquo;ll give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds and wild animals so the whole world will know there&rsquo;s a God in Israel. 47This whole assembly will know that he doesn&rsquo;t deliver by sword or spear. The battle is Yahveh&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;ll give youpl to us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> When the Philistine came to meet him, David ran fast toward the battle line to meet him. 49He put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine in the forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell on his face.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone. He struck him and killed him, but David didn&rsquo;t have a sword. 51He ran and stood over the Philistine, drew his sword out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 52Israel and Judah rose up and raised the battle cry. They chased the Philistines to the mouth of the valley and the gates of Ekron. Slain Philistines lay along the road to Shaaraim, all the way to Gath and Ekron. 53Israel came back from chasing them and plundered their camps. 54David picked up the Philistine&rsquo;s head and took it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent. 55When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, his general, &ldquo;Whose son is he? 57So when David came back from killing the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul with the Philistine&rsquo;s head in his hand. 58Saul asked him, &ldquo;Whose son are you, young man?&quot;</span></p>
