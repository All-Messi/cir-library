The blind and lame will stop you.&rdquo; They thought he couldn&rsquo;t do it, 7but he captured the Zion fortress, The City of David. 8He said that day, &ldquo;Whoever strikes the Jebusites, reach &rsquo;the lame and blind&rsquo; [that David hated] through the water tunnel.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why people say, &ldquo;&lsquo;The blind and lame&rsquo; won&rsquo;t get into the house.&rdquo; 9David lived in the fortress and named it The City of David [Ir-David].

Your flesh will be restored, and you&rsquo;ll be clean.&rdquo; 11Naaman was furious and left, &ldquo;I thought surely he&rsquo;d come out and call on Yahveh his God, and wave his hand over the place to cure a leper. 12Aren&rsquo;t Abanah and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than any river in Israel? Couldn&rsquo;t I have dipped myself in them to be clean?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Hiram gave him as much cedar and cypress as he wanted. 11Each year Solomon gave him 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of wheat and 1800 gallons 20 kors of pressed olive oil for his household. 12Yahveh gave Solomon wisdom like he&rsquo;d promised. Hiram and Solomon signed a peace treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the priests came out of the Holy Place, they&rsquo;d sanctified themselves without regard to divisions. 12The Levitical singers Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. They stood east of the altar with 120 priests blowing trumpets. 13The singers made themselves heard to Yahveh&rsquo;s praise and honor, and sang out accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments. When they praised Yahveh, and said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good because his love endures forever,&rdquo; his Temple filled with such a cloud 14the priests couldn&rsquo;t carry out their service. Yahveh&rsquo;s glory filled his Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> His officers came up to him, &ldquo;Father, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, wouldn&rsquo;t you have done it? How much more when he just says to dip yourself to be clean?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe were 44,760—brave men who carried shield and sword, shot bow and arrow, were capable in battle. 19They fought the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 20God helped them and delivered the Hagrites and everybody that was with them, because they cried out to God in the battle. He granted their petition because they trusted in him. 21They took their livestock: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 men. 22Many fell slain because the war came from God. They settled in their place. 23The descendants of the Manasseh half-tribe lived in the land. They were numerous from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon. 24The heads of their clans were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, trained soldiers, famous men. 25But they sinned against their ancestors&rsquo; God and committed prostitution with the gods of the people in the land God had destroyed. 26The God of Israel stirred up Pul, king of Assyria—also known as Tilgath-pilneser/Tiglathpileser—and he took Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe into exile, to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River ever since. 	1 Ch 5:11-26</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He told him, &ldquo;Have a good day.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Gehazi thought, &ldquo;My master has spared this Naaman the Aramean by not accepting what he brought. As sure as Yahveh lives, I&rsquo;ll run and accept something from him.&rdquo; 21When Naaman saw somebody running after him, he got down out of the chariot to meet him, &ldquo;Is everything all right?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He said, &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine. My master sent me to say that two young men from the school of the prophets just came from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them 75½ lbs a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Naaman said, &ldquo;Please take 151 lbs two talents.&rdquo; 	2 Kg 5:20-23a He urged him and put 151 lbs two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his men to carry ahead of him. 24When Gehazi got to the hill, he took them and put them in the house, and they left. 25But when he went inside, Elisha said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> David did that and struck them down from Geba to Gezer.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Didn&rsquo;t my spirit go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you?
