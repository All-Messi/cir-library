<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the people in Jerusalem made Ahaziah/Jehoahaz, his youngest son, king. The band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp had killed the older sons. 2Ahaziah was 22 and ruled for 1 year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri. 3To his destruction, he also followed Ahab&rsquo;s practices because his mother gave him bad counsel. 4He sinned in 5going with Jehoram Ben-Ahab to fight Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram/Jehoram. 6He came back to heal in Jezreel from his wounds at Ramah. Ahaziah Ben-Joram/Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram/Jehoram in Jezreel because he was wounded.	2 Ch 22:1-6</span></p>

I&rsquo;ll give him rest from his enemies everywhere. His name will be Solomon because I&rsquo;ll give Israel &lsquo;peace&rsquo; and quiet during his life. 10He&rsquo;ll build a temple for me. He&rsquo;ll be my son, and I&rsquo;ll be his father. I&rsquo;ll make his kingdom permanently secure.&rsquo; 11Yahveh be with you so you can succeed at building it. 12May he give you with discretion and intelligence, and give you charge over Israel so you can keep his Law. 13You&rsquo;ll prosper if you observe carefully the statutes and ordinances he commanded Moses.

You can add to that. 15You have lots of stonecutters, stone masons, and carpenters skilled in all kinds of work. 16There&rsquo;s no limit to the gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get started.
