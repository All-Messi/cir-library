Lighten his hard service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we&rsquo;ll serve you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But they were too afraid, &ldquo;Two kings couldn&rsquo;t stand against him. How can we?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The steward of the household, the mayor of the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children sent Jehu a message, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re your servants; we&rsquo;ll do whatever you say. We won&rsquo;t make anybody king. Do what you want to.&rdquo; 6He wrote them a second letter, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re with me, take the heads of your master&rsquo;s sons and meet me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.&rdquo; 	2 Kg 10:1-6a The chief men in the city were raising the king&rsquo;s sons. 7When the letter came, they killed his 70 sons, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He consulted the elders that had served his father Solomon, &ldquo;How do you advise me to answer the people?&rdquo; 7&quot;If you&rsquo;ll be kind to them, please them, and speak good words to them, they&rsquo;ll serve you permanently.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When the Israelites in the valley saw they&rsquo;d fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; the Philistines came and lived in them. 8The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons. 9They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and the people. 10They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 11When Jabesh-gilead heard what they&rsquo;d done to Saul, 12brave men got up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons, buried their bones under the terebinth tree in Jabesh, and fasted for a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But he disregarded their advice and consulted the young men he grew up with and served him. 9He asked them, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your advice?&rdquo; 10&quot;Tell them, &lsquo;My little finger is thicker than my father&rsquo;s thighs! 11He loaded you with a heavy yoke; I&rsquo;ll make it heavier. He disciplined you with whips; I&rsquo;ll discipline you with scorpions.&rsquo;&rdquo;	2 Ch 10:1-11</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In the morning he went out and told the people, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re innocent. I plotted against your master and killed him, but who killed all these? 10Know then that nothing Yahveh said about Ahab&rsquo;s family will fall to the ground. He&rsquo;s done what he said through Elijah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and large amounts of spices and precious stones. Never again did such an abundance of spices come in as she brought him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jehu killed everybody from Ahab&rsquo;s family in Jezreel, as well as his chief men, acquaintances, and priests. There weren&rsquo;t any survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day like he&rsquo;d directed them. 13The king answered them harshly and didn&rsquo;t take the elders&rsquo; advice. 14&quot;My father made your yoke heavy; I&rsquo;ll make it heavier. My father disciplined you with whips; I&rsquo;ll discipline you with scorpions.&rdquo; 15He didn&rsquo;t listen to the people, a turn of events Yahveh allowed with the result that he would bring about his message through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So Saul died for his trespass against Yahveh 14and because he inquired from a medium instead of Yahveh. He killed him and turned the kingdom over to David.     	1 Ch 10:1-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, &ldquo;Take them alive.&rdquo; They took them alive and then decided to kill every one of them at the pit at Beth-eked—42 men.	 2 Kg 10:6b-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he left there, he met Jehonadab Ben-Rechad, coming to meet him. He greeted him, &ldquo;Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?&rdquo; Jehu said, &ldquo;Give me your hand.&rdquo; He took him up into the chariot, 16&quot;Come with me and see how devoted I am to Yahveh.&quot; He had him ride in his chariot.  17When he got to Samaria, he killed everybody that remained to Ahab there—like Yahveh told Elijah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When Israel saw that the king didn&rsquo;t listen to them, they answered, Israel left and went home. 17But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites in the towns in Judah. 18He sent Hadoram, who oversaw forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. 19Israel has been in rebellion against David&rsquo;s dynasty ever since.	 2 Ch 10:12-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Samuel called the people to Yahveh at Mizpah 18and told them, &ldquo;Yahveh God of Israel, says, &lsquo;I brought you out of Egypt and delivered you from the Egyptians and the kingdoms that oppressed you.&rsquo; 19But today you&rsquo;ve rejected the God who saved you from your calamities and distresses. You&rsquo;ve said, &lsquo;No, install a king over us.&rsquo; Present yourselves to Yahveh by tribes and by thousands.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jehu got the people together and told them, &ldquo;Ahab served Baal a little; I&rsquo;ll serve him a lot. 19Call the Baal prophets, worshipers, and priests. Make sure everybody&rsquo;s here because I&rsquo;m holding a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever&rsquo;s absent won&rsquo;t live.&rdquo; But it was a trick to destroy the Baal worshipers. 20He said, &ldquo;Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.&rdquo; They declared it. 21He sent all over Israel and the Baal worshipers came. There wasn&rsquo;t a man that didn&rsquo;t go into Baal&rsquo;s temple and fill it end to end. 22He told the one in charge of the wardrobe, &ldquo;Bring out robes for the worshipers.&rdquo; He did that. 23Jehu went in with Jehonadab and told the Baal worshipers, &ldquo;Make sure there aren&rsquo;t any worshipers of Yahveh.&rdquo; 24Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stationed 80 men outside, &ldquo;Whoever lets a man escape that I bring to you will give his life in exchange for it.&rdquo; 	2 Kg 10:15-24</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Samuel brought the tribes forward, and Benjamin was taken by lot. 21He brought Benjamin forward by families, and the Matrite family was taken by lot. Finally, he brought the Matrite family forward one by one, and Saul Ben-Kish was taken by lot. But they couldn&rsquo;t find him. 22They asked Yahveh again, &ldquo;Did the man come here?&rdquo; Yahveh said, &ldquo;He hid in the baggage.&rdquo; 23They ran and got him. When he stood among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> King Solomon became wealthier and wiser than all the other kings in the world. 24The whole world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God had put in him. 25Everybody brought a gift, silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much each year. 	1 Kg 10:14-25</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Samuel said to the people, &ldquo;See who Yahveh has chosen? There&rsquo;s none like him among you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> As soon as he&rsquo;d finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and royal officers, &ldquo;Go in, kill them; don&rsquo;t let anybody get out.&rdquo; They killed them with swords, and the guard and royal officers threw them out. They went to the inner room of Baal&rsquo;s temple 26and brought out the sacred pillars and burned them. 27They demolished his sacred pillar, tore down his temple, and made it a toilet ever since. 28So Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Solomon gathered 1,400 chariots and 12,000 calvary and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 27He made silver as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lower western hills. 28His merchants obtained horses from Egypt and Kue for a price. 29He imported Egyptian chariots for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver each and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver apiece. Then he exported them to the kings of the Hittites and of Aram.  	    1 Kg 10:26-29</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But, Jehu didn&rsquo;t stop the sins Jeroboam caused Israel to do—the gold calves at Bethel and Dan. 30Yahveh told him, &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve done to Ahab&rsquo;s family what I wanted, your descendants will sit on Israel&rsquo;s throne for four generations.&rdquo; 31But Jehu wasn&rsquo;t careful to follow the Law of Yahveh with all his heart. 	2 Kg 10:25-31</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then Yahveh began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout Israel&rsquo;s territory: 33from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon—Gilead and Bashan. 34The rest of the acts of Jehu and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 35He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became king. 36Jehu ruled Israel for 28 years in Samaria. 	2 Kg 10:32-36</span></p>
