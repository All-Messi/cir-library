<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, circulated again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahveh God of their ancestors. 5He appointed judges in each fortified city in Judah, 6&quot;Consider what you&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;re not just judging for people but for Yahveh that&rsquo;s with you. 7Respect him; he won&rsquo;t take part in sin, partiality, or bribery.&rdquo;	2 Ch 19:1-7</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then Joab went into the house and told the king, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shamed your men today. They&rsquo;ve saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives and concubines. 6By loving the ones that hate you and hating the ones that love you, you&rsquo;ve shown that officers and troops don&rsquo;t mean anything to you. If Absalom was alive and all of us dead, you&rsquo;d be pleased. 7Get up; go speak graciously to them. I swear by Yahveh, if you don&rsquo;t, not a man will spend the night with you. This will be worse than all the bad things that have come on you since you were young.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the Ammonites saw they&rsquo;d been offensive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 37¾ tons 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and Zobah. 7They hired 32,000 chariots, the king of Maacah, and his soldiers. They camped by Medeba. The Ammonites gathered from their towns and came to battle. 8When David heard it, he sent Joab and the whole army, the strongest soldiers. 9The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The kings that had come were by themselves in the field.    	1 Ch 19:1-9</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then Jonathan called David and told him. He brought David to Saul, and he was with him like before.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and heads of families to judge disputes, 9&quot;Do this in respect for Yahveh, faithfully and wholeheartedly. 10Whenever a dispute comes to you from your relatives that live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, warn them so they won&rsquo;t be guilty to Yahveh and wrath won&rsquo;t come on you or them. 11Amariah the chief priest will manage everything that has to do with Yahveh. Zebadiah Ben-Ishmael, ruler of Judah, will manage everything that has to do with the king. The Levites will be officers in your presence. Act resolutely; Yahveh be with the godly.&rdquo;	 2 Ch 19:8-11</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He came upon a cave and stayed there, and a message from Yahveh came to him, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he selected elite soldiers and arrayed them against the Arameans. 11The rest he placed under his brother Abishai, and they arrayed themselves against the Ammonites. 12He said, &ldquo;If the Arameans are too strong for me, you help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I&rsquo;ll help you. 13Be strong; let&rsquo;s show ourselves courageous for our people and the towns of our God. May Yahveh do what seems good to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, &ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence.&rdquo; Yahveh was passing by! A gale was tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in Yahveh&rsquo;s presence, but Yahveh wasn&rsquo;t in the wind. After the wind an earthquake came, but Yahveh wasn&rsquo;t in the earthquake. 12After the earthquake, fire came, but Yahveh wasn&rsquo;t in the fire. After the fire the sound of a gentle whisper came. 13When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo; 	1 Kg 19:9-13</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Joab and his troops engaged the Arameans, and they fled. 15When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they retreated from Abishai into the city. Then Joab made a trip to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh told him, &ldquo;Go back on the road to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram, 16anoint Jehu Ben-Nimshi king of Israel, and anoint Elisha Ben-Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 17The one that escapes from Hazael&rsquo;s sword, Jehu will kill, and the one that escapes from Jehu&rsquo;s sword, Elisha will kill. 18I&rsquo;ll preserve 7,000 in Israel, who haven&rsquo;t bowed to Baal and haven&rsquo;t kissed him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When the Arameans saw Israel had defeated them, they sent ambassadors to bring out the Arameans from the other side of the River with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer&rsquo;s army leading them. 17When David heard it, he mustered Israel, crossed the Jordan, and came on them. He drew up in formation against them, and they fought him. 18They fled, and he killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put Shophach to death. 19When Hadadezer&rsquo;s vassals saw Israel had defeated them, they surrendered and served David. The Arameans weren&rsquo;t willing to help the Ammonites anymore.	 1 Ch 19:10-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> David escaped to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went to stay in Naioth. 19Saul heard that David was at Naioth in Ramah. 20He sent troops to take him, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on them and they prophesied too. 21When Saul learned about it, he sent some other troops, and they prophesied. He sent troops a third time, and they prophesied. 22Then Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big well in Secu and asked where Samuel and David were. One person said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re at Naioth in Ramah.&rdquo; 23He went on to Naioth, and the Spirit of God came on him. As he went, he kept prophesying till he got to Naioth. 24He, too, stripped off his clothes and prophesied in Samuel&rsquo;s presence; he lay naked all day and all night. That&rsquo;s why people say, &ldquo;Is Saul among the prophets too?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He left and found Elisha plowing with 12 yokes of oxen; he was with the twelfth. Elijah went over and threw his mantle on him. 20He left the oxen and ran after Elijah, &ldquo;Let me kiss my parents. Then I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo; He told him, &ldquo;Go on back, but think about what I&rsquo;ve done for you.&rdquo; 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Isaiah sent to Hezekiah, &ldquo;Yahveh says, &lsquo;Because you&rsquo;ve prayed about Sennacherib, I&rsquo;ve listened.&rsquo; 21This is what Yahveh says against him:</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But Abishai Ben-Zeruiah answered, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we put him to death for cursing Yahveh&rsquo;s anointed?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Who have you disparaged and blasphemed?</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> By your ambassadors you&rsquo;ve disparaged Yahveh.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I dug wells and drank foreign water;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He answered, &ldquo;My lord the king, my servant deceived me. I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll saddle a donkey so I can go with the king,&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m lame. 27He slandered me to you, but you&rsquo;re like an angel of God. Do what you think&rsquo;s right. 28All my father&rsquo;s family was nothing but dead men; yet you set me among the ones that ate at your own table. What right do I have to complain?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> From ancient times I&rsquo;ve known</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Because you&rsquo;ve raged against me, 29&rsquo;This will show you what I mean: this year you&rsquo;ll eat what volunteers, next year what sprouts from that, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat what they produce. 30The surviving remnant of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 31A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahveh will make that happen. 32&rsquo;Yahveh says the king of Assyria won&rsquo;t come to this city or shoot an arrow here. He won&rsquo;t approach it with a shield or build a mound against it. 33He&rsquo;ll go back the way he came. 34I&rsquo;ll save this city for my own sake and for David&rsquo;s sake.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The king said, &ldquo;Why are you still talking about your affairs? I&rsquo;ve decided that you and Ziba will divide the land.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Mephibosheth said, &ldquo;Let him have it all since you&rsquo;ve come home safely.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim and went on with the king to escort him across the Jordan. 32He was old and had sustained the king while he was staying at Mahanaim because he was a really wealthy man. 33The king told Barzillai,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> But he said, &ldquo;How long do I have left to live that I should go up with you to Jerusalem? 35I&rsquo;m 80 years old. Can I distinguish good from bad, or taste what I eat, or still hear men and women singing? Why should I be an added burden to you? 36I&rsquo;d simply be crossing over the Jordan with you. Why should you compensate me with this reward? 37Let me go back so I can die in my own town near my parents&rsquo; grave. But here is my son Kimham. Let him cross over with you, and you can do for him what seems good.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> That night the angel of Yahveh struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early, the Assyrians were all dead. 36Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 37As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to Ararat. His son Esarhaddon became king. 	    2 Kg 19:29-37</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> The king answered, &ldquo;Chimham will cross over with me, and I&rsquo;ll do for him what seems good to you and whatever you need me to do for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> The king and the people crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he went back home.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The king and Chimham went on over to Gilgal. Judah and half of Israel crossed with the king. 41The men from Israel came to the king and said, &ldquo;Why did our fellow Jews in Judah steal you away and bring you, your family, and your men across the Jordan?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The men from Judah answered, &ldquo;Because the king is a close relative of ours. Why are you mad about that? Have we eaten at all at the kings&rsquo; expense, or has anything been taken for us?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> But the men of Israel said, &ldquo;We have ten parts in the king, so we have more claim on David than you do. Why then did you dishonor us? Wasn&rsquo;t it our advice first to bring him back?&quot;</span></p>
