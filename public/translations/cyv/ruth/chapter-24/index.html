<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joash was 7 when he became king and ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2He did what was good all the time Jehoiada was alive. 3Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The king told Joab the commander of the army, &ldquo;Go through the tribes from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people so I can know how many there are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But Joab said, &ldquo;May Yahveh your God multiply the people 100 times while you can still see it, but why delight in this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> After that, Joash decided to restore Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple. 5He gathered the priests and Levites, and said, &ldquo;Go out to the towns in Judah and collect money to repair your God&rsquo;s Temple annually; do it right away.&rdquo; But the Levites didn&rsquo;t act right away. 6He summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax Moses laid on Israel for the Tent of Testimony?&rdquo; 7The sons of Athaliah had broken into God&rsquo;s Temple and used the holy things for the images of Baal.	2 Ch 24:1-7</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The first lot came out for Jehoiarib,	the second for Jedaiah,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The king had them make a chest to set outside by the gate into Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple. 9They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Yahveh the tax Moses had levied in the desert. 10The officers and common people celebrated and brought in their levies and dropped them in the chest till they&rsquo;d finished. 11Whenever the Levites saw there was a lot in the chest, they&rsquo;d bring it to the king&rsquo;s officer, and his secretary and the chief priest&rsquo;s officer would empty it and take it back to its place. They did that daily and collected a lot of money. 12The king and Jehoiada gave it to the ones that serviced theY Temple. They hired masons, carpenters, and artisans in iron and bronze to repair the Temple, 13and the work progressed. They restored it to its specifications and reinforced it. 14When they finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. They made it into utensils for theY Temple, for its service, the burnt offering, gold and silver pans and utensils. They offered burnt offerings continually all the time Jehoiada was alive. 	2 Ch 24:8-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> At that time, the officers of Nebuchadnezzar came up to Jerusalem and laid siege to it. 11He came while they were besieging it. 12Jehoiachin, his mother, advisors, commanders, and officials went out to him. The king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 13He carried the treasures out of Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s palace, and cut up the gold articles Solomon had made in the Temple—like Yahveh said. 14He led into exile Jerusalem, the commanders, trained soldiers (10,000 captives), craftsmen, and smiths. Only the poorest people remained. 15He led Jehoiachin to Babylon along with his mother, his wives, officials, leading men of the country, 16the brave men (7,000), the craftsmen and smiths (1,000), the ones strong and fit for war. 17He made his uncle Mattaniah king and changed his name to Zedekiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gad went and asked David, &ldquo;Will three [1 Chronicles 21:12] years of famine come on you and your land? Will you flee from your enemies for three months? Or will there be a three-day plague in your land? Which answer will I take back to the One who sent me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> David told Gad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really distressed. Let&rsquo;s fall into Yahveh&rsquo;s hand. He has great mercy; don&rsquo;t let me fall into human hands.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jehoiada died at the good old age of 130. 16They buried him in The City of David among the kings because he&rsquo;d done well in Israel for God and his Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When David finished, Saul said, &ldquo;Is that you, David my son? 17You&rsquo;re better than I am. You&rsquo;ve been good to me while I&rsquo;ve been bad to you. 18You&rsquo;ve declared that you&rsquo;ve done good to me, that Yahveh delivered me to you, but you didn&rsquo;t kill me. 19If someone finds his enemy, will he let him get away? May Yahveh reward you with good for what you&rsquo;ve done today. 20I know you&rsquo;ll be king, and the kingdom will be firmly under your rule. 21Swear to me by Yahveh that you won&rsquo;t kill my descendants or destroy my name from my father&rsquo;s family.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But after Jehoiada&rsquo;s death, the officials of Judah came and bowed to the king, and he listened to them. 18They abandoned the Temple of Yahveh God and worshiped Asherah poles and idols; so wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem. 19He sent prophets to bring them back to him, but they wouldn&rsquo;t listen. 20Then God&rsquo;s Spirit came on Zechariah Ben-Jehoiada the priest. He stood above the people and said, &ldquo;God says, &lsquo;Why do you sin against Yahveh&rsquo;s commands and not prosper? Because you&rsquo;ve left him, he&rsquo;s left you.&rsquo;&rdquo; 21They plotted against him, and at the king&rsquo;s command stoned him to death in theY Temple court. 22So Joash the king didn&rsquo;t remember the kindness Zechariah&rsquo;s father Jehoiada had shown him; he murdered his son. As he died, he said, &ldquo;May Yahveh see and repay you!&rdquo;         	2 Ch 24:15-22</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Zedekiah was 21 and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal Bat-Jeremiah of Libnah. 19He did evil like Jehoiakim. 20Because of Yahveh&rsquo;s anger, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah till he threw them out from his presence. Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon.	2 Kg 24:8-20</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Those were their officers for ministry when they came to Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple according to the ordinance Aaron their ancestor gave them by Yahveh God&rsquo;s command. 	1 Ch 24:7-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now about the rest of the descendants of Levi: 23the descendants of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, Jekameam fourth.  	1 Ch 24:20-23 Those were the Levites by families. 31They also cast lots—the head of each family and his younger brother alike—like their relatives the descendants of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families among the priests and Levites.	1 Ch 24:24-31</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Araunah told him, &ldquo;Take and offer what you want to: the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes for wood. 23You can have it all. May Yahveh your God accept you.&rdquo; 24&quot;No, I&rsquo;ll buy it from you. I won&rsquo;t offer burnt offerings that don&rsquo;t cost me anything.&rdquo; He bought the threshing floor and oxen for 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. 25He built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Yahveh was moved by David&rsquo;s petition for the country and held back the plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> At the turn of the year, the Aramean army came up against him. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, killed the people&rsquo;s officials, and sent their spoil to the king in Damascus. 24Though the Arameans came with a small army, Yahveh delivered a large army to them because they&rsquo;d left himY. They carried out judgment on Joash.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They left him seriously wounded. When they&rsquo;d gone, his own officials plotted against him for murdering Jehoiada&rsquo;s son. They assassinated him in his bed and buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 26The ones that plotted against him were Zabad Ben-Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad Ben-Shimrith the Moabitess. 27The Commentary on the Book of the Kings gives accounts about his sons, the many oracles against him, and the restoration of God&rsquo;s Temple. His son Amaziah became king.	    2 Ch 24:23-27</span></p>
