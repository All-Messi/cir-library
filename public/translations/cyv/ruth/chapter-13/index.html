War arose between Abijah and Jeroboam. 3Abijah entered the battle with 400,000 trained soldiers; Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 trained soldiers.	2 Ch 13:1-3</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 13:4-12</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He gave a sign the same day,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and shouted, &ldquo;Jeroboam and all Israel. 5Don&rsquo;t you know that Yahveh God of Israel gave the rule over Israel permanently to David and his descendants by a covenant of salt? 6Yet Jeroboam rebelled against him. 7Worthless men gathered around him, scoundrels that proved to be too strong for the son of Solomon when he was young and timid and couldn&rsquo;t hold his own against them. 8So now you intend to resist the kingdom of Yahveh by the descendants of David because you have a big army and the golden calves Jeroboam made as your gods. 9Haven&rsquo;t you driven out Yahveh&rsquo;s priests, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites, and made your own priests like people in other countries? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, can become a priest for what aren&rsquo;t gods. 10Yahveh is our God. We haven&rsquo;t left him. The descendants of Aaron are serving him as priests and the Levites are doing their work. 11Every morning they burn burnt offerings and fragrant incense to him. They set the showbread on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is ready to light every evening, because we&rsquo;re keeping the charge of Yahveh our God. But you&rsquo;ve left him. 12God is at our head and his priests with the signal bugles to sound the alarm against you, Israel. Don&rsquo;t fight with Yahveh God of your ancestors; you won&rsquo;t prevail.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jonadab said, &ldquo;Lie down on your bed and act like you&rsquo;re sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, &lsquo;Let my sister come and give me something to eat, and let her fix the food so I can see it and she can hand it to me.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king went to see him, Amnon said, &ldquo;Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple cakes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The king said, &ldquo;Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I&rsquo;ll give you a reward.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The man of God told him, &ldquo;If you gave me half of what you own, I wouldn&rsquo;t go with you, eat bread, or drink water here. 9Yahveh told me not to eat bread, drink water, or come back the way I came.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon/Nachon, Uzza reached out to steady the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 10Yahveh&rsquo;s anger burned against him, so he struck him down, and he died there in front of God. 11David was mad because Yahveh &ldquo;lashed out against Uzza,&rdquo; and has called the place Perez-uzza ever since. 12David was afraid of God that day, &ldquo;How can I bring the Ark home to me?&rdquo; 13So he didn&rsquo;t take it to The City of David but to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite nearby. 14It stayed with his family for three months, and Yahveh blessed them and everybody he had.     	1 Ch 13:1-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Joash/Jehoash Ben-Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 16 years. 11He didn&rsquo;t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam that got Israel to sin. 12The rest of the acts of Joash and his strength in fighting Amaziah, king of Judah, are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 13Joash died, and they buried him in Samaria with the kings of Israel. JeroboamII sat on his throne. 	2 Kg 13:10-13</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> An old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the man of God had done that day in Bethel and what he&rsquo;d told the king. 12Their father asked them which way he went. They&rsquo;d seen which way he&rsquo;d gone. 13&quot;Saddle the donkey for me.&rdquo; They saddled it, and he rode 14after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth tree. &ldquo;Are you the man of God from Judah?&rdquo; 16&quot;I can&rsquo;t return with you, eat bread, or drink water with you here. 17Yahveh told me not to eat bread, drink water, or go back the way I came.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> She answered him, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t violate me! Such a thing is not done in Israel. Don&rsquo;t do this awful thing! 13Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And you&rsquo;ll be like one of the fools in Israel. Please speak to the king. He won&rsquo;t withhold me from you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Jeroboam had set an ambush from the rear, so Israel lay in front of Judah and behind. 14When Judah turned around, Israel attacked them from the front and back. Israel cried out to Yahveh, the priests blew the bugles, 15and Judah&rsquo;s soldiers raised the battle cry. When they did, God routed Jeroboam and Israel in front of Abijah and Judah. 16When the Israelites fled, God delivered them to Judah. 17Abijah and his army defeated them with a massacre of 500,000 elite troops. 18Israel was subdued because Judah trusted in Yahveh. 19Abijah chased Jeroboam and captured several towns: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron with their villages. 20Jeroboam didn&rsquo;t regain strength during Abijah&rsquo;s reign. Yahveh struck him, and he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When Elisha took sick with the illness he&rsquo;d die from, Joash, king of Israel, came down and cried over him, &ldquo;Father! Father! the chariots of Israel and their drivers!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Elisha said, &ldquo;Pick up a bow and arrows, 16and put your hand on the bow.&rdquo; Elisha put his hands on the king&rsquo;s hands. 17&quot;Open the window toward the east. Shoot! Yahveh&rsquo;s arrow of victory over Aram! You&rsquo;ll destroy the Arameans at Aphek.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She told him, &ldquo;No! Sending me away is worse than the other sin you&rsquo;ve done to me!&rdquo; But he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her. 17He called the young man that attended him and said, &ldquo;Throw this woman out and lock the door behind her.&rdquo; 18She was wearing a long-sleeved robe, because that&rsquo;s the way the king&rsquo;s virgin daughters dressed in robes. His attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. 19Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment. She put her hand on her head and went away, wailing as she went.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then he said, &ldquo;Pick up some arrows and strike the floor.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The man of God was mad at him, &ldquo;You should have struck it five or six times. Then you would have struck Aram till you&rsquo;d destroyed it. But as it is, you&rsquo;ll strike Aram only three times.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Elisha died, and they buried him. Bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring. 21Once, as some Israelites were burying a man, they saw a marauding band. They threw him into Elisha&rsquo;s tomb and ran. When he touched Elisha&rsquo;s bones, he came back to life and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Abijah became more powerful and took 14 wives and became father of 22 sons and 16 daughters. 22The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and words, are recorded in The Account of the Prophet Iddo.	2 Ch 13:13-22</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Hazael, king of Aram, had oppressed Israel all the time of Jehoahaz. 23But Yahveh was gracious, had mercy, and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He still hadn&rsquo;t destroyed them or thrown them out of his presence. 24When Hazael died, Benhadad his son became king. 25Jehoash took back the towns Hazael had taken in war from his father. Three times he defeated him and recovered Israel&rsquo;s towns.	2 Kg 13:14-25</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Two years later Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor near Ephraim and invited all the royal sons. 24He went to the king and said, &ldquo;I have sheep-shearers. You and your officials go with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When the prophet heard it, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man of God that disobeyed Yahveh; he let the lion tear him apart like his message had said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then he told his sons to saddle the donkey for him. 28He went and found the body on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion hadn&rsquo;t eaten the body or torn the donkey. 29The old prophet picked up the body and laid it on his donkey. He brought it back to his city 30and laid it in his own grave. They mourned for him, &ldquo;Ah, my brother!&rdquo; 31He told his sons, &ldquo;When I die, bury me where I buried the man of God. Lay my bones beside his. 32What he cried out by the message from Yahveh against the altar in Bethel and the houses at the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly happen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Absalom told his men, &ldquo;When Amnon is half drunk with wine and I say, &lsquo;Strike him down,&rsquo; put him to death. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Haven&rsquo;t I commanded you? Be courageous and brave.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Absalom&rsquo;s men did what he said, and the king&rsquo;s sons got on their mules and fled.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> While they were on their way, the report came to David, &ldquo;Absalom struck down your sons; there&rsquo;s not a one left.&rdquo; 31The king got up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. His servants stood by him with torn clothes. 32Jonadab, son of David&rsquo;s brother Shimeah, answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ve killed all your sons—just Amnon. Absalom has intended to do that ever since Ammon violated his sister Tamar.&rdquo; [33]</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Even after all that, Jeroboam kept following his own sinful way. Anybody that volunteered, he ordained as a priest for the high places. 34What happened became the sin in his family that destroyed it.	    1 Kg 13:26-34</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Absalom had fled. The young man that was the watchman looked up and saw many people coming from the road behind him beside the mountain. 35Jonadab told the king, &ldquo;Your sons are here. It&rsquo;s what I said would happen.&rdquo; 36As soon as he&rsquo;d finished talking, the king&rsquo;s sons came and cried out loud. The king and his servants also cried bitterly. 37-38Absalom fled to Talmai Ben-Ammihud, king of Geshur, for 3 years. David mourned for him every day. 39He really wanted to go out to Absalom, because he was at peace over Amnon, since he was dead.</span></p>
