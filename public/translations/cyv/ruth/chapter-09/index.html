<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She brought a large contingent of camels carrying spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. When she got there, she talked to him about everything on her mind. 2He answered her questions; there wasn&rsquo;t anything he couldn&rsquo;t explain to her. 3When she&rsquo;d seen his wisdom, the palace he&rsquo;d built, 4the food at his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance by his servers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, the stairway he used to go up to Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple, she was breathless, 5&quot;The report was true that I heard in my country about your words and wisdom. 6But I didn&rsquo;t believe it till I saw it. They didn&rsquo;t tell me half of it. 7How fortunate your officers must feel, being around you continually and listening to your wisdom. 8Bless Yahveh your God that delighted in you and set you on his throne. He loved Israel and established the nation permanently; that&rsquo;s why he made you their king—to do justice and goodness.&quot; 	2 Ch 9:1-8</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The first to live again in their towns were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Temple servants. 3Some descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem: 4from the descendants of Perez Ben-Judah was Uthai Ben-Ammihud Ben-Omri Ben-Imri Ben-Bani; 7from the descendants of Benjamin were Sallu Ben-Meshullam Ben-Hodaviah Ben-Hassenuah, 8and Ibneiah Ben-Jeroham, Elah Ben-Uzzi Ben-Michri, and Meshullam Ben-Shephatiah Ben-Reuel Ben-Ibnijah, 9and their relatives by generations: 956. Those were heads of families.										1 Ch 9:1-9</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Kish&rsquo;s donkeys were lost so he told Saul to take a servant and look for them. 4They went through the hill country of Ephraim, through the territory around Shalishah, Shaalim, and Benjamin, but couldn&rsquo;t find them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The young man went to Ramoth-gilead. 5The commanders of the army were sitting there, and he said, &ldquo;I have a message for you, commander.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> David had him brought in. 6He came and prostrated himself. David said, &ldquo;Mephibosheth, 7you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid. I&rsquo;ll treat you well out of regard for your father Jonathan, and give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul; you&rsquo;ll eat at my table regularly.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He got up and went into the house. The young man poured the oil on his head, &ldquo;Yahveh God of Israel says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve anointed you king over his people Israel. 7Strike Ahab&rsquo;s family so I can avenge the blood of my prophets that Jezebel shed. 8Ahab&rsquo;s family will perish, and I&rsquo;ll remove from him every male, bond and free. 9I&rsquo;ll destroy his family like Jeroboam&rsquo;sI and Baasha&rsquo;s. 10Dogs will eat Jezebel in Jezreel, and nobody will bury her.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Saul said, &ldquo;If we go, what can we take him? We don&rsquo;t have any bread left in our sacks; we don&rsquo;t have a present. What do we have?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and a large amount of spices and precious stones. There&rsquo;d never been spices like what she gave him. 10Then Hiram and Solomon&rsquo;s crews brought gold from Ophir plus algum wood and precious stones. 11From the algum wood he made steps for Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple and the king&rsquo;s palace as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Nobody in Judah had ever seen anything like them. 12King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for—more than what she&rsquo;d brought him. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	 2 Ch 9:9-12</span></p>

He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 17He made a large throne out of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 18It had 6 steps leading up to it, a gold footstool attached to it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside the arms. 1912 lions stood on opposite sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 20King Solomon&rsquo;s drinking cups were made out of gold. The items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver wasn&rsquo;t considered valuable in his time. 21He had ships that went to Tarshish every three years with Hiram&rsquo;s sailors, and brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.	 2 Ch 9:13-21</span></p>

They were soldiers, officials, officers, captains, chariot commanders, and cavalry.   	1 Kg 9:10-22</span></p>

They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages, men that David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust. 23They and their descendants guarded the gates of Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple—when it was a tabernacle—24on all four sides. 25Their relatives in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 26The four chief gatekeepers (Levites) were in an office of trust over the rooms and treasuries in God&rsquo;s Temple. 27They spent the night around God&rsquo;s Temple, because they were responsible for guarding them. They were responsible for opening the Temple each morning.</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> King Solomon became greater than any king other anywhere in wealth and wisdom. 23Kings from all over the world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God put in him. 24Each one brought his gift: silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules—so much a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Joram reined around and fled. He told Ahaziah, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s treason!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms. The arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot. 25Then Jehu told Bidkar his officer, &ldquo;Pick him up and throw him on Naboth&rsquo;s field. Remember when we were riding behind his father Ahab, Yahveh laid this oracle against him: 26&rsquo;I certainly saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday.

They counted them when they brought them in and took them out. 29Some were appointed to oversee the furniture and utensils for the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 30Some descendants of the priests mixed the spices. 31Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for what was baked in pans. 32Some relatives of the Kohathites prepared the showbread every Sabbath. 	1 Ch 9:17-32</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He looked up at the window and said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s with me?&rdquo; They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and the horses, and he tramped her under his horses hooves. 34He came in and ate, and said, &ldquo;See to that cursed woman and bury her. She is a king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; 35They went to bury her, but they couldn&rsquo;t find any of her except skull, feet, and palms. 36They came back and told him.
