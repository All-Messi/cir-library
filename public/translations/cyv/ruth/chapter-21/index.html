<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> David told Ahimelech, &ldquo;The king commissioned me with a matter, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let anybody know about it. I&rsquo;ve directed my young men where to meet me later.&rsquo; 3What do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Joab said, &ldquo;May Yahveh add to his people 100 times as many as they are! But my lord the king, aren&rsquo;t they all serving you? Why do you want to know this? Why bring guilt on Israel?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When Jehoram had taken over the kingdom and made himself secure, he killed his brothers with the sword and some of the rulers too. 5He was 32 when he became king and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 6He followed the ways of Israel&rsquo;s kings like Ahab&rsquo;s house did. (His wife was Ahab&rsquo;s daughter.) He did evil, 7but because of his covenant with David, Yahveh wouldn&rsquo;t destroy David&rsquo;s house. He&rsquo;d promised to give him and his descendants a lamp permanently. 	2 Ch 21:1-7</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His wife Jezebel came in, &ldquo;Why are you so sullen you won&rsquo;t eat?&rdquo; 6&quot;I asked Naboth to let me buy his vineyard or trade him for another one, but he wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;&rdquo; 	1 Kg 21:1-6</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The priest gave him the Bread of the Presence, which is removed from Yahveh&rsquo;s presence and replaced with fresh bread the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jezebel said, &ldquo;Do you rule Israel? Get up, eat something, and be happy. I&rsquo;ll get you his vineyard.&rdquo; 8She wrote letters in Ahab&rsquo;s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles in Naboth&rsquo;s town, 9&quot;Declare a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place. 10Put two worthless fellows with him and have them accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> During his reign Edom revolted and set up its own king. 9So Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. He got up at night and struck down the Edomites and the commanders of the chariots that were surrounding him. 10But Edom is still independent from Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time because Jehoram had left Yahveh God of his ancestors. 11Besides, he made high places in the mountains in Judah, and led the people in Jerusalem to carry on religious prostitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh told Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, 10&quot;Tell David, &lsquo;Yahveh says 11to take 12either three years of famine, three months of being swept away by your enemies&rsquo; sword, or three days of the sword of Yahveh when his angel destroys throughout Israel.&rsquo; What should I report to the One that sent me?&rdquo;     	1 Ch 21:8-12</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Now Yahveh spoke through his prophets, 11&quot;Manasseh has done more disgusting things than the Amorites before him, and got Judah to sin with his idols. 12So I&rsquo;m bringing such catastrophe on Jerusalem and Judah that both ears will ring of whoever hears it. 13I&rsquo;ll stretch over Jerusalem Samaria&rsquo;s measuring line and Ahab&rsquo;s plumb bob. I&rsquo;ll wipe Jerusalem like someone wipes a dish and turns it upside down. 14I&rsquo;ll abandon the remnant of my permanent possession and deliver them to their enemies to become plunder and spoil. 15They&rsquo;ve done evil and made me angry ever since I brought their ancestors out of Egypt.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The elders and nobles 12declared a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place. 13The two worthless fellows came in and sat down with him, and started accusing him of cursing God and the king. They took him outside the city and stoned him, 14and sent word to Jezebel. 15She told Ahab, &ldquo;Go take Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard; he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; 16He got up to go down and take it. 	1 Kg 21:7-16</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Elijah the prophet sent him a letter: &ldquo;Yahveh, God of your ancestor David, says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve not followed the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and Asa king of Judah. 13You&rsquo;ve followed the kings of Israel and made Judah and Israel carry on religious prostitution like Ahab&rsquo;s house did. You&rsquo;ve even killed your own brothers, who were better than you. 14I&rsquo;mY going to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and everything you own with catastrophe. 15You&rsquo;ll suffer with a severe intestinal disease till your bowels come out.&rsquo;&rdquo;	2 Ch 21:8-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David told Gad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in great distress. I&rsquo;ll cast myself on Yahveh&rsquo;s mercy because it&rsquo;s so great. Don&rsquo;t let me fall into human hands.&rdquo; 14Yahveh sent a plague on Israel; 70,000 people died. 15He sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem; but as he was about to do it, he looked and was sad over the catastrophe. He told the destroying angel, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough; relax your hand.&rdquo; The angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan/Araunah the Jebusite. 16David looked up and saw him standing between earth and sky with his sword held out over Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with burlap, fell on their faces. 17He told God, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one that sinned. What have these sheep done? Yahveh my God, please plague me and my father&rsquo;s house, not your people.&rdquo; 	1 Ch 21:13-17</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Philistines were at war again with Israel. When David and his men went down and fought them, David got tired. 16Ishbi-benob, a descendant of the giants in Gath—whose spearhead weighed 7½ lbs 300 shekels—was armed with a new sword and tried to kill David. 17But Abishai Ben-Jeruiah helped him, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David&rsquo;s men swore to him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going out with us again to battle so you don&rsquo;t snuff out the lamp in Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Yahveh stirred up the Philistines and Arabs that bordered the Nubians. 17They invaded Judah and carried away everything in the king&rsquo;s palace, including his sons and wives. He didn&rsquo;t have any son left except Jehoahaz, the youngest.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to Elijah, 18&quot;Meet Ahab in Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard. He&rsquo;s gone down to confiscate it. 19Tell him I&rsquo;ve said, &lsquo;Have you murdered and confiscated? Where dogs licked up Naboth&rsquo;s blood, they&rsquo;ll lick up yours.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> In addition, Yahveh struck him with an incurable disease. 19In two years, his bowels came out, and he died in severe pain. His people made no fire for him like they did for his ancestors. 20He died with nobody&rsquo;s regret. They buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.	    2 Ch 21:16-20</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Amon was 22 and ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth Bat-Haruz from Jotbah. 20He did evil like Manasseh, 21followed his ways, served the idols he&rsquo;d worshiped, 22and forsook Yahveh God of his ancestors. 23Amon&rsquo;s officials plotted against him and assassinated him in his palace. 24The common people killed his assassins and made his son Josiah king. 25The rest of the acts of Amon are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 26They buried him in Uzza&rsquo;s garden. 	    2 Kg 21:19-26</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Ahab said, &ldquo;Have you found me, my enemy?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you because you&rsquo;ve sold yourself to doing evil in Yahveh&rsquo;s presence. 21&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring evil on you and completely sweep you away. I&rsquo;ll remove from you every male in Israel, bond or free, 22and make your dynasty like Jeroboam&rsquo;s and Baasha&rsquo;s; you&rsquo;ve made me angry and got Israel to sin.&rsquo; 23Yahveh has also said dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel. 24Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Ornan/Araunah said, &ldquo;Take it and do what seems good. I&rsquo;ll give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, the wheat for the grain offering—all of it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But King David said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take what&rsquo;s yours for Yahveh or offer a burnt offering that doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything.&rdquo; 25He paid him 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold for the site. 26He built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called to Yahveh, and he answered him with fire from the sky on the altar. 27Yahveh told the angel to sheath his sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Nobody had sold himself to doing evil like Ahab did, influenced by his wife. 26He acted horribly in following idols like the Amorites had done that Yahveh originally drove out.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When Ahab heard that, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and fasted. He lay down in burlap and walked around in mourning. 28Then a message came to Elijah, 29&quot;See how Ahab has humbled himself? Since he&rsquo;s done that, I won&rsquo;t do what I&rsquo;d promised during his lifetime. I&rsquo;ll bring it on his family during his son&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;	 1 Kg 21:17-29</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When David saw that Yahveh had answered him, he offered sacrifice there, 29because the Tabernacle and altar that Moses made were in the countryside at Gibeon. 30But David couldn&rsquo;t go to it to ask God because the angel&rsquo;s sword terrified him.</span></p>
