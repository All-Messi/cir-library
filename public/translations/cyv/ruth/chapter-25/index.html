His mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2He did what was good, but not with all his heart. 3As soon as his kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 4He didn&rsquo;t put their children to death, like Yahveh commanded in the Law of Moses: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person&rsquo;s sin.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 25:11-15</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Amaziah gathered Judah and appointed them according to their families under commanders of thousands and hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin. He took a census of men 20 and older and found 300,000 elite men, fit for war and handling spear and shield. 6He hired 100,000 trained soldiers out of Israel for 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver. 7But a man of God came to him and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Israel&rsquo;s army go with you; Yahveh is not with Israel or Ephraim. 8Even if you go strong into the battle, God will still make you stumble in front of the enemy. He has power to help or hinder.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Those were under their father&rsquo;s direction to sing in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple, with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman served under the king&rsquo;s direction. 7There were 288 trained in singing to Yahveh with their relatives, talented men. 8They cast lots for their duties, least and greatest, teacher and pupil.	1 Ch 25:1-8</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The seventh day, fifth month, nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard and an official of the king, came to Jerusalem. 9He burned Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple, the king&rsquo;s palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem, including every important building. 10The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 11He exiled the rest of the people in the city, the deserters, and the rest of the population. 12He left some of the very poor to take care of the vineyards and fields.	 2 Kg 25:1-12</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Amaziah said, &ldquo;But what will we do for the 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver I&rsquo;ve given Israel&rsquo;s troops?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Amaziah dismissed the troops from Ephraim, and they went home disgruntled.  	`2 Ch 25:1-10</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Amaziah gathered his courage, led his people to the Valley of Salt, and struck down 10,000 people from Seir. 12Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down and threw them down to their death. 13But Israel&rsquo;s troops that Amaziah sent back, raided the towns in Judah between Beth-horon and Samaria, struck down 3,000 of them, and plundered a lot of spoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> David&rsquo;s young men retraced their steps and told him what Nabal said. 13David told them to put on their swords. David put on his sword, and about 400 men went up behind him while 200 stayed with the baggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Babylonians broke to pieces the bronze pillars, the stands, and the bronze sea that were in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple, and carried the bronze to Babylon. 14They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and bronze items used in the Temple service. 15The captain of the guard took away the firepans and basins, what was fine gold and silver, 16the two pillars, the sea, and the stands Solomon had made for the Temple; the bronze from these was more than they could weigh. 17The two pillars were bronze plated 27ft tall. Their capitals were 4½ft high with a bronze network and pomegranates all the way around.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After Amaziah came from slaying the Edomites, he brought the gods from Seir. He set them up as gods, bowed to them, and burned incense to them. 15Yahveh&rsquo;s anger burned against him. He sent him a prophet, &ldquo;Why seek gods that haven&rsquo;t delivered their own people from you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> As he was talking to him, the king said, &ldquo;Did we appoint you a royal counselor? Shut up! Why get struck down?&rdquo; The prophet stopped and said, &ldquo;God has planned to destroy you because you&rsquo;ve done that and ignored my advice.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Amaziah took counsel and sent to Joash (Ben-Jehoahaz Ben-Jehu, king of Israel), &ldquo;Come. Let&rsquo;s face each other.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Joash sent back to him, &ldquo;A thistle in Lebanon sent to a cedar in Lebanon, &lsquo;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&rsquo; But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and tramped down the thistle. 19You said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve defeated Edom.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ve become proud. Stay home. Why stir up trouble to make yourself and Judah fall?&rdquo; 	2 Ch 25:16-19</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But Amaziah wouldn&rsquo;t listen because it fit with Yahveh&rsquo;s plan to God deliver them to Joash because they&rsquo;d looked to Edom&rsquo;s gods. 21Joash, king of Israel, went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 22He defeated Judah, and they fled to their tents. 23Joash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh and took him to Jerusalem. He tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 600ft. 24He took all the gold and silver, the items in God&rsquo;s Temple with Obed-edom, the treasures of the king&rsquo;s palace, and hostages too, and went back to Samaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah Ben-Ahikam Ben-Shaphan as governor for the people he left in the country. 23When the commanders of the forces and their men heard it, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael Ben-Nethaniah, Johanan Ben-Kareah, Seraiah Ben-Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, and their men. 24Gedaliah swore to them and their men, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of the Babylonians. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and you&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;	2 Kg 25:13-24</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Amaziah lived 15 years after the death of Joash Ben-Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 26The rest of the acts of Amaziah, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 27From the time Amaziah turned away from following Yahveh, they plotted against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent assassins after him and killed him. 28They brought him back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in The City of Davidms.	 2 Ch 25:20-28</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The twenty-seventh day, twelfth month, thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin&rsquo;s exile, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in his first year, released him from prison. 28He spoke graciously to him and set his throne above the other kings in Babylon. 29Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes and had his meals in the king&rsquo;s presence the rest of his life. 30The king gave him a regular serving each day.  	2 Kg 25:25-30</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> David told Abigail, &ldquo;Bless Yahveh God of Israel, who sent you. 33Bless you for your discretion. You&rsquo;ve kept me from shedding blood to avenge myself. 34Nevertheless, as sure as Yahveh lives, who kept me from harming you, if you hadn&rsquo;t come so soon, I wouldn&rsquo;t have left Nabal one male by morning.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> David accepted what she&rsquo;d brought. &ldquo;Go home on good terms. I&rsquo;ve done what you asked.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> She went to Nabal. He was holding a feast in his house, celebrating like a king. He was half drunk, so she didn&rsquo;t tell him anything till morning. 37When he&rsquo;d sobered up, she told him everything. His heart died; he became like a stone. 38Some ten days later, Yahveh struck him, and he died.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When David heard Nabal was dead, he said, &ldquo;Bless Yahveh, who pleaded the cause of his insult to me, and kept me from doing something bad. Yahveh has brought his wrongdoing back on him.&rdquo; Then David sent a proposal to Abigail to be his wife. 40When his servants came to her at Carmel, they said, &ldquo;David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.&rdquo; 41She got up and bowed to the ground, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash his servants&rsquo; feet.&rdquo; 42She got up quick and rode a donkey with her five maids attending her. She followed David&rsquo;s messengers and became his wife. 43David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel; they both became his wives. 44Saul had given his daughter Michal, David&rsquo;s wife, to Palti Ben-Laish from Gallim.</span></p>
