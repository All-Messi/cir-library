        <h2 id="lamentations-chapter-2">Lamentations Chapter 2</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> How the Lord in his anger has covered Zion under a cloud! He has thrown down Israel&rsquo;s splendor from heaven to earth; he hasn&rsquo;t remembered his footstool in his wrath.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Without mercy the Lord has swallowed up the residents in Jacob. In his anger he has thrown down Judah&rsquo;s fortresses and leveled the kingdom and its officials to the ground in dishonor.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In his fury he has cut down Israel&rsquo;s power and stopped restraining the enemy. He has burned like a fire in Jacob and consumed it everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He has bent his bow like an enemy; he has set his right hand like an adversary and killed everybody we took pride in. He has poured out his anger like fire in the tent of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Lord has become like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel, laid its palaces in ruins, destroyed its fortresses, and multiplied mourning and groaning in Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He&rsquo;s violently treated his Tabernacle like a garden shed and laid in ruins his appointed meeting place. Yahveh has stricken from memory the appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion, and deposed king and priest in his angry indignation.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Lord has rejected his altar, disowned his sanctuary, and delivered to the enemy the walls of its palaces. A clamor was raised in Yahveh&rsquo;s Temple like that of an appointed festival day.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh decided to destroy the wall around Zion. He stretched out a line and didn&rsquo;t restrain his destroying. He made rampart and wall mourn; they&rsquo;ve broken down together.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Its gates have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken its bars and scattered its king and officials among the nations. There&rsquo;s no law anymore; prophets don&rsquo;t have visions from Yahveh.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The elders of Zion sit silent on the ground; they&rsquo;ve thrown dust on their heads and wrapped themselves in burlap. The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> My eyes are worn out from crying; my spirit is in turmoil; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people have been destroyed; the little ones and babies pass out in the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They ask their mothers, &ldquo;Where is the bread and wine?&rdquo; as they faint like wounded men in the city streets, as their life dies out on their mother&rsquo;s chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> What can I say for you? What can I compare you to, young woman in Jerusalem? What can I liken you to, as I comfort you, young virgin in Zion? Your ruin is as wide as the sea; who can restore you?</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Your prophets have deceived you with false visions; they haven&rsquo;t exposed your iniquity to restore you from sin; they&rsquo;ve seen false, misleading oracles for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Everybody that goes by claps their hands at you; they gasp and shake their heads at Jerusalem, &ldquo;Is this the city they used to say was &lsquo;perfectly beautiful, a delight to the whole world&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Your enemies mock you; they scoff and snarl, and shout, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve swallowed you up! That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been waiting for; at last it&rsquo;s here to see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh has accomplished his purpose and carried out the threat he ordained long ago. He has destroyed without pity and enabled your enemies to celebrate over you and increased the power of your adversaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Their heart appealed to the Lord, &ldquo;Resident of Zion, let your tears run down like a river day and night; don&rsquo;t give yourself any relief or let your eyes rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Get up, cry out loud at the beginning of the night watches; pour your heart out like water to the Lord; lift your hands up to him for the life of your little ones who are faint from hunger at the end of every street.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> See, Yahveh, look! Who else have you ever dealt with this way? Should women eat their offspring, little babies born healthy? Should prophet and priest be killed in your sanctuary?</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Young and old lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and young men have fallen by the sword. You&rsquo;ve slain them in your anger, slaughtered them without mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You invited terrors on every side of me as to an appointed festival. Nobody escaped or survived your anger. My enemy destroyed the ones I cared for and raised. Hope in Yahveh&rsquo;s Faithfulness</span></p>
