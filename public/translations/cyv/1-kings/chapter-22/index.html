<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 2In the third year, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to visit the king of Israel. 3The king of Israel said to his officials, &ldquo;Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we&rsquo;re still not doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram?&rdquo; 4He asked Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?&rdquo; Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours.&rdquo; 5He added, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask first for a message from Yahveh.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The king of Israel gathered the prophets—about 400 men, &ldquo;Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Yahveh will deliver it to you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there still a prophet of Yahveh we can ask?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The king said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still one, Micaiah Ben-Imlah, but I despise him; he never prophesies anything good about me.&rdquo; 9&quot;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;	 1 Kg 22:1-9</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes at the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria. The prophets were prophesying there. 11Zedekiah Ben-Chenaanah made iron horns for himself and said, &ldquo;Yahveh says you&rsquo;ll gore the Arameans with these till they&rsquo;re consumed.&rdquo; 12The prophets were all prophesying, &ldquo;Attack Ramoth-gilead. Yahveh will deliver it to you.&rdquo; Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The messenger to Micaiah told him, &ldquo;The prophets agree in giving a favorable report to the king. Make your report like theirs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But Micaiah swore, &ldquo;As sure as Yahveh lives, I&rsquo;ll say what he tells me.&quot;</span></p>
