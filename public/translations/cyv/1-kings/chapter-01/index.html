<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When King David got old, they covered him with blankets, but he still had the chills. 2His advisers told him, &ldquo;Have us look for a young virgin so she can attend you, become your nurse, and lie in your arms to keep you warm.&rdquo; 3They searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4She became his nurse, but he didn&rsquo;t have relations with her. Adonijah Claims the Throne</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Adonijah Ben-Haggithfem pushed himself forward to make himself king. He prepared chariots and horsemen with 50 men to run ahead of him. 6His father had never crossed him by asking why he did something.  7He&rsquo;d conferred with Joab Ben-Jeruiah and Abiathar the priest. They supported him. He was a handsome man, born after Absalom. 8But Zadok the priest, Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and The Three most elite soldiers, belonged to David, didn&rsquo;t join him. 9Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and young grain-fed animals by the Rock of Zoheleth next to En-rogel. He invited his half-brothers, the king&rsquo;s sons; and the men of Judah, the king&rsquo;s aides. 10But he didn&rsquo;t invite Nathan, Benaiah, The Three most elite soldiers, or his half-brother Solomon. 	1 Kg 1:1-10</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Nathan told Bathsheba, Solomon&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard that Adonijah has become king, and David our lord doesn&rsquo;t know it? 12Take my advice and save your life and your son&rsquo;s life. 13Go right now to King David and say, &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you sworn to me that Solomon will be king after you? Why has Adonijah become king?&rsquo; 14While you&rsquo;re there, I&rsquo;ll come in and confirm what you say.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Bathsheba went to the king&rsquo;s bedroom; Abishag was helping him. 16Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself to him, and he asked, &ldquo;What can I do for you?&quot;</span></p>
