I&amp;rsquo;ll make you as famous as anyone that&amp;rsquo;s ever lived in the world. 10I&amp;rsquo;ll appoint a place to plant my people so they can live there undisturbed, and sinful people won&amp;rsquo;t oppress them anymore. 11Like when I appointed judges over them, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you rest from your enemies.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Yahveh also says he&amp;rsquo;ll make a dynasty from you. 12-13&amp;rsquo;When you die, I&amp;rsquo;ll raise up your descendant and establish his kingdom permanently.  13He&amp;rsquo;ll build me a temple. 14I&amp;rsquo;ll be his father, and he&amp;rsquo;ll be my son. When he sins, I&amp;rsquo;ll correct him with rods like people do. 15But my enduring love won&amp;rsquo;t leave him like it did Saul, that I removed before you. 16Your family and kingdom will endure.

When anybody had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, &amp;ldquo;What city are you from?&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;d say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m from a tribe in Israel.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Then Absalom would say, &amp;ldquo;Your claims are right, but everybody with the king is ignoring you. 4If only somebody would appoint me judge in the land, everyone that has a suit could come to me for justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If Absalom was alive and all of us dead, you&amp;rsquo;d be pleased. 7Get up; go speak graciously to them. I swear by Yahveh, if you don&amp;rsquo;t, not a man will spend the night with you. This will be worse than all the bad things that have come on you since you were young.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
