They&amp;rsquo;ll become adversaries, and their gods will be a snare to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. 5They&amp;rsquo;d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land 6and brought Israel low. The people appealed to Yahveh, [7] 8and he sent a prophet, &amp;ldquo;Yahveh God of Israel says,&amp;rsquo; I led you out of slavery in Egypt, 9and delivered you from other oppressors. I drove them out and gave you their land. 10I told you, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Yahveh your God. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of the Amorites&amp;rsquo; gods where you&amp;rsquo;re living.&amp;rdquo; But you ignored me.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Remember, I&amp;rsquo;m your flesh and bone.&amp;quot; 3His mother&amp;rsquo;s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him because he was their kin. 4They gave him 70 pieces of silver from Baal-berith&amp;rsquo;s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows 5to go with him to his father&amp;rsquo;s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal&amp;rsquo;s youngest son, hid. 6The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s wait till morning light, then kill him.&amp;rdquo; 3But Samson lay till midnight, he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and its two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that&amp;rsquo;s near Hebron.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She said, &amp;ldquo;I consecrate the silver to Yahveh for my son to make a carved image and a molten image. Now I&amp;rsquo;ll return it to you.&amp;rdquo; 4She gave 200 pieces of it to a silversmith to make a graven image and a molten image. It was in Micah&amp;rsquo;s house. 5He had a shrine and appointed one of his sons as his priest. 6In those days, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any king in Israel.

The tribe of Dan was looking for an territory to live in, because no inheritance in Israel had fallen to them yet. 2They sent out from Zorah and Eshtaol five capable men from their tribe to spy out the land and explore it. They happened to come to Micah&amp;rsquo;s house and lodged there. 3While they were at his house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite and turned aside to him, &amp;ldquo;Who brought you here? What are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; 4&amp;quot;Micah has done such and such with me and hired me to be his priest.&amp;quot; 5&amp;quot;Ask God so we can know if our journey will be successful.&amp;quot; 6&amp;quot;Goodbye.

A Levite was living in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim. He took a concubine from Bethlehem, Judah. 2She got mad at him and went back to her father&amp;rsquo;s family in Bethlehem for four months. 3Then her husband went after her to speak graciously to her and bring her back. He had a servant and a couple donkeys with him. SheLXX brought him to her father&amp;rsquo;s family. When her father saw him, he was glad to see him. 4His father-in-law urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days. They ate and drank and lodged there. 5On the fourth day, they got up early, and he got ready to go, but the girl&amp;rsquo;s father told him, &amp;ldquo;Strengthen yourself with some bread and after that you can go.&amp;rdquo; 6The two men sat and ate and drank together. The girl&amp;rsquo;s father told him, &amp;ldquo;Spend the night and enjoy yourself.&amp;rdquo; 7When he got up to go, his father-in-law urged him till he stayed there again. 8On the fifth day, he got up early to leave, and the girl&amp;rsquo;s father said, &amp;ldquo;Strengthen yourself and wait till this afternoon.&amp;rdquo; So they ate together again. 9When the man, his concubine, and his servant got up to leave, his father-in-law said, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s getting toward evening; stay here tonight and relax. You can get up early tomorrow for your trip home.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They said, &amp;ldquo;How did this wickedness happen?&amp;rdquo; 4The Levite, husband of the murdered woman, said, &amp;ldquo;My concubine and I came to Gibeah, in Benjamin, to spend the night. 5The men there rose against me and set on the house around me after dark. They meant to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she&amp;rsquo;s dead. 6I cut her up in pieces and sent them all over Israel because they&amp;rsquo;ve committed a detestable, disgraceful act. 7People of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
