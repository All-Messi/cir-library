<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men in Ephraim said to him, &ldquo;What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?&rdquo; They were in animated contention with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, &ldquo;What have I done compared to you? Isn&rsquo;t the gleaning of grapes in Ephraim better than the vintage in Abiezer? 3God delivered Oreb and Zeeb to you. What have I done compared to that?&rdquo; They calmed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gideon and the 300 crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. 5He said to the men in Succoth, &ldquo;Give loaves of bread to the ones with me. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re worn out, and I&rsquo;m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The officials in Succoth said, &ldquo;Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your army?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Gideon said, &ldquo;All right, then. When Yahveh delivers them to me, I&rsquo;ll flail you with wild briers and thorns.&rdquo; 8He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told them, &ldquo;When I come back after peace is restored, I&rsquo;ll tear down this tower.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east of the Jordan; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and caught them in a surprise attack. 12Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, 14he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the names of the 77 officials and elders in Succoth. 15Gideon came and said, &ldquo;Look, Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, &lsquo;Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your exhausted men?&rsquo; 16He disciplined the city elders with wild thorns and briers from the countryside. 17He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, &ldquo;What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Every one of them was like you, like a king&rsquo;s son.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He said, &ldquo;They were my brothers, my mother&rsquo;s sons. As sure as Yahveh lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn&rsquo;t have killed you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He told Jether his firstborn to get up and kill them. But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, &ldquo;Be a man. Come do it yourself.&rdquo; Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels&rsquo; necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the Israelites said to him, &ldquo;Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well. You&rsquo;ve delivered us from Midian.&rdquo; 23&quot;I won&rsquo;t be your ruler. My son won&rsquo;t either. Yahveh will be your ruler. 24Let me ask you for one thing, though. Each of you, give me the earrings from your spoil.&rdquo; 25&quot;We&rsquo;ll be glad to.&rdquo; They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. 26The gold earrings weighed 50 pounds 1700 shekels of gold—plus the camels&rsquo; crescents. 27Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 28So Israel subdued Midian; they didn&rsquo;t threaten anymore. The land had peace for 40 years during Gideon&rsquo;s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jerubbaal/Gideon went and lived in his own house. 30He had 77 sons from many wives. 31A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. 32Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. 34They didn&rsquo;t remember Yahveh their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, 35or show kindness to Jerubbaal&rsquo;s family in return for everything he&rsquo;d done for Israel. Abimelech&rsquo;s Conspiracy</span></p>
