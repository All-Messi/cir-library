        <h2 id="luke-chapter-20">Luke Chapter 20</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> One day he was teaching the people in the Temple and delivering good news. The chief priests, scribes, and elders confronted him: 2&quot;What right do you have to do this? Who gave you that right?&quot; 3&quot;I&rsquo;ll ask you something too. Tell me, 4Was John&rsquo;s baptism from heaven or humans?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They talked it over, 6&quot;If we say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you believe him?&rsquo; If we say, &lsquo;From humans,&rsquo; the people will stone us; they&rsquo;re convinced John was a prophet.&quot; 7They said they didn&rsquo;t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you either what right I have to do what I&rsquo;m doing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He started telling the people this parable: &ldquo;A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to tenants, and went on an extended trip. 10At harvest time he sent the tenants a servant to receive the fruit from the vineyard. But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. 11&quot;He proceeded to send another servant. They beat him up, too, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away with nothing. 12He sent a third. They wounded him and threw him out. 13The owner said, &lsquo;What am I going to do? I&rsquo;ll send my dear son. Maybe they&rsquo;ll respect him.&rsquo; 14When the tenants saw him, they started talking among themselves, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the heir. Let&rsquo;s kill him so the vineyard will belong to us.&rsquo; 15They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What&rsquo;s the owner going to do to them? 16He&rsquo;ll come and destroy them and give the vineyard to other tenants.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He looked at them and said, &ldquo;What then does this scripture mean,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Everybody that falls on that rock will get bruised. Whoever it falls on will get crushed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The scribes and chief priests were ready to seize him right then, but they were afraid of the people. They knew he&rsquo;d told that parable on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They kept a close eye on him and sent spies pretending to be honest men so they could latch onto something he said. That way they could turn him over to the governor&rsquo;s authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know you&rsquo;re straightforward when you teach. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you&rsquo;re talking to; you teach the way of God correctly. 22Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He saw through their deception, 24&quot;Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have on it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They couldn&rsquo;t make anything out of what he said in front of his audience. They were dumbfounded by his answer and didn&rsquo;t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Some Sadducees—who deny there&rsquo;s resurrection—came and asked him, 28&quot;Rabbi, Moses wrote to us, &lsquo;If a brother dies and has a wife but no children, his brother is to marry his wife and raise up offspring to his brother&rsquo; [Deut 25:5; Gen 38:8]. 29There were seven brothers, and the first married a wife and died childless. 30The second and 31third through the seventh married her and died and didn&rsquo;t leave any children. 32Last of all, the woman died too. 33Whose wife will she be in the resurrection? They all had her as a wife.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;People in this age get married. 35The ones considered worthy of receiving that age and the resurrection of the dead don&rsquo;t get married. 36They can&rsquo;t die anymore either, they&rsquo;re like angels. They&rsquo;re like God and participate in the resurrection. 37&quot;But, that the dead are raised, even Moses showed when he said in the &lsquo;bush passage,&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the LORD, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&rsquo;s God&rsquo; [Ex 3:6, 15-16]. 38He&rsquo;s not a God of the dead, but of the living; everybody is alive to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Some scribes responded, &ldquo;Rabbi, that was a good answer.&rdquo; 40After that, nobody tried to trip him up with loaded questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He said to them, &ldquo;How do they say the Messiah is David&rsquo;s son? 42He says himself in the Book of Psalms,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> If David calls him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; how can he be his son?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Right in front of everybody, he told the crowd and his disciples, 46&quot;Watch out for the scribes.
