        <h2 id="luke-chapter-1">Luke Chapter 1</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Many have undertaken to put together an account of what&rsquo;s been fulfilled among us. 2Eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the message have handed down accounts of those events to us. 3It seemed appropriate to me, as well, to trace these things from the start and write you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, 4so you can know for certain that your oral instruction was accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At the time of Herod king of Judaea, there was a priest named Zachariah in the Abijah division; his wife Elizabeth descended from Aaron. 6They both lived upright before God and conducted themselves blamelessly by his commandments. 7Elizabeth couldn&rsquo;t have children, and both were getting old.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zachariah was carrying out his priestly duties in front of God in the sequence of his division. 9According to the custom of the priestly office, he&rsquo;d been chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the LORD to offer incense. 10A crowd was praying outside. 11An angel of the LORD appeared to him and stood on the right side of the altar of incense. 12When Zachariah saw him, he froze in fear. 13The angel said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid, Zechariah; God has heard your prayer. Your wife will have a son, and you&rsquo;re to name him &lsquo;John.&rsquo; 14You&rsquo;llsg be so happy, and lots of people will celebrate his birth. 15He&rsquo;ll be great before the LORD:</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He&rsquo;ll return many Israelites to the LORD their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Zechariah said, &ldquo;How am I going to know that? My wife and I are both old.&rdquo; 19&quot;I&rsquo;m Gabriel; I stand beside the LORD. He sent me to bring you this good news. 20You won&rsquo;t be able to talk till it happens, because you didn&rsquo;t believe me; but it will come about in due time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The people waiting for Zechariah couldn&rsquo;t believe how long he&rsquo;d been in the sanctuary. 22When he did come out, he couldn&rsquo;t talk. They surmised that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making gestures to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When his term of service was up, he went back home. 24Later, Elizabeth became pregnant and stayed inside for five months, 25&quot;That&rsquo;s how the LORD dealt with me when he looked favorably at me and took away my disgrace at not being able to have children.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> In Elizabeth&rsquo;s sixth month, God sent Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee. 27He went to a virgin named Mary, who was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of David. 28He went inside and said, &ldquo;Hello, favored one; the LORD&rsquo;s with you.&rdquo; 29It startled her, and she wondered what he meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The angel said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid, Mary. God&rsquo;s pleased with you. 31You&rsquo;ll become pregnant and have a son you&rsquo;re to name &lsquo;Jesus.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He&rsquo;ll be great</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He&rsquo;ll rule Jacob&rsquo;s descendants forever;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Mary said, &ldquo;How can that be? I don&rsquo;t have a husband.&rdquo; 35&quot;The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One begotten will be called God&rsquo;s Son. 36Elizabeth your relative is pregnant, too, with a son in her old age. This is the sixth month with her that&rsquo;s been childless. 37God can do anything.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Mary said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the LORD&rsquo;s servant; may it be to me like you&rsquo;ve said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judaea, 40and went into Zechariah&rsquo;s house to greet Elizabeth. 41When she heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, her baby kicked, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit: 42she shouted, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a blessed woman, and your baby&rsquo;s blessed too! 43How is it that my Lord&rsquo;s mother comes to me? 44When I heard you say, &lsquo;Hello,&rsquo; I felt the baby kick for joy. 45You&rsquo;re blessed for believing the LORD will keep his promise to you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Mary said,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> I&rsquo;m happy because God my Savior</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The Mighty One has done great things for me;</span></p>

He lived in the open country till his public appearance to Israel.</span></p>
