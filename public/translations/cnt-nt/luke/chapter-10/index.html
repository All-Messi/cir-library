        <h2 id="luke-chapter-10">Luke Chapter 10</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, the Lord appointed 72 other men to go ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he intended to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He told them, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge harvest and there aren&rsquo;t many workmen, so ask the crew chief to put more help in his harvest. 3I&rsquo;m sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4Don&rsquo;t carry a money bag, knapsack, or shoes. Don&rsquo;t visit with anybody along the road. 5Whatever house you go in, first say, &lsquo;Peace to this house.&rsquo; 6If peace-loving people live there, your blessing will rest on them. If not, it will come back to you. 7Stay in the same house and eat what they provide. A worker is worth his wages. Don&rsquo;t move around from house to house. 8Whatever town you go in and they welcome you, eat what they put in front of you. 9Heal the sick in it and say, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s kingdom has come close to you.&rsquo; 10Whatever town doesn&rsquo;t welcome you, go out in the main streets and say, 11&rsquo;Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. But know this: God&rsquo;s kingdom has come close to you.&rsquo; 12At the judgment it&rsquo;ll be more bearable for Sodom than for that town. 13&quot;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would&rsquo;ve repented long ago in burlap and ashes. 14At the judgment it&rsquo;ll be more bearable for those cities than for you. 15And you, Capernaum! You won&rsquo;t be exalted to heaven, will you? You&rsquo;ll be taken down to hell. 16&quot;Whoever listens to you is listening to me; whoever rejects you is rejecting me; and whoever rejects me is rejecting the One that sent me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The 72 came back excited, &ldquo;Even the demons submit to us in your name!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching Satan fall from heaven like a blazing meteor*. 19I&rsquo;ve made you able to step on snakes and scorpions, and have authority over the power the enemy has. Nothing will hurt you. 20But, don&rsquo;t get excited as much about the spirits submitting to you as about having your names recorded in heaven.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Right then he was especially glad, &ldquo;I praise you, Father, LORD of earth and sky, for keeping these things from wise, smart people and revealing them to children. 22-23Yes, you delighted in doing that.&rdquo; He turned to his disciples, &ldquo;My Father has turned everything over to me, and nobody knows who the Son is but him, and who he is but the Son, and whoever the Son wants to reveal him to.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fortunate to see what you&rsquo;re seeing. 24Prophets and kings have wanted to see it and haven&rsquo;t seen it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A lawyer stood up to test him, &ldquo;Rabbi, what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Law say? How do you read it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He answered, &ldquo;Love the LORD your God with all your heart, soul, strength [Deut 6:5; 10:12; Josh 22:5], and mind; and love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo; [Lev 19:18].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Do that and you&rsquo;ll inherit eternal life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But he wanted to justify asking his question, so he said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s my &rsquo;neighbor&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;A man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by robbers. They stripped him, beat him up, and left him half dead. 31By chance a priest was going down that road and saw him and went around him. 32A Levite came to the place and saw him and did the same thing. 33But a Samaritan on business came by and saw him and felt sorry for him. 34He went over and treated his wounds with oil and wine, bandaged them up, put him on his own pack animal, and took him to an inn to take care of him. 35&quot;The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. &lsquo;Take care of him. Whatever more you spend I&rsquo;ll pay you when I get back.&rsquo; 36Which of the three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man the robbers attacked?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The lawyer said, &ldquo;The one that showed him mercy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> As they were traveling, he went into a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him. 39She had a sister, Mary, who was sitting in front of Jesus, listening to him. 40Martha was worried with serving, and came and said, &ldquo;Sir, don&rsquo;t you care that my sister has left me to do the serving by myself? Have her help me.&quot;</span></p>
