        <h2 id="luke-chapter-4">Luke Chapter 4</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus went away from the Jordan filled with the Holy Spirit. The Spirit was leading him to the desert 2while the devil tempted him during 40 days. He didn&rsquo;t eat anything during that time. Afterwards, he was hungry, 3and the devil said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;Scripture says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The devil took him up to show him the kingdoms of the world in an instant, 6&quot;I&rsquo;ll give you all this authority and their splendor. It&rsquo;s been given to me, and I can give it to whoever I want to. 7If you bow down to me, it&rsquo;ll all be yours.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;Scripture says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The devil took him to Jerusalem and stood him on the pinnacle of the Temple, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re  God&rsquo;s Son, throw yourself down. 10Scripture says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;It says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When the devil finished tempting him, he left till another chance would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about him spread all over the region. 15He was teaching in their synagogues, and everybody was praising him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He went to Nazareth, where he grew up. He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath as usual and stood up to read. 17They handed him a scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled it to where it says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everybody in the synagogue gave him their full attention. 21He began, &ldquo;Today you can hear this scripture being fulfilled.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They started whispering about him, amazed at the gracious way he was speaking. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Joseph&rsquo;s son?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He said, &ldquo;No doubt you&rsquo;ll use this saying against me, &lsquo;Doctor, heal yourself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do here what we heard you did in Capernaum.&rsquo; 24I tell you, a prophet is not welcome in his hometown. 25There were lots of widows in Israel at the time of Elijah, when it hadn&rsquo;t rain for 3½ years, and a severe famine dragged on. 26But the LORD didn&rsquo;t send Elijah to any of them but to a widow in Zarephath, up around Sidon. 27There were lots of lepers in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Everybody in the synagogue just lost it. 29They jumped up and threw him out of town. They hustled him to the brow of the hill the town was built on, to throw him over the cliff. 30But he passed through the mob and left.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and was teaching them every Sabbath. 32They were impressed because he delivered his message with authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> A man in the synagogue with an unclean demon shouted, 34&quot;Ah, what is this, Jesus, you Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are: God&rsquo;s Holy One!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus ordered him to be quiet and come out of him. The demon convulsed him right in front of them and came out without harming him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Everybody was astounded, &ldquo;What is this? With authority and power, he gives orders to unclean spirits, and they come out!&rdquo; 37The news about him went out everywhere in the surrounding countryside.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He left the synagogue and went to Simon Peter&rsquo;s house. Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus about her. 39He stood over her and ordered the fever to leave. She got up right away and started waiting on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> As the sun was going down, they brought him people with several kinds of illness. He laid hands on each one and healed them. 41Demons were coming out of many, crying out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s Son.&rdquo; He wouldn&rsquo;t let them keep talking because they knew he was the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> At daybreak the next morning, Jesus went out away from people, and the crowd was looking for him.
