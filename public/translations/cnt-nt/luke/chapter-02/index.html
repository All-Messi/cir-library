    <div class="chapter-content">
        <h2 id="luke-chapter-2">Luke Chapter 2</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time Caesar Augustus issued a decree to take a census of the Roman Empire. 2That was the first census, when Quirinius was governing Syria. 3Everyone went to his ancestral city to register. 4Joseph went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judaea, to Bethlehem, David&rsquo;s city because he&rsquo;d descended from David. 5He went up to register with Mary, who was engaged to him and pregnant. 6While they were there, she came due 7and had her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there wasn&rsquo;t any room for them in the inn.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nearby, shepherds were watching sheep outdoors at night. 9An angel of the LORD stood beside them, and the brightness of the LORD shined around them. They were really afraid. 10The angel said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid; I have good news for you that will make everybody happy. 11A Savior was born today in David&rsquo;s city: the Messiah the Lord. 12You&rsquo;ll find a baby wrapped in cloths, lying in a manger.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> All of a sudden, a vast host of angels in the sky joined the angel, praising God:</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When the angels went back to heaven, the shepherds said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Bethlehem and see what the LORD&rsquo;s told us about.&rdquo; 16They hurried away and found Mary and Joseph and the baby that was lying in a manger. 17When they&rsquo;d seen him, they told everybody what the angel had said about him. 18What the shepherds were saying amazed them. 19Mary treasured all that up in her heart. 20The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for everything they&rsquo;d seen and heard, which was just like the angel said.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When eight days had passed for circumcising him, they named him Jesus, like the angel had directed before Mary became pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When the time was up for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they went up to Jerusalem to present him to the LORD —23like the Law of the LORD says,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A man in Jerusalem named Simeon, a good, devout man, was looking forward to Israel&rsquo;s liberation. The Holy Spirit was on him and 26told him that he&rsquo;d see the LORD&rsquo;s Messiah before he died. 27The Spirit led him into the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to custom, 28he took him in his arms and blessed God:</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I&rsquo;ve seen the salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He amazed Joseph and Mary with what he was saying. 34He blessed them and told Mary, &ldquo;This child is destined to cause the rise and fall of many in Israel and to be a controversial sign. 35A sword will pierce your own heart too; lots of people will show what they&rsquo;re really like.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> There was Hannah as well, a prophetess, daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher. She was quite elderly, married for seven years 37and then a widow to age 84. She never left the Temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer day and night. 38She came up and thanked God and talked about the child to everyone that was anticipating Jerusalem&rsquo;s liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When Mary and Joseph had finished what the Law required, they went back home. 40The child grew and became strong and increased in wisdom. God&rsquo;s grace was on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Every year his parents would go up to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival. 42When he was twelve, they went up to the festival as usual. 43After it was over, they headed back; but the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it; 44they thought he was in the caravan. They traveled for a day and started looking for him among relatives and acquaintances. 45When they didn&rsquo;t find him, they went back to Jerusalem. 46Three days later they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking them questions. 47Everybody that heard him was surprised at his understanding and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said, &ldquo;Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking all over for you, worried sick.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> He said, &ldquo;Why were you looking all over for me? Wouldn&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;d be in my Father&rsquo;s house?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> They didn&rsquo;t get what he meant. 51He went down with them to Nazareth and was subject to them. His mother treasured all that up in her heart. 52Jesus kept growing in wisdom and stature, in favor with God and people.</span></p>
