        <h2 id="mark-chapter-15">Mark Chapter 15</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At daylight, the chief priests held session with the elders, scribes, and full Sanhedrin. They bound Jesus and led him away to Pilate. 2Pilate asked him, &ldquo;Are you the &lsquo;King of the Jews&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The chief priests accused him of all kinds of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Pilate asked him again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not saying anything? Look at all the things they&rsquo;re accusing you of.&rdquo; 5Jesus still didn&rsquo;t answer. Pilate was surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At each festival, Pilate would release a prisoner that they asked for. 7A prisoner called Barabbas was incarcerated with insurgents thatpl had committed murder in the uprising. 8The crowd came forward and started asking Pilate to do as he customarily did for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Pilate answered, &ldquo;Do you want me to release &rsquo;the King of the Jews&rsquo;?&rdquo; (10He knew the high priests had delivered him over because they envied him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But the high priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Pilate answered again, &ldquo;What do you want me to do then with the one you call &rsquo;the King of the Jews&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Pilate wanted to quiet the crowd, so he released Barabbas and delivered Jesus to be flogged and crucified.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The soldiers took him into the court—The Praetorium—and got the whole cohort together. 17They dressed him in purple and twisted together a crown made out of thorns and put it on him. 18They began to acclaim him, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; 19and were beating him on the head with a reed, spitting on him, and kneeling and bowing to him. 20When they were done making fun of him, they took off the purple robe and dressed him in his own clothes, and tookp him away to crucify him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They conscriptedp Simon, a Cyrenian coming in from the countryside—father of Alexander and Rufus—to carry his cross. 22They tookp him to Golgotha (&ldquo;The Skull&rdquo;), 23and offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he didn&rsquo;t take it. 24When they&rsquo;d crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots for what each soldier would take.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> It was 9 o&rsquo;clock when they crucified him. 26Pilate inscribed his accusation above him, &ldquo;The King of the Jews.&rdquo; 27They also crucifiedp two insurgents with him, one on each side. [28]ms</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The people going past threw insults at him and shook their heads, &ldquo;Ha! You that tear down the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, 30save yourself; come down from the cross!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The chief priests along with scribes made fun of him too, &ldquo;He saved other people; he can&rsquo;t save himself! 32Messiah, King of Israel, come down now from the cross so we can see and believe!&rdquo; Even the ones crucified with him were insulting him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> At noon it got dark over the whole country till 3. 34At 3 o&rsquo;clock Jesus cried out very loud, &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani (My God, my God, why have you deserted me) [Ps 22:1]?&rdquo; 35Some of the people standing nearby heard it, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s calling for Elijah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> One man ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if Elijah will come and take him down.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Jesus let out a loud cry and quit breathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> The curtain in the sanctuary tore in two, top to bottom. 39When the centurion standing beside him saw the way he quit breathing, he said, &ldquo;This man really was God&rsquo;s Son.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Some women watching from a distance included Mary the Magdalene; Mary, mother of James the Less and Joses; and Salome. 41When he was in Galilee, they traveled with him and helped him. There were some other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> When evening came, since it was Preparation, the day before Sabbath, 43Joseph of Arimathea—a respected member of the Sanhedrin, who was waiting for God&rsquo;s kingdom—gathered the courage to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus&rsquo; body. 44Pilate was surprised that he&rsquo;d already died. He called the centurion to ask him if Jesus was dead already. 45When he understood from him that Jesus was dead, he let Joseph have the body. 46Joseph had bought a linen sheet; he took Jesus down and wrapped him in it. He put him in a rock-hewn tomb and rolled a stone over the entrance. 47Mary the Magdalene and Mary, mother of Joseph, watched where they laid him.</span></p>
