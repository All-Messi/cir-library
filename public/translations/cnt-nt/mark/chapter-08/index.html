        <h2 id="mark-chapter-8">Mark Chapter <strong>8</strong></h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time again, the large crowd didn’t have anything to eat. Jesus called<sup>p</sup> the disciples over, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> </em><em>feel for</em><em> the crowd.</em><em> </em><em>They’ve stayed with me </em><em>three </em><em>days already and don’t have any food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> I send them home hungry, they’ll </em><em>collapse</em><em> on the way.</em><em> </em><em>Some of them have come a long way.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Six days later Jesus took<sup>p</sup> Peter, James, and John up on a mountain by themselves, and was transfigured in front of them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His clothes turned brilliant white like no laundryman can bleach them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Elijah appeared with Moses, talking to Jesus. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Peter responded<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Rabbi, it’s good to be here.</em><em> </em><em>Should we set up three tents—one </em><em>each </em><em>for you, Moses, and Elijah?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He didn’t know what to say, because they were afraid. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A cloud surrounded them, and a voice came out of it, <em>“This is my </em><em>dearly </em><em>loved Son; listen to him.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Suddenly they looked around and didn’t see anybody but Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 9:2-8</p>
<h3 id="discussing-the-vision">Discussing the Vision</h3>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His disciples answered, <em>“Where </em><em>can anyone</em><em> satisfy them </em><em>out </em><em>here in the </em><em>open </em><em>country?”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“How many loaves do you have?”</em> <em>	“</em><em>Seven</em><em>.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He told<sup>p</sup> the crowd to sit down. He took the seven loaves, blessed them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They had a few small fish. He blessed them and said to pass them out too. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The people ate till they were full, and the <em>disciples</em> picked up seven large baskets of pieces. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span></p>

Mk 8:1-10 Visit to Magadan; Demand for a Sign from the Sky</h3>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>As they were coming down the mountain, he impressed on them not to pass on to anybody what they’d seen till the Son of Man arose from the dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They kept the matter to themselves and wondered what <em>“arising from the dead”</em> meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>They asked him, <em>“Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Elijah</em><em> does come first and restore everything, and how </em><em>does the scripture say</em><em> that the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> has to suffer many things and be rejected?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> Elijah has in fact come, and they </em><em>treated him however they wanted to, like</em><em> </em><em>scripture says</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p class="section-ref">Mk 9:9-13</p>
<h3 id="healing-the-demoniac-boy">Healing the Demoniac Boy</h3>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they got back to the rest of the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When they saw him, the whole crowd was really surprised and ran to greet him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Jesus asked, <em>“Why are you arguing with them?”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>A man in the crowd answered him, <em>“Rabbi, I brought you my boy. He </em><em>has a spirit that makes him unable to talk.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Wherever</em><em> it seizes him, it throws him on the ground.</em><em> </em><em>He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth; and it makes him </em><em>rigid</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I spoke to your disciples about casting it out, but they couldn’t do it.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Unbelieving</em><em> bunch, how long am I going to be with you?</em><em> </em><em>How long am I going to deal with you?</em><em> </em><em>Bring him to me.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They brought him; and when the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus asked his dad, <em>“How long has this been going on?”</em> <em>“Ever since he was little.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Lots</em><em> of times it’</em><em>s thrown him into </em><em>the </em><em>fire or </em><em>the </em><em>water to destroy him.</em><em> </em><em>But if you can, help us; have sympathy for us.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They went<sup>p</sup> to Bethsaida, and people brought<sup>p</sup> Jesus a blind man and asked<sup>p</sup> him to touch him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He led him by the hand out of the village. He spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, and asked, <em>“Do you see anything?”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“If you can?</em><em> </em><em>Everythin</em><em>g’</em><em>s possible </em><em>for someone that </em><em>believes.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His dad cried out, <em>“</em><em>I believe! H</em><em>elp my unbelief!”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Jesus saw the crowd quickly coming together, he commanded the unclean spirit, <em>“Mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and don’t go into him again.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>It cried out and threw him into severe convulsions and came out. The boy looked like he was dead, so much so that many of them said he’d died. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi.
