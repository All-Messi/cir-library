        <h2 id="mark-chapter-8">Mark Chapter 8</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time again, the large crowd didn&rsquo;t have anything to eat. Jesus calledp the disciples over, 2&quot;I feel for the crowd. They&rsquo;ve stayed with me three days already and don&rsquo;t have any food. 3If I send them home hungry, they&rsquo;ll collapse on the way. Some of them have come a long way.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His disciples answered, &ldquo;Where can anyone satisfy them out here in the open country?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He toldp the crowd to sit down. He took the seven loaves, blessed them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. 7They had a few small fish. He blessed them and said to pass them out too. 8The people ate till they were full, and the disciples picked up seven large baskets of pieces. 9About 4,000 were there, and he dismissed them. 10Directly he got in the boat with his disciples and went to the vicinity of Dalmanutha.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Pharisees came and started arguing with him and demanding a sign from the sky—testing him. 12He groaned under his breath, &ldquo;Why do people today keep looking for a sign? They&rsquo;re not going to get one.&rdquo; 13He got in the boat again and went back to the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The disciples had forgotten to take bread along and only had one loaf left in the boat. 15He gave them strict orders, &ldquo;Watch out for the &lsquo;yeast&rsquo; from the Pharisees and Herod.&rdquo; 16They started reasoning with one another that his comment was because they did not have any bread. 17He knew it and saidp, &ldquo;Why are you talking about not having any bread? Don&rsquo;t you get it yet? Do you have minds that can&rsquo;t understand? 18Do you have eyes but can&rsquo;t see, and ears but can&rsquo;t hear? Don&rsquo;t you remember 19how many medium-sized baskets of leftover pieces you picked up when I broke the five loaves for the 5,000?&rdquo; 20&quot;How many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up when I broke the seven loaves for the 4,000?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They wentp to Bethsaida, and people broughtp Jesus a blind man and askedp him to touch him. 23He led him by the hand out of the village. He spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, and asked, &ldquo;Do you see anything?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He looked up and said, &ldquo;I see people—like trees—walking.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jesus put his hands on the man&rsquo;s eyelids again; the man looked intently, and his sight came back clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus sent him home, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back into the village.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, &ldquo;Who are people saying I am?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus told them not to tell anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He started explaining to them that the Son of Man had a lot to suffer; be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be put to death, and resurrect after three days. 32He was talking about the matter openly, and Peter pulled him aside and began to scold him. 33He turned around and saw his disciples and scolded Peter, &ldquo;Get behind me, Satan. Your mind&rsquo;s not on God&rsquo;s interests, but human interests.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He called the crowd with his disciples, &ldquo;If people want to follow me, they have to set aside their own interests, pick up their cross, and follow me. 35Whoever wants to save their life will lose it; whoever loses their life more than me and the good news will save it. 36What good does it do anyone to gain the whole world and forfeit teir life? 37What would they give in exchange for their life? 38Whoever&rsquo;s ashamed of me and my message in this adulterous, sinful time, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his Father&rsquo;s glory with his holy angels.</span></p>
