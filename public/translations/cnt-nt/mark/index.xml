A man with a paralyzed hand was there. 2Pharisees were watching to see if he&amp;rsquo;d heal him on Sabbath so they could accuse him. 3He toldp the man, &amp;ldquo;Stand up.&amp;rdquo; 4He askedp them, &amp;ldquo;Is it lawful to do good on Sabbath or to do bad, to save life or take life?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; He looked around at them angry, dismayed at their lack of compassion. He toldp the fellow, &amp;ldquo;Hold out your hand.&amp;rdquo; He did, and it was restored. 6The Pharisees left right away to plot with the Herodians to destroy him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The crowd was on the shore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He started teaching them with parables. 3&amp;quot;Listen. A sower went out to sow. 4As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and birds came and ate it. 5Some fell on rocky ground, where there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much soil. It sprouted up right away because the soil was thin. 6But when the sun climbed high, it scorched and shriveled up because it didn&amp;rsquo;t have roots. 7Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it out, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t produce anything. 8But other seed fell on good ground, grew up, and produced 30, 60, 100 times over. 9Whoever has ears, listen!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He&amp;rsquo;d pulled the chains apart and break the shackles in pieces. Nobody was strong enough to subdue him. 5Constantly day and night in the tombs and in the hills, he&amp;rsquo;d scream and cut himself with stones. 6When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and bowed to him 7and screamedp, &amp;ldquo;What is this, Jesus, Son of God Most High! I beg you by God not to torment me!&amp;rdquo; (8He said that because Jesus had told the unclean spirit to come out of him.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(3The Pharisees and all the Jews always wash their hands vigorously before they eat—keeping the tradition of the elders. 4When they come in from the marketplace, they don&amp;rsquo;t eat unless they take a bath. They keep many other customs—immersing cups, pitchers, bronze kettles [and bedrolls]ms.) 5They gathered around Jesus and asked, &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t your disciples follow the tradition of the elders instead of eating with defiled hands?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jesus calledp the disciples over, 2&amp;quot;I feel for the crowd. They&amp;rsquo;ve stayed with me three days already and don&amp;rsquo;t have any food. 3If I send them home hungry, they&amp;rsquo;ll collapse on the way. Some of them have come a long way.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; His disciples answered, &amp;ldquo;Where can anyone satisfy them out here in the open country?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Should we set up three tents—one each for you, Moses, and Elijah?&amp;rdquo; 6He didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to say, because they were afraid. 7A cloud surrounded them, and a voice came out of it, &amp;ldquo;This is my dearly loved Son; listen to him.&amp;rdquo; 8Suddenly they looked around and didn&amp;rsquo;t see anybody but Jesus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mark-chapter-16&#34;&gt;Mark Chapter 16&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; When Sabbath had passed, Mary the Magdalene; Mary, mother of James; and Salome bought aromatic oils to put on his body. 2Very early on the first day of the week, they camep to the tomb as the sun was just starting to come up. 3They were saying to one another, &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s going to roll the stone away for us from the entrance to the tomb?&amp;rdquo; 4When they looked up, they sawp the big stone had been rolled away. 5They went into the tomb and saw a young man sitting on the right wearing a white robe, and they were startled. 6He saidp, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be startled. You&amp;rsquo;re looking for Jesus the Nazarene that was crucified. He&amp;rsquo;s not here; he resurrected. See where they laid him. 7Go tell his disciples and Peter, &amp;lsquo;He&amp;rsquo;s going on ahead of you to Galilee. You&amp;rsquo;ll see him there like he said.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; 8They went out and ran from the tomb because trembling and excitement gripped them. They didn&amp;rsquo;t talk to anybody because they were afraid. [[9After he&amp;rsquo;d resurrected early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, that he&amp;rsquo;d cast seven demons out of. 10She reported it to the ones that had been with him, who were mourning and crying. 11When they heard she&amp;rsquo;d seen him alive, they didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it.    [Mk 16:9-11]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
