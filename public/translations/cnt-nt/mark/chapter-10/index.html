        <h2 id="mark-chapter-10">Mark Chapter 10</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> From there he wentp to places in Judaea and beyond the Jordan. Again, crowds wentp with him; and he was teaching them like usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Pharisees came and asked if a man could legally divorce his wife—testing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He answered, &ldquo;What did Moses command you?&rdquo; 4&quot;Moses allowed a husband to write a certificate of divorce and divorce her&quot; [Deut 24:1, 3].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;He wrote that because of your hardheartedness. 6From the beginning of creation, &lsquo;he made them male and female [Gen 5:2]. 7So a man is to leave his parents and be unite with his wife, 8and they&rsquo;ll become a physical unit&rsquo; [Gen 2:24]; they&rsquo;re no longer two but one. 9What God has joined, people are not to separate.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In the house the disciples asked him about it again. 11&quot;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. 12If a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> People were bringing their kids so he could touch them, but the disciples fussed at them. 14When Jesus saw it, he was indignant, &ldquo;Let them come to me. Don&rsquo;t get in their way. God&rsquo;s kingdom is made up of people like them. 15Whoever doesn&rsquo;t welcome God&rsquo;s kingdom like a little child, will certainly not get into it.&rdquo; 16He took the children in his arms and laid hands on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> As he was going out to the road, a man ran and knelt to him, &ldquo;Good Rabbi, what can I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;Why are you calling me good? Only God is good. 19You know the commandments, &lsquo;do not murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, or swindle; respect your parents&rdquo; [Ex 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20; 24:14].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus looked at him and liked him, &ldquo;There is one thing you lack. Sell what you own, give it to the poor, and you&rsquo;ll have wealth in heaven; come with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He was shocked and went away discouraged because he owned a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus looked around and saidp to his disciples, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard for wealthy people to get into God&rsquo;s kingdom.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> That surprised the disciples, but he saidp it again; &ldquo;Children, it&rsquo;s so hard to get into God&rsquo;s kingdom. 25It&rsquo;s easier for a camel to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye than for rich people to get into God&rsquo;s kingdom.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They were surprised even more and said to one another, &ldquo;So who can be saved?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jesus looked at them and saidp, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible with people, but with God everything&rsquo;s possible.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Peter spoke up, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve left everything to follow you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;Everybody that&rsquo;s left a house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields for my sake 30will receive houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields 100 times over in this age with persecution and eternal life in the age to come. 31Many first will be last and last, first.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> On the way up to Jerusalem, Jesus was ahead of them. They were wondering what was going to happen, and the people behind were afraid. He called the Twelve again and explained to them what was about to happen: 33&quot;We&rsquo;re going to Jerusalem, and I&rsquo;ll be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes. They&rsquo;ll condemn me to death and turn me over to the Gentiles. 34They&rsquo;ll make fun of me, spit on me, flog me, and put me to death. Three days later I&rsquo;ll resurrect.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> James and John, Zebedee&rsquo;s sons, camep, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, we want you to do something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Jesus told them, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking. Can you drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I&rsquo;m baptized with?&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drink the cup I drink all right and be baptized with the baptism I&rsquo;m baptized with. 40But I&rsquo;m not the One that decides who sits on my right and left hand. They&rsquo;re the ones it&rsquo;s prepared for.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> When the ten heard it, they were indignant over what James and John had done.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Jesus saidp, &ldquo;You know that rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants toward them. 43It&rsquo;s not that way with you. Whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant, 44and whoever wants to be first among you will be the servant of all. 45Even I didn&rsquo;t come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life as a ransom for many.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> They camep to Jericho. As he, his disciples, and a sizeable crowd were leaving the city, Bartimaeus (&ldquo;Son of Timaeus&rdquo;), a beggar, was sitting by the road. 47When he heard it was Jesus the Nazarene, he started yelling, &ldquo;Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> People told him to quiet down, but he yelled louder, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Jesus stopped, &ldquo;Call him over here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> He threw his cloak aside, jumped up, and went to Jesus. 51Jesus answered him, &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo; 52&quot;Go on, your faith has made you able to see.&rdquo; Instantly he could see again, and he went with Jesus on the road.</span></p>
