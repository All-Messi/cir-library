        <h2 id="mark-chapter-1">Mark Chapter 1</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> THE GOSPEL ABOUT</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Isaiah the prophet wrote,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> John came baptizing in the desert and preaching a baptism of repentance to forgive sins. 5The people from Jerusalem and Judaea were going out to have him baptize them in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins. 6John wore camel&rsquo;s hair with a leather belt around his waist and lived on locusts and wild honey.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He preached, &ldquo;After me someone more important is coming. I&rsquo;m not even worthy to squat down and unfasten his sandals. 8I&rsquo;m immersing you with water; he&rsquo;ll &lsquo;immerse&rsquo; you in the Holy Spirit.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time Jesus of Nazareth in Galilee came, and John baptized him in the Jordan. 10When he came up out of the water, John saw the sky open up and the Spirit come down on him like a dove. 11A voice came out of the sky, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my dearly loved Son that I delight in.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Spirit tookp him directly into the desert, 13and the devil tempted him there for 40 days. He was with the wild animals, and angels were helping him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, delivering God&rsquo;s good news: 15&quot;It&rsquo;s time; God&rsquo;s kingdom is on its way. Repent and believe the good news.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> As he passed along Lake Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting nets in the lake; they were fishermen. 17Jesus said, &ldquo;Come with me; I&rsquo;ll have you &lsquo;fishing&rsquo; for people.&rdquo; 18They left their nets and went with him. 19A little farther along, he saw Zebedee&rsquo;s sons, James and John, in a boat, mending nets. 20He called them, and they left their father in the boat with the hired help and went with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They wentp to Capernaum and entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and he started teaching. 22The people were amazed at how he taught; he was teaching them like someone that had authority, not like the scribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> A man in their synagogue had an unclean spirit that shouted, 24&quot;What is this, Jesus, you Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are: God&rsquo;s Holy One!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jesus rebuked it, &ldquo;Be quiet and come out of him!&rdquo; 26The unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, made a loud noise, and came out.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They were surprised and started, wondering to each other, &ldquo;What is this? A new kind of teaching with authority? He even gives orders to unclean spirits, and they obey.&rdquo; 28The news about him spread all over that part of Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They left the synagogue and went to Simon and Andrew&rsquo;s house with James and John. 30Peter&rsquo;s mother-in-law was in bed sick with a fever, and they told him about her. 31He went and took her hand and raised her up. The fever went away, and she started waiting on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That evening at sunset, people were bringing him the sick and demon-possessed. 33The whole town gathered at the door. 34He healed them from many kinds of diseases and cast out lots of demons. He wouldn&rsquo;t let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> In the morning, a good while before daylight, Jesus got up and went out by himself to pray. 36Simon and the others hunted for him 37till they found him; &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s looking for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He saidp, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the villages nearby so I can preach there. That&rsquo;s the main reason I came.&rdquo; 39He went around preaching in their synagogues all over Galilee and casting out demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> A leper camep and pleaded with him on his knees, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing, you can cleanse me.&rdquo; 41He felt sorry for him and reached out and touched him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing; be cleansed.&rdquo; 42Instantly his leprosy disappeared. 43Jesus spoke strictly to him and sent him off at once, 44&quot;Keep this to yourself, show yourself to a priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded for a public testimony.&rdquo; 45But he went out and spread it around, so Jesus had a hard time going into a town openly anymore. He stayed out in open areas, and people were coming to him from everywhere.</span></p>
