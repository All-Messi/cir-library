        <h2 id="john-chapter-7">John Chapter 7</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus was traveling around in Galilee. He didn&rsquo;t want to travel around in Judaea because the Jews were trying to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The Jews&rsquo; Festival of Unleavened Bread was coming up. 3Jesus&rsquo; brothers told him, &ldquo;Go to Judaea so your disciples can see what you&rsquo;re doing. 4Nobody does something privately when he&rsquo;s trying to get known publicly. If you&rsquo;re doing these things, show yourself to the world.&rdquo; (5Even his brothers didn&rsquo;t believe in him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Jesus toldp them, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not time for me to go yet. You can go anytime. 7The world can&rsquo;t hate you; it hates me because I speak to the fact that it does sinful things. 8You go on up; it&rsquo;s not time for me to go up to this festival yet.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He stayed in Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Jesus went up secretly. 11The Jews were looking for him at the festival, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; 12A lot of murmuring was going on in the crowds. Some were saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good man.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s misleading the crowd.&rdquo; 13But, people wouldn&rsquo;t talk openly about him because they were afraid of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> In the middle of the festival, Jesus did go up to the Temple and start teaching. 15The Jews were amazed, &ldquo;How does he know letters without going to school?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;My teaching&rsquo;s not mine; it&rsquo;s the teaching of the One that sent me. 17If anybody wants to do his will, he&rsquo;ll know if my teaching is from God or if I&rsquo;m speaking on my own. 18Somebody that speaks on his own is looking for his own honor. Somebody that&rsquo;s looking for the honor of the One that sent him is genuine; there&rsquo;s nothing dishonest about him. 19Didn&rsquo;t Moses give you the Law? But none of you keep it. Why are you trying to kill me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The crowd answered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a demon. Who&rsquo;s trying to kill you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus responded, &ldquo;I did one thing, and it amazed you all. 22Moses gave you circumcision—not that it originated with him but with the ancestors—and you circumcise a man on a Sabbath. 23If you circumcise a man on a Sabbath to avoid breaking the Law, are you mad at me because I made a whole man well on a Sabbath? 24Don&rsquo;t make superficial judgments; base your judgments on what&rsquo;s real.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Some that lived in Jerusalem were saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the One they&rsquo;re trying to put to death? 26And look, he&rsquo;s speaking openly, and they&rsquo;re not saying anything to him. Do the rulers know maybe that he is the Messiah?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then, as he was teaching, he shouted, &ldquo;You know me, and you know where I&rsquo;m from! I haven&rsquo;t come on my own; the One that&rsquo;s true sent me. You don&rsquo;t know him; 29but I do, because he sent me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They were trying to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him because it wasn&rsquo;t time yet. 31Many in the crowd believed in him, &ldquo;When the Messiah comes, he won&rsquo;t do more signs than this man&rsquo;s done, will he?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring those things, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33Jesus said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you for a little while yet; then I&rsquo;ll go back to the One that sent me. 34You&rsquo;ll look for me, but you won&rsquo;t find me. You can&rsquo;t go where I&rsquo;m going.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The Jews said to each other, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going that we won&rsquo;t find him? He&rsquo;s not going to the Diaspora among the Greeks to teach the Greeks, is he? 36What does he mean, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll look for me and won&rsquo;t find me,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go where I&rsquo;m going&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> On the last day of the festival, the main day, Jesus stood and shouted, &ldquo;If anybody&rsquo;s thirsty, come to me and drink. 38Everyone that believes in me, like the scripture has said, will have streams of living water flowing from within him.&rdquo; 39(He said that about the Spirit the ones who believed in him would receive. The Spirit hadn&rsquo;t come yet because Jesus hadn&rsquo;t been glorified.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Some in the crowd said, &ldquo;This really is &rsquo;the prophet&rsquo;&rdquo;; some said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s &rsquo;the Messiah.&rsquo;&rdquo; 41Others said, &ldquo;The Messiah&rsquo;s not supposed to come from Galilee, is he? 42Doesn&rsquo;t scripture say he descends from David and comes from Bethlehem, where David lived?&rdquo; 43So a difference of opinion about him arose in the crowd. 44Some wanted to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> The officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring him?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The officers answered, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s ever spoken like that.&quot;</span></p>
