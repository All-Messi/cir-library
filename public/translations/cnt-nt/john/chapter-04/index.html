        <h2 id="john-chapter-4">John Chapter 4</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus found out that the Pharisees heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2(though Jesus didn&rsquo;t perform the baptisms himself; his disciples did them), 3he left Judaea and headed back to Galilee. 4He had to go through Samaria. 5He camep to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land Jacob gave his son Joseph. 6Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. Jesus was sitting on the well wall about noon, tired from the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A Samaritan woman camep to draw water, and he said to her, &ldquo;Give me a drink.&rdquo; 8(His disciples had gone into town to buy food.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The woman saidp, &ldquo;How does a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink? Jews don&rsquo;t have anything to do with Samaritans.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;If you knew God&rsquo;s gift and who&rsquo;s asking you for a drink, you&rsquo;d be asking him to give you living water.&rdquo; 11&quot;Sir, you don&rsquo;t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get &rsquo;living water&rsquo;? 12You aren&rsquo;t greater than our ancestor Jacob, are you? He gave us the well and drank from it himself—his sons and herds too.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;Everybody that drinks this water gets thirsty again. 14Whoever drinks the water I give him won&rsquo;t get thirsty again. It&rsquo;ll become a well inside him that springs up into eternal life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus told herp, &ldquo;Go get your husband and come back.&rdquo; 18&quot;You said it well. You&rsquo;ve had five husbands; the one you&rsquo;re living with now isn&rsquo;t your husband. You told the truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The woman saidp, &ldquo;Sir, you must be a prophet. 20Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. Youpl say people should worship in Jerusalem.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus toldp her, &ldquo;Believe me, the time&rsquo;s coming when youpl won&rsquo;t worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem. 22Youpl don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re worshiping. We do, because salvation does come from the Jews. 23But, the time&rsquo;s coming—it&rsquo;s here now—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. The Father&rsquo;s looking for people to worship him like that. 24God&rsquo;s a spirit. and those who worship him need to worship him in spirit and truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus saidp, &ldquo;I am the Messiah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At that point his disciples got back and were surprised that he was talking to a woman. But nobody said, &ldquo;What are you trying to find out?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are you talking to her?&rdquo; 28She left her water pot and went into town and toldp the men, 29&quot;Come see a fellow that told me everything I ever did. He&rsquo;s not the Messiah, is he?&rdquo; 30They left the town and were on the way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Meanwhile the disciples kept saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, eat something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> But he said, &ldquo;I have &lsquo;food&rsquo; to eat that you don&rsquo;t know about.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They said to one another, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s brought him anything to eat, have they?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus saidp, &ldquo;My &lsquo;food&rsquo; is doing the will of the One that sent me and finishing it up. 35Aren&rsquo;t youpl saying harvest is still four months away? Look; the fields are ready for harvest now. 36Whoever reaps earns wages and gathers grain for eternal life. 37In this respect, the saying holds true, &lsquo;One sows, another reaps.&rsquo; 38I&rsquo;ve sent you to reap what you haven&rsquo;t worked on. Other people have worked, and you&rsquo;ve joined in their work.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> From that town many Samaritans believed in him because the woman said, &ldquo;He told me everything I ever did.&rdquo; 40So when the Samaritans got to where he was, they asked him to stay with them; he stayed two days. 41Many more believed because of what he said. 42They told the woman, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe just because of what you said. We&rsquo;ve heard him ourselves and know this really is the One that will save the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Two days later, Jesus left for Galilee. 44He observed that a prophet doesn&rsquo;t get any respect in his hometown.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Yet when he got to Galilee, the Jews welcomed him because they&rsquo;d seen what he&rsquo;d done in Jerusalem; they&rsquo;d attended the festival themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Then he went to Cana in Galilee, where he&rsquo;d turned the water into wine. An official&rsquo;s son in Capernaum was sick. 47When he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he went to ask him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Jesus told him, &ldquo;Unless youpl see signs, you won&rsquo;t believe, will you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The official saidp, &ldquo;Sir, come on down before my little boy dies.&quot;</span></p>
