        <h2 id="john-chapter-6">John Chapter 6</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Jesus went to the other side of Lake Galilee (Lake Tiberias). 2A big crowd followed him because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick. 3He went up on a hillside and sat down with his disciples. 4The Jews&rsquo; Passover Festival was coming up. 5Jesus looked up and saw a huge crowd arriving, and said to Philip, &ldquo;Where are we going to buy enough bread for these people to eat?&rdquo; (6He said that to test him because Jesus already knew what he was going to do.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Philip answered, &ldquo;Bread worth 200 denarii won&rsquo;t be enough for each person to get even a little bit.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, saidp, 9&quot;There&rsquo;s a boy here that has five barley loaves and two fish, but what good is that for this big crowd?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;Have them sit down.&rdquo; There was lots of grass there, so they sat down—about 5,000 men. 11Jesus took the loaves, blessed them, and gave them to the ones that were sitting there—the fish too, as much as people wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When they were full, he told his disciples, &ldquo;Pick up the leftover pieces so nothing&rsquo;s wasted.&rdquo; 13So they filled twelve baskets with scraps from the five barley loaves that Jesus had multiplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The people that saw the sign said, &ldquo;This really is the prophet that&rsquo;s supposed to come.&rdquo; 15Jesus knew they intended to take him by force to make him king, so he withdrew up the hill alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, 17got in a boat, and headed over to Capernaum. It was dark now, and Jesus hadn&rsquo;t come. 18The lake was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing. 19When they&rsquo;d rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the lake, getting close to the boat, and it scared them. 20But he saidp, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me; don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; 21So they came to take him into the boat, and presently the boat landed where they were headed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The next day the crowd that was standing back on the other side of the lake, saw that no other small boat had been there except the one Jesus hadn&rsquo;t got into with his disciples; they&rsquo;d left by themselves. 23Other small boats came from Tiberias to where the people ate the bread the Lord had blessed. 24When the crowd saw that he and his disciples weren&rsquo;t around, they got in those small boats and went to Capernaum, looking for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did you get here?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking for me, not so much because you saw signs, but because you ate bread till you were full. 27Don&rsquo;t work for bread that molds, but for bread that stays freesh forever. That&rsquo;s the kind of bread the Son of Man will give you, because he&rsquo;s the One the Father has marked with a seal.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They asked him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do to be working God&rsquo;s works?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s &lsquo;work&rsquo;: believe in the One he sent.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They said, &ldquo;What sign are you doing so we can see it and believe? What &lsquo;work&rsquo; do you do? 31Our ancestors ate manna in the desert like scripture says, &lsquo;He gave them bread from heaven to eat&rsquo;&rdquo; [Ps 78:24].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;Moses didn&rsquo;t give you bread from heaven. My Father is giving you the real &lsquo;bread from heaven.&rsquo; 33God&rsquo;s &lsquo;bread&rsquo; is the One that has come down from heaven to give life to the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> They said, &ldquo;Sir, give us that bread all the time!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the life-giving bread. Whoever comes to me will never get hungry; whoever trusts in me will never get thirsty. 36But, you&rsquo;ve seen me and not believed. 37Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I won&rsquo;t reject; 38because I haven&rsquo;t come down from heaven to do my will, but the will of the One that sent me. 39This is his will: that I not lose anything he&rsquo;s given me, 40that everybody who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I raise him up in the end.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> The Jews started grumbling because he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the bread that&rsquo;s come down from heaven.&rdquo; 42They were saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Jesus, Joseph&rsquo;s son? We know his parents. How can he be saying now that he has come down from heaven?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Jesus answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grumble around with one another. 44Nobody can come to me unless the Father that sent me is drawing him. 45The prophets wrote, &lsquo;God will teach them all&rsquo; [Is 54:13]. Everybody that listens to the Father and learns, comes to me—46not that anybody has seen him except the One that&rsquo;s come from him; he&rsquo;s seen him. 47Whoever believes has eternal life. 48I&rsquo;m the life-giving &lsquo;bread.&rsquo; 49Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died. 50Nobody that eats this &lsquo;bread&rsquo; from heaven will die. 51I&rsquo;m the life-giving &lsquo;bread&rsquo; that comes from heaven. Everybody that eats this &lsquo;bread&rsquo; will live forever. Yes, and the &lsquo;bread&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give for the life of the world is my own flesh.&rdquo; 52The Jews started quarreling with one another, &ldquo;How can he give us his flesh to eat?&rdquo; 53Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless you &rsquo;eat&rsquo; the flesh of the Son of Man and &lsquo;drink&rsquo; his blood, you don&rsquo;t have any life in you. 54People that &rsquo;eat&rsquo; my flesh and &lsquo;drink&rsquo; my blood have eternal life, and I&rsquo;ll raise them up in the end. 55My flesh is real &lsquo;food,&rsquo; and my blood is real &lsquo;drink.&rsquo; 56People that &rsquo;eat&rsquo; my flesh and &lsquo;drink&rsquo; my blood remain in me and I in them. 57As the living Father has sent me and I live because of him, whoever &rsquo;eats&rsquo; me will live because of me. 58This is the &lsquo;bread&rsquo; from heaven; it&rsquo;s not like what the ancestors ate and died. Whoever &rsquo;eats&rsquo; this bread will live forever.&rdquo; 59He said that as he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 60When they heard it, many disciples said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to understand. Who can make sense of it?&rdquo; 61Jesus knew his disciples were grumbling about it, &ldquo;Does that shock you? 62What if you see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63The spirit of what I&rsquo;ve said is the point, not the literal words. What I&rsquo;ve said I mean figuratively. 64But some of you don&rsquo;t believe. (Jesus knew from the start who wouldn&rsquo;t believe and who&rsquo;d betray him.) 65That&rsquo;s why I told you that people can&rsquo;t come to me unless the Father lets them.&rdquo; 66At that point, many disciples quit traveling with him. 67Jesus said to the Twelve, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go too, do you?&rdquo; 68Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;Lord, who would we go to? You have the life-giving message. 69We believe and have come to know that you&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s Holy One.&rdquo; 70Jesus answered, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I choose you twelve, and one of you is a devil?&rdquo; (71He was referring to Judas, Simon Iscariot&rsquo;s son, the one that would betray him.)</span></p>
