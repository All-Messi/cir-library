        <h2 id="john-chapter-9">John Chapter 9</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As he was walking along, he saw a man that had been blind from birth. 2His disciples asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, him or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?&rdquo; 3&quot;Neither he nor his parents sinned to cause his blindness. That has happened so I could demonstrate God&rsquo;s work in him. 4We need to work for the One that sent me while it&rsquo;s daylight. Night&rsquo;s coming when nobody can work. 5While I&rsquo;m in the world, I&rsquo;m the light of it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he&rsquo;d said that, he spit on the ground and made some mud and smeared it on the blind man&rsquo;s eyelids, 7&quot;Go wash it off in the Pool of Siloam (&lsquo;Sent&rsquo;).&quot; He went and washed it off and came back able to see. 8Neighbors and people that had seen him begging said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the fellow that sits and begs?&rdquo; 11&quot;The man they call Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyelids and told me to go to Siloam and wash it off. So I did, and I could see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They tookp him to the Pharisees. 14It was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and gave him sight. 15The Pharisees, too, asked him how he&rsquo;d received his sight. He told them, &ldquo;He put mud on my eyelids. I washed it off and I can see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Some Pharisees said, &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s not from God; he doesn&rsquo;t keep Sabbath.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;How could a man that&rsquo;s a sinner do such a thing?&rdquo; So they were divided over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They saidp to the blind man again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one he made see. What do you think about him?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Jews doubted that he&rsquo;d been blind till they called his parents, 19&quot;Is this your son that you claim was blind? How can he see now?&rdquo; 20&quot;He&rsquo;s our son, and he was born blind. 21We don&rsquo;t know how he can see now or who gave him his sight. Ask him; he&rsquo;s legal age; he can speak for himself.&rdquo; 22(They said that because they were afraid. The Jews had already agreed to excommunicate from the synagogue anybody who agreed that Jesus was the Messiah. [23]repeat)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They called the man a second time, &ldquo;Give God the credit; we know that man&rsquo;s a sinner.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He responded, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a sinner. I do know one thing: I was blind; now I can see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They said, &ldquo;What did he do to you? How did he make you able to see?&rdquo; 27&quot;I already told you and you didn&rsquo;t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don&rsquo;t want to become his disciples too, do you?&rdquo; 28&quot;You&rsquo;re his disciple; we&rsquo;re Moses&rsquo; disciples. 29We know God spoke to Moses, but we don&rsquo;t know where this man&rsquo;s from.&rdquo; 30&quot;It&rsquo;s amazing that you don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s from: he gave me my sight. 31We know God doesn&rsquo;t listen to sinners, but if anybody is devout and does his will, he listens to him. 32From eternity past nobody ever heard of someone giving sight to a man born blind. 33If he weren&rsquo;t from God, he couldn&rsquo;t have done anything.&quot; 34&quot;You were totally born in sins, and you&rsquo;re trying to teach us?&quot; They excommunicated him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus heard they&rsquo;d excommunicated him. When he found him, he said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;I came to the world to render judgment so the ones that can&rsquo;t see can see, and the ones that can see can go blind.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The Pharisees that were with him heard it, &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t blind too, are we?&rdquo; 41&quot;If you were blind, you wouldn&rsquo;t be guilty. But you say, &lsquo;We can see.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re still guilty.&quot;</span></p>
