<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus finished, he went out with his disciples past the wadi Kidron to an orchard 2Judas knew about, because Jesus often went there with his disciples. 3Judas had received a cohort as well as officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4Jesus knew what was coming and went out to meet them, &ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jesus.&rdquo; (Judas was standing with them.) 6When he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jesus,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He asked them again, &ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo; 8&quot;I told you I&rsquo;m Jesus. If you&rsquo;re looking for me, let these go&quot; (9like he&rsquo;d said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost any you gave me.&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s servant and cut off his right ear. His name was Malchus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;Put your sword back in its sheath. Am I not going to drink the cup the Father gave me to drink?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. 13They led him to Annas first because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 14He&rsquo;s the Caiaphas who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was acquainted with the high priest and went in with Jesus to the courtyard. 16Peter stood outside at the gate. The other disciple went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The gatekeeper, a servant woman, saidp to Peter, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of this man&rsquo;s disciples, are you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Servants and officers were standing there. They&rsquo;d built a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was standing with them, warming himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He answered, &ldquo;I spoke openly to the world and taught constantly in synagogue and in the Temple, where the Jews all gather. I haven&rsquo;t done anything secretly. 21Why ask me? Ask the ones that heard me. They know what I said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> One of the officers standing by slapped him, &ldquo;Do you answer the high priest that way?&rdquo; 23&quot;If I said something wrong, what was it? If I didn&rsquo;t, what are you hitting me for?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> While Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself, the officers said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of his disciples too, are you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> One of the high priest&rsquo;s servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, saidp, &ldquo;I saw you in the orchard with him, didn&rsquo;t I?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Peter denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They ledp Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They didn&rsquo;t go into the Praetorium themselves. They didn&rsquo;t want to defile themselves and not be able to eat the Passover. 29So Pilate came out to them, &ldquo;What charges are you bringing against this man?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Pilate said, &ldquo;You take him and judge him by your Law.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s illegal for us to execute anybody&rdquo; (32fulfilling Jesus&rsquo; statement about how he would die).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Pilate went back into the Praetorium and called Jesus, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; 35&quot;I&rsquo;m not a Jew, am I? Your nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?&rdquo; 36&quot;My &lsquo;kingdom&rsquo; is not an earthly kingdom. If it was, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being delivered to the Jews.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;king.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s why I was born—why I came into the world—to speak about truth. Everybody that&rsquo;s committed to truth listens to me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Pilate saidp, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s truth?&rdquo; When he said that, he went out to the Jews, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not guilty of anything. 39You have a custom that I release a prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release &rsquo;the King of the Jews&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> They shouted again, &ldquo;Not him! Barabbas!&rdquo; (an insurgent).</span></p>
