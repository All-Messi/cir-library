The Word was with God, and the Word was deity. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3He made everything; nothing came into existence without him. What has come 4in him was life, life that gave people light. 5The light shinedp in the darkness, but the darkness tended not to accept it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; God sent a man named John 7to tell about the light so everybody would believe. 8He wasn&amp;rsquo;t the light, but came to reveal 9it, the true light for enlightening everyone in the world. 10The Word was in the world and made the world, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t know him. 11He came into his own things, but his own people tended not to accept him. 12But, to as many as did accept and believe in him, he gave the right to become God&amp;rsquo;s offspring, 13not born by blood, physical desire, or a husband&amp;rsquo;s will, but by God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jesus&amp;rsquo; mother was there, 2and he and his disciples were invited. 3When the wine ran out, his mother toldp him they&amp;rsquo;d run out of wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus saidp, &amp;ldquo;What is this? It&amp;rsquo;s not my time yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; His mother toldp the help, &amp;ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Six big stone water jars were standing there that the Jews use for purification. They held 20 or 30 gallons apiece. 7Jesus saidp, &amp;ldquo;Fill the jars with water.&amp;rdquo; They filled them to the brim. 8&amp;quot;Dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies.&amp;rdquo; 9When he tasted it, he didn&amp;rsquo;t know where it had come from—but the help that drew the water knew. He called the groom, 10&amp;quot;Everybody serves good wine first. When guests have had a lot to drink, they serve wine that&amp;rsquo;s not as good. You&amp;rsquo;ve kept the good wine till now.&amp;rdquo; 11So Cana was where Jesus performed his first sign and demonstrated his glory, and his disciples believed in him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Jesus was sitting on the well wall about noon, tired from the trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re doing these things, show yourself to the world.&amp;rdquo; (5Even his brothers didn&amp;rsquo;t believe in him.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The people came, and he sat down and started teaching them. 3The scribes and Pharisees broughtp a woman they&amp;rsquo;d caught in adultery and stood her in front of everybody, 4&amp;quot;Rabbi, we caught this woman in adultery—in the very act. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone a woman like this. What do you say?&amp;quot; 6(They were trying to trap him so they could accuse him.) Jesus squatted down and scribbled on the ground with his finger. 7When they kept badgering him, he stood up, &amp;ldquo;The one of you that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any sin, throw the first stone at her.&amp;rdquo; 8He squatted down again and scribbled on the ground. 9They began to go away one by one, starting with the oldest, and left him alone with the woman standing there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That has happened so I could demonstrate God&amp;rsquo;s work in him. 4We need to work for the One that sent me while it&amp;rsquo;s daylight. Night&amp;rsquo;s coming when nobody can work. 5While I&amp;rsquo;m in the world, I&amp;rsquo;m the light of it.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He calls them by name and leads them out. 4When he gets them out, he goes in front of them, and they follow him because they know his voice. 5They won&amp;rsquo;t follow a stranger. They&amp;rsquo;ll run away because they don&amp;rsquo;t recognize his voice.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Martha was waiting on him and Lazarus was reclining at table with him. 3Mary took twelve ounces of ointment—very expensive pure nard—and poured it on Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet and started wiping them with her hair. The scent from the ointment filled the house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He prunes every branch that does bear fruit so it&amp;rsquo;ll bear more fruit. 3The message I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to you has already pruned you. 4Stay in me and I in you. A branch can&amp;rsquo;t bear fruit by itself; it has to stay connected to the vine; you can&amp;rsquo;t either unless you stay in me. 5I&amp;rsquo;m the vine; you&amp;rsquo;re the branches. If you stay in me and I in you, you&amp;rsquo;ll bear lots of fruit. You can&amp;rsquo;t bear any by yourselves. 6If you don&amp;rsquo;t stay in me, you&amp;rsquo;re cut off like a branch that dries up and people burn up. 7If you stay in me and what I say stays in you, ask whatever you want, and you&amp;rsquo;ll receive it. 8This is what honors my Father: you becoming my disciples and bearing lots of fruit. 9I&amp;rsquo;ve loved you like the Father has loved me. Stay in my love. 10If you do what I tell you, you&amp;rsquo;ll be staying in my love like I&amp;rsquo;ve done what my Father told me and stay in his love. 11&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve told you that so you can have the complete joy I have. 12This is my command: love one another like I&amp;rsquo;ve loved you. 13Nobody loves more than a person that lays down his life for his friends. 14You&amp;rsquo;re my friends if you do what I tell you. 15I don&amp;rsquo;t consider you servants anymore; servants don&amp;rsquo;t know what their master&amp;rsquo;s doing. I consider you friends because I tell you everything I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from my Father. 16You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose me; I chose you and appointed you to bear fruit that lasts, so my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name. 17I&amp;rsquo;m commanding these things so you&amp;rsquo;ll love one another. 18&amp;quot;If the world hates you, understand that it hated me first. 19If you were like the world, it would love its own kind. But because you&amp;rsquo;re not like it, it hates you—but I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen you out of it. 20Remember that I told you servants are not better off than their master. If they persecuted me, they&amp;rsquo;ll persecute you. If they kept my word, they&amp;rsquo;ll keep yours. 21They&amp;rsquo;ll do that to you because of me, because they don&amp;rsquo;t know the One that sent me. 22&amp;quot;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come and spoken to them, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be guilty; but now they don&amp;rsquo;t have any excuse for their sin. 23Whoever hates me hates my Father too. 24If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done among them what no one else has done, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be guilty; but now they&amp;rsquo;ve seen and hated both me and my Father. 25What they&amp;rsquo;ve done fulfills what their Law says, &amp;lsquo;They hated me for no reason&amp;rsquo; [Ps 35:19; 69:4]. 26&amp;quot;When the Helper comes that I&amp;rsquo;ll send from the Father—the truth-revealing Spirit—he&amp;rsquo;ll speak on my behalf. 27You will, too, because you&amp;rsquo;ve been with me since I began my ministry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-chapter-16&#34;&gt;John Chapter 16&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve told you that, so you won&amp;rsquo;t get caught off guard. 2They&amp;rsquo;ll excommunicate you from the synagogues, but—more than that—the time&amp;rsquo;s coming when anybody that kills you will think they&amp;rsquo;re serving God. 3That&amp;rsquo;s because they don&amp;rsquo;t know the Father or me. 4So when it happens, remember that I told you it would. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell you those things at first because I was with you. 5But now I&amp;rsquo;m going to the One that sent me, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to ask where I&amp;rsquo;m going. 6Because I&amp;rsquo;ve told you that, you feel sad. 7But it&amp;rsquo;s to your benefit that I go away because the Helper wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coming to you. If I go, I&amp;rsquo;ll send him. 8When he comes, he&amp;rsquo;ll convict the world of sin and goodness and judgment—9of sin because they don&amp;rsquo;t believe in me; 10of goodness because I&amp;rsquo;m going to the Father and you won&amp;rsquo;t see me anymore; 11and of judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged. 12&amp;quot;I still have so much to tell you, but you can&amp;rsquo;t deal with it now. 13But when the truth-revealing Spirit comes, he&amp;rsquo;ll lead you in all truth. He won&amp;rsquo;t speak on his own; he&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what he&amp;rsquo;s heard and what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. 14He&amp;rsquo;ll honor me because he&amp;rsquo;ll take from me and tell you. 15Everything the Father has is mine. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve said the Spirit will take from me and tell you. 16&amp;quot;In a little while you won&amp;rsquo;t see me; and a little while after that you&amp;rsquo;ll see me again.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Honor your Son so he can honor you. 2You gave him the right to give eternal life to everybody you&amp;rsquo;ve given him. 3Eternal life means knowing you, the only true God, and Jesus the Messiah you sent. 4I&amp;rsquo;ve honored you on the earth and finished the work you gave me to do. 5Now, glorify me and yourself with the glory I had with you before the earth existed. 6&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you to the ones you gave me out of the world, and they&amp;rsquo;ve kept your word. 7Now they know that the message I&amp;rsquo;ve given them came from you, 8They know that I really did come from you, and believe you sent me. 9I&amp;rsquo;m not asking about the world right now, but about the ones you gave me. 10My things are yours and yours are mine, and they&amp;rsquo;ve honored me. 11I&amp;rsquo;m not in the world anymore, but they are, and I&amp;rsquo;m coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name—which you&amp;rsquo;ve given me—so they can be one like we are. 12When I was with them, I kept them in your name, and none of them have perished except the one headed for destruction—to fulfill scripture. 13I&amp;rsquo;m saying these things so they can fully experience my joy. 14The world hates them because they&amp;rsquo;re not like it. 15I&amp;rsquo;m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. 16They&amp;rsquo;re not like the world as I&amp;rsquo;m not. 17I&amp;rsquo;ve sanctified them with the truth—with your message. 18As you sent me into the world, I&amp;rsquo;ve sent them into it. 19I&amp;rsquo;ve sanctified myself for them so the truth can sanctify them. 20&amp;quot;Father, I&amp;rsquo;m not just asking that these be one, but that their converts also be one. 21That way the world will know you sent me. 22I&amp;rsquo;ve given them the honor you gave me so they can be one like we are—23so the world can know you love them like you love me. 24What you&amp;rsquo;ve given me I want to be with me where I am so they can see the honor you gave me because you loved me before the world existed. 25&amp;quot;Righteous Father, the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t know you, but I know you, and these know you sent me. 26I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to make you known to them so the love you loved me with can be in them like I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4Jesus knew what was coming and went out to meet them, &amp;ldquo;Who are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Jesus.&amp;rdquo; (Judas was standing with them.) 6When he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Jesus,&amp;rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They put a purple robe on him 3and started coming up to him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&amp;rdquo; and slapping him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Pilate brought him out again, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m bringing him out to let you know I don&amp;rsquo;t find him guilty of anything.&amp;rdquo; 5So he brought Jesus out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. &amp;ldquo;Look at the man!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
