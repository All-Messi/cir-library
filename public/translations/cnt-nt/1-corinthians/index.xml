You couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat solid food and still can&amp;rsquo;t. 3You&amp;rsquo;re still material minded. While jealousy and conflict exist among you, aren&amp;rsquo;t you material minded and act like typical people? 4When any of you says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m with Paul,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m with Apollos,&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t you material minded and act like typical people? 5What&amp;rsquo;s Apollos? What&amp;rsquo;s Paul? Ministers that led you to faith. 6I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. 7So the one that plants or waters isn&amp;rsquo;t important, but God who makes it grow. 8The one that plants and the one that waters combine their efforts, and God will pay each one for his own work. 9We&amp;rsquo;re God&amp;rsquo;s fellow workers; you&amp;rsquo;re his field, his building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Lord&amp;rsquo;s the One that evaluates me. 5So, don&amp;rsquo;t rush to judgment before the Lord comes. He&amp;rsquo;ll bring to light what darkness hides and reveal the motives in people&amp;rsquo;s hearts. Then God will do the complimenting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t you understand that a little yeast spreads through the whole batch? 7Get rid of the old yeast so you&amp;rsquo;re a fresh batch. You&amp;rsquo;re a fresh batch because Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. 8So let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate the feast, not with old, evil yeast, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://all-messi.github.io/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/1-corinthians/chapter-06/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-corinthians-chapter-6&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians Chapter 6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If you have something against a fellow Christian, do any of you dare go to court in front of sinners rather than saints? 2You know, don&amp;rsquo;t you, that the saints will judge the world? If you&amp;rsquo;re going to judge the world, can&amp;rsquo;t you judge small matters? 3You know, don&amp;rsquo;t you, that you&amp;rsquo;ll judge angels, much less matters of everyday life? 4If you have courts that deal with everyday matters, appoint as judges the ones looked down on in the church. 5I&amp;rsquo;m saying this so you&amp;rsquo;ll be ashamed: don&amp;rsquo;t you have anybody among you smart enough to decide between his fellow believers? 6Christians take Christians to court and do it in front of unbelievers? 7It&amp;rsquo;s a real defect in you that you bring lawsuits against each other. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to let yourselves be wronged or defrauded? 8But you do the wronging and defrauding, and do it to fellow Christians, at that. 9Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that bad people won&amp;rsquo;t inherit God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom? Don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourselves: sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate men, homosexuals, 10thieves, covetous people, drunkards, revilers, swindlers won&amp;rsquo;t inherit his kingdom. 11Some of you were like that, but you were washed, sanctified, made good in the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s okay for a man to stay single. 2But, to avoid sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. 3A husband needs to give his wife what&amp;rsquo;s due her, and vice versa. 4A wife doesn&amp;rsquo;t have sole rights over her own body; her husband does too. The same for a husband. 5Don&amp;rsquo;t withhold yourself from one another except for a while by agreement to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so Satan doesn&amp;rsquo;t tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6I say that as a concession, not a commandment. 7I&amp;rsquo;d like everyone to be like me, but each person has his gift from God—one, one way; another, another way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We all have knowledge. Knowledge tends to make a person proud; love builds other people up. 2If anybody thinks he knows, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know like he should. 3If anybody loves God, God knows it. 4So, as to eating things offered to idols, we know idols aren&amp;rsquo;t real and there&amp;rsquo;s no God but one. 5There are lots of so-called gods and lords in the sky and on earth. 6But for us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-corinthians-chapter-9&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians Chapter 9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven&amp;rsquo;t I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren&amp;rsquo;t you my work in the Lord? 2If I&amp;rsquo;m not an apostle to other people, I am to you. You&amp;rsquo;re the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s my defense to the ones who are criticizing me. 4Don&amp;rsquo;t I have a right to eat? 5Don&amp;rsquo;t I have a right to have a wife that&amp;rsquo;s a sister in the faith like Cephas, the rest of the apostles, and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s brothers? 6Are Barnabas and I the only ones that don&amp;rsquo;t have a right not to work? 7What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat its fruit? Who tends sheep and doesn&amp;rsquo;t drink their milk? 8I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about human custom, am I? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the Law of Moses say that too? 9&amp;quot;Don&amp;rsquo;t put a muzzle on an ox while it&amp;rsquo;s threshing&amp;quot; [Deut 25:4]. God&amp;rsquo;s not concerned here about oxen, is he? 10Isn&amp;rsquo;t he speaking for our benefit? He wrote it for our benefit so the one who&amp;rsquo;s threshing should work in hopes of sharing in the crops. 11If we sowed spiritual things to you, is it too much to reap material things from you? 12If other people share that right, don&amp;rsquo;t we even more? &#x9;1 Cor 9:1-12a But we haven&amp;rsquo;t used that right. We endure things to keep from hindering the good news of Christ in any way. 13Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that the ones who perform sacred services eat from the Temple, and that the ones who wait on the altar have a share from the altar? 14In the same way the Lord has directed that the ones who deliver the good news should have a living from it. 15But I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken advantage of that provision, and I&amp;rsquo;m not writing this to change what we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. I&amp;rsquo;d rather die than let anyone make my pride hollow. 16If I deliver the good news, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to take pride in. I have to do that. Woe to me if I don&amp;rsquo;t! 17If I do it because I want to, I&amp;rsquo;m entrusted with a stewardship. 18Where&amp;rsquo;s my reward then? That I deliver the good news for free and not make use of my rights in it.&#x9; 1 Cor 9:12b-18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

God&amp;rsquo;s reliable; he won&amp;rsquo;t let you face more than you can handle. He&amp;rsquo;ll provide an escape so you can handle it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-corinthians-chapter-11&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians Chapter 11&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Follow my example like I follow Christ&amp;rsquo;s.&#x9;1 Cor 10:23-11:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I commend you for remembering me and maintaining the customs I passed on to you. 3I want you to know that God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every husband, and a husband is head of a wife. 4A man that prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. 5A woman that prays or prophesies bareheaded disgraces her head. It&amp;rsquo;s the same as shaving it. 6If a woman is bareheaded, she may as well be bald. If it&amp;rsquo;s shameful for a woman to cut her hair off, she should cover her head. 7A man shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cover his head because he&amp;rsquo;s the image and delight of God. A wife is her husband&amp;rsquo;s delight. 8Man didn&amp;rsquo;t come from woman, but woman from man. 9Man wasn&amp;rsquo;t created for woman, but woman for man. 10So she should wear a sign of authority on her head because of the angels. 11But, in the Lord a husband and wife exist as a combination. 12As woman came from man, man comes by woman, and everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God bareheaded? 14Doesn&amp;rsquo;t what&amp;rsquo;s natural teach you that long hair dishonors a man, 15but it honors a woman? Long hair serves as a covering for her. 16If someone wants to argue about it, we don&amp;rsquo;t have such a custom; neither do the churches of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you communicate, you&amp;rsquo;re doing something more important than speaking in other languages—unless you translate so you can help the church.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-corinthians-chapter-15&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians Chapter 15&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; My fellow Christians, I want you to know the most important thing in the good news I delivered to you, that you accepted, that you stand in, 2that saves you if you hold onto it (unless you&amp;rsquo;ve believed for nothing): 3Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, 4was buried, was resurrected the third day according to the scriptures, 5appeared to Cephas, then the Twelve, 6then to more than 500 disciples at the same time (most of them are still alive). 7Next he appeared to James and then to all the apostles. 8Last, he appeared to me like someone born out of season. 9I&amp;rsquo;m the least of the apostles and don&amp;rsquo;t deserve to be called one because I persecuted God&amp;rsquo;s church. 10But by God&amp;rsquo;s grace I am what I am, and his grace to me has produced results. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked harder than any of them—not so much me, but God&amp;rsquo;s grace in me. 11So whether it&amp;rsquo;s me or them, Christ&amp;rsquo;s resurrection is what we proclaimed and what you believed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do what I told the churches in Galatia. 2Every first day of the week, each of you lay aside in store as things go for you, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be any collecting after I get there. 3When I arrive, whoever you appoint, I&amp;rsquo;ll send with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 4If it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for me to go too, we&amp;rsquo;ll go together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
