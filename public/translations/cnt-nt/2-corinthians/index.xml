He&amp;rsquo;s our merciful Father and comforting God. 4He comforts us in every hardship so we can comfort other people in any hardship with the comfort he gave us. 5As sufferings for Christ increase in us, our comfort through Christ also increases. 6If we experience hardship, it&amp;rsquo;s for your comfort and salvation. If we&amp;rsquo;re comforted, it&amp;rsquo;s for your comfort to endure the same sufferings we have. 7Our hope for you is unmovable because we know that as you share our sufferings, you share our comfort too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m confident that my joy would mean your joy. 4Out of hardship and anxiety, I wrote to you through many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know how much I care about you.  &#x9;2 Cor 1:23-2:4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We don&amp;rsquo;t need letters of recommendation to you or from you like some do, do we? 2You&amp;rsquo;re our letter that everybody can know and read, written on our hearts. 3You&amp;rsquo;re an open letter from Christ, served by us, not written with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on human hearts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-corinthians-chapter-4&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So, since we have this ministry, we don&amp;rsquo;t get discouraged because we&amp;rsquo;ve received mercy. 2We&amp;rsquo;ve set aside shameful secrets; we don&amp;rsquo;t indulge in trickery or pervert God&amp;rsquo;s message. But by showing what&amp;rsquo;s true, we commend ourselves to everyone&amp;rsquo;s conscience in front of God. 3If our good news is veiled, it&amp;rsquo;s veiled to people that perish. 4The god of this world has blinded the minds of disbelievers so the glorious good news about Christ, the image of God, doesn&amp;rsquo;t enlighten them. 5We don&amp;rsquo;t present ourselves; we present Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your servants for his sake. 6God said, &amp;ldquo;Light will shine out of darkness&amp;rdquo; [Gen 1:3; Is. 9:2]; he&amp;rsquo;s the One that will &amp;ldquo;shine&amp;rdquo; in our hearts and &amp;ldquo;enlighten&amp;rdquo; us with the knowledge of his glory that shines on the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[3] 4While we&amp;rsquo;re in this tent, we groan with burdens. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to be &amp;ldquo;unhoused,&amp;rdquo; but fully housed so life can swallow up what&amp;rsquo;s mortal. 5God has prepared us for that by giving us the Spirit as a pledge.       &#x9; 2 Cor 4:7-5:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything wrong to anybody, misled anybody, taken advantage of anybody. 3I&amp;rsquo;m not criticizing you; like I said earlier, you&amp;rsquo;re in our hearts whether that means living or dying together. 4I&amp;rsquo;m being bold with you and expressing the great pride I take in you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-corinthians-chapter-9&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians Chapter 9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t need to write to you about this ministry to the saints. 2I know you&amp;rsquo;re committed to it, and I&amp;rsquo;ve told the Macedonians how pleased we are over it—pleased that you in Achaia have been ready since last year. Your zeal has stirred up many of them. 3I&amp;rsquo;ve sent the brothers so our pride in you in this matter wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be empty talk and, like I said, so you&amp;rsquo;d be ready. 4That way, if Macedonians come with me, they&amp;rsquo;ll find you ready, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be embarrassed (much less, you) by this confidence we&amp;rsquo;ve expressed about you. 5So I considered it appropriate to urge the brothers to go on to you and prepare ahead of time the blessing you promised before and get it ready as a blessing and not something you&amp;rsquo;d be doing under pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With them we destroy speculations 5and every stronghold that rises up against knowing God. We make every thought captive to obeying Christ. 6We stand ready to punish every disobedience whenever your obedience is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I married you to one husband and presented you as a pure virgin. 3I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that somehow, like the snake tricked Eve, he&amp;rsquo;ll lead your minds astray from the simplicity [and purity]ms that&amp;rsquo;s in Christ. 4If anybody comes presenting another Jesus than the One we&amp;rsquo;ve presented, or you receive a different spirit than you&amp;rsquo;ve received, or a different message than you&amp;rsquo;ve received, you pay patient attention to him! 5In no way do I consider myself inferior to the most prominent apostles. 6Even if I&amp;rsquo;m not skilled in how I speak, I am &amp;ldquo;skilled&amp;rdquo; in what I know, and we&amp;rsquo;ve made that quite clear to you in everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 2I know a man in Christ 14 years ago—whether in the body or not, I don&amp;rsquo;t know; God knows. He was caught up to the third heaven—[3]repeat 4to Paradise—and heard things you can&amp;rsquo;t express in words. 5I&amp;rsquo;ll take pride in that man; I won&amp;rsquo;t boast about myself except in my weaknesses. 6If I do boast, I won&amp;rsquo;t be foolish about it; I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s real. I don&amp;rsquo;t want anybody to regard me as something more than what they can see for themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He&amp;rsquo;s not weak toward you but is strong among you. 4Indeed, he was crucified out of weakness, but lives by God&amp;rsquo;s power. We&amp;rsquo;re weak in him too, but we&amp;rsquo;ll live with him by God&amp;rsquo;s power that&amp;rsquo;s directed at you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
