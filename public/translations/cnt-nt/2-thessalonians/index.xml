      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-thessalonians-chapter-1&#34;&gt;2 Thessalonians Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus ChristMessiah. 2Grace and peace from God [our]ms Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re always obliged to thank God for you because your faith is growing so much and your love for one another keeps increasing. 4As a result, among the churches, we say how proud we are of you because of your faith despite the persecution and hardships you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with. 5Those hardships show that in God&amp;rsquo;s just judgment you&amp;rsquo;re worthy of his kingdom you&amp;rsquo;re suffering for. 6He will be just when he pays back trouble to the ones that are giving you trouble, 7and in paying back relief to you that face trouble along with us. That vengeance will come when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven with his powerful angels 8in flaming fire. He&amp;rsquo;ll take revenge on people that don&amp;rsquo;t know God or obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. 9They&amp;rsquo;ll undergo permanent destruction away from his presence and glorious power. 10That&amp;rsquo;ll be the day when he comes, and you saints can praise him and be amazed at him because you believed our testimony. 11So we always pray for you, too, that our God will count you worthy of his calling and powerfully fulfill every good intention and faithful work. 12That way you&amp;rsquo;ll praise the Lord Jesus, and he&amp;rsquo;ll praise you in proportion to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-thessalonians-chapter-2&#34;&gt;2 Thessalonians Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Now, about our Lord&amp;rsquo;s return and our gathering to him. 2Don&amp;rsquo;t let a spirit, a message, a letter claiming to be from us disturb you if it says it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Lord to return. 3He won&amp;rsquo;t return till apostasy occurs and &amp;ldquo;the lawless one&amp;rdquo; appears. That &amp;ldquo;one destined for destruction&amp;rdquo; 4will oppose God and exalt himself above everything that&amp;rsquo;s called deity or is worshiped. He&amp;rsquo;ll seat himself in God&amp;rsquo;s Temple and claim to be deity. 5You remember me telling you that, don&amp;rsquo;t you, while I was there? 6You know what&amp;rsquo;s holding him back for now—till he&amp;rsquo;s revealed in his time. 7That secret lawlessness is already at work, but the one that&amp;rsquo;s holding him back now will continue to do so till he&amp;rsquo;s gone. 8Then &amp;ldquo;the lawless one&amp;rdquo; will appear, the one the Lord will kill with his breath and destroy at his return. 9The lawless one&amp;rsquo;s coming will be like Satan&amp;rsquo;s working: with power, signs, false wonders, 10and every sinful deception, all aimed at people that perish, people that haven&amp;rsquo;t welcomed a love for the truth so they&amp;rsquo;d be saved. 11So God will send them a deluding influence to cause them to believe a lie. 12Then the truth will judge disbelievers who delight in doing wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
