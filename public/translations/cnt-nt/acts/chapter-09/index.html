<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Saul was still making murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and asked for letters to synagogues in Damascus so, if he found any belonging to The Way—men or women, he could bring them bound to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>As he was getting close to Damascus, all of a sudden, a light from the sky shined around him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He fell to the ground and heard a voice, <em>“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Who are you, </em><em>Sir</em><em>?”</em> <em>“I’m Jesus that you’re persecuting.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em> up and go in</em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>the city. Someone will tell you what to do.</em><em>”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The men traveling with him stood speechless. They heard the voice but didn’t see anyone. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Saul got up; and when he opened his eyes, he couldn’t see. They took him by the hand into Damascus. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For three days he couldn’t see and didn’t eat or drink anything.</span></p>
<p class="section-ref">Acts 9:1-9</p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him, <em>“</em><em>A</em><em>nania</em><em>s</em><em>.”</em> <em>	“Yes, Lord.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Go</em><em> to Straight Street and ask for Saul of Tarsus in </em><em>Judas’</em><em> house</em><em>. He’s praying </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> has seen a man named </em><em>A</em><em>nania</em><em>s</em><em> coming in a</em><em>nd laying hands on him so he could</em><em> see.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Ananias answered,<em> “Lord, I’ve heard from </em><em>lots of</em><em> people how many evil things he</em><em>’s done</em><em> in Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> h</em><em>as authority from the chief priests to bind </em><em>ever</em><em>ybody </em><em>here </em><em>that calls on you.”</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Lord said, <em>“Go on; I’ve chosen him </em><em>to carry my name to</em><em> Gentiles, kings, and Israel</em><em>ites</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> show him how much </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> </em><em>has to</em><em> suffer for me.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Ananias went into Judas’ house, laid hands on him, and said, <em>“Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus that appeared to you on the road has sent me so you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Immediately scales, as it were, fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>After he ate, he regained his strength.</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>When he got back to Jerusalem, he tried to associate with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. They didn’t believe he’d become a disciple. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Barnabas took him to the apostles, and told them how he’d seen the Lord, how the Lord had spoken to him, how he’d presented the Lord boldly in Damascus. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Saul was moving freely among them in Jerusalem, presenting the Lord boldly. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He was disputing with the Hellenistic Jews, who were trying to get hold of him to kill him. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But the brothers found out, took him down to Caesarea, and sent him to Tarsus. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Then, all over Judaea, Galilee, and Samaria the church had peace and multiplied.

<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As Peter circulated through the region, he went down to the saints in Lydda. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He found a man there named Aeneas, who’d been confined to for bed eight years paralyzed. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Peter said, <em>“Aeneas, Jesus </em><em>the Messiah</em><em> is healing you.</em><em> </em><em>Get up and make your bed.”</em> Immediately he stood up. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Everyone in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord. <strong>Peter Resurrects Dorcas</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In Joppa a disciple named Tabitha (Dorcas) was always doing good things for people and giving gifts to those in need. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>She got sick and died. They bathed her and laid her in an upstairs room. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Lydda was close to Joppa, and the disciples heard that Peter was there. They sent two men, <em>“C</em><em>ome right away.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Peter went with them. When he got there, they took him upstairs. The widows stood beside him mourning and showing him shirts and <em>other </em>clothes Dorcas had made for them. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Peter had them step out; he knelt and prayed, and turned to the body, <em>“Tabitha, get up.”</em> When she opened her eyes and saw Peter, she sat up. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>He gave her his hand and raised her up. He called the saints and widows and presented her alive. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>The news spread all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>For some time, Peter stayed in Joppa with Simon the tanner.</span></p>
