        <h2 id="acts-chapter-9">Acts Chapter 9</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Saul was still making murderous threats against the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. He went to the high priest 2and asked for letters to synagogues in Damascus so, if he found any belonging to The Way—men or women, he could bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3As he was getting close to Damascus, all of a sudden, a light from the sky shined around him. 4He fell to the ground and heard a voice,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He said, &ldquo;Who are you, Sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jesus that you&rsquo;re persecuting. 6Get up and go into the city. Someone will tell you what to do.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The men traveling with him stood speechless. They heard the voice but didn&rsquo;t see anyone. 8Saul got up; and when he opened his eyes, he couldn&rsquo;t see. They took him by the hand into Damascus. 9For three days he couldn&rsquo;t see and didn&rsquo;t eat or drink anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; 11&quot;Go to Straight Street and ask for Saul of Tarsus in Judas&rsquo; house. He&rsquo;s praying 12and has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying hands on him so he could see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I&rsquo;ve heard from lots of people how many evil things he&rsquo;s done in Jerusalem. 14He has authority from the chief priests to bind everybody here that calls on you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord said, &ldquo;Go on; I&rsquo;ve chosen him to carry my name to Gentiles, kings, and Israelites. 16I&rsquo;ll show him how much he has to suffer for me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Ananias went into Judas&rsquo; house, laid hands on him, and said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus that appeared to you on the road has sent me so you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; 18Immediately scales, as it were, fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized. 19After he ate, he regained his strength. 	Acts 9:10-19a He was with disciples in Damascus for some days. 20Right away in the synagogues, he started presenting Jesus as God&rsquo;s Son. 21The ones that heard him were amazed, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the one that executed people in Jerusalem for calling on this Name and has come here to lead them bound to the chief priests?&rdquo; 22Paul grew stronger and confounded the Jews in Damascus, proving that this was the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> After a while the Jews plotted to kill him, 24but he found out about it. They were watching the gates day and night. 25During the night his disciples lowered him in a big basket through an opening in the wall.	Acts 9:19b-25</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When he got back to Jerusalem, he tried to associate with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. They didn&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d become a disciple. 27But Barnabas took him to the apostles, and told them how he&rsquo;d seen the Lord, how the Lord had spoken to him, how he&rsquo;d presented the Lord boldly in Damascus. 28Saul was moving freely among them in Jerusalem, presenting the Lord boldly. 29He was disputing with the Hellenistic Jews, who were trying to get hold of him to kill him. 30But the brothers found out, took him down to Caesarea, and sent him to Tarsus. 31Then, all over Judaea, Galilee, and Samaria the church had peace and multiplied. They were living with respect for the Lord and comfort from the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> As Peter circulated through the region, he went down to the saints in Lydda. 33He found a man there named Aeneas, who&rsquo;d been confined to for bed eight years paralyzed. 34Peter said, &ldquo;Aeneas, Jesus the Messiah is healing you. Get up and make your bed.&rdquo; Immediately he stood up. 35Everyone in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> In Joppa a disciple named Tabitha (Dorcas) was always doing good things for people and giving gifts to those in need. 37She got sick and died. They bathed her and laid her in an upstairs room. 38Lydda was close to Joppa, and the disciples heard that Peter was there. They sent two men, &ldquo;Come right away.&rdquo; 39Peter went with them. When he got there, they took him upstairs. The widows stood beside him mourning and showing him shirts and other clothes Dorcas had made for them. 40Peter had them step out; he knelt and prayed, and turned to the body, &ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&rdquo; When she opened her eyes and saw Peter, she sat up. 41He gave her his hand and raised her up. He called the saints and widows and presented her alive. 42The news spread all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord. 43For some time, Peter stayed in Joppa with Simon the tanner.</span></p>
