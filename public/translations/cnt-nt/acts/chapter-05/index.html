        <h2 id="acts-chapter-5">Acts Chapter 5</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of land. 2He kept part of the price and took the rest to the apostles. (She was in on it.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, why did Satan prompt you to lie to the Holy Spirit, when you kept part of the price of the field? 4While you had it, wasn&rsquo;t it yours? When you sold it, didn&rsquo;t you control it? Why decide to do this? You didn&rsquo;t just lie to people, but to God.&rdquo; 5When Ananias heard that, he collapsed and died. Great respect came on everybody that heard about it. 6The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Some three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8Peter asked her, &ldquo;Did youpl sell the field for such and such?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Peter said, &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d youpl agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? The ones that buried your husband are at the door, and they&rsquo;ll carry you out.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> She collapsed right there and died. The young men carried her out to bury her beside her husband. 11People that heard about what happened came to greatly respect the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The apostles did many signs and wonders among the people, and they were getting together in Solomon&rsquo;s Portico. 13People hesitated to join them, but they held them in high regard. 14Believers kept coming to the Lord, large numbers of men and women. 15As a result, they were bringing sick people out into the streets and putting them on cots and stretchers so when Peter came, even his shadow might fall on some of them. 16Crowds even came from towns around Jerusalem, carrying sick people and people harassed by unclean spirits. They were all healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The high priest and his associates—Sadducees—were jealous. 18They arrested the apostles and put them in public custody. 19During the night an angel of the LORD opened the gates of the jail and let them out, 20&quot;Go into the Temple and speak to the people the message about this life.&rdquo; 21They went in about daylight and started teaching. The high priest and his associates convened Israel&rsquo;s Sanhedrin, the senate, and sent to the jail to bring the apostles. 22But the officers didn&rsquo;t find them. They came back and reported, 23&quot;We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened it, we didn&rsquo;t find anybody inside.&rdquo; 24The captain of the Temple and the chief priests were dumbfounded about what this might lead to. 25A fellow came and told them, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re standing in the Temple, teaching the people.&rdquo; 26The captain went with the officers and brought them without force because they were afraid the people would stone them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked them, 28&quot;Didn&rsquo;t we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? You&rsquo;ve filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man&rsquo;s blood on us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Peter and the apostles said, &ldquo;We have to obey God instead of you. 30Our ancestors&rsquo; God raised up Jesus that you did murder on a tree. 31God exalted him as Leader and Savior to his right hand to offer repentance and forgiveness to Israel. 32We speak to that fact and so does the Holy Spirit God has given to ones that obey him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They were furious and wanted to execute them. 34But a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the Law, stood up and told them to put the men out of the council chamber for a while, 35&quot;Israelites, be careful what you do to them. 36Before now, Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. About 400 men joined him. He was killed, and everybody that obeyed him scattered and didn&rsquo;t amount to anything. 37&quot;After that, Judas the Galilean rose up during the census, and drew people to him. He perished too, and the ones that obeyed him scattered. 38Now I tell you, leave these men alone. If this effort is coming from men, it&rsquo;ll be overthrown. 39If it&rsquo;s from God, you won&rsquo;t overthrow them, and you can be fighting against God.&rdquo; They agreed. 40They called the apostles, beat them, charged them not to speak in Jesus&rsquo; name, and released them. 41They left the Sanhedrin, elated over being considered worthy of suffering for The Name. 42Every day in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to preach that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></p>
