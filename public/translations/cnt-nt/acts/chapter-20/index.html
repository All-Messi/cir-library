        <h2 id="acts-chapter-20">Acts Chapter 20</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After the uproar, Paul sent for the disciples. When he&rsquo;d encouraged them and said goodbye, he left for Macedonia. 2After he passed through that area and encouraged them a lot, he went to Greece 3for three months. The Jews laid a plot against him as he was getting ready to sail to Syria; so he decided to go back through Macedonia. 4With him were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy, and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. 5They went on ahead and waited for us in Troas. 6After the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi and met them in Troas in five days and stayed seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> On the first day of the week, when we got together to break bread, Paul started speaking, He intended to leave in the morning and kept speaking till midnight. 8Quite a few lamps were in the upstairs room where we gathered. 9A young man named Eutychus was sitting on the windowsill. As Paul kept speaking for a long time, Eutychus went sound asleep and fell from the third floor. They picked him up for dead. 10When Paul went down, he knelt beside him, took him in his arms, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; he&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo; 11He went back up and broke the bread and ate. After he talked for a long time till daybreak, he went out directly like he was. 12They brought the boy alive and were really relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, intending to pick up Paul there. That&rsquo;s the arrangement he&rsquo;d made; he planned to go on foot himself. 14We took him on board at Assos and went on to Mitylene. 15From there, we arrived the following day across from Chios, the next day came near Samos, and the day after that made it to Miletus. 16Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus to keep from spending time in Asia. He was pushing to get to Jerusalem by Pentecost if he could.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the church elders. 18When they came, he said, &ldquo;From the day I first came to Asia, you know how I operated among you. 19I served the Lord with humility, tears, and trials that came on me from plots by the Jews. 20I told you everything profitable as I taught you publicly and from house to house. 21To Jews and Greeks I solemnly preached repentance toward God and trust in our Lord Jesus. 22Now I&rsquo;m determined to go to Jerusalem. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen there. 23In every city the Holy Spirit declares that bonds and sufferings are waiting for me. 24But I don&rsquo;t consider my life of any value to myself, so I can finish my course in the ministry I received from the Lord—to speak the good news about God&rsquo;s grace. 25&quot;Now I&rsquo;ve presented God&rsquo;s kingdom among you, and I know you won&rsquo;t see me again. 26So I tell you today, I&rsquo;m innocent of everybody&rsquo;s blood. 27I&rsquo;ve explained to you God&rsquo;s whole plan. 28Pay attention to yourselves and the flock the Holy Spirit has given you to oversee. Shepherd God&rsquo;s church that he bought with the blood of his own Son. 29After I leave, I know fierce wolves are going to come in and not spare the flock. 30Even from you, men will rise up and say perverse things to lure away disciples. 31So pay attention; remember that for three years day and night I warned each one with tears. 32Now I entrust you to God and his grace. It can build you up and provide you an inheritance among the sanctified. 33I haven&rsquo;t coveted anybody&rsquo;s gold, silver, or clothes. 34You know these hands have provided for my needs and the ones that were with me. 35In everything I&rsquo;ve shown you that by working this way you should help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more blessed to give than to receive.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then he knelt down with them and prayed. 37They began to cry out loud, hug him, and kiss him. 38They grieved especially over his comment that they wouldn&rsquo;t see him again. They went with him to the ship.</span></p>
