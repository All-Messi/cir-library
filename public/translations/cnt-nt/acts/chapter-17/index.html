        <h2 id="acts-chapter-17">Acts Chapter 17</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia to Thessalonica. A Jewish synagogue was there. 2As usual, Paul went in and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures. 3He showed from predictions that the Messiah had to suffer and arise from the dead, and that, &ldquo;This Jesus I&rsquo;m presenting to you is the Messiah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Some were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas—a good number of God-fearers and prominent women. 5The Jews got jealous and took some riffraff from the marketplace to form a mob. They set the city in an uproar and assaulted Jason&rsquo;s house, intending to bring Paul and Silas out to the public assembly. 6When they didn&rsquo;t find them, they dragged Jason and some other converts to the city authorities, shouting, &ldquo;These insurgents against the empire elsewhere have come here too. 7Jason has welcomed them. They act contrary to Caesar&rsquo;s decrees, saying there&rsquo;s another king—Jesus.&rdquo; 8That stirred up the crowd and the authorities, 9who made Jason and the rest post bond, then released them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> That night their converts sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jews&rsquo; synagogue. 11These Jews were more open-minded than the ones in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message and examined the scriptures daily to check these things out. 12Many of them believed, together with quite a few prominent Greek men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When Jews from Thessalonica heard Paul was presenting God&rsquo;s message in Berea, they went there, too, and upset the crowds. 14Right away the converts sent Paul away as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed. 15The ones that went with Paul conducted him to Athens and brought back word for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> While Paul waited for them in Athens, seeing the city full of idols upset him. 17He reasoned with the Jews and God-fearers in the synagogues and every day with people in the marketplace. 18Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were bantering with him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this scavenger trying to say?&rdquo; Others commented, &ldquo;He seems to be presenting strange gods&rdquo; (because he was presenting Jesus and the resurrection).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They escorted him to the Areopagus, &ldquo;Can we know what this new teaching is you&rsquo;re talking about? 20You&rsquo;re bringing some strange things to us. We want to know what they mean.&rdquo; (21Athenians and foreign visitors typically spent their time telling or hearing something new.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Paul stood up in the Areopagus and said, &ldquo;Athenians, I observe that you&rsquo;re quite religious in every way. 23As I was looking at your objects of worship, I ran across an altar inscribed, &lsquo;To the Unknown God.&rsquo; What I&rsquo;m presenting to you then is what you worship without knowing him. 24The God who made the world and everything in it, is LORD of earth and sky; 25so he doesn&rsquo;t live in handmade sanctuaries. People don&rsquo;t serve him as if he needs anything; he gives everybody life, breath, and everything. 26He made the whole human race with one nature to live all over the world, and appointed their times when and boundaries where they live. 27People are to look for God if by chance they grope around and find him, though he&rsquo;s not far from any of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> We live and move and exist in him, like some of your poets have said,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Since we&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s offspring, we shouldn&rsquo;t think of deity as like gold or silver or stone or an image made from human art and imagination. 30God has overlooked the times of ignorance, but now he tells people everywhere to repent. 31So he has established a time to judge the world in regard to goodness as measured by the man he&rsquo;s appointed. He&rsquo;s given assurance to everybody by resurrecting him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> When they heard &ldquo;resurrection,&rdquo; some made fun of it; others said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hear you again about this.&rdquo; 33So Paul left them. 34Some listeners joined him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and some others.</span></p>
