        <h2 id="acts-chapter-28">Acts Chapter 28</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When we&rsquo;d made it safely, we learned the island was Malta. 2The locals were especially nice to us and received us all. Because of the rain and cold that had set in, they built a fire. 3When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a snake came out of the wood from the heat and fastened on his hand. 4The locals saw it and said to one another, &ldquo;He must be a murderer that survived the sea, but Justice didn&rsquo;t let live.&rdquo; 5He shook it loose into the fire and wasn&rsquo;t harmed. 6They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after a good while not seeing anything unusual, they started saying he was a god.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Around that place were lands that belonged to Publius, the Principal in the island. He welcomed us and entertained us for three days. 8His father lay sick with dysentery and bouts of fever. Paul went in to see him, prayed, laid hands on him, and healed him. 9After that, other sick people on the island started coming to be healed. 10They greatly honored us; and later, when we set sail, they put on board what we needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> After three months, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island—it had The Twin Brothers (Dioscuri/Twin Sons of Zeus) as its figurehead. 12We harbored at Syracuse for three days, 13then sailed around to Rhegium. A day later, a south wind came up, and the second day we made it to Puteoli. 14We found disciples there, who invited us to stay with them for a week. And so we got to Rome. 15From there disciples heard about us and came to meet us as far as Three Taverns and The Forum of Appius. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took heart. 16When we went into Rome, the centurion let Paul stay by himself with a soldier guarding him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Three days later he called together the Jewish leaders, &ldquo;Brothers, though I hadn&rsquo;t done anything against the people or the customs of the forefathers, the Jews delivered me to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem. 18The Romans examined me and were willing to release me because there wasn&rsquo;t any reason to execute me. 19When the Jews objected, I had to appeal to Caesar, though I didn&rsquo;t have anything against my nation. 20I asked to speak to you because I&rsquo;m wearing this chain on account of Israel&rsquo;s hope.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They said, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t received any letters about you from the Jews, and none of the brothers have come to report anything bad about you. 22We do want to hear what you think, because we know that people everywhere speak against this sect.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> On a day they appointed him, quite a number came to where he roomed. From morning to evening, from the Law of Moses and the Prophets, he talked about God&rsquo;s kingdom and made efforts to persuade them about Jesus. 24What he said persuaded some, but not others. 25When they disagreed with each other, they left at Paul&rsquo;s one comment,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Understand, then, that God has sent this salvation to the Gentiles; they&rsquo;ll listen.&rdquo; [29]ms</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> For two whole years Paul stayed in his own rented quarters and received everyone that came to him. 31He presented God&rsquo;s kingdom without interference and taught boldly about the Lord Jesus as the Messiah.</span></p>
