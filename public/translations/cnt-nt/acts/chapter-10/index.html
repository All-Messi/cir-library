        <h2 id="acts-chapter-10">Acts Chapter 10</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius, from the Italian cohort, 2was a devout God-fearer along with his household. He gave considerable charitable gifts to the people and prayed to God constantly. 3In a vision about 3 o&rsquo;clock, he saw an angel of God coming in and saying, &ldquo;Cornelius.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He looked at him and was afraid, &ldquo;Yes, Sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your prayers and charitable gifts have come up as a memorial to God. 5Send some men to Joppa and summon Simon called Peter. 6He&rsquo;s staying with Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea.&rdquo; 7When the angel left, he called two household servants—his personal assistants—and a devout soldier. 8He went through everything with them and sent them to Joppa.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The next day, as they were getting close to the town, Peter went up on the housetop about noon to pray. 10He was getting hungry. While they were fixing lunch, he fell into a trance. 11He watched the sky open up and something like a big sheet was let down to earth by four corners. 12It held reptiles, birds, and four-footed animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A voice said, &ldquo;Kill and eat them, Peter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The voice spoke again, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you consider unclean what God has cleansed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> That happened three times, and the vessel went back up into the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> While Peter was wondering what the vision could possibly mean, Cornelius&rsquo; men had asked around for Simon&rsquo;s house and were standing at the gate. 18They called out, asking if Simon called Peter was staying there.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> While he kept trying to figure out the vision, the Spirit said, &ldquo;Three men are looking for you. 20Go down and go with them without scruples. I&rsquo;ve sent them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He went down and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one you&rsquo;re looking for. Why have you come?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They said, &ldquo;Cornelius is a centurion, a God-fearer with a good reputation in the Jewish nation. A holy angel directed him to invite you to his house to hear what you have to say.&rdquo; 23So he invited them in and put them up for the night. The next day he went with them, and some brothers from Joppa went along.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> On the second day, he came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends. 25When Peter came in, Cornelius met him and fell down to him in homage. 26Peter raised him up, &ldquo;Please stand up; I&rsquo;m just a man too.&rdquo; 27As they talked, Peter went in and found a large group.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He told them, &ldquo;You know a Jew&rsquo;s not supposed to associate at home with a foreigner, but God has shown me not to consider anybody ceremonially unclean. 29So without objecting, I came when you called. Why did you send for me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Cornelius said, &ldquo;Four days ago about this time, I was observing 3 o&rsquo;clock prayer in my house. A man stood in front of me in bright clothes 31and said, &lsquo;Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your charitable gifts. 32Send to Joppa for Simon called Peter. He&rsquo;s staying with Simon, a tanner next to the sea. 33Right away I sent for you. Thank you for coming. We&rsquo;re here in front of God to hear what the Lord has commanded you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Peter said, &ldquo;I perceive that God doesn&rsquo;t show favoritism with people. 35But, in every nation he accepts people that respect him and live right. 36He sent the message to the people of Israel, delivering good news about peace through Jesus the Messiah, who is Lord of all. 37You know what took place all over Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached. 38God anointed Jesus the Nazarene with the Holy Spirit and power. He went around doing good and healing people the devil had oppressed, because God was with him. 39-40We witnessed what he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. On the third day God raised up the One they killed on a tree and presented him clearly, 41not to everybody, but to witnesses he&rsquo;d previously chosen—to us who ate with him after his resurrection. 42He sent us to tell the people that he&rsquo;s the One God appointed to judge the living and the dead. 43The prophets show that through him everybody who trusts in him has his sins forgiven.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on the audience. 45The believers from the Circumcision who had come with Peter were surprised that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Gentiles too. 46They heard them speak in languages and praise God. Peter responded, 47&quot;Nobody can forbid water, can they, for baptizing these who have received the Holy Spirit like we did?&rdquo; 48He commanded to baptize them into Jesus the Messiah.</span></p>
