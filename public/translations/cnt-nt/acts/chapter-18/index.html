        <h2 id="acts-chapter-18">Acts Chapter 18</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, he left Athens for Corinth. 2He found a Jew named Aquila, a native from Pontus, who was recently displaced from Italy with his wife Priscilla. Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to them. 3Since he had the same trade, he stayed with them and worked because they were leatherworkers. 4He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath in an effort to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul started devoting himself to the message. He was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 6When they opposed and slandered him, he shook the dust from his clothes at them, &ldquo;Your blood&rsquo;s on your own heads; I&rsquo;m innocent. From now on I&rsquo;m going to the Gentiles.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He moved from there to the house of Titius Justus, a God-fearer whose house was next to the synagogue. 8Crispus, the synagogue ruler, believed in the Lord along with his household. Many Corinthians heard and believed and were baptized. 9At night the Lord told Paul in a vision, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Speak out 10because I&rsquo;m with you; nobody will harm you. I have lots of people in this city.&rdquo; 11For a year and a half he settled there and taught God&rsquo;s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews as a group rose up against Paul and took him to the judgment seat, 13&quot;This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to our Law.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Paul was about to speak up when Gallio told them, &ldquo;Jews, if it were some crime or fraud he committed, I&rsquo;d have a reason to hear your case. 15But if there are questions about words, names, and your Law, see to it yourselves. I&rsquo;m not willing to render judgment on such things.&rdquo; 16He made them leave the judgment seat. 17The bystanders grabbed Sosthenes, the synagogue ruler, and started beating him in front of the judgment seat. Gallio didn&rsquo;t concern himself with any of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Paul stayed quite a few more days, said goodbye to the converts, and set sail for Syria with Priscilla and Aquila. He cut his hair in Cenchrea to keep a vow. 19They arrived at Ephesus, and Paul left them there while he went into the synagogue and dialogued with the Jews. 20Although they asked him to stay longer, he declined, 21&quot;I&rsquo;ll come back, God willing&rdquo;; and sailed from Ephesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and went down to Antioch. 23After he spent some time there, he left and passed through Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> A Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent speaker, arrived at Ephesus. He knew the scripture well. 25He&rsquo;d been orally instructed in the way of the Lord. An enthusiastic man, he was teaching accurately things about Jesus, but he only knew about John&rsquo;s baptism. 26He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and presented the way of God to him more completely. 27When he wanted to cross over to Greece, the disciples encouraged him and wrote letters to them to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped the ones that believed by God&rsquo;s grace. 28He powerfully refuted the Jews in public and showed by the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></p>
