        <h2 id="acts-chapter-27">Acts Chapter 27</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When they decided we would sail to Italy, they turned Paul and some other prisoners over to Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort. 2We boarded a ship out of Adramyttium, ready to sail to places along the coast of Asia. We put out to sea along with Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. 3The next day we harbored at Sidon. Julius was nice to Paul and let him go to friends and refresh himself. 4We launched from there and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were against us. 5After we navigated the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. 6The centurion found an Alexandrian ship there that was sailing for Italy and put us on board. 7For a number of days, we sailed slowly, and barely made it to Cnidus. Since the wind didn&rsquo;t let us sail under the shelter of Crete along Salmone, 8we drifted along it with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When considerable time had passed and the voyage was getting risky—even the Fast [Yom Kippur] was past, Paul started advising them, 10&quot;Men, I sense the voyage will involve damage and considerable loss of cargo, the ship, and our lives.&quot; 11But the centurion listened more to the captain and the ship owner than to Paul. 12Because the harbor wasn&rsquo;t suitable for wintering, the majority decided to sail from there if they could just get to Phoenix—a harbor at Crete facing southwest and northwest—and winter there.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When a gentle breeze came up, they supposed they&rsquo;d achieved their purpose. They weighed anchor and started sailing along Crete as close to shore as they could. 14But not long afterwards, a nor&rsquo;easter called Euraquilo rushed down from land 15and caught the ship. It couldn&rsquo;t face the gale; so we gave way to it and scudded along. 16We ran under a small island called Cauda and were barely able to secure the dinghy. 17After they hoisted it up, they used cables to gird up the ship. They were afraid they might run aground on Syrtis, so they let down the sail and drifted along. 18The next day, the storm tossed us violently, and the crew began to throw cargo overboard*. 19The third day, they threw the ship&rsquo;s tackle overboard by hand. 20When the sun and stars didn&rsquo;t appear for several days, and the monstrous storm bore down on us, we lost all hope of surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When they&rsquo;d gone a long time without eating, Paul stood up among them, &ldquo;Men, you should&rsquo;ve listened to me and not sailed from Crete and incurred this damage and loss. 22Now I urge you to take heart. There won&rsquo;t be any loss of life, just the ship. 23Last night an angel of the God I serve stood by me, 24&rsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Paul; you need to stand in front of Caesar, and God has granted you everybody that&rsquo;s sailing with you.&rsquo; 25So take heart; I believe it will turn out like he said, 26but we have to run aground on an island.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The fourteenth night, the storm was driving us around in the Sea of Hadria. About midnight the sailors sensed we were nearing land, 28so they took a sounding and found the depth was 120 feet. A little farther on, another sounding showed 90 feet. 29Fearing we might run aground on a rocky coast, they cast four anchors out the stern and longed for daylight. 30The sailors tried to jump ship by lowering its dinghy into the water on the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow. 31Paul told the centurion and his soldiers, &ldquo;If those sailors don&rsquo;t stay on the ship, youpl won&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo; 32The soldiers cut the ropes to the dinghy and let it fall off.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> At early dawn, Paul started urging everybody to eat, &ldquo;Today makes two weeks you&rsquo;ve been on edge, not eating. 34Eat for your survival. Not a hair of your head will perish.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When he&rsquo;d said that, he took a loaf, thanked God in front of them all, broke it up, and starting eating. 36They took heart and started eating too. 37There were 276 of us on board. 38When they&rsquo;d eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When it got daylight, they didn&rsquo;t recognize the land, but they noticed a creek with a beach. They decided, if possible, to save the ship. 40They cut the anchors loose and left them in the sea. At the same time, they took loose the ropes of the rudders, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach. 41But they struck a mud bar where two currents met. The prow stuck fast and wouldn&rsquo;t budge, and the force of the waves started tearing the stern apart. 42The soldiers intended to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim away and escape. 43But the centurion wanted to take Paul safely through and stopped them. He told the ones that could swim to jump overboard and get to land first. 44The rest would float there on planks or items from the ship. That way everybody got to shore.</span></p>
