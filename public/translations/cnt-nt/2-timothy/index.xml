      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-timothy-chapter-1&#34;&gt;2 Timothy Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God&amp;rsquo;s will in regard to the life he promised in Christ Jesus, 2to Timothy, my dear son. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; As I remember you in my prayers day and night, I thank my ancestors&amp;rsquo; God that I serve with a good conscience. 4I really want to see you again because I&amp;rsquo;ve been remembering your tears. 5I remember your sincere faith, a faith your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice had first. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s been in you, too, ever since. 6That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m reminding you to stir up the spiritual gift you have from the laying on of my hands. 7God hasn&amp;rsquo;t given us a timid mentality, but power, love, and self-discipline. 8So don&amp;rsquo;t be ashamed of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s mystery or of me his prisoner; suffer with me for the good news as God gives you strength. 9He has saved us and called us with a holy calling. What we can do ourselves doesn&amp;rsquo;t define that calling. His purpose and grace define it, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began. 10The coming of our Savior Christ Jesus now has revealed that purpose and grace. He destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news. 11He&amp;rsquo;s appointed me as a preacher, apostle, and teacher of that good news. 12That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m suffering what I am. But I&amp;rsquo;m not ashamed; I know who I&amp;rsquo;ve trusted, and I&amp;rsquo;m confident that he can keep what I entrusted to him till that day. 13Hold onto the sound form of the message you&amp;rsquo;ve heard from me about the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 14By the Holy Spirit who lives in us, keep what he&amp;rsquo;s entrusted to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-timothy-chapter-2&#34;&gt;2 Timothy Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So, my son, you be strong in the grace that Christ Jesus gives. 2What you&amp;rsquo;ve heard from me among many witnesses entrust to faithful men that can teach others. 3Endure hardship with me like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4A soldier doesn&amp;rsquo;t get mixed up in the affairs of daily life while he&amp;rsquo;s a soldier. That way he can please his recruiter. 5An athlete doesn&amp;rsquo;t win the garland unless he competes by the rules. 6A laboring farmer should be first to share in his crops. 7Think about what I&amp;rsquo;m saying; the Lord will help you understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-timothy-chapter-3&#34;&gt;2 Timothy Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Be aware that difficult times will come later on. 2People will be selfish, money-loving, proud and arrogant, slanderous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3without natural affection, heartless, slanderous gossips, without self-control, vicious, not loving what&amp;rsquo;s good, 4treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure more than God. 5They&amp;rsquo;ll have the trappings of religion but deny its power. Avoid people like that. 6They&amp;rsquo;re the kind that sneak into families and seduce morally weak women that are weighed down with sins and lured on by various desires, 7whomas are always learning but never able to find the truth. 8Those who oppose the truth are like Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses. They&amp;rsquo;re corrupt in mind; they&amp;rsquo;re rejected as far as the faith is concerned. 9They won&amp;rsquo;t get anywhere because their foolishness will be obvious to everybody just like the foolishness of those men was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-timothy-chapter-4&#34;&gt;2 Timothy Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I solemnly charge you in front of God and Christ Jesus—who will judge the living and the dead—and by his appearing and kingdom: 2proclaim the message. Be ready in normal or unusual times. Refute, reprimand, encourage patiently with teaching. 3The time will come when people won&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to sound teaching. They&amp;rsquo;ll draw teachers to themselves that reinforce their own desires and say what they want to hear. 4They&amp;rsquo;ll wander off from the true message and turn to myths. 5You be self-controlled, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
