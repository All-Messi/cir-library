      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-chapter-5&#34;&gt;Matthew Chapter 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 1When he saw the crowd, he went up on a hillside and sat down. His disciples joined him, 2and he started teaching: 3“Poor people are fortunate spiritually; they have the kingdom of heaven. 4“People in mourning are fortunate; comfort will come. 5“Humble people are fortunate; they’ll inherit the earth. 6“People that are hungry and thirsty for righteousness are fortunate; they’ll be satisfied. 7“Merciful people are fortunate; they’ll receive mercy. 8“People that are pure in heart are fortunate; they’ll see God. 9“Peacemakers are fortunate; they’ll be called God’s children. 10“People persecuted for living right are fortunate; they have the kingdom of heaven.&#x9;Mt 5:1-10 11“When people insult you, mistreat you, say all kinds of bad things about you falsely because of me, you are fortunate. 12Be glad, because you have a great reward in heaven. They treated the prophets the same way. 13“You are the salt of the earth; but if salt loses its saltiness, what can make it salty? It’s not good for anything but to throw out for people to walk on. 14You are the light of the world. A city on a hill can’t hide. 15Nobody lights a lamp and sticks it under a basket; they put it on a stand, and it gives light to everybody in the house. 16Let your light shine so people can see the good things you’re doing and praise your Father in heaven. 17“Don’t get the impression that I’m here to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I’m not here to destroy them, but to fulfill them. 18Earth and sky will pass away, but not one iota or one serif* will pass away from the Law till it’s fully accomplished its purpose. 19Whoever breaks one of its least commandments and teaches people to do that, is least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them is great in that kingdom. 20Unless the way you live is better than the way the scribes and Pharisees live, you won’t even get into the kingdom of heaven.                                                                                   Mt 5:11-20 21“You’ve heard that God said long ago, ‘Do not commit murder’ [Ex 20:13; Deut 5:17]; ‘whoever commits murder faces condemnation.’ 22I’m telling you, anybody that’s mad at someone faces judgment. Whoever says, ‘You good for nothing . . .’ has the court to face. Whoever says, ‘You idiot,’ faces a burning hell. 23So if you’re taking your gift to the altar and remember your brother has something against you, 24leave it at the altar and go reconcile with him. Then come and offer your gift. 25Come to terms with your opponent quickly while you’re on the way to court with him so he doesn’t deliver you to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the court assistant, and he put you in jail. 26You won’t get out till you pay the last penny. 27“You’ve heard, ‘Do not commit adultery’ [Ex 20:14; Deut 5:18]. 28I’m telling you, anybody that looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29If your right eye is causing you problems, gouge it out and throw it away. It’s better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to get thrown into hell. 30If your right hand is causing you problems, cut it off and throw it away. It’s better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go to hell.Mt 5:21-30 31“It’s been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife has to give her divorce papers” [Deut 24:1]. 32I’m telling you, whoever divorces his wife—except for adultery—is treating her like an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 33“Again, you’vepl heard that God said long ago, ‘Dosg not swear falsely’; ‘perform yoursg oaths to the LORD’ [Lev 19:12; Num 30:3; Deut 23:21]. 34I’m telling youpl not to swear at all—not by heaven, it’s God’s throne; 35not by the earth, it’s his footstool; not by Jerusalem, it’s the city of the Great King; 36not by your head, you can’t make one hair white or black. 37Just say ‘yes, I will’ or ‘no, I won’t’; anything more than that comes from the evil one.&#x9;Mt 5:31-37 38“You’ve heard, ‘An eye for an eye,’ ‘a tooth for a tooth’ [Ex 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21]. 39I’m telling you not to try to get even with evil. Whoever slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other one too. 40If somebody sues you for your shirt, give them your coat too. 41If somebody makes* you go one mile, go with them two. 42Give to whoever asks you, and don’t turn away from anybody that wants to borrow from you. 43“You’ve heard, ‘Love yoursg neighbor [Lev 19:18], and hate your enemy.’ 44I’m telling youpl to love your enemies and pray for people that mistreat you 45so you can be like your Father in heaven. He raises his sun on the good and the bad, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. 46If you love the people that love you, what’s special about that? Don’t tax collectors do that? 47If you just say ‘Hi’ to your buddies, what’s special about that? Don’t even pagans do that? 48You be perfect like your Father.                                                             Mt 5:38-47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Otherwise, you won’t have any reward from your Father in heaven. 2“When yousg donate to benevolence, don’t blow a trumpet like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets so people will admire them. They have all the reward they’re going to get. 3When you donate to benevolence, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand’s doing. 4That will keep your benevolence will be private, and your Father who sees private things will reward you. 5“When youpl pray, don’t do like the hypocrites. They like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so people will see them. I tell youpl, they have all the reward they’re going to get. 6When yousg pray, go to your private room, shut the door, and pray in private. Your Father, who sees private things, will reward you. &#x9;Mt 6:1-6 7“When youpl pray, don’t say things over and over like pagans do. That doesn’t mean anything. They think they’ll be listened to because they say lots of words. 8Don’t do that. Your Father knows what you need before you ask. 9You pray this way, ‘Our Father in heaven, you are holy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They’ll trample them under their feet and turn on you and tear you apart. 7“Ask and you’ll get, seek and you’ll find, knock and it’ll open for you. 8People that ask get, people that seek find, and people that knock it opens for. 9If your boy asked for a loaf of bread, you wouldn’t give him a rock, would you? 10If he asked for a fish, would you give him a snake? 11If you, who are sinful, know how to give good gifts to your kids, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to people that ask him? 12Treat other people the way you want them to treat you. That covers the Law and the Prophets.&#x9;Mt 7:1-12 13“Go through the narrow gate. It’s a broad road and a wide gate that leads to destruction, and many go through it. 14How narrow the path is and tight the gate that leads to life! Not many find it. 15“Watch out for false prophets that come to you in wool, but inside they’re wolves. 16You can recognize them by what they produce. People don’t gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? 17-18Good trees bear good fruit; bad trees bear bad fruit. 19Every tree that doesn’t bear good fruit gets chopped down and thrown into the fire. 20So, you can recognize them by what they produce. 21“Not everybody that says to me ‘Lord’ is going to get into the kingdom of heaven. It’s the ones that do the will of my Father in heaven. 22A lot of people will try to say to me in that day, ‘Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, and do lots of miracles in your name?’ 23I’ll tell them, ‘I never knew you. Go away, sinners.’&#x9;Mt 7:13-23 24“Everybody that hears what I’m saying and does it, is like a wise man that built his house on bedrock. 25Rain fell, floods came, winds blew and beat on it; but it didn’t collapse. He’d built it on bedrock. 26“Everybody that hears what I’m saying and doesn’t do it, is like a foolish man that built his house on sand. 27Rain fell, floods came, winds blew and beat on it, and it collapsed—a total loss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You lock up the kingdom of heaven in front of people. You don’t go in yourselves or let them go in that are trying to. [14]ms 15“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel all over land and sea to make one proselyte. Then you make him more destined for hell than you are. 16“Woe to you, blind guides that say, ‘Whoever swears by the sanctuary hasn’t taken a binding oath, but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary has taken a binding oath.’ 17Blind fools! Which is more imporant, the gold or the sanctuary that makes it holy? 18“You also say, ‘Whoever swears by the altar hasn’t taken a binding oath, but whoever swears by the gift on the altar has taken a binding oath.’ 19You blind people! Which is more important, the gift or the altar that makes it holy? 20So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and everything on it. 21Whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and the One that lives there. 22Whoever swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and the One that sits on it.   &#x9; Mt 23:13-22 23“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin; and neglect the more important things in the Law: justice, mercy, faith. You should’ve done these and not neglected those. 24Blind guides that strain out the gnat and swallow the camel! 25“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and plate, but inside they’re full of greed and self-indulgence. 26Blind Pharisee! Clean the inside of the cup first so the outside of it becomes clean too. 27“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You’re like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside, but inside they’re filled with filth and dead men’s bones. 28You look good on the outside, but inside you’re filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.     &#x9;  Mt 23:23-28 29“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous 30and say, ‘If we’d lived when our ancestors did, we wouldn’t have joined them in shedding the prophets’ blood.’ 31You speak against yourselves because you’re just like the ones that murdered the prophets. 32Go ahead and be as bad as your ancestors. 33You snakes! You nest of vipers! How will you escape condemnation in hell? 34For this reason I’ll send you prophets, wise men, and scribes. You’ll kill and crucify some of them; some you’ll flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. 35So on you will come all the righteous blood shed from Abel to Zechariah son of Berechiah, the one you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary. 36I’m telling you, it’ll all come down on this generation! 37“Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that murders prophets and stones my messengers! How many times I’ve wanted to gather your people the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn’t want to! 38I leave your house to you deserted. 39You won’t see me again till you say, ‘Blessed is the One that’s coming in the name of the LORD’” [Ps 118:26].      &#x9;Mt 23:29-39 The Olivet Discourse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Come out to meet him!’ 7The virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. 8“The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ 9“The wise said, ‘No, there won’t be enough for all of us. Go to the dealers and get your own.’ 10While they were gone, the groom came. The ones that were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was locked. 11Later, the rest of the virgins came, ‘Sir, let us in.’ 12But he answered, ‘I don’t know you.’ 13So be alert; you don’t know the day or the hour.”  &#x9;Mt 25:1-13 The Parable About Talents 14“The kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a trip. He called his servants and entrusted them with things he owned. 15He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to another—according to their abilities—and left. Right away 16the one with five talents went and traded with them and earned five more. 17The one with two talents did the same thing and earned two more. 18But the servant with one talent dug a hole and hid it. 19“After a long time, the master came back and settled accounts with them. 20The one he gave five talents came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents; I’ve earned five more.’ 21“‘Well done, good, dependable servant. You were dependable in handling a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many. Enjoy my approval.’ 22“The one he gave two talents came up, ‘You entrusted me with two talents; I’ve earned two more.’     &#x9;    Mt 25: 14-22 23“‘Well done, good, reliable servant. You were reliable in handling a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many. Enjoy my approval.’ 24“But the servant he gave one talent came up, ‘Master, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow, gathering where you didn’t scatter. 25I was afraid and hid your talent in the ground. You have what’s yours.’ 26“‘You wicked, lazy servant. You knew, did you, that I reap where I don’t sow and gather where I don’t scatter? 27You should’ve taken my money to the bankers. When I came back, I would’ve received it back plus interest. 28Take the talent away from him and give it to the one with ten. 29Everybody that has will receive more; but the one that doesn’t have will lose what he does have. 30Throw the worthless servant out into the dark. There’ll be crying and chattering of teeth out there.&#x9;       Mt 25:23-30 Discussion of the Final Judgment 31“When the Son of Man comes in his glory with the angels, he’ll sit on his glorious throne. 32The nations will stand in front of him, and he’ll separate them like a shepherd separates sheep from goats. 33He’ll put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34The king will tell the sheep, ‘Come, my Father’s blessed ones, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world. 35I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you gave me a place to stay. 36I needed clothes, and you gave me some. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’ &#x9;Mt 25:31-36 37“Those good people will say, ‘When did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? 38When did we see you a stranger and give you a place to stay, or needing clothes and give you some? 39When did we see you sick or in prison and take care of you.’ 40“The king will answer, ‘When you did it for the of least of these friends of mine, you did it to me.’ 41“Then he’ll say to the people on the left, ‘Go away, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42I was hungry, and you didn’t give me anything to eat. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me anything to drink. 43I was a stranger, and you didn’t give me a place to stay. I needed clothes, and you didn’t give me any. I was sick and in prison and you didn’t take care of me.’ 44”They’ll say, ‘When did we see you hungry, thirsty, a stranger, needing clothes, sick, or in prison, and not help you?’ 45“He’ll answer, ‘Since you didn’t do it for the least of these of the friends of mine, you didn’t do it for me either.’ 46Those will go away into eternal punishment, but the good people will go into eternal life.”     &#x9; Mt 25:37-46 Fifth Prediction of His Death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
