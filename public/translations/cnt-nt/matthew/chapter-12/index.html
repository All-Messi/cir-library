        <h2 id="matthew-chapter-12">Matthew Chapter 12</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, Jesus was walking along through grain fields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and started picking off heads of wheat and eating the seeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When some Pharisees saw it, they said, &ldquo;Your disciples are breaking the Law.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read, haven&rsquo;t you, what David and his men did when they needed food? 4He went into God&rsquo;s house, and he and his men ate the consecrated loaves that were against the Law for him and his men to eat, loaves that were only for priests. 5Or, you&rsquo;ve read in the Law, haven&rsquo;t you, how the priests in the Temple desecrate Sabbath and remain innocent? 6Something more important than the Temple is here. 7If you&rsquo;d known what this means, &lsquo;I want mercy more than sacrifice&rsquo; [Hos 6:6], you wouldn&rsquo;t have criticized innocent people. 8A person is more important than the Sabbath.&ldquo;lit</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He left and went into their synagogue. 10A man with a paralyzed hand was there, and they asked Jesus if it was lawful to heal on a Sabbath (so they could accuse him).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t any of you pull your sheep out that fell in a ravine on a Sabbath? 12A person&rsquo;s worth more than a sheep. So, it&rsquo;s lawful to do good on a Sabbath.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then he told the man, &ldquo;Hold out your hand.&rdquo; It was restored like the other one. 14The Pharisees went out and plotted to destroy him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jesus knew it and left. Many [crowds]ms followed him, and he healed them all 16and charged them not to expose him—17in fulfillment of what Isaiah the prophet said,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He won&rsquo;t quarrel or shout;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He won&rsquo;t break a bent reed</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The nations will put their hope in him&rdquo; [Is 42:1-4].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They brought Jesus a demon-possessed blind mute, and he healed him; he could speak and see. 23The crowds were astounded, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the Son of David, is it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When the Pharisees heard about it, they said, &ldquo;He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He knew what they were thinking and told them, &ldquo;Every kingdom at cross purposes with itself becomes desolate; no city or family at cross purposes with itself will stand. 26If Satan casts out Satan, he&rsquo;s at cross purposes with himself; how would his kingdom stand? 27If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, who do your students cast them out by? Judge for yourselves. 28&quot;If I cast out demons by God&rsquo;s Spirit, then God&rsquo;s kingdom has reached you. 29How can somebody go into a strong man&rsquo;s house and seize his property unless he ties him up first? Then he can ransack his house. 30&quot;Whoever&rsquo;s not with me is against me, and whoever doesn&rsquo;t gather with me scatters around. 31So, every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven except blasphemy against the Spirit. 32Whoever insults me can be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit won&rsquo;t be forgiven in this age or the next. 33&quot;Consider a tree and its fruit good or bad together, because by its fruit a tree is known to be good or bad. 34You bunch of poisonous snakes! How can you bad people say good things? The mouth says what the heart holds. 35A good person brings good things out of his good treasure; a bad person brings out bad things. 36&quot;At the judgment, people will account for every off-handed comment they make. 37What you say will justify you or condemn you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Some scribes and Pharisees answered, &ldquo;Rabbi, we want to see you do a sign.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He answered them, &ldquo;A sinful, adulterous generation is straining to see a sign, but it won&rsquo;t get one—except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40As &lsquo;Jonah was in the stomach of the sea monster for three days and nights&rsquo; [Jon 1:17], the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and nights. 41The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with people from today and condemn them. They repented at Jonah&rsquo;s preaching; something greater than Jonah is here. 42The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with people from today and condemn them; she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom; something greater than Solomon is here. 43&quot;When an unclean spirit leaves someone, it wanders through desert places looking for rest and doesn&rsquo;t find any. 44It says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the house I left.&rsquo; It goes and finds it empty, swept out, and decorated. 45Then it takes seven spirits worse than itself, goes in and takes up permanent residence. The person&rsquo;s last condition is worse than the first. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;ll be with today&rsquo;s bad people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> While Jesus was talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside of the crowd, trying to get to him to talk to him. 47Someone told him, &ldquo;Your mother and your brothers have been standing outside, trying to get to talk to you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> He answered the person, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s my mother? Who are my brothers?&rdquo; 49He held out his hand toward his disciples, &ldquo;My mother and my brothers! 50My brother, my sister, my mother is whoever does the will of my Father in heaven.&quot;</span></p>
