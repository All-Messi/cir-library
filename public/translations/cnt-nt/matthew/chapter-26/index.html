<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1When Jesus finished, he told his disciples, 2“As you know, the Passover is two days from now. I’ll be handed over to be crucified.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Meantime the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the courtyard of Caiaphas, the high priest, 4and conspired to arrest Jesus by treachery and put him to death. 5But they said, “Not during the festival; the people will riot.” 	Mt 26:1-5 The Anointing by Mary</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7a woman approached him with an alabaster cruise of very expensive ointment and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table. 8The disciples were indignant, “What’s the point of such waste? 9She could’ve sold it for a lot and given the money to the poor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus was aware of it, “Why are you fussing at her? She’s done me a good turn. 11You always have poor people around, but you won’t always havefp me. 12She put this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial. 13I tell you, wherever you deliver the good news in the world, tell what she did in memory of her.	 Mt 26:6-13 Judas’ Plot to Betray Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the high priests, 15“What would you give me to deliver Jesus over to you?” They counted out 30 silver shekels for him. 16From then on, he was looking for a chance to deliver him over to them. 	Mt 26:14-16 Preparation for the Passover Meal</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> On the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, “Where do you want us to get things ready for the Passover?”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said, “Go into the city to such and such a man and say, ‘The Rabbi says, “My time’s getting close. I’ll observep the Passover at your place with my disciples.”’”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The disciples did that and got things ready for observing the Passover meal.	Mt 26:17-19 The Passover Meal; Judas Identified as Traitor</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That evening, Jesus was reclining at table with the Twelve.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> While they were eating, he said, “I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They were really distressed and started saying, “It’s not me, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He answered, “It’s the one that has dipped his hand with me in the bowl. 24The Son of Man will go the way scripture says, but woe to the one that betrays him. It would’ve been better if he hadn’t been born.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Judas, the one that did betray him, said, “It’s not me, is it?” “Yes.”	Mt 26:20-25 The Lord’s Supper Instituted</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> During the meal, Jesus took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, “Take and eat it; it’s my body.” 27He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, “All of you, drink out of it; 28it’s my blood of the covenant that’s shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29This is the last time I’ll be drinking this fruit of the vine till I drink it with you in my Father’s kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jesus toldp them, “All of you will desert me tonight. Scripture says, ‘I’ll strike down the shepherd, and his sheep will scatter’ [Zech 13:7].</span></p>

Nevertheless, I’m telling you, ‘Later you’ll see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds’” [Ps 110:1; Dan 7:13].</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v65"><sup class="verse-num">65</sup> The high priest tore his clothes, “He blasphemed. What do we need witnesses for?” You heard the blasphemy. 66What’s your verdict?” “He deserves the death penalty.”	Mt 26:57-67</span></p>
