        <h2 id="matthew-chapter-27">Matthew Chapter 27</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people developed a strategy for getting Jesus executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They bound him and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.  	Mt 26:67-27:2 The Death of Judas</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When Judas the traitor saw Jesus was condemned, he regretted it and took the 30 silver shekels back to the chief priests and elders, 4“I’ve sinned. I betrayed innocent blood.” They said, “What’s that to us? That’s your problem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He threw the shekels into the sanctuary and went and hanged himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The chief priests took the shekels and said, “It’s against the Law to put them in the Temple Treasury since they’re blood money.” 7They talked it over and decided to use them to buy a potter’s field as a cemetery for foreigners. 8That’s why it’s still called the Field of Blood.* 9That fulfilled what Jeremiah the prophet said, “I took the 30 silver shekels, the price of the One as evaluated by the people of Israel,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> and theyms bought a potter’s field, like the LORD instructed me” [Zech 11:12-13; cp Jer 32:6-9].	Mt 27:3-10 The First and Second Trials in Front of Pilate</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus stood in front of the governor, who asked him, “Are you king of the Jews?” “Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> While the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he didn’t respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Pilate said, “You hear all the things they’re accusing you of, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He didn’t answer him on a single charge. The governor was really surprised. Mt 27:11-14</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> At each Passover Festival the governor had a custom of releasing one prisoner the crowd wanted. 16At the time they were holding a notorious prisoner called [Jesus]ms Barabbas. 17So while they were assembled, Pilate said, “Who do you want me to release to you, [Jesus]ms Barabbas or Jesus, called Messiah?” (18He knew they’d delivered him up out of envy.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, “Don’t do anything with that innocent man. I suffered a terrible nightmare last night because of him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and execute Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release?” “Barabbas.” 22“What do you want me to do with Jesus, called Messiah?” “Crucify him!” 23“Why? What’s he done?” They started shouting louder, “Crucify him!”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When Pilate saw he wasn’t getting anywhere, but a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, “I’m innocent of this man’s blood. This is your problem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The people answered, “His blood’s on us and our descendants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then he released Barabbas, had Jesus scourged, and turned him over to be crucified. Mt 27:15-26 Torture by the Roman Soldiers</span></p>
