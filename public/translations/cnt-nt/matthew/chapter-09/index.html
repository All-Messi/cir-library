        <h2 id="matthew-chapter-9">Matthew Chapter 9</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They got in the boat and crossed back over to his town. 2Some men were trying to bring him a paralyzed man on a stretcher. When he saw their faith, he said to the man, &ldquo;Take heart, son; I&rsquo;ve forgiven your sins.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Some of the scribes said to themselves, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s blaspheming!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus knew what they were thinking, &ldquo;Why are you thinking critical things? 5Which is easier, to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve forgiven your sins&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get up and walk&rsquo;? 6So you can know that the Son of Man has the right on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;—he saidp to the man, &ldquo;Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home.&rdquo; 7He got up and went home. 8When the crowd saw it, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to mortals.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus went along from there and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and saidp, &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; He got up and went with him. 10While he was reclining at table in Matthew&rsquo;s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined at table with Jesus and his disciples. 11When the Pharisees saw it, they started saying, &ldquo;Why is your Rabbi eating with tax collectors and sinners?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He overheard it, &ldquo;Healthy people don&rsquo;t need a doctor; sick ones do. 13Go figure out what this means, &lsquo;I want mercy more than sacrifice&rsquo; [Hos 6:6]. I didn&rsquo;t come so much to call good people, as to call sinners.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then John&rsquo;s disciples came, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don&rsquo;t fast?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jesus said, &ldquo;The groomsmen can&rsquo;t feel sad while the groom is around, can they? The time&rsquo;s coming when the groom will be taken away. They&rsquo;ll fast then. 16Nobody puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. The new material would pull away from the old garment and make the tear worse. 17People don&rsquo;t put new wine in old wineskins. The wineskins would burst and be ruined, and the wine would drain out. They put new wine in new wineskins, and both are preserved.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> While he was saying that, a ruler came and knelt to him, &ldquo;My daughter has just died. If you come and put your hand on her, she&rsquo;ll come back to life.&rdquo; 19Jesus and his disciples followed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> A woman with chronic bleeding for 12 years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. 21She said to herself, &ldquo;If I can just touch his cloak, I&rsquo;ll be cured.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus turned and saw her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, daughter, your faith has cured you.&rdquo; She was cured from then on.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus went into the ruler&rsquo;s house and saw flute players and a crowd making an uproar, 24&quot;You can go; the girl&rsquo;s not dead; she&rsquo;s &lsquo;asleep.&rsquo;&rdquo; They started to ridicule him. 25When he&rsquo;d put them out, he went in and took the girl&rsquo;s hand and raised her up. 26That news about the miracle got out into the whole area.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> As Jesus was leaving, two blind men followed him, shouting, &ldquo;Son of David, have mercy on us!&rdquo; 28When he went into the house, they came to him. Jesus said, &ldquo;Do you believe I can do this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus touched their eyelids, &ldquo;Let it happen according to your faith&rdquo;; 30and they could see. Jesus strictly warned them to keep this to themselves. 31But they went out and spread the news about him all over that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> As they were leaving, people brought him a demon-possessed man that couldn&rsquo;t talk. 33When Jesus had cast out the demon, the man could speak. The crowd was amazed, &ldquo;Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel.&rdquo; 34The Pharisees were claiming he was casting out demons by the ruler of demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus was traveling around the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, delivering the good news about the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and illness. 36When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them. They were stressed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd. 37He toldp his disciples, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big crop to harvest, but there aren&rsquo;t many workers. 38Ask the harvest foreman to put more workers in his harvest.&quot;</span></p>
