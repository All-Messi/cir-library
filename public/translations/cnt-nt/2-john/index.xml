      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-john-chapter-1&#34;&gt;2 John Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The Elder to the elect lady and her children thatpl I really love—as does everybody that knows the truth—2because of the truth that&amp;rsquo;s in us and with us forever. 3We&amp;rsquo;ll have grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Jesus ChristMessiah, the Son of the Father in truth and love.&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;2 Jn 1-3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; I was so happy to find yoursg children living in the truth the Father commanded us. 5Now I urge you, lady—not as some new commandment but what we&amp;rsquo;ve had all along: love one another 6and so be living his way. 7Many deceivers have gone out who don&amp;rsquo;t agree that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. They&amp;rsquo;re deceivers and antichrist. 8Watch that you not lose what you&amp;rsquo;ve gained, but receive a full reward. 9Anybody that goes out on his own and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay in Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching doesn&amp;rsquo;t have God. The one that stays in his teaching has both the Father and the Son. 10If a person doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring that teaching, don&amp;rsquo;t invite him into your house or greet him. 11Whoever greets him shares in his evil work.&#x9; 2 Jn 4-11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
