      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hebrews-chapter-1&#34;&gt;Hebrews Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Long ago God spoke to our ancestors by prophets in many parts and different ways. 2In these last days he has spoken to us in a Son. He made the universe through him and made him heir of everything. 3He&amp;rsquo;s the radiance of God&amp;rsquo;s glory, the exact image of his nature, and upholds everything by his powerful word. When he&amp;rsquo;d made purification for sins, he sat down on the right side of the Majesty on high, 4and became as much better than angels as he inherited a better name than they have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hebrews-chapter-2&#34;&gt;Hebrews Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So we need to pay close attention to what we&amp;rsquo;ve heard so we never drift away from it. 2What God said through angels stood firm, and every sin received the punishment it deserved. 3So how will we get off if we neglect such a great salvation? After the Lord spoke it, the ones that heard it confirmed it to us. 4God testified alongside them with signs, wonders, and various miracles and gifts that the Holy Spirit dispensed as he saw fit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hebrews 3</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58357/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/hebrews/chapter-03/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hebrews-chapter-3&#34;&gt;Hebrews Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So, holy &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; that take part in the heavenly calling, pay close attention to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of what we profess. 2He was faithful to the One that appointed him just like Moses was in his house. 3But Jesus has been considered worthy of more honor than Moses—as much more as a house builder has more honor than the house. 4Somebody builds every house; God has built everything. 5Moses was faithful as a servant in his house to testify about things that would be spoken later; 6ChristMessiah was faithful as a Son over his house. We are that house if we stay confident and take pride in our hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what they heard didn&amp;rsquo;t do them any good because they didn&amp;rsquo;t combine hearing with believing. 3We who believe do go into rest like he said, He finished his work when he founded the world. 4In one text it says of the seventh day,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hebrews-chapter-6&#34;&gt;Hebrews Chapter 6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So let&amp;rsquo;s get past the basics about Christ and press on to maturity. Let&amp;rsquo;s not lay again a foundation about repentance from dead works, and about faith toward God, 2teaching about baptizings, laying on hands, resurrection, eternal judgment. 3We&amp;rsquo;ll get past the basics, God willing. 4You can&amp;rsquo;t renew people to repentance that have once seen the light, tasted the heavenly gift, partaken of the Holy Spirit, 5tasted God&amp;rsquo;s good word and the powers of the age to come—6and then fall away. They crucify to themselves God&amp;rsquo;s Son all over again and hold him up to public disgrace. 7God blesses the ground that soaks up frequent rains and produces crops farmers can use. 8If it grows thorns and briars, it&amp;rsquo;s worthless and close to being accursed. It ends up getting burned off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, by translation, &amp;ldquo;Melchizedek&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;king of righteousness,&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;king of Salem,&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;king of peace.&amp;rdquo; 3Without record of father, mother, genealogy, birth, or death—like God&amp;rsquo;s Son—he remains a priest for all time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Inside the ark there was a gold pot with manna in it along with Aaron&amp;rsquo;s rod that budded and the tablets that contained the covenant. 5Above the ark the glorious cherubs hovered over the mercy seat. We can&amp;rsquo;t speak in detail about these now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The worshipers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel like sinners anymore because they would&amp;rsquo;ve been cleansed once and for all. 3But every year the sacrifices remind people that they&amp;rsquo;re still sinners. 4The blood of bulls and goats can&amp;rsquo;t take away sins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Through it he received testimony that he was good. (God testified in response to his gifts.) Through it he&amp;rsquo;s still speaking though he&amp;rsquo;s dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s press on in the race that&amp;rsquo;s in front of us, 2as we look ahead to Jesus the forerunner and finisher of our faith. For the joy in front of him, he endured the cross, overlooked the disgrace, and sat down on the right side of God&amp;rsquo;s throne. 3Keep in mind the One that endured such verbal hostility from sinners so you don&amp;rsquo;t get discouraged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Some have entertained angels without knowing it.)  3Remember prisoners as if you&amp;rsquo;re in prison with them, and those abused as if you&amp;rsquo;re in their bodies. 4With everybody, keep marriage honorable and the bed undefiled; God will judge fornicators and adulterers. 5Be free from the love of money and be content with what you have. He said it himself,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; So we can confidently say,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
