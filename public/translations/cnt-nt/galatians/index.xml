Amen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;galatians-chapter-2&#34;&gt;Galatians Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Fourteen years later, I went up to Jerusalem again, that time with Barnabas, and took Titus along. 2I went up, directed by revelation, to lay out for them the message I was presenting to Gentiles. I met privately with the recognized leaders so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running or had run for nothing. 3They didn&amp;rsquo;t consider it necessary to circumcise Titus, a Gentile. 4That trip came about because false believers had slipped in to spy out the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to enslave us to the Law. 5To maintain the truth about the good news, we didn&amp;rsquo;t back down for one minute. 6The recognized leaders in Jerusalem didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute anything to me. (Who they were didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. God doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay any attention to that.) 7Instead, they saw that God had entrusted me with presenting the good news to the uncircumcised like he&amp;rsquo;d entrusted Peter with presenting it to the circumcised. 8The One at work in Peter&amp;rsquo;s apostleship was at work in mine for the Gentiles. 9James, Cephas, and John—recognized pillars—shook hands with me and Barnabas to go to the Gentiles. They&amp;rsquo;d go to the Circumcision. 10The only thing was, they wanted us to remember the poor, and I was eager to do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Galatians 3</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/galatians/chapter-03/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;galatians-chapter-3&#34;&gt;Galatians Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Foolish Galatians! Who cast a spell on you? Right in front of your eyes I portrayed Jesus Christ crucified. 2This is what I&amp;rsquo;d like to know: did you receive the Spirit by working under law or by trusting the Person you listened to? 3Are you foolish enough to start with spirit and try to finish with flesh? 4Did you suffer so much for nothing—if it was for nothing? 5Does the one that provides you the Spirit and works miracles among you do it by working under law or trusting the Person he listened to? 6In that way, Abraham &amp;ldquo;trusted God, and God considered him good&amp;rdquo; [Gen 15:6].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Galatians 4</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/galatians/chapter-04/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;galatians-chapter-4&#34;&gt;Galatians Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Let me point out that as long as heirs are minors, they&amp;rsquo;re like servants at present though owners of everything in prospect. 2They&amp;rsquo;re under guardians and trustees till the time their father specifies. 3That&amp;rsquo;s like us. When we were minors, we were servants to the material-based notions the world operates by. 4But when the time came, God sent out his Son—born by woman under law—5to redeem us who were under law and to adopt us as children. 6Since we&amp;rsquo;re children, God gave us the sense of being that his Son has; we call out, &amp;ldquo;Dad.&amp;rdquo; 7So we&amp;rsquo;re not servants anymore, but children that became heirs by God&amp;rsquo;s promise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Galatians 5</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/galatians/chapter-05/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;galatians-chapter-5&#34;&gt;Galatians Chapter 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Christ really has set us free; so stand firm; don&amp;rsquo;t put yourselves back under a yoke of bondage.   &#x9;Gal 4:21-5:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you, if you accept circumcision, Christ doesn&amp;rsquo;t do you any good. 3You&amp;rsquo;re obligated to keep the Law completely. 4You that are trying to gain righteousness by law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You&amp;rsquo;ve fallen away from grace into law. 5In spirit we wait by trust for the goodness we hope for. 6In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is relevant. What matters is trust expressing itself in love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Galatians 6</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cir-library/translations/cnt-nt/galatians/chapter-06/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;galatians-chapter-6&#34;&gt;Galatians Chapter 6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If someone gets caught up in some sin, you that are spiritual should humbly restore that person. Keep an eye on yourselves so you don&amp;rsquo;t get caught up in temptation. 2Share each other&amp;rsquo;s burdens and fulfill Christ&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;law&amp;rsquo; that way. 3If we think we&amp;rsquo;re special when we&amp;rsquo;re not, we&amp;rsquo;re kidding ourselves. 4We each one must examine our own behavior and take pride in it only in respect to ourselves, not in comparison to somebody else. 5Each one of us has to carry our own load. 6The one that&amp;rsquo;s being taught the message needs to share everything good with the one that&amp;rsquo;s teaching it. 7Make no mistake, we can&amp;rsquo;t mock God. We reap what we sow. 8If we sow in the flesh, we&amp;rsquo;ll reap decay. If we sow in the spirit, we&amp;rsquo;ll reap eternal life. 9Let&amp;rsquo;s not get discouraged with doing what&amp;rsquo;s right. In due time we&amp;rsquo;ll reap if we don&amp;rsquo;t give up. 10So while we&amp;rsquo;ve got a chance, let&amp;rsquo;s work at doing good to everybody, especially to members of the family of faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
