Grace and [peace (be) to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; We┘always└thank [the] God for all of-you, making mention (of you) in the prayers of-us; constantly 3remembering the work of-[the] faith of-you and [the] labor of-love and [the] perseverance of-[the] hope of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ before the God and Father of-us, 4knowing, brothers beloved by [the]ms God, the election of-you; 5because the gospel of-us did┘not└come to you in word only, but also in power and in [the] Holy Spirit and [in]ms full assurance, even-as you-know what-kind-of-men we-proved-to-be amongms you on-account-of you.  6And you became imitators of-us and the Lord, having-received the word in much tribulation with (the) joy of-(the)-Holy Spirit, 7so-that you became (an) example to-all the believing-ones in [the] Macedonia and in [the] Achaia.  8For from you the word of-the Lord rang-out, not only in [the] Macedonia and [in the]ms Achaia, but in every place the faith of-you [the] toward [the] God has-gone-out, so-that we have no need to-say anything.  9For they┘ themselves └acknowledge about us what-kind-of reception we-had with you, and how you-turned to [the] God from [the] idols to-serve (the) living and true God, 10and to-await the Son of-him from [the] heaven[s], whom he-raised from [the]ms dead, Jesus, the-one rescuing us from the coming [the] wrath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As if (a) nursing-mother takes-good-care-of her [the] children, 8thus longing-for you, we-were-well-pleased to-share-with you, not only the gospel of-[the] God, but also the souls of-us, wherefore you-became beloved to-us.  9For you-remember, brothers, the labor of-us and the hardship, night and day working unto [the] not burdening any of-you, we-preached to you the gospel of-[the] God.  10You (are) witnesses and [the] God how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we-became to-you the believing-ones, 11even-as you-know, as each one of-you like (a) father (would) his children, 12urging you and encouraging and testifying unto [the] your living worthily of-[the] God the-One calling you into the kingdom of-him and glory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
