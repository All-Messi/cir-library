And if we-are-comforted (it is) on-behalf-of the comfort [the] of-you the-one working in endurance of-the same sufferings that we also suffer. 7And the hope of-us (is) firm on-behalf-of you, knowing that as you-are sharers of-the suffering (of us), so also (you are sharers) of-the comfort (of us).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the letter kills, but the spirit enlivens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
