These were-purchased from [the] men (as a) first-fruit to-[the] God and to-the Lamb, 5and in the mouth of-them (a) lie was┘not└found; they-are without-blemish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will-tell you the mystery of-the woman and the beast [the] bearing her [the] having the seven heads and the ten horns.  8The beast that you-saw was and is not and will rise-up out-of the deep and goes into destruction, and the-ones dwelling on all the earth, the name of-whom is┘not└written on the book of-[the] life from (the) foundation of-(the)-world, seeing the beast that it-was and is not and will-be-present.  9Here (is) the mind [the] having wisdom:  the seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is-sitting on them.  And seven kings are.  10[The] five fell, the one is, the other did┘not-yet└come, and when he-comes it-is-necessary for-him to-remain (a) little-while.  11And the beast that was and is not, is also itself (the) eighth and is of the seven and goes into destruction.  12And the ten horns that you-saw are ten kings, who did┘not-yet└receive (a) kingdom/rule but receive authority as kings for-one hour with the feast.  13These have one purpose, and [the] power and authority of-them they-give to-the beast.  14These make-war with the Lamb, and the Lamb conquers them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and the ones with-him (are) called and chosen and faithful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
