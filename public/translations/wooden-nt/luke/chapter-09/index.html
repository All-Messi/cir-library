<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-called–together the twelve, he-gave them power and authority over all the demons and to-heal diseases; 2and he-sent┘them└out to-preach the kingdom of-[the] God and to-heal [the] sicknesses, 3and he-said to-them, &ldquo;Take nothing for the road, neither rod nor knapsack, nor bread nor money nor have two tunics; 4and into whatever house you-enter, stay there and go-out from-there. 5And as-many-as2 do┘not└welcome you, going-out from [the] that city, shake the dust off the feet of-you for (a) testimony to them.&rdquo; 6And going-out, they-began-to-go-through according-to the villages3/every village3, evangelizing and healing everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And Herod the tetrarch heard-about all the-things happening, and he-was-perplexed on-account-of the saying by some that John was-resurrected from the dead, 8and by some that Elijah appeared, and (by) others that (a) certain prophet of-the old arose. 9And Herod said, &ldquo;I beheaded John. And who is this concerning whom I-hear such-things?&rdquo; And he-was-trying to-see him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the apostles, having-returned, related to-him as-many-things-as they-did. And taking┘them└along, he-withdrew privately2 into (a) city called Bethsaida. 11But the crowds, having-found-out, followed him; and, having-welcomed them, he-began-to-speak to-them about the kingdom of-[the] God, and he-was-healing the-ones having need of healing.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the day began to-draw-to-a-close. And the twelve, having-come, said to-him, &ldquo;Dismiss the crowd, in-order-that, having-gone into the surrounding villages and countryside, they-might-find-lodging and might-find something-to-eat, because we-are here in (an) unpopulated place.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-said to them, &ldquo;You give to-them (something) to-eat.&rdquo; And the/they said, &ldquo;Not more than five loaves and two fish are to-us, unless2, having-gone, we-buy food[s] for all this [the] people.&rdquo; 14For about five thousand men were.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And they-did so, and they-sat-(them) ┘all└down. 16And having-taken the five loaves and the two fish, having-looked-up into the sky, he-blessed them and broke┘them└up and started-giving (them) to-the disciples to-pass-around to-the crowd. 17And they-ate and all were-satisfied, and the leftover to-them of-(the)-pieces was-picked-up, twelve baskets.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And it-happened in [the] him to-be praying alone2 (that) the disciples were-with him, and he-asked them, saying, &ldquo;Whom do┘the crowds└say me to-be?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And they/they, having-answered, said, &ldquo;John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that (a)-certain prophet of-the old-ones arose.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-said to-them, &ldquo;But whom do┘you└say me to-be?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-strictly-charged them, commanded (them) to-say this to nobody/anybody, 22having-said [that], &ldquo;It-is-necessary for-the Son of-[the] Man to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by the elders and chief-priests and scribes and to-be-put-to-death and on-the third day to-be-resurrected.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-was-saying to all, &ldquo;If anybody wants to-come after me, let-him-deny himself and pick-up the cross of-him according-to (the) day/daily2 and let-him-follow me. 24For whoever2 wants to-save the life of-him will-lose it; but whoever2 loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me—this-one will-save it. 25For what is┘(a) men└profited having-gained the whole world and having-lost or forfeited himself? 26For whoever2 is-ashamed-of me and [the] my words—this-one the Son of-[the] Man will-be-ashamed-of when he-comes in the glory of-him and the Father and the holy angels. 27And I-say to-you truly, some of-the-ones standing here are who will┘certainly not└taste of-death until2 they-see the kingdom of-[the] God.&quot;</span></p>
