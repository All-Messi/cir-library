<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And they-began to-accuse him, saying, &ldquo;We-found this-One misleading the nation of-us, and preventing to-pay tribute to-Caesar, and saying himself to-be Messiah, (a) king.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And [the] Pilate asked him, saying, &ldquo;You are the king of-the Jews?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Pilate said to the chief-priests and the crowds, &ldquo;I-find no matter in [the] this man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And the/they kept-insisting, saying [that], &ldquo;He-stirs-up the people, teaching according-to the whole of-Israel/all over Judaea, and having-begun from [the] Galilee unto here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And Pilate, having-heard, asked whether the man is/was (a) Galilean; 7and having-come-to-know that he-is/was from the jurisdiction of-Herod, sent him to Herod, being also himself in Jerusalem in these [the] days. 8And [the] Herod having-seen [the] Jesus was┘really└glad, for he-was wanting out-of (a) long time[s] to-see him on-account-of hearing about him, and was-hoping to-see some sign occurring by him. 9And he-kept-questioning him with lots-of words, but he answered him nothing. 10And the chief-priests and the scribes had-stood, accusing him aggressively. 11And [also]ms [the] Herod with the soldiers of-him, having-treated┘him└with-contempt and having-mocked (him), having-dressed (him) with-bright-clothes, sent┘him└back to-[the] Pilate. 12And both [the] Herod and [the] Pilate became friends with one-another on the very day. For previously-they-were at enmity with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And Pilate, having-gathered the chief-priests and the rulers and the people, 14said to them, &ldquo;You-brought [the] this man to-me as one-stirring-up the people, and behold, I, before you having-examined (him), found no matter in [the] this man of-which-things you-accuse against him. 15But neither [did] Herod, for he-sent┘him└back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of-death has-been done by-him. 16So, having-flogged him, I-will-release (him).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And they-started-shouting together, saying, &ldquo;Take this-one; and release [the] Barabbas to-us,&rdquo; 19who, on-account-of some insurrection having-happened in the city, and murder, was-cast in [the] prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And again [the] Pilate addressed them, desiring to-release [the] Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/they kept-calling-out, saying, &ldquo;Crucify (him)! Crucify him!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the/he said to them (a)-third-(time), &ldquo;For what evil-thing did┘this-one└do? I-found no matter of-death in him. So, having-flogged him, I-will-release (him).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And the/they were-adamant, with-loud voices, asking him to-be-crucified. And the voices of-them began-to-prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And Pilate determined the demand of-them to-happen. 25And he-released the-one cast in prison on-account-of insurrection and murder, whom they-were-asking-for; but delivered [the] Jesus to-the will of-them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And as they-led┘him└away, having-conscripted (a)-certain Simon, (a) Cyrenian coming from (the) country, they-laid-on him the cross-to carry in-front-of [the] Jesus. 27And (a) big crowd of-the people and of-women were-following him, who were-mourning and weeping-for him. 28And having-turned to them, [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;Daughters of-Jerusalem, do┘not└cry over me. Instead, cry over yourselves and over the children of-you, 29because, behold, days are-coming in which they-will-say, &lsquo;Blessed (are) the sterile, and the wombs that did┘not└bear, and breasts that did┘not└nurse.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then they-will-begin to-say Because if they-do these-things in the green wood, what will-happen in the dry?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And two others were┘also└being-led with him to-be-put-to-death. 33And when they-came to the place [the] called &lsquo;(The) Skull,&rsquo; there they-crucified him and the evil-doers, one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s]. 34[[And [the] Jesus was-saying/kept-saying, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they-do┘not└know what they-are-doing.&rdquo;]] And dividing-up the clothes of-him, they cast lots.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And the people stood-by, watching. But the rulers were┘also└mocking, saying, &ldquo;He-saved others; let-him-save himself if this-one is the Messiah, the chosen-One of-[the] God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming-up and offering sour-wine to-him, 37and saying, &ldquo;If you are the king of-the Jews, save yourself.&quot;</span></p>
