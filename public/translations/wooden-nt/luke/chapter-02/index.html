<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in [the] those days, (that) (a) decree went-out from Caesar Augustus to-take-a-census-of all the world. 2This (was) the first census, Quirinius governing [the] Syria. 3And all were-traveling to-be-registered-in-the-census, each to [the] city of-himself. 4And Joseph also went-up from [the] Galilee from (the) town of-Nazareth into [the] Judaea into (the) city of-David, which is-called Bethlehem, on-account-of [the] his being from (the) house and lineage of-David, 5to-be-registered with Mary the-one betrothed to-him, being-pregnant. 6And it-happened in [the] their being there, (that) the days of-[the] her giving-birth were-fulfilled, 7and she-bore the firstborn [the] son of-her; and she-wrapped┘him└in-baby-clothes and laid him in (a) manger, because (a) place was not for-them in the inn.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And in the same [the] region shepherds were living-outdoors and keeping watch[es] over their flock during-the night. 9And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord stood-by them, and (the) glory of-(the)-Lord shined-around them, and they-feared (a) great fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the angel said to-them, &ldquo;Do┘not└be-afraid, for behold, I-am-bringing you great joy that will-be to-all the people, 11because today (a) Savior was-born to-you that is the Lord Messiah in (the) city of-David. 12And this is the sign for-you: you-will-find (a) baby wrapped–in-baby-clothes and lying in (a) manger.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And suddenly (a) multitude of-(the) heavenly host came with the angel, praising [the] God and saying,</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And when eight days were-fulfilled for-[the] circumcising him, and/that the name of-him was-called Jesus, the (name) called by the angel before [the] his being-conceived in the womb.</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And behold, (a) man was in Jerusalem, (the) name to-whom (was) Simeon, and [the] this man (was) righteous and devout, waiting-for (the) liberation of-[the] Israel, and (the) Holy Spirit was on him. 26And it-was revealed to-him by the Holy [the] Spirit not to-see death until3 he-would-see the Messiah of-(the)-Lord. 27And he-went in the spirit into the temple, and in [the] the parents&rsquo; entering [the] their doing-for the child Jesus according-to the accustomed-thing of-the Law about him, 28and he received him into the/his arms and blessed [the] God and said,</span></p>
