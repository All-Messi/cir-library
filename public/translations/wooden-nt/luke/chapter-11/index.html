<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in [the] his being in-(a)-certain place praying, when he-stopped, (a)-certain-one of-the disciples of-him said to him, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to-pray, even-as also John taught the disciples of-him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And he-said to-them,	 &ldquo;When you-pray, say,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Give us [the] according-to (the) day/daily</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-said to them, &ldquo;Who of you will-have (a) friend and will-go to-him in-the-middle-of-the-night, and say to-him, &lsquo;Friend, lend me three loaves, 6because (a) friend of-me came off the road to me, and I-do┘not└have what-thing I-will-set-before him.&rsquo; 7And-that-one from-inside, having-answered, may-say, &lsquo;Do┘not└be-a-bother to-me. Already the door is-shut and the kids of-me are in [the] bed with me. I-am┘not└able, having-gotten-up, to-give to-you.&rsquo; 8I-say to-you, although2 he-will┘not└give to-him, having-gotten-up, on-account-of [the] being (a) friend of-him, on-account-of shamelessness/persistence of-him, having-gotten-up, he-will-give him as-many-things-as he-needs. 9And-I say to-you, ask and it-will-be-given to-you, seek and you-will-find, knock and it-will-be-opened to-you. 10For everybody the-one asking receives, and the-one seeking finds, and the-the-one knocking it-will-be-opened. 11And the son will-ask┘└for (a) fish, and instead-of (a)-fish he-will-give him (a) snake? 12Or, also he-will-ask-for (an) egg, he-will-give him (a) scorpion? 13If then you, being evil, know to-give good gifts to-the children of-you, more by-much the Father [the] from heaven will-give (the) Holy Spirit to-the-ones asking him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And he-was casting-out (a) demon [and it-was]ms mute. And it-happened, the demon having-come-out, the mute spoke and the crowds were-amazed. 15And some of-them said, &ldquo;By Beelzebub the ruler of-[the] demons, he-casts-out [the] demons.&rdquo; 16And others, testing (him), were-seeking (a) sign from heaven/from (the) sky from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And he, knowing the reasonings of-them, said to-them, &ldquo;Every kingdom, having-been-divided against itself, is-made-desolate, and (a) house (divided) against itself falls. 18And if also [the] Satan was-divided against himself, how will┘the kingdom of-him└stand?—because you-are-saying me to-cast-out [the] demons by Beelzebub. 19And if by Beelzebub I-cast-out [the] demons, by what do┘the sons of-you└cast┘(them)└out? On-account-of this they will-be judges of-you. 20But if by (the) finger of-God [I]ms cast-out [the] demons, then the kingdom of-[the] God reached you. 21When the/a strong-man, fully-armed, guards the courtyard of-himself, the possessions of-him are in peace. 22But whenever one-stronger than he, having-attacked (him), overcomes him, he-picks-up the armor on which he-has-trusted and distributes the plunder of-him. 23The-one not being with me is against me, and the-one not gathering with me scatters-out. 24&quot;When the/an unclean spirit goes-out from the/a man, it roams through waterless places seeking rest and not finding, [then]ms it-says, &ldquo;I-will-return to the house of-me whence I-came-[out].&rdquo; 25And having-come, he-finds (it) swept and decorated/set-in-order. 26Then he-goes and takes-along seven other demons more-evil than-himself and, having entered, takes-up-permanent-dwelling there. And the last-things of-[the] that man become worse than-the first.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And it-happened in [the] his saying these-things (a)-certain woman, having-lifted-up (her) voice out-of the crowd, said to-him, &ldquo;Blessed (is) the womb [the] having-born you and the breasts that you nursed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And he said, &ldquo;Much-more, blessed (are) the ones listening-to the word of-[the] God and keeping (it).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And the crowds increasing, he-began to-say, &ldquo;[The] this generation is evil. It-seeks (a) sign, and (a) sign will┘not└be-given to-it except2 the sign of-Jonah. 30For even-as Jonah became (a) sign to-the Ninevites, so also the Son of-[the] Man will-be to-[the] this generation. 31[The] queen of-(the)-south will-rise-up in the judgment with the men of-[the] this generation and will-condemn them, because she-came out-of the ends of-the earth to-hear the wisdom of-Solomon, and behold, one-greater than Solomon (is) here. 32[The] men of-Nineveh will-stand-up in the judgment with [the] this generation and they-will-condemn it, because they-repented at the preaching of-Jonah, and behold, one-greater than Jonah is here. 33&quot;Nobody, having-lit (a) lamp, puts (it) in (a) cellar [nor under (a) bucket]ms, but on the/a lampstand, in-order-that the-ones coming-in may-see the light. 34The lamp of-the body is the eye of-you. When the eye of-you is clear, the whole body is also full-of-light. But when it-is evil, the body of-you is also full-of-darkness. 35So watch-out lest the light [the] in you is darkness. 36If then the whole body of-you (is) full-of-light, not having any part full-of-darkness, (the) whole (body) will-be full-of-light as when the/a lamp enlightens you with-the/its brightness.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And the Lord said to-him, &ldquo;Now you [the] Pharisees cleanse the outside of-the cup and the dish, but the inside of-you is-full of robbing and wickedness. 40Foolish-ones, did┘not└the-One having-made the outside also make the inside? 41Except, give the-things being-inside (as) mercy/charity, and behold, all-things are clean to-you. 42But woe to-you [the] Pharisees, because you-tithe [the] mint and [the] rue and every vegetable and by-pass [the] justice and the love of-[the] God. but it-is-necessary to-do these-things and┘not to-neglect└those. 43Woe to-you [the] Pharisees, because you-love the main-seat in the synagogue and the greetings in the market-places. 44Woe to-you, because you are like [the] unmarked [the] graves and [the] men [the]ms walking on (them) do┘not└know (it).&quot;</span></p>

Yes, I-say to-you, it-will-be-required from [the] this generation. 52Woe to-you [the] lawyers, because you-take-away the key of-[the] knowledge; you┘yourselves└do┘not└enter, and you-hindered the-ones trying-to-enter.&rdquo; 53And-from-there he, having-gone-out, the scribes and the Pharisees began to-be┘terribly└hostile and to-interrogate him about very-many things, 54plotting against him to-latch-onto something from the mouth of-him.</span></p>
