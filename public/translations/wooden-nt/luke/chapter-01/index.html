<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Inasmuch-as many took-in-hand to-draw-up (an) account about the-things fulfilled among us, 2even-as the-ones being eyewitnesses from (the) beginning and minsters of-the word, 3it-seemed-good to-me-also, having-traced all-things from the-beginning, to-write to-you in-orderly-fashion, most-excellent Theophilus, 4in-order-that you-may-know the accuracy about what words you-were-orally instructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It-happened in the days of-Herod, king of-[the] Judaea, (that there was) (a) certain priest, Zachariah by-name, from (the) course of-Abijah, and (the) wife to-him (was) from the daughters of-Aaron, and the name of-her (was) Elizabeth. 6And they-were both just before [the] God, going in all the commandments and just-requirements of-the Lord, blameless. 7And (a) child was not to-them, because [the] Elizabeth was sterile, and both were advanced in the years of-them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And it-happened in [the] his carrying-out-the priesthood-duties in the order of-the course of-him before [the] God—9according-to the custom of-the priestly-office, he-was-chosen-by-lot [the] to-offer-incense, having-entered into the sanctuary of-the Lord—10and/that all the multitude of-the people was praying outside at-the hour of-[the] incense-offering. 11And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appeared to-him, standing of (the) right[s] of-the altar of-[the] incense. 12And Zachariah was-troubled, having seen (him); and fear fell on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the angel said to him, &ldquo;Do┘not└fear, Zachariah, because the prayer of-you was-heard, and the wife of-you, Elizabeth, will-bear (a)son to-you, and you-will-call the name of-him John. 14And he-will-be (a) joy to-you and gladness, and many will-rejoice at the birth of-him. 15For he-will-be-great before [the]ms Lord, and he-will┘certainly not└drink wine and strong-beer; and he-will-be-full of-(the)-Holy Spirit even from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, 16and he-will-turn many of-the sons of-Israel to (the) Lord the God of-them. 17And he will-go before him in (the) spirit and power of-Elijah, to-turn (the) hearts of-fathers to-(their)-children and (the) disobedient-ones to (the) attitude of-(the)-righteous, to-ready (a) people prepared for-(the)-Lord.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And Zachariah said to the angel, &ldquo;According-to what will-I-know this? For I am (an) old-man, and the wife of-me (is) advanced in the days of-her.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the angel, having-answered, said to-him, &ldquo;I am Gabriel, the-one standing before the God and I-was-sent to-speak to you and to-tell-you these-things. 20And behold, you-will-be silent and not able to-speak until which day these-things happen, instead-of-which things you-did┘not└believe the words of-me, which will-be-fulfilled in the time of-them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the people were waiting-for [the] Zachariah, and they-were-being-amazed in [the] his spending-time in the sanctuary. 22And having-come-out, he-was┘not└able to-speak to-them; and they-surmised that he-has/had-seen (a) vision in the sanctuary, and he was signaling to-them and remained mute. 23And it-happened when the days of-the service of-him were-fulfilled, (that) he-went-away to the house of-him. 24And after these [the] days Elizabeth the wife of-him became-pregnant, and she-hid herself for-five months, saying 25[that], &ldquo;Thus (the) Lord has-done to-me in-which he-looked-on (me) to-take-away (the) disgrace of-me among men.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And in the sixth [the] month, the angel Gabriel was-sent from [the] God to (a) town of-[the] Galilee to-which (was) (the) name Nazareth, 27to (a) virgin engaged to-(a)-man (the) name to-whom (was) Joseph, of (the) house of-David; and the name of-the virgin (was) Mary. 28And having-come-inside to her, he-said, &ldquo;Mary, hail, favored-one; the Lord (is) with you.&quot;</span></p>
