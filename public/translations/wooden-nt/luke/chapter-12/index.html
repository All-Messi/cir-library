<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In which-things/Meantime2 the myriads of-the crowd having-been-pressed-together so-as to-be-stepping-on one-another, he-began to-say to the disciples of-him first, &ldquo;Take-heed to-yourselves from the leaven of-the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2And nothing is covered that will┘not└be-revealed and hidden that will┘not└be-made-known. 3In-contrast-to which-things, as-many-things-as you-said in the darkness will-be-heard in the light, and what-thing you-said to-the ear/whispered in the store-rooms will-be-preached on the housetops. 4&quot;And I-say to-you [the] friends, do┘not└be-afraid of-the-ones killing the body, and after these-things not having anything more to-do. 5But I-will-show you whom you-will-fear. Fear the One, after [the] killing, having-authority to-cast into [the] Gehenna. Yes I-say to-you, fear this-One. 6Are┘not five sparrows└sold for-two assarions? And one of them is┘not└forgotten before [the] God. 7But even the hairs of-the head of-you are numbered. Do┘not└fear; you-are-worth-more than-many sparrows. 8&quot;And I-say to-you, everybody whoever2 confesses in me before [the] men, the Son of-[the] Man will┘also└confess in him before the angels of-[the] God. 9But the-one denying me before [the] men will-be-denied before the angels of-[the] God. 10And everybody who will-speak (a) word against the Son of-[the] Man, it-will-be-forgiven to-him. But to-the-one blaspheming the Holy Spirit, it-will┘not└be-forgiven. 11And when they-bring you before [the] synagogues and [the] rulers and [the] authorities, do┘not└worry how or what you-will-defend-yourselves or what you-will-say. 12For the Holy Spirit will-teach you in the very hour what-things it-is-necessary to-say.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And somebody out-of the crowd said to-him, &ldquo;Teacher, tell the brother of-me to-share the inheritance with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-him, &ldquo;Man, who appointed me (a) judge or arbitrator over youpl?&rdquo; 15And he-said to them, &ldquo;See and keep yourselves from all greed, because in [the] being-abundant to-anybody the life of-him is not of the-things being to-him.&rdquo; 16And he-told (a) parable to them, saying, &ldquo;The land of-(a)-certain rich man produced-well. 17And he-began-to-reason in himself, saying, &lsquo;What shall-I-do, because I-do┘not└have where I-can-store the crops of-me?&rsquo; 18And he-said, &lsquo;This I-will-do; I-will-take-down the barns of-me, and I-will-build bigger-ones; and I-will-store there all the grain and the good-things of-me. 19And I-will-say to the soul of-me, &ldquo;Soul, you-have many good things laid-up for many years. Take-it-easy; eat, drink, celebrate.&rdquo;&rsquo; 20And [the] God said to-him, &lsquo;Fool, this [the] night will-they-ask-from you the soul of-you, and to-whom will-be what-things you-prepared?&rsquo; 21Thus (is) the-one treasuring-up for-himself and not being-rich toward God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And he-said to the disciples [of-him]ms, &ldquo;On-account-of this I-say to-you, do┘not└worry about the/your life what you-will-eat, nor for-the/your body what you-will-wear. 23For [the] life is more than [the] nourishment, and the body (is more) than clothes. 24Think-carefully-about [the] blackbirds that they-do┘not└sow or harvest, to-which is not (a) storeroom nor (a) barn; and [the] God feeds them. You are-worth more by-much than [the] birds. 25And who of you, worrying, is-able to-add (a) cubit to the stature of-him? 26If then you-are┘not└able (to do) (a) very-small-thing, why worry about the rest? 27Think-carefully-about [the] lilies how they grow: they-do┘not└work-hard or spin, but I-say to-you, not-even Solomon in all the glory of-him used-to-be-dressed like one of-these. 28And if [the] God dresses the plants in [the] field, being today and tomorrow cast into (a) furnace, more by-much (will he dress) you, little-faith-ones. 29And do┘not you└seek what you-will-eat and what you-will-drink and what you-will-wear. 30For all these-things the nations of-the world strain-after, and the Father of-you knows that you-have-need of-these-things. 31Instead, seek the kingdom of-him, and these-things will-be-added to-you. 32Do┘not└fear, [the] little flock, because the Father of-you is-pleased to-give you the kingdom. 33Sell the possessions of-you and give alms. Make for-yourselves purses not wearing-out, (a) never-ending treasure in [the] heaven[s], where (a) thief does┘not└come-near nor (a) moth destroys. 34For where the treasure of-you is, there the heart of-you will-be also. 35&quot;Let┘the loins of-you└be dressed and the lamps (of you) burning, 36and you (will-be) like men expecting the lord of-them when he-returns from the/a wedding-feast, in-order-that, having-come, having-knocked, immediately they-will-open to-him. 37Blessed (are) [the] those servants, whom, coming, the lord will-find watching. Truly I-say to-you that he-will-gird-himself and recline┘them└(at-table), and, having-come, will-wait-on them. 38And-if in the second (watch) and if in the third watch he-comes and finds (them) thus, blessed are those. 39And know this: that if the master-of-the-house had-known at-what hour the/a thief would-come, he-would┘not└have-allowed2 the house of-him to-be-broken-into. 40And you be ready, because you-do┘not└know at-what hour the Son of-the Man comes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And [the] Peter said, &ldquo;Lord, are-you-telling [the] this parable to us or also to all?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And the Lord said, &ldquo;Who then is the/a faithful, [the] wise steward, whom the lord will-put-in-charge over the household-servants [the] to-give (them) [the]ms rations at (the) right-time? 43[The] that servant (is) blessed, whom having-come, the lord of-him will-find doing thus. 44Truly I-say to-you that over all the possessions of-him he-will-put┘him└in-charge. 45But if [the] that servant says in the heart of-him, &lsquo;The lord of-me is-delaying (his) coming&rsquo;; and he-will-begin to-bully the men-servants and women-servants, and (will-begin) to-eat and drink and get-drunk, 46the lord of-[the] that servant will-come in (a) day in-which he-does┘not└expect and at (an) hour in-which he-does┘not└know, and he-will-severely-flog him and will-put the part of-him with the unfaithful. 47But that [the] servant the-one having-known the will of-the lord of-him and not having-been-ready or (not) having-done according-to the will of-him will-be-beaten many (lashes). 48But the-one not knowing, having-done things-worthy of-lashes, will-be-beaten few (lashes). But to-everybody to-whom much was-given—much will-be-required from him; and to-whom they-entrusted much, they-will-ask him more. 49&quot;I-came to-cast fire on the earth, and what I-wish if already it was-kindled. 50And I-have (a) baptism to-be-baptized-with, and how I-am-under-stress until when it-is-finished. 51Do-you-think I-have-come to-bring peace on the earth. No, I tell you, but rather division. 52For from the now five will-be in one house divided three against two and two against three. 53They-will-be-divided father against son, 54And he-started-to-say also to-the crowds, &ldquo;When you-see [the/a]ms cloud coming-up in (the) west, immediately you-say [that], &lsquo;(A) storm is-coming, and it-happens thus. 55And when (you see) (a) south wind blowing, you-say [that], &lsquo;It-will-be-hot,&rsquo; and it-happens. 56Hypocrites, you-know to examine the face of-the earth and the sky, but how do-you┘not└know to-examine [the] this time&rdquo; 57&quot;And why even from yourselves you-do┘not└judge/determine the right-thing? 58For as you-are-going with the opponent of-you to (a) ruler, on the way give effort to-be-released from him, lest he-drag you to the judge and the judge will-deliver you to-the constable, and the constable will-cast you into prison. 59I-say to-you, you-will┘not└come-out until you pay even the last lepton.&quot;</span></p>
