<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in the crowd[s] pressing-on him and hearing the word of-[the] God and/that he-was standing beside [the] Lake Gennesaret, 2and he-saw two boats moored at-the-edge the lake. And the fishermen, having-gotten-out from them, were-mending [the] nets. 3And having-gotten into one of-the boats, which was of-Simon, he-asked him to-put out from the shore (a)-little; and having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach the crowds out-of the boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And when he-stopped speaking, he-said to [the] Peter, &ldquo;Put-out into the deep-(water), and let-down the nets of-youpl for (a) catch.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-answered, Peter said, &ldquo;Master, through all night, having-worked, we-took nothing. But at the word of-you, I-will-let-down the nets.&rdquo; 6And having-done this, they-caught (a) great multitude of-fish, and the nets of-them were-starting-to-tear. 7And they-signaled to-the/their partners in the other boat [the], having-come, to-help them; and they-came and filled both [the] boats so that they were-riding-low-in-the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-seen, Simon Peter fell to-the knees of-Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Go-away from me, because I-am (a) sinful man, Lord.&rdquo; 9For amazement gripped him, and all the-ones with him at the catch of-[the] fish that they-caught; 10and likewise also James and John, sons of-Zebedee, who were partners to-[the] Simon. And [the] Jesus said to [the] Simon, &ldquo;Do┘not└be-afraidsg. From the now yousg-will-be catching men.&rdquo; 11And having-brought the boats to [the] land, having-left all-things, they-followed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And it-happened in [the] his being in one of-the towns, and/that, behold, (a) man full of-leprosy (was there). And having-seen [the] Jesus, having-fallen on (his) face, he-begged him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, if you-are willing, you-are-able to-cleanse me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-reached-out the/his hand, he-touched him, saying, &ldquo;I-am-willing; be-cleansed,&rdquo; and immediately the leprosy went-away from him. 14And he charged him to-tell nobody; but, &ldquo;Having-gone-away, show yourself to-the priest, and offer for the cleansing of-you even-as Moses commanded for (a) testimony to-them.&rdquo; 15But instead, the word about him kept-spreading, and many crowds were-coming-together to-hear and to-be-healed from the sicknesses of-them. 16But he was going-away in the uninhabited-places and praying.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And it-happened on one of-the days and/that he was teaching, and sitting were Pharisees and teachers-of-the-Law, who were come out-of every village of-[the] Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and (the) power of-(the)-Lord as unto [the] his healing.  18And behold, men, carrying (a) man on (a) stretcher who was paralyzed, and they-were-trying to-bring┘him└in and to-put [him]ms before him. 19And not finding what (ways) they-might-bring┘him└in on-account-of the crowd, having-gone-up on the roof, they-let┘him└down through the tiles with the stretcher into the midst in-front-of [the] Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-seen the faith of-them, he-said, &ldquo;Man, the sins of-you are-forgiven to-you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to-argue, saying, &ldquo;Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who is able to-forgive sins except2 [the] God only?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-known the reasonings of-them, having-answered, said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning in the hearts of-you? 23Which is easier, to-say, &lsquo;The sins of-you are-forgiven to-you&rsquo;; or to-say, &lsquo;Get-up and walk&rsquo;? 24But in-order-that you-may-know that the Son of-Man has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins&rdquo;—he-said to-the paralyzed-(man), &ldquo;I-say to-you, get-up, and having-picked-up the stretcher of-you, go to the house of-you.&rdquo; 25And immediately, having-stood-up in-front-of them, having-picked-up on what he-was-lying, he-went-away into the house of-him, glorifying [the] God. 26And astonishment gripped all, and they-were-glorifying [the] God; and they-were-filled with-fear, saying [that], &ldquo;We-saw incredible-things today.&quot;</span></p>
