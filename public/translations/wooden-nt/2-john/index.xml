      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-john-chapter-1&#34;&gt;2 John Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The Elder to-the-elect lady and the children of-her, whompl I love in truth, and not only I, but all the-ones having-known the truth, 2on-account-of the truth [the] residing in us and will-be with us forever3.  3Grace, mercy, peace will-be with us from God (the) Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of-the Father in truth and love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; I-was┘very└joyous, because I-have-found (some) of the children of-you walking in truth, even-as we-received commandment from the Father.  5And now I-ask you, lady, not as writing (a) new commandment, but what we-were-having from (the) beginning:  that we-love one-another.  6And this is [the] love:  [in-order]-that we-walk according-to the commandments of-him.  This is the commandment, even-as you-heard from (the) beginning:  [in-order]-that you-walk in it.  7Because many deceivers went-out into the world, the-ones not confessing Jesus Christ coming in (the) flesh.  This is the deceiver and the antichrist.  8Watch yourselves, in-order-that you not lose what-things you-gained, but receive (a) full reward.  9Everybody [the] going-forward and not remaining in the teaching of-[the] Christ does┘not└have God.  The-one remaining in the teaching—this-one has both the Father and the Son.  10If anybody comes to you and does┘not└bring this [the] teaching, do┘not└receive him into (the) house, and do┘not└say greetings to-him.  11For the-one saying greetings to-him shares in-the evil [the] deeds of-him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
