        <h2 id="john-chapter-19">John Chapter 19</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So then [the] Pilate took [the] Jesus and scourged (him). 2And the soldiers, having-woven (a) crown out-of thorns, put┘(it)└on the head of-him, and put┘(a) purple robe└on him. 3And they-began-coming-up to him and saying, &ldquo;Hail, [the] king of-the Jews.&rdquo; And they-were-giving him slaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Pilate went out and says to-them, &ldquo;Look; I-am-leading him out to-you in-order-that you-may-know that I-find no fault in him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So [the] Jesus came out wearing the thorn crown and the purple robe, and he-says to-them, &ldquo;Behold, the man!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they-began-to-shout, saying, &ldquo;Crucify (him)! Crucify (him)!&rdquo; [The] Pilate says to-them, &ldquo;You take him and crucify (him), for I do┘not└find (a) fault in him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have (a) law, and according-to the law he-ought to-die, because he-made himself (the) Son of-God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then when [the] Pilate heard this [the] word, he-became┘more└fearful. 9And he-went into the Praetorium again and says to-[the] Jesus, &ldquo;Where┘are you└from?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then [the] Pilate says to-him, &ldquo;You-are┘not└talking to-me? Do-you┘not└know that I-have authority to-release you, and I-have authority to crucify you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus answered [him]ms, &ldquo;You-would┘not└have any authority over me except2 it-was given to-you from above. On-account-of this the-one betraying me to-you has greater sin.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From this [the] Pilate was-seeking to-release him. But the Jews began-to-shout, saying, &ldquo;If you-release this-(man), you-are not (a) friend of-[the] Caesar. Everybody [the] making himself king speaks-against [the] Caesar.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So [the] Pilate, having-heard these [the] words, led [the] Jesus outside and sat on (the) judgment-seat in (a) place called Pavement, but in-Hebrew Gabbatha. 14And it-was Preparation of-the Passover; it-was about (the) sixth hour. And he-says to-the Jews, &ldquo;Behold, the king of-you!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then they shouted, &ldquo;Take┘(him)└away! Take┘(him)└away! Crucify him!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So then he-delivered him to-them in-order-that he-might-be-crucified.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So they-took Jesus, and, carrying the cross for-himself, he-went out into the (place) called Place of the Skull, which is-called in-Hebrew &lsquo;Golgotha,&rsquo; 18where they-crucified him, and with him too others on each side and [the] Jesus between. 19And [the] Pilate also wrote (a) title and put (it) on the cross. And it-was written, &ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene, the king of-the Jews.&rdquo; 20So many of-the Jews read this [the] title because the place was near the city where [the] Jesus was-crucified. And it-was written in-Hebrew, in-Latin, (and) in-Greek.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So the chief priests of-the Jews began-to-say to-[the] Pilate, &ldquo;Do┘not└write, &lsquo;The king of-the Jews,&rsquo; but that that-one said, &lsquo;I-am king of-the Jews.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the soldiers, when they-crucified [the] Jesus, they-took the clothes of-him and made four parts, (a) part to-each soldier, plus the cloak. And the coat was seamless, woven from the above through (the) whole. 24So they-said to one-another, &ldquo;Let-us┘not└tear it, but let-us-cast-lots for it whose it-will-be&rdquo;; in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, [the] saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the mother of-him and the sister of-the mother of-him, Mary the (wife) of-[the] Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene had-been-standing by the cross of-Jesus. 26Then Jesus, seeing the mother and the disciple standing-by that he loved, says to-the/his mother, &ldquo;Behold, the son of-you.&rdquo; 27Then he-says to-the disciple, &ldquo;Behold, the mother of-you.&rdquo; And from that [the] hour the disciple took her into [the] his-own-things.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> After this, [the] Jesus, having-seen that all-things already had-been-finished in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, says, &ldquo;I-thirst.&rdquo; 29(A) vessel was-sitting full-of sour-wine. Then having-wrapped┘(a) sponge full-of the sour-wine└around (a) hyssop, they-brought (it) to-the mouth (of him). 30Then when he-took the sour-wine, [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;It-is-finished&rdquo;; and having-bowed-down the/his head, he-gave-up the spirit/breath.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then the Jews, because it-was Preparation, in-order-that the bodies might┘not└remain on the cross on the Sabbath—for the day of-that [the] Sabbath was great—asked [the] Pilate [in-order]-that the legs of-them might-be-broken and they-would-be-taken-(down). 32Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of-the first and of-the other [the] having-been-crucified-with him. 33But, having-come to [the] Jesus, when they-saw him already having-died, they-did┘not└break the legs of-him. 34But one of-the soldiers with-(the)-spear of-him pierced the/his side, and immediately blood and water came-out. 35And the-one having-seen has-testified, and the testimony of-him is true, and that-one knows that he-says true-things in-order-that you may-believe. 36For these-things came-to-be in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled,</span></p>
