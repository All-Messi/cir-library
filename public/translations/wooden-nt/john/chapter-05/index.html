        <h2 id="john-chapter-5">John Chapter 5</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things was (a) feast of-the Jews, and Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. 2And there-is in [the] Jerusalem at the sheep (gate a) pool [the] called in-Hebrew &lsquo;Bethesda,&rsquo; having five porches. 3In these (a) crowd of-[the] sick-ones was-lying—blind, lame, paralyzed. [4] 5(A)-certain man was there for-thirty and eight years, having in the weakness of-him. 6[The] Jesus, seeing this-one lying and knowing that he was-having already for-(a)-long time, says to-him, &ldquo;Do-you-want to-become well?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The infirm-one answered him, &ldquo;Sir, I-do┘not└have (a) person in-order-that, when the water is stirred, he-can-put me in the pool. And in which (time) I am-coming, another (person) comes down ahead-of me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And immediately the man became healthy and picked-up the bedroll of-him and began-to-walk. And it-was (the) Sabbath on that [the] day. 10Then the Jews said to-the healed-one, &ldquo;It-is Sabbath, and it-is┘not└lawful for-you to-carry the bedroll of-you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the (man) answered them, &ldquo;The-one having-made┘me└healthy—that-one said to me, &lsquo;Pick-up the bedroll of-you and walk.&rsquo;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They-asked him, &ldquo;Who is the man the-one having-said to-you, &lsquo;Pick-up and walk&rsquo;?&rdquo; 13And the-one having-been-healed did┘not└know who he-was, for [the] Jesus had-left, (a) crowd being in-the-place. 14After these-things [the] Jesus finds him in the temple and said to-him, &ldquo;Behold, you-have-become healthy; no-longer sin, lest2 something worse become to-you.&rdquo; 15The man went-away and reported to-the Jews that Jesus was the-One having-made┘him└well. 16And on-account-of this, the Jews began-to-persecute [the] Jesus, because he-was-doing these-things on (the) Sabbath. 17But [the] Jesus answered them, &ldquo;The Father of-me is-working up-to now and-I am-working.&rdquo; 18Then on-account-of this, the Jews were-seeking more to-kill him because not only was-he-breaking the Sabbath, but also he-was-calling [the] God his &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; making himself equal to-[the] God.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then [the] Jesus answered and said to-them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I-tell you, the Son is┘not└able of himself to-do something unless2 he-sees the Father doing something; for whatever2 that-One does—these-things also the Son likewise does. 20For the Father loves the Son and shows him all-things that he does, and he-will-show him greater works than-these in-order-that you may-marvel. 21For as the Father raises the dead and makes-alive, so also the Son makes-alive whom he-wants-to. 22For neither does┘the Father└judge anybody, but he-has-given all [the] judgment to-the Son, 23in-order-that all may-honor the Son as they-honor the Father. The-one not honoring the Son does┘not└honor the Father, the-One having-sent him. 24Truly, truly, I-tell you that the-one hearing the word of-me and believing the-One having-sent me has eternal life and does┘not└come into condemnation, but has-crossed-over from [the] death into [the] life. 25Truly, truly, I-tell you that (the) hour is-coming and now is when the dead will-hear the voice of the Son of-[the] God, the remaining and the-ones having-heard will-come-to-life. 26For as the Father has life in himself, so also he-gave to-the Son to-have life in himself. 27And he-gave him authority to-make judgment, because he-is (a) Son of-Man. 28Do┘ not└marvel-at this—that (the) hour is-coming in which all the-ones in the grave will hear the voice of-him, 29and the-ones having-done [the] good-things will-come-out into (the) resurrection of-life, and the-ones having-done [the] foul-things into (the) resurrection of-condemnation. 30I am┘not└able to-do anything from myself; even-as I-hear, I judge; and [the] my [the] judgment is just, because I-do┘not└seek [the] my [the] will, but the will of-the-One having-sent me. 31&quot;If I testify about myself, the testimony of-me is not valid. 32Another is the-one testifying about me, and I-know that the testimony that he-testifies about me is true. 33You have-sent to John, and he-has-testified to-the truth. 34But I do┘not└receive [the] testimony from man, but I-say these-things in-order-that you may-be-saved. 35That-one was the/a lamp [the] burning and shining, and you were-willing to-be-happy for (a) time in the light of-him. 36But I have [the] testimony greater than [the] John, for the works that the Father has-given me in-order-that I-might-carry┘them└out—the works themselves that I-do testify about me that the Father has-sent me. 37And the having-sent me Father—that-one has-testified about me. You-have┘neither└heard (the) voice of-him at-any-time, nor have-you-seen (the) visible-form of-him. 38And the word of-him you-do┘not└have staying in you, because whom that-One sent—this-One you do┘not└believe. 39You-search the scriptures because you think in them to-have eternal life; and those are the-ones testifying about me. 40And you-do┘not└want to-come to me in-order-that you-may-find life. 41&quot;I-do┘not└receive glory from men, 42but I-have-known you that you-do┘not└have the love of-[the] God in yourselves. 43I have-come in the name of-the Father of-me, and you-do┘not└receive me; if another comes in [the] his-own [the] name, that-one you-will-receive. 44How are┘you└able to-believe, receiving glory from one-another, and do┘not└seek the glory [the] from the only God? 45Do┘not└suppose that I will-accuse you to the Father; Moses is the-one accusing you, in whom you have-hoped. 46If you believed Moses, you would-be-believing me, because that-one wrote about me. 47And if you do┘not└believe the writings of-that-one, how will-you-believe [the] my words?&quot;</span></p>
