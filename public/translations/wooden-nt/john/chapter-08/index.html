<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And Jesus went to the Mount of-[the] Olives. 2And again early-in-the-morning he-arrived in the temple, and all the people began-to-come to him; and, having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach them. 3And the scribes and the Pharisees bring (a) woman having-been-caught in adultery; and, having-stood her in (the) midst, 4they-say to-him, &ldquo;Teacher, this [the] woman has-been-caught committing-adultery—in (the) very-act. 5And in the Law Moses commanded to-stone [the] such (a woman). So what do┘you└say?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now they-were-saying this, testing him, in-order-that they-might-have (something) to-accuse him. But [the] Jesus having-squatted down, wrote-down on the ground with-the-finger. 7And as they-were-remaining, asking him, he-stood-up and said to-them, &ldquo;Let┘the sinless-one of-you first└throw (a) stone at her.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-squatted-down again, he-started writing on the ground on the ground. 9And the-ones having-heard were-beginning-to-leaving one by one, starting from the older-ones; and he-was-left alone and the woman being in (the) midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-stood-up, &ldquo;Woman, where are-they? Did┘nobody└condemn you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the (woman) said, &ldquo;Nobody, Sir.&rdquo; And [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do┘I└condemn you; Go, and from the now do┘not└sin again.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then [the] Jesus spoke again to-them, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of-the world. The-one following me will┘certainly not└walk in darkness, but will-have the light of-[the] life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then the Pharisees said to-him, &ldquo;You testify about yourself; the testimony of-you is not valid.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus answered and said to-them, &ldquo;Even-if I testify about myself, the testimony of-me is valid because I know whence I-came and whence I-am-going. But you do┘not└know whence I-come or where I-go. 15You are-judging/judge according-to the flesh; I am┘not└judging/judge anybody. 16And if I do-judge, [the] my [the] judgment is true, because I-am not alone; but I and the having-sent me Father. 17But in [the] your [the] Law it-is┘also└written that the testimony of-two men is valid. 18I am the-one testifying for myself, and the having-sent me Father testifies for me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then they-were-saying to-him, &ldquo;Where is the Father of-you?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You-know neither me nor the Father of-me. If you had-known me, you┘would└have-known the Father of-me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> These [the] words he-spoke teaching in the Treasury in the temple, and nobody arrested him because the hour of-him had┘not-yet└come.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then he-said again to-them, &ldquo;I am-going-away and you-will-look-for me, and you-will-die in the sins of-you. Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the Jews said, &ldquo;He-is┘not┘┘└going-to-kill himself, └└is he?&rdquo; because he-says, &ldquo;Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, &ldquo;You are from the-things below; I am from the-things above. You are from this [the] world; I am not from this [the] world. 24So I-said to-you that you-will-die in the sins of-you, for if you-do┘not└believe that I am (the One), you-will-die in the sins of-you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then they-were-saying to-him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; [The} Jesus said to-them, &ldquo;Even what I-said to you from the beginning. 26I-have many-things to-say and to-judge about you, but the-One having-sent me is true. And what-things I-heard from him—these-things I-say to the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They-did┘not└know that he-was-speaking to-them with-respect-to-the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-them, &ldquo;When you-lift-up the Son of-[the] Man, then you-will-know that I am, and do mothering of myself, but even-as the Father taught me—I speak these-things. 29And the-One having-sent me is with me. He-did┘not└leave me alone, because I always do the-things pleasing to-him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He saying these-things, many believed in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then [the] Jesus continued-on-saying to the ones-having-believed him Jews. &ldquo;If you remain in[the] my [the] word, you really are disciples of-me, 32and you-will-know the truth, and the truth will-free you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They-responded to him, &ldquo;We-are Abraham&rsquo;s seed and have┘never└been-enslaved to-anybody.
