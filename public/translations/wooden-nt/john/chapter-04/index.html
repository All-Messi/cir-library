        <h2 id="john-chapter-4">John Chapter 4</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When then [the] Jesus knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus was-making and baptizing more disciples than-John—2although Jesus himself was┘not└doing-the-baptizing, but the disciples of-him (were doing the baptizing)—3he-left [the] Judaea and went-away back into [the] Galilee. 4And it-was-necessary-for him to-go through [the] Samaria. 5Then he-comes into (a) village of-the Samaritans called Sychar near the parcel that Jacob gave Joseph, the son of-him. 6And (the) well of-[the] Jacob was there. Then [the] Jesus, having-become-weary from the journey was-sitting thus on the well. It-was about (the) sixth hour. 7(A) woman from [the] Samaria comes to-draw water. (The) Jesus says to-her, &ldquo;Give me to-drink.&rdquo; 8For the disciples of-him had-gone into the village in-order-that they-might-buy food.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the Samaritan [the] woman says to-him, &ldquo;How do┘you, being (a) Jew,└ask to-drink from me, being (a) Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (For Jews do┘not└associate-with Samaritans.)</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus answered and said to-her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of-[the] God and who the-One is that-is-saying to-you, &lsquo;Give me to-drink,&rsquo; you would have-asked him, and he┘would└have-given you living water.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The woman says to-him, &ldquo;Sir, you-do┘not-even└have (a) bucket and the well is deep. Whence then do-you-have [the] living [the] water? 12You are not┘greater than-the father of-us, Jacob,└are-you, who gave us the well and himself drank from it and the sons of-him and the domesticated-animals of-him?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Jesus answered and said to-her, &ldquo;Everybody who drinks from this [the] water will-get-thirsty again. 14But whoever2 drinks of the water that I-will-give him, will┘certainly not└thirst forever3. But, the water that I-will-give to-him will-become in him (as) spring of water springing-up into eternal life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The woman says to him, &ldquo;Sir, give me this [the] water in-order-that I-will┘not└get-thirsty or come here to-draw (it).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He-says to-her, &ldquo;Go call the husband of-you and come here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The woman answered and said to-him, &ldquo;I-do┘not└have (a) husband.&rdquo; [The] Jesus says to-her, &ldquo;You-said well [that], &lsquo;I-do┘not└have (a) husband.&rsquo; 18For you-had five husbands and now whom you-have is not your husband. You-have-said this truly.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The woman says to-him, &ldquo;Sir, I-see that you are (a) prophet. 20The fathers of-us worshiped on this [the] mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it-is-necessary to-worship.&rdquo; &ldquo;Believe me, woman, [that] (the) time/hour is-coming when neither on this [the] mountain nor in Jerusalem will-youpl-worship the Father. 22Youpl worship what you-do┘not└know; we worship what we-know, because [the] salvation is of the Jews. 23But (the) time is-coming—and now is—when the true worshipers will-worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such the-ones worshiping him. 24[The] God (is a) spirit, and it-is-necessary-for the-ones worshiping him to-worship in spirit and truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The woman says to-him, &ldquo;I-know that Messiah is-coming, the-One called Christ. When that-one comes he-will-announce all-things to-us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus says to-her, &ldquo;I, the-One speaking to-you, am (he).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And upon this (situation) the disciples of-him came, and they-were-amazed that/because he-was-speaking with (a) woman. However, nobody said, &ldquo;What are-you-looking-for?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why are-you-talking with her?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then the woman left the water-pot of-her and went-away into the village, and says to-the men, 29&quot;Come, see (a) fellow who told me all-things as-many-as I-did. This is not┘ the Messiah, └is it?&rdquo; 30They-went-out of the village and were-coming to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> In-the-meantime the disciples kept-asking him, saying, &ldquo;Eat (something).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> But the/he said to-them, &ldquo;I have food to-eat that you do┘not└know.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The disciples started-saying to-one-another, &ldquo;Somebody has┘not┘┘└brought him (something) to-eat, └└have-they?&rdquo; &ldquo;My food is in-order-that I-might-do the will of-the-One having-sent me and in-order-that I-might-finish the work of-him. 35Do-you┘not└say [that] yet three-months are and [the] harvest is-coming? Behold, I-tell you, lift-up the eyes of-you and look-at the fields that they-are already white for harvest. 36The reaper receives pay and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in-order-that the sower and the reaper may-rejoice together. 37For this [the] saying is true [that],&lsquo;One is the sower and another (is) the reaper.&rsquo; 38I sent you to-reap what you have┘not└labored-on. Others have-labored, and you have-entered into the work of-them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And from that [the] village many of-the Samaritans came-to-believe on-account-of the word of-the woman testifying [that], &ldquo;He-told me everything [that] that I-did.&rdquo; 40So when the Samaritans came to him, they-asked him to-stay with them, and he-stayed there two days. 41And more by-much they-came-to-belief on-account-of the word of-him. 42And to-the woman they-were-saying [that], &ldquo;No-longer do-we-believe on-account-of [the] your saying, for we┘ourselves└have-heard and know that this is truly the Savior of the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And after the two days he-went-out from-there into [the] Galilee. 44For Jesus himself testified that (a) prophet in [the] his-own country does┘not└have honor. 45Therefore when he-came into [the] Galilee, the Galileans received him, having-seen all-things as-many-as he-did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went to the feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> So they came again into [the] Cana of-[the] Galilee, where he-made the water wine. And (a) certain ruler was whose [the] son was-sick in Capernaum. 47This-one, having heard that Jesus came from Judaea into [the] Galilee, went-away to him and began-to-ask in-order-that he-come-down and heal the son of-him, for he-was-about to-die.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> So [the] Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Unless2 youpl-see signs and wonders, you-will┘not└believe at-all!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The ruler says to-him, &ldquo;Sir, go-down before the son of-me dies.&rdquo; The man believed the word that [the] Jesus said to-him and went. 51And already, he going-down, the slaves of-him met him, saying that the son of-him was-living. 52So he-asked from them the hour in which he-had recovery. So they said to-him [that], &ldquo;Yesterday the fever left him at-(the)-seventh hour.&rdquo; 53Then the father knew that (it was) at that [the] hour in which [the] Jesus said to-him, &ldquo;The son of-you lives,&rdquo; and he believed, and the whole household of-him believed. 54And again this (was a/the) second sign Jesus did, having-come out-of [the] Judaea into [the] Galilee.</span></p>
