You know him because he-remains with you, and will-be in you. 18I-will┘not└leave you orphans; I-am-coming to you. 19Yet (a) little (while) and the world no-longer sees me, but you will-see me, because I live and you will-live. 20In that [the] day you will-know that I (am) in the Father of-me and you (are) in me and-I (am) in you. 21The-one having the commandments of-me and keeping them—that-one is the-one loving me. And the-one loving me will-be-loved by the Father of-me, and-I will-love him, and I-will-manifest myself to-him.&amp;rdquo; 22Judas, not [the] Iscariot, says to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, [and]ms what is (it) that you will manifest yourself to-us and not to-the world?&amp;rdquo; 23Jesus answered and said to-him, &amp;ldquo;If anybody loves me, he-will-keep the word of-me, and the Father of-me will-love him, and we-will-come to him and make (a) place-to-stay with him. 24The-one not loving me does┘not└keep the word of-me. And the word that you-hear is not mine but of-the having-sent me Father. 25&amp;quot;I-have-spoken these-things to-you, remaining with you. 26And/But the Comforter, the Holy [the] Spirit, that the Father will-send in the name of-me—that-one will-teach you all-things and remind┘of└of all-things that [I]ms said to-you. 27I-leave peace for-you; I-give my [the] peace to-you; I-am┘not└giving to-you like the world gives. Do┘not└let┘the heart of-you└be-troubled, nor let-it-be-afraid. 28You-heard that I said to-you, &amp;lsquo;I-am-going-away, and I-am-coming to you.&amp;rsquo; If you loved me, you┘would└rejoice that I-am-going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. 29And now I-have-told you before (it) happens, in-order-that when it-does-happen, you-may-believe. 30No-longer will-I-say many-things with you; for the ruler of-the world is-coming, and he-has nothing in me. 31But in-order-that the world may-know that I-love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, thus I-do. Get-up, let-us-go from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As the branch is┘not└able to-bear fruit from itself unless2 it-remains in the vine; so you neither unless2 you-remain in me. 5I am the vine; your (are) the branches. The-one remaining in me and-I in him—this-one bears much fruit, because without me you-are┘not└able to-do anything. 6Unless2 somebody remains in me, he-will-be-thrown out like the/a branch and wither, and they-gather-up and throw (them) into the fire, and they-are-burned-up. 7If you-remain in me and the words of-me remain in you, whatever2 you-want, ask, and it-will-become to-you. 8In/By this the Father of-you with-be-glorified: that you-bear much fruit and become disciples to-me. 9As the Father loved me, I-also loved you; remain in [the] my [the] love. 10If you-keep the commandments of-me, you-will-remain in the love of-me, as I have-kept the commandments of-the Father of-me and remain in the love of-him. 11I-have-said these-things to-you in-order-that [the] my [the] joy may-be in you, and the joy of-you may-be-full. 12This is [the] my [the] commandment: that you-love one-another as I-loved you. 13Nobody has greater love than-this: that somebody lay-down the life of-himself on-behalf-of the friends of-him. 14You are friends of-me if you-do what I command you. 15No-longer do-I-call you servants, because the/a servant does┘not└know what the lord of-him is-doing; but I-have-called you friends because all that I-heard from the Father of-me I-made-known to-you. 16You did┘not└choose me, but I chose you and appointed you in-order-that you may-go and bear fruit, and the fruit of-you may-remain in-order-that whatever2 you┘[would] └ask the Father in the name of-me I-might-give (it) to-you. 17I-command you these-things in-order-that you-may-love one-another. 18&amp;quot;If the world hates you, you-know that it-has-hated me first. 19If you-were of the world, the world would be-friendly-to [the] its-own, but because you-are not of the world—but I-chose you out-of the world—on-account-of this the world hates (you). 20You remember the word that I said to-you, &amp;lsquo;A slave is not greater than-the lord of-him.&amp;rsquo; If they-persecuted me, they-will┘also└persecute you. If they-kept the word of-me, they-will┘also└keep [the] yours. 21But they-will-do all these-things to you on-account-of the name of-me, because they-do┘not└know the-One having-sent me. 22If I-had┘not└come and spoken to-them, they-would┘not└have sin. But now they-do┘not└have (an) excuse for the sin of-them. 23The-one hating me also hates the Father of-me. 24If I had┘not└done among them the works that nobody else did, they would┘not└have sin. But now they-have┘both└seen and hate both me and the Father of-me. 25But (this has happened) in-order-that the word [the] written in the Law of-them might-be-fulfilled [that],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For if I do┘not└go-away, the Comforter will┘not└be-coming to you. But if I-go, I-will-send him to you, 8and having-come, that-One will-convict the world about sins and about righteousness and about judgment—9about sins, on-the-one-hand, because they-do┘not└believe in me; 10about righteousness, on-the-other-hand, because I-am-going to the Father and no-longer do-you-see me; 11about judgment, on-the-one-hand, because the ruler of-[the] this world has-been-judged. 12&amp;quot;Yet many-things I-have to-say to-you, but you-are┘not└able to-bear (them) now. 13But when that-One comes—the Spirit of-[the] truth, he-will-lead you in all the/[the] truth. For he-will┘not└speak from himself, but as-many-things-as he-will-hear he-will-speak, and he-will-announce to-you the-things coming. 14That-one will-glorify me, because he-will-take from [the] my [thing] and announce to-you. 15All-things as-many-as the Father has are mine; on-account-of this-thing I-say that he-takes from the my (thing) and will-announce (it) to-you. 16&amp;quot;(A) little (time) and no-longer do-you-see me, and again (a) little (time) and you-will-see me.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They-were to-you and┘you-gave them└to-me, and they-have-kept the word of-you. 7Now they-have-known that all-things as-many-as you-have-given me are from you; 8because the words that you-gave me I-have-given to-them, and they received and knew truly that I-came-out from you, and they believed that you sent me. 9I ask about them; not about the world do-I-ask, but about whom you-have-given to-me, because they-are to-you. 10And all [the] my-things are your-things and [the] your-things (are) mine, and I-have-been-glorified in them. 11And no-longer am-I in the world, and they are in the world, and-I am-coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in the name of-you that you-have-given to-me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are). 12When I-was with them, I was-keeping them in the name of-you that you-have-given me; and I guarded and nobody out-of them perished except2 the son of-[the] perdition in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled. 13But now I-am-coming to you, and I-say these-things in the world in-order-that they-may-have [the] my [the] joy fulfilled in themselves. 14I have-given them the word of-you, and the world hated them, because they-are not of the world as I am not of the world. 15I-do┘not└ask in-order-that you-take them out-of the world, but in-order-that you-may-keep them from the evil-one. 16They-are not of the world as I-am not of the world. 17Sanctify them in the truth; [the] your [the] word is truth. 18As you-sent me into the world, I-also am-sending them into the world. 19And on-behalf-of them I am-sanctifying myself in-order-that they may┘also└be sanctified by (the) truth. 20And not only about these am-I-asking, but also about the-ones believing in me through the word of-them, 21in-order-that they┘all└may-be one as you, Father, (are) in me and-I (am) in you, in-order-that the world may-believe that you sent me. 22And-I have-given them the glory that you-have-given me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are) one. 23I in them and you in me in-order-that they-may-be perfected into one in-order-that the world may-know that you sent me and loved them as you loved me. 24Father, what you-have-given me I-desire that where I am those-also may-be with me, in-order-that they-may-see [the] my [the] glory, which you-have-given me because you-loved me before (the) foundation of-(the)-world. 25Righteous Father, indeed the world did┘not└know you; but I knew you, and these know that you sent me, 26and I-made-known to them the name of-you and I-will-continue-to-make-(it)-known, in-order-that the love that you-loved me may-be in them and-I in them.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
