        <h2 id="john-chapter-12">John Chapter 12</h2>
<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then [the] Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 2So they-made (a) supper for-him there, and [the] Martha was-serving, and [the] Lazarus was one of the–ones reclining with him. 3Then [the] Mary, having-taken 11½-ounces of-ointment—expensive pure nard—anointed the feet of-Jesus and wiped the feet of-him with the hair[s] of-her. And the house was-filled from the fragrance of-the ointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But Judas [the] Iscariot, one of the disciples of-him, the-one going to-betray him, says, 5&quot;On-account-of what was┘this [the] ointment not└sold for-three-hundred denarii and given to-(the)-poor?&quot; 6But he-said this, not because it-was-(a)-care to-him about the poor, but because he-was (a) thief, and, having the money-bag, was-stealing the-things put-(in-it).</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;Let┘her└alone, in-order-that for the day of-the burial of-me she-may-keep it. 8For you┘always└have the poor with you, but you-do┘not always└have me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The large crowd of [the] Jews knew that he-was there, and they-came, not only on-account-of [the] Jesus, but in-order-that they-might┘also└see [the] Lazarus, whom he-raised from (the) dead. 10But the chief priests took-counsel in-order-that they-might┘also└kill [the] Lazarus, 11because on-account-of him many of-the Jews were-going-away and believing in [the] Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> On-the next-day the great crowd [the] having-come to the feast, having-heard that [the] Jesus was-coming into Jerusalem, 13took [the] fronds of-the palm-trees and went-out for meeting him, and began-to-shout,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-found (a) young-donkey, sat on it, as it-is-written,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Do┘not└fear, daughter of-Zion;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The disciples of-him at-first2 did┘not└understand, but when Jesus was-glorified, then they-remembered that these-things were written about him and they-did these-things to-him. 17So the crowd—the-one being with him when he-called [the] Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from (the) dead—was-testifying. 18On-account-of this also the crowd met him: because they-heard he had-done this [the] sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the Pharisees said to one-another, &ldquo;You-see that you-do┘not└achieve anything. Behold, the world went after him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And there-were some Greeks of the-ones coming-up in-order-that they-might-worship at the feast. 21So/Then these came-to Philip, the-one from Bethsaida of-[the] Galilee, and were-asking him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, we-want to-see [the] Jesus.&rdquo; 22[The] Philip comes and speaks to-[the] Andrew, and Andrew and Philip come and speak to-[the] Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus answers them, saying, &ldquo;The hour has-come in-order-that the Son of-[the] Man might-be-glorified. 24Truly, truly, I-tell you, unless2 the/a kernel of-[the] grain dies, falling into the ground, it remains alone. But if it-dies, it-bears much fruit. 25The-one loving the life of-him loses it, and the-one disregarding the life of-him in this [the] world will-keep it unto eternal life. 26If anybody serves me, let-him-follow me, and where I am—there also [the] my [the] servant will-be. If anybody serves me, the Father will-value/honor him. 27&quot;Now the soul of-me is-in-tension; and what am-I-to-say, &lsquo;Father, save me from this [the] hour&rsquo;? But on-account-of this I-came into this [the] hour. 28Father, glorify the name of-you.&rdquo; Then (a) voice came out-of the sky, &ldquo;I-have-glorified (it) and will-glorify (it) again.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Then the crowd [the] standing and having-heard began-to-say (that) thunder had-happened; others were=saying, &ldquo;(An) angel has-spoken to-him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;This [the] voice has┘not┘┘└occurred └└so-much on-account-of me, but on-account-of you. 31Now (the) judgment of-this [the] world is; now the ruler of-this [the] world will-be-thrown out. 32And-I if I-am-lifted up from the ground, I-will-draw all-people/men to me.&rdquo; 33And he-said this, signifying by-what-kind-of death he┘would└die.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then the crowd answered, &ldquo;We heard out-of the Law that the Messiah remains forever3, and how do┘you└say that it-is-necessary for-the Son of-[the] Man to-be-lifted-up? Who is this [Son of-[the] Man&rsquo;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-them, &ldquo;Yet (a) little time the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, in-order-that darkness may┘not└overtake you. And the-one walking in the darkness does┘not└know where he-is-going. 36When you-have the light, trust in the light, in-order-that you-may-become sons of-light.&rdquo; Jesus said these-things, and having-gone-away was-hid from them. 37And he having-performed such signs in-front-of them, they-were┘not└believing in him, 38in-order-that the word of-Isaiah the prophet might-be-fulfilled that he-said,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> On-account-of this they-were┘not└able to-believe, because Isaiah said again,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Isaiah said these-things because he-saw the glory of-him, and spoke about him. 42Nevertheless, however, even many of the rulers believed in him, but on-account-of the Pharisees they-were┘not└confessing (it) in-order-that they-might┘not└be excommunicated-from-the-synagogue. 43For they-loved the glory of-[the] men more than the glory of-[the] God.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> And Jesus shouted and said, &ldquo;The-one believing in me does┘not└believe in me (only), but in the-One having-sent me; 45and the-one seeing me sees the-One having-sent me. 46I have-come into the world as-(a)-light, in-order-that the-one believing in me does┘not└remain in the darkness. 47And if anybody hears the words of-me and does┘not└keep (them), I do┘not└condemn him. For I-did┘not└come in-order-that I-might-condemn the world, but in-order-that I-might-save the world. 48The-one ignoring/rejecting me and not receiving the words of-me has the-thing condemning him: the message that I-spoke—it will-condemn him in the last day, 49because I did┘not└speak from myself, but the-One having-sent me—the Father himself—has-given me (a) commandment what I-should-say and what I-should-speak. 50And I-know that the commandment of-him is eternal life. So what-things I speak, as the Father has-spoken to-me, thus I-speak.&quot;</span></p>
