Behold, how-small (a) fire ignites/sets-on-fire how big (a) forest!  6And the tongues (is a) fire.  The world of-[the] iniquity, the tongue is-placed among the members of-us [the-one] polluting the whole body and setting-on-fire the course of-[the] existence and is-set-on-fire by [the] Gehenna.  7For every nature/kind both of-beasts and birds, both of reptiles and fish is-controlled and has-been-controlled by-[the] human [the] species, 8but nobody of-men is-able to-control the tongue.  (It is a) restless evil-thing, full of-deadly poison.  9With it we-bless the Lord and Father, and with it we-curse [the] men made according-to (the) likeness of- God.  10Blessing and cursing comes out-of the same mouth.  These-things ought┘not└to-be, my brothers.  11The/A spring does┘not└gush/pour out-of the same opening [the] sweet-(water) and [the] bitter, does-it?  12(A) fig-tree is┘not┘┘└able to-make olives or (a) vine (is not able to produce) figs, └└can-it?  Neither (is) salty water (able) to-produce fresh (water).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Is it) not whence from the passions of-you the-ones waging-war in the members of-you?  2You-lust and do┘not└have; you-murder and envy, and you-are┘not└able to-obtain; you-war and battle; you-do┘not└have on-account-of [the] your not asking; 3you-ask and do┘not└receive, because you-ask badly, in-order-that you-may-spend (it) on the pleasures of-you.  4Adulteresses, do you┘not└know that [the] friendship of-the world is hostility of-[the] God?  Whoever2 then wants to-be (a) friend of-the world, makes-himself (an) enemy of-[the] God.  5Or, do-you-suppose that in-vain the scripture says, &amp;ldquo;The Spirit that he caused to dwell in us desires unto jealousy&amp;rdquo;?  6But he-gives greater grace:  wherefore it-says,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You-treasured (it up) in the last days.  4Behold, the pay of-the laborers [the] mowing the fields of-you, [the] withheld by you, cries-out; and the outcries of-the reapers has-entered into the ears of-(the)-Lord of-hosts/Sabaoth.  5You-lived-in-self-indulgence on the earth, and you-lived-in-luxury.  You-nourished the hearts of-you in (the) day of-slaughter/butchering; 6you-condemned; you-put-to-death the Righteous-One.  He-does┘not└resist you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
