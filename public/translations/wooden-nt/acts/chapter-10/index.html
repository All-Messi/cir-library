<p><span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the-one/he having-fixed-his-eyes-on him and having-become fearful, said, &ldquo;What is-it, sir?&rdquo; And he-said to-him, &ldquo;The prayers of-you and the alms of-you came-up for (a) memorial before [the] God. 5And now send men to Joppa and summon a-certain Simon who is-called Peter. 6This-one is-lodging with a-certain Simon, (a) tanner, (a) house to-whom is beside (the) sea.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And when the angel the-one speaking to-him went-away, having-called two of-the domestic-servants and (a) devout soldier of-the-ones being-in-close-company-with him; 8and having-explained all-things to-them, he-sent them to [the] Joppa.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And on-the next-day, those traveling-on-the road and nearing the city, Peter went-up on the housetop to-pray about (the) sixth hour. 10And he-became hungry and was-wanting to-taste (something). And they making-preparation, (a) trance came on him, 11and he-sees the sky opened and (a) container like (a) large piece-of-linen-cloth being-let-down to the earth by four corners, 12in which were all the four-footed-animals and reptiles of-the earth and birds of-the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And (a) voice came to him, &ldquo;Get-up, Peter; kill and eat.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And this-thing happened up-to three (times) and immediately the container was-taken-back/up into the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And while [the] Peter was-wondering in himself what the vision would be that he-saw, behold, the men [the-ones] having-been-sent by [the] Cornelius, having-asked-around-for the house of-[the] Simon, stood at the gate, 18and having-called-out were-asking whether Simon [the-one] called Peter was-lodging there.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Peter trying-to-understand about the vision, the Spirit said to-him, &ldquo;Behold, three men are-seeking you. 20But having-gotten-up, go-down and travel with them, doubting nothing because I have-sent them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And Peter having-gone-down to the men, said, &ldquo;Behold, I am whom you-seek. What is the matter on-account-of which you-are-present?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the-ones/they said, &ldquo;Cornelius (a) centurion, (a) righteous man and one-fearing [the] God, and testified-to by the whole nation of-the Jews, was-instructed by (a) holy angel to-summon you to the house of-him and to-hear words from you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So having-invited┘them└in, he-entertained (them). And on-the next-day, having-arisen, he-went-out with them and some of-the brothers [the] from Joppa went-with him. 24And on-the next-day he-entered into [the] Caesarea. And [the] Cornelius was expecting them, having-called-together the relatives of-him and the/his close friends. 25And when [the] Peter&rsquo;s entering, [the] Cornelius having-met him, having-fallen at the/his feet, worshiped (him).</span></p>

And┘[the] God showed└to-me to-call no man common or unclean. 29Wherefore also without-objection I-came having-been-summoned. So I-ask-for what reason did-you-send-after me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And [the] Cornelius said, &ldquo;(The) fourth day ago during this [the] hour I-was praying the ninth (hour) in the house of-me, and, behold, (a) man stood in-front-of me in shining clothing, 31and says, &lsquo;Cornelius, the prayer of-you was-heard and the alms of-you were-remembered before [the] God; 32so send to Joppa and summon Simon who is-called Peter; this-one is-lodging in (the) house of Simon (the) tanner beside (the) sea. 33So immediately I-sent to you, and you did well arriving.
