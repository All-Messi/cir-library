<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And having-heard, they-entered into the temple under the early-morning3/at daybreak3, and began-to-teach. And the high-priest having-arrived, and the-ones with him called-together the Sanhedrin and all the Council of-the sons of-Israel, and they-sent to the prison for-them to-be-brought.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the having-arrived, officers did┘not└find them in the prison; and, having-returned, they-reported, 23saying [that], &ldquo;We-found the prison locked in all safety and the guards standing at the doors, but having-opened we-found nobody inside.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And when they-heard [the] these words, and the captain of-the temple and the high-priests were-wondering about them—whatever2 this would become. 25And a-certain one, having-arrived, reported to-them [that], &ldquo;Behold, the men whom you-put in [the] prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then the captain, having-gone-away with the officers were-bringing them not with violence, for they-were-fearing the people lest they-would-stone them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And having-led them, they-stood (them) in the Sanhedrin; and the high-priest asked them, saying, &ldquo;With instruction we-instructed you not to-teach in [the] this name, and behold you-have-filled [the] Jerusalem with-the teaching of-you, and plan to-bring on us the blood of-[the] this man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And Peter, having-responded and the apostles said, &ldquo;It-is-necessary to-obey God rather than men. 30The God of-the fathers of-us raised Jesus whom you did-murder, having-hung (him) on (a) cross. 31[The] God exalted this-One as-Leader and Savior to-the right-(hand) of-him [the] to-give repentance to-[the] Israel and remission of-sins. 32And we are witnesses of-[the] these words/matters and the Holy [the] Spirit that [the] God gave to-the-ones obeying him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the-ones/they, having-heard, became-enraged and were-planning to-kill them. 34And a-certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin, having-arisen, name to-him Gamaliel, (a) teacher-of-the-Law respected by all the people, commanded (them) to-put the men outside/aside for-a-little-while, 35and he-said to them, &ldquo;Men Israelites, take-heed-to yourselves in-respect-to [the] these men what you-are-about to-do. 36For before these [the] days Theudas rose-up, saying himself to-be something, to-whom (a) number of-men were-inclined, about four-hundred, who was-killed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed, and they-became for nothing. 37After this-one, Judas the Galilean rose-up in the days of-the enrollment and drew-aside people after him; and that-one was-destroyed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed. 38And the-things now, I-say to-you, set┘[the] these men└aside and leave┘them└alone; because if [the] this plan or [the] this work is from men, it-will-be-overthrown; 39but if it-is from God, you-will┘not└be-able to-overthrow them, lest-at-any-time you-be-found even to-be-battling God.&rdquo; And they-took his advice/obeyed him. 40And they-summoned the apostles, having-beaten (them), they-commanded (them) not to speak in the name of-[the] Jesus and released them. 41So the-ones/they were-going-out rejoicing from (the) face of-the Sanhedrin, because they-were-considered-important-enough to-be-disgraced. 42And every day in the temple and from house to house2/according-to (the) house2 they-did┘not└cease teaching and preaching the Christ (was) Jesus.</span></p>
