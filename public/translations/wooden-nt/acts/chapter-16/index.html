<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But [also]ms he-arrived in Derbe and in Lystra. And, behold, a-certain disciple was there, Timothy by-name, (the) son of-(a)-Jewish woman of-faith and of-(a)-Greek father, 2who was testified-to by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium. 3This-one [the] Paul wanted to-go-out with him; and having-taken (him), he-circumcised him on-account-of the Jews [the] being in [the] those places, for all knew that the father of-him was (a) Greek. 4And as they-were-traveling-through the cities, they-were-delivering to-them to-keep the decrees [the] judged by the apostles and elders [the] in Jerusalem. 5So the churches were-being-strengthened in-the/[the] faith, and they-were-increasing in–[the] number according-to (the) day/daily2.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And they-went/passed-through [the] Phrygia and Galatia country, having-been-prevented by the Holy Spirit to-speak the word in the Asia. 7And having-gone down-to [the] Mysia, they-tried to-travel into [the] Bithynia, and the Spirit of-Jesus did┘not└let them. 8But having-gone-past [the] Mysia, they-went-down to Troas. 9And (a) vision through/during [the]ms night appeared to-[the] Paul, a-certain man, (a) Macedonian, was standing and urging him and saying, &ldquo;Having-traveled-through into Macedonia, help us.&rdquo; 10And when he-saw the vision, immediately we-sought to-go-out into Macedonia, concluding that [the] God had-called us to-evangelize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And having-set-sail from Troas, we-ran-a-straight-course to Samothrace, and on-the next-day to Neapolis, 12and-from-there to Philippi, which is (a) city of-(the)-first part of-[the] Macedonia, (a) colony. And we-were staying in this [the] city certain days. 13And on-the day of-the Sabbath, we-went-out outside the city beside (a) river where we-were-supposing prayer to-be; and having-sat-down, we-began-talking with the women having-gathered-together. 14And a-certain woman, Lydia by-name, (a) dealer-in-purple-cloth, of-(the)-city of-Thyatira, fearing [the] God/(a) God-fearer, was-listening, the heart of-whom the Lord opened to-give-herself to-the-things spoken by [the] Paul. 15And when she-was-baptized and the house of-her, she-urged (us), saying, &ldquo;If you-have-found me to-be trustworthy/faithful to-the Lord, having-entered the house of-me, remain&rdquo;; and she-persuaded us.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And it-happened, we going to [the] prayer, a-certain slave-girl, having (a) spirit-of-divination, met us, who was-bringing much profit to-the lords of-her, fortune-telling. 17This-one, dogging [the] Paul and us, kept shouting, saying, &ldquo;These [the] men (are) servants of-[the] God Most High, who proclaim to-us (the) way of-salvation.&rdquo; 18And she-kept-doing this for many days. And Paul, having-been-greatly-annoyed and having-turned around, said to-the spirit, &ldquo;I-charge you in (the) name of-Jesus Christ to-come-out from her.&rdquo; And it-came-out the very hour. 19And the lords of-her, having-seen that the hope of-the profit of-them had-gone-out, seizing [the] Paul and [the] Silas, dragged (them) into the marketplace to-the rulers; 20and having-brought┘them└to the soldiers/magistrates/praeters, said, &ldquo;These [the] men are-stirring-up the city of-us, being Jews, 21and they-are-proclaiming customs that are┘not└legal for-us to-observe nor to-do, being Romans.&rdquo; 22And the crowd joined-in-the-attack against them, and the soldiers/magistrates/praeters, having-torn-off the clothes of-them, were-commanding to-beat┘them└with-rods; 23and having-laid┘many blows└on them, they-put them in prison having-ordered the jailor to-keep them safely/securely; 24who, having-received such (an) order, put them in the inner prison and secured the feet of-them in [the] stocks.</span></p>
