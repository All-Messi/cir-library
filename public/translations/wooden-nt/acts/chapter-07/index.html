<p><span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the/he said, &ldquo;Men brothers and fathers, listen. The God of-[the] glory appeared to-Abraham the father of-us being in [the] Mesopotamia before2 his dwelling in Haran, 3and said to him, &lsquo;Go-out from the land of-you and from the relative(s) of-you, and go into the land that2 I-will-show you.&rsquo; 4And having-gone-out from (the) land of-(the)-Chaldeans, he-settled in Haran. And from-there after the father of-him [the] having-died, he-moved him into [the] this land in which we now dwell, 5and he-did┘not└give him (an) inheritance in it not-even (a) space of-(the)-foot and promised to-give it to-him for possession and to-the seed of-him after him, (an) offspring not being to-him. 6And so [the] God said [that], &lsquo;The seed of-him will-be (a) sojourner in (a) foreign land and they-will-enslave it and mistreat it for-four-hundred years. 7And the nation to-which they-will-be-slaves I will-judge, says [the] God, and after these-things they-will-come-out, and they-will-serve me in [the]this place.&rsquo; 8And he-gave to-him (the) covenant of-circumcision, and so he-begot [the] Isaac and circumcised him on-the eighth [the] day. And Isaac (begot) [the] Jacob, and Jacob (begot) the twelve patriarchs. 9&quot;And the patriarchs, having-been-jealous-of [the] Joseph, sold (him) into Egypt and [the] God was with him. 10And he-delivered him out-of all the afflictions of-him, and gave grace and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of-Egypt and [over]ms all the household of-him. 11And (a) famine came on the whole-of Egypt and Canaan and great affliction, and the fathers of-us were┘not└finding food/fodder. 12And Jacob, having-heard grain[s] being in Egypt, sent the fathers of-us first. 13And in the second Joseph made-himself-known to-the brothers of-him, and the family of-[the] Joseph became apparent to-[the] Pharaoh. 14And Joseph, having-sent-away, summoned Jacob the father of-him and all the kin/relatives, in souls seventy five. 15And Jacob went-down into Egypt, and he and the fathers of-us died, 16and they-were-removed into Shechem and were-put in the tomb that Abraham bought for-(the)-price of-silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And even-as the time of-the promise came-near that [the] God assured [the] Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt 18until2 another king arose over Egypt, who did┘not└know [the] Joseph. 19This-one, having-taken-advantage-of the race of-us, mistreated the fathers [of-us]ms [the] to-make (them) expose the babies of-them unto [the] not allowing-(them)-to-live; 20at which time Moses was born and he-was handsome to-[the] God, who was-nourished for-three months in the house of-the/his father. 21And he having-been-exposed the daughter of-Pharaoh took-him-up and nourished him for-himself for (a) son. 22And Moses was-educated in all wisdom of-(the)-Egyptians, and he-was capable in his words and deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And when (a) forty-years&rsquo; time was-fulfilled to-him, it-went-up in the heart of-him to-visit the brothers of-him, the sons of-Israel. 24And having-seen a-certain-one being-mistreated, he-came-to-help, and took vengeance for-the-one being-oppressed, striking-down the Egyptian. 25And he-was-supposing the brothers of-him understood that [the] God through (the) hand of-him was-giving salvation to-them. But the-ones/they did┘not└understand.</span></p>
