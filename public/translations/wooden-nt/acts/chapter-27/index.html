<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And when our [the] sailing to [the] Italy was decided, they-were-delivering both Paul and some other prisoners to-(a)-centurion, Julius by-name of-(the)-Augustan band. 2And having-boarded (an) Adramyttium ship being-about to-sail to [the] places along [the] Asia, we-embarked, Aristarchus, (a) Macedonian of-Thessalonica being with us. 3And the next-(day) we-harbored at Sidon; and [the] Julius, having-treated Paul kindly, allowed (him), having-gone to the/his friends, to-obtain care. 4From there, having-embarked, we-sailed-under-the-shelter-of [the] Cyprus on-account-of the winds to-be contrary. 5And having-sailed-across the open-sea [the] along [the] Cilicia and Pamphylia, we-landed at Myra of-[the] Lycia. 6And-there the centurion, having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to [the] Italy, boarded us on it. 7And in sufficient days, sailing-slowing and having-arrived with-difficulty along [the] Cnidus, the wind not allowing┘us└to-go-farther, we-sailed-under-[the] Crete along Salome; 8and with-difficulty, drifting-along it, we-came to a-certain place called Fair Havens, which was near (a) town/city Lasea.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And sufficient time passing and already the voyage being risky on-account-of even the Fast already [the] having-gone-by, [the] Paul kept-urging, 10saying to-them, &ldquo;Men, I-see that with injury and much loss, not only of-[the] cargo and the ship but also of-the lives of-us, the voyage will be.&rdquo; 11But the centurion was-being-persuaded more by the captain and the ship-owner than by the things spoken by Paul. 12And the harbor being unsuitable for wintering, the majority set plan(s) to embark from there, if somehow they-might-be-able, having-reached [the] Phoenix, to-winter—(a) harbor of-[the] Crete facing according-to southeast and according-to northeast.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And (a) south-wind having-started-blowing-gently, having-supposed to-have-achieved the/their purpose, having-raised anchor, they-were-coasting-along [the] Crete as-close-as-possible. 14But after not much (time), (a) very-strong wind [the] called Euraquilo surged-down from it. 15And the ship having-been-caught and not able to-face the gale, having-given-way (to it), we-began-to-be-carried. 16And running-under a-(certain) small island, we-were-able with difficulty to-gain control of-the dinghy/skiff; 17which having-taken-up, they-were-making-use-of cables/helps securing the ship, and fearing lest they-would-run-around on [the] Syrtis, having-let/lowered-down, thus they-were-drifting along. 18And we undergoing┘exceedingly└bad-weather on-the next-day, they-began (a) casting-off/throwing-overboard, 19and on-the third day with-their-hands they-threw-overboard the tackling/gear of-the ship. 20And neither sun nor stars shining for many days, and (the) storm bearing-down not (a) little, henceforth, all hope of-[the] our being-saved was-being-taken-away.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And much lack-of-appetite being, then [the] Paul, having-stood in (the) midst of-them, said, &ldquo;O men, it-was-necessary, having-obeyed me not to-embark/sail from [the] Crete and to-gain [the] this damage and [the] loss. 22And the-things now, I-advise you to-take-courage, for no loss of-life will-be of you—only the ship, 23for (an) angel of-[the] God, of-whom [I]ms am and whom I-serve, stood-beside me, 24saying, &lsquo;Do┘not└fear, Paul; it-is-necessary to-stand-before Caesar, and behold, [the] God has-granted to-yousg all the rest with youpl.&rsquo; 25Wherefore, take-courage, men, for I-believe [the] God that thus it-will-be according-to which way he-has-spoken to-you. 26But it-is-necessary for-us to-run-aground on (an) island.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And when (the) fourteenth night came, we being-driven-back-and-forth in the Adriatic, about (the) middle of-the night the sailors were-suspecting some land to-be-coming-near to-them. 28And having-taken-soundings, they-found 20 fathoms; and in-a-little-while having-gone-on and again, having-taken-soundings, (they found) fifteen fathoms. 29And fearing lest we-should-fall somewhere according-to rough places, having-cast anchors, they-were-praying-for day to-come. 30And the sailors trying/seeking to-flee from the ship and having-lowered the dinghy/skiff into the sea in-pretext as-if intending to-lay-out anchors from (the) bow, 31[the] Paul said to-the centurion and the soldiers, &ldquo;If these do┘not└remain in the boar, you are┘not└able to-be-saved.&rdquo; 32Then the soldiers cut-off the ropes of-the dinghy/skiff and let them fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And when2 day was-about to-come, [the] Paul urged all to-share-in food, saying, &ldquo;Today (is the) fourteenth day waiting you-are-continuing having-received nothing. 34Wherefore I-urge you to-share-in good, for this is to [the] your safety/salvation, for (a) hair from the head of-nobody will-perish.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And having-said these-things and having-received bread, he-thanked [the] God before all; and having-broken (a loaf), he-began to-eat. 36And all having-become encouraged, they also received food. 37And all we [the] souls on the ship were 276. 38And having-eaten-enough, they-began-to-lighten the ship, throwing-out the grain/wheat into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Now when day came, they-were┘not└recognizing the land; but they-came-to-notice (a) bay having (a) shore/beach into which they-were-counseling/considering whether they-might-be-able to-save the boat. 40And having-cut-away the anchors, they-left (them) in the sea, at-the-same-time loosening the ropes of-the rudders and raising the foresails to-the blowing-of-the-wind, they-were-heading toward the beach. 41But having-encountered/fallen into (a) two-currents place, they-ran┘the ship└aground, and the bow, having-stuck-fast, remain-unmovable, and the stern-of-the-boat was-being-destroyed by the force [of-the waves]ms. 42And (the) counsel of-the soldiers came-to-be-that they-should-kill the prisoners lest anybody, swimming-away, should-escape. 43But the centurion, wanting to-bring┘Paul└safe-through, prevented them of-the plan, and commanded the-ones able to-swim, having-jumped-overboard first, to-get to [the] land; 44and the rest—some on planks, and others on some things [the] from the ship—and thus it-happened all were-brought safely-through on [the] land.</span></p>
