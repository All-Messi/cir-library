Wherefore I-beg-of-you to-hear me patiently. 4So all the Jews know [the] my manner-of-life from (my) youth [the] spent from (the) beginning in [the] my nation and in Jerusalem, 5knowing-beforehand for-a-long-time, if they-are-willing to-testify, that according-to the strictest sect of-[the] our religion, I-lived (as a) Pharisee. 6And now over the hope of-the promise of-the fathers of-us, becoming/having-happened by [the] God, I-stand, being-judged, 7unto which the twelve-tribe (group) of-us hopes to-attain, serving night and day in earnestness, concerning which hope I-am-being-accused, King. 8Why is-it unbelievable with you whether [the] God raises (the) dead? 9I then supposed it-to-be-necessary for-myself to-practice many-things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene, 10and this-thing I-did in Jerusalem and both many of-the saints I locked-up in prison, having-received [the] authority from the high-priests and, they being-condemned-to-death, I-cast┘(my) lot└against (them). 11And according-to all the synagogues many-times, having (them) punished, I-tried-to-make them blaspheme, and being┘all-the-more insanely└furious with-them, I-would-persecute (them) even unto [the] foreign cities. 12&amp;quot;In which-things traveling to[the] Damascus with authority and commission [the] of-the high-priests, 13during-(the)-middle of-day along the road, I-saw, King, from-(the)-sky above the brightness of-the sun (a) light shining-around me and the-ones traveling with me. 14We all having-fallen-down onto the ground, I-heard (a) voice speaking to me in-the Hebrew dialect, &amp;lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are-you-persecuting me? (It is) hard for-you to-kick at (the) goad.&amp;rsquo; 15And I said, &amp;lsquo;Who are-you, Sir?&amp;rsquo; And the Lord said, &amp;lsquo;I am Jesus whom you are-persecuting. 16But stand-up and stand on the feet of-you. For to this I-appeared to-you: to-hand-pick you (as a) minister and witness of-the-things both you-saw and of-the-things I-will-show you, 17deliverinig you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am-sending you, 18to-open (the) eyes of-them, to┘[the]└turn (them) from darkness into light and (from) the power of-[the] Satan to [the] God, and (an) inheritance in the-ones sanctified by-faith [the] in me.&amp;rsquo; 19&amp;quot;Whence, King Agrippa, I-did┘not└prove-disobedient to-the heavenly vision, 20but both to-the-ones in Damascus first and Jerusalem and all the country of-[the] Judaea and the Gentiles I-kept-declaring to-repent and turn to [the] God, practicing works/deeds worthy of-[the] repentance. 21On-account-of these-things Jews, seizing me [being]ms in the temple, were-attempting to-kill-me-by-hand. 22So having-obtained help [the] from [the] God until [the] this day, I-stand testifying to-smallsg and greatsg, and saying nothing except what-things the prophets and Moses said would be, 23whether the Messiah, subject-to-suffering, whether first by/from (the) resurrection of-(the)-dead would proclaim light both to-the people and to-the Gentiles.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
