And they-people-came to-see what is/was the-thing occurred. 15And they-come to [the] Jesus and they-see the-one being-demon-possessed sitting clothed and being-in-his-right-mind, the-one having-had the legion, and they-were-afraid. 16And the-ones having-seen related to-them how it-happened to-the-one being-demon-possessed and about the pigs. 17And they-began to-appealed-to him to-go-away from the regions of-them. 18And he getting into the boat, the-one being-demon-possessed began-to-appeal-to him in-order-that he-might-be with him. 19And he-did┘not└let him, but says to-him, &ldquo;Go to the house of-you, to [the] your (people), and report to-them as-many-things-as the Lord has-done for-you and was-merciful-to you.&rdquo; 20And he-went-away and began to-preach in the Decapolis as-many-things-as [the] Jesus did for-him, and all were-being-amazed.</span></p>
