<p><span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the Passover and [the] (Feast of) Unleavened-(Bread) was after two days, and the chief-priests and the scribes were-trying how, having-arrested him by stealth, they-might-put┘(him)└to-death. 2For they-were-saying, &ldquo;Not during the feast lest-at-any-time (a) riot will-be among the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he being in Bethany in the house of-Simon the leper, he-reclining, (a) woman came having (an) alabaster-vial of-expensive, pure nard, (and) she-began-to-pour-(it)-on the head of-him. 4And some were being-indignant with each-other, &ldquo;Unto what has┘[the] this waste└happened? 5For this [the] ointment was-able to-be-sold for-over three hundred denarii and given to-the poor.&rdquo; And they-started-scolding her.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;Let┘her└alone; why are-you-giving her trouble? She-worked (a) good work on me. 7For you always have the poor with you; and whenever you-want, you-are-able to-do well for-them, but you-do┘not always└have me. 8She-did what she-could. She-anointed the body of-me ahead-of-time for [the] entombment. 9And truly I-tell you, wherever2 the gospel is-preached in the whole world, what she-did shall be-told as (a) memorial of-her.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And Judas Iscariot, [the] one of-the twelve, went-away to the high-priests in-order-that he-might-deliver him to-them. 11And the/they, having-heard, rejoiced and promised to-give him silver, and be-began-trying how he-might-deliver him at-a-good-time.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And on-the first day of-the Unleavened-(Bread), when the Passover was-being-sacrificed, the disciples of-him say to-him, &ldquo;Where do-you-want, having-gone-away, us-to-prepare in-order-that we-may-eat the Passover?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-sent two of-the disciples of-him and says to-them, &ldquo;Go into the city and (a) man will-meet you carrying (a) pot of-water. Follow him, 14and wherever2 he-enters, say to-the master-of-the-house that, &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;Where is the upper-room of-me where I-may-eat the Passover with the disciples of me?&rdquo;&rsquo; 15And he will-show you (a) large upper-room, furnished, ready. And there prepare for-us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the disciples went-out and they-came into the city and they-found even-as he-said to-them, and they-prepared the Passover. 17And evening having-come, he-arrives with the twelve.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And they reclining and eating, [the] Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly I-say to-you that one out-of you will-betray me, the-one eating with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They-began to-be-grieved and to-say to-them one by one, &ldquo;(It is) not┘me, └is-it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the/he said to-them, &ldquo;One of-the twelve, the-one dipping with me in the bowl. 21Because the Son of-[the]Man goes even-as it-is-written concerning him, but woe to-[the] that man through whom the son of-[the] Man is-destroyed. (It would have been) good for-him if [the] that man had┘not└been-born.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And they eating, having-taken (a) loaf, having-blessed (it), he-broke (it) and gave (it) to-them and said, &ldquo;Take, this is the body of-me.&rdquo; 23And having-taken (a) cup, having-given-thanks, he-gave (it) to-them, and they┘all└drank from it. 24And he-said to-them, &ldquo;This is the blood of-me, (the blood) of-the covenant [the] poured-out on-behalf-of all. 25Truly I-say to-you that I-will┘certainly not no-longer/any-longer└be-drinking of-the fruit of-the vine until [the] that day when I-drink it new in the kingdom of-[the] God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And having-sung-a-hymn, they-went-out to the Mount of-[the] Olives.</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-them [that], &ldquo;You┘all└will-be-offended because it-is-written,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But after [the] my being-raised, I-will-go-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And [the] Peter said to-him, &ldquo;Even if all will-be-offended, [but] I (will) not.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-him, &ldquo;Truly I-say to-you that you today, this [the] night, before (a) rooster double crows/crows twice, you-will-deny me three-times.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> But the/he kept-saying insistently, &ldquo;If it-is-necessary for-me to-die-with you, I-will┘certainly not└deny you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And they-are-going into (a) parcel-of-land the name of-which (is) Gethsemane, and he-says to-the disciples of-him, &ldquo;Sit here while I-pray.&rdquo; 33And he-takes-along [the] Peter and [the]ms James and [the]ms John with him, and he-began to-be-completely-distressed and to-be-anxious, 34and he-says to-them, &ldquo;The soul of-me is deeply-grieved to death. Stay here and keep-watch.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And having-gone-forward a-little, he-fell on the ground and began-to-pray in-order-that, if possible, the hour might-go-past from him. 36And he-was-saying, &ldquo;Abba [the] Father, all-things (are) possible for-you. Take [the] this cup from me, but not what I want but what you (want).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And he-comes and finds them sleeping, and he-says to-[the] Peter, &ldquo;Simon, are-you sleeping? Were-you┘not└able to-keep-watch for-one hour? 38Watch and pray, in-order-that you┘not└come into temptation; the spirit (is) willing, but the flesh (is) weak.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And again, going-away, he-prayed, saying the same word. 40And again coming, he-found them sleeping, for the eyes of-them were weighed-down, and they-did┘not└know what they-might-answer him. 41And he-comes the/a third (time) and says to-them, &ldquo;Keep-sleeping the/a little (while) and rest.&rdquo; &ldquo;It-is enough. The hour came; behold, the Son of-Man is-being-betrayed into the hands of-[the] sinners. 42Get-up; let-us-go. Behold, the-one betraying me came-near.&quot;</span></p>
