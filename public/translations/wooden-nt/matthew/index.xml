      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;matthew-chapter-5&#34;&gt;Matthew Chapter 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; And having-seen the crowds, he-went-up one the/a mountain; and he having-sat-down, the disciples of-him came-to him. 2And having-opened the mouth of-him, he-began-to-teach them saying, 11&amp;quot;Blessed are-you when they-insult you and persecute (you) and say all evil against youpl [falsely]ms for-the-sake-of me. 12Rejoice and be-glad, because the reward of-you is much in [the] heaven[s]. For thus they-persecuted the prophets [the] before you. 13&amp;quot;You are the salt of-the earth; but if [the] salt loses the/its saltiness, by-what will-it-be-made salty? It-is-strong for nothing yet except2 having-been-thrown outside to-be-trampled by [the] men. 14You are the light of-the world. A city set on (a) hill is┘not└able to-be-hid. 15Neither do-they-light (a) lamp and put it under the/a bucket but on the/a lampstand, and it gives-light to-all the-ones in the house. 16Let┘the light of-you└shine in-such-a-way before [the] men [in-order]-that they-may-see the good works of-you, and they-may-glorify the Father of-you [the] in [the] heaven[s]. 17&amp;quot;Do┘not└think that I-came to-destroy the Law or the prophets. I-did┘not└come to-destroy (them), but to-fulfill (them). 18For truly I-tell you, until2 the sky and the earth pass-away, one-iota or one serif will┘not└pass-away from the Law until2 all things come-to-be. 19So whoever destroys one of-[the] these [the] least commandments and teaches [the] men so, will-be-called least in the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]. But whoever2 does and teaches (them)—this-one will-be-called great in the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]. 20For I-say to-you that unless2 the righteousness of-you exceeds more than the scribes and Pharisees, you-will┘not└enter the kingdom of-the heaven[s]. 21&amp;quot;You-heard that it-was-said to-the ancients, &amp;lsquo;You-shall┘not└commit-murder,&amp;rsquo; and whoever commits-murder will-be-liable to-[the] condemnation. 22But I say to-youpl that everyone [the] getting-angry towards-the brother of-him will-be-liable to-[the] condemnation; andwhoever2 says to the brother of-him, &amp;lsquo;Raca,&amp;rsquo; will-be liable to-the Sanhedrin, and whoever2 says, &amp;lsquo;Fool,&amp;rsquo; will-be liable to the Gehenna of-[the] fire. 23So if you-bring the gift of-yousg to the altar and-there remember that the brother of-you has something against you, 24leave there the gift of-you before the altar and go first reconcile to-the brother of-you, and then, having-come, offer the gift of-you. 25Be coming-to-terms-with the opponent of-you quickly while2 you-are with him on the road, lest-at-any-time the/your opponent deliver you to-the judge and the judge (deliver you) to-the officer and he-put (you) in prison. 26Truly I-say to-you, you-will┘not└come-out from-there until2 you-pay the last quadrans. 27&amp;quot;You-heard that it-was said, &amp;lsquo;You-shall┘not└commit adultery.&amp;rsquo; 28But I say to-youpl that everyone [the] looking-at (a) woman unto [the] lusting-after her already committed adultery-with her in-the heart of-him. 29&amp;quot;And if the right [the] eye of-you offends you, pluck┘it└out and throw (it) away-from you, for it-is-better for-you in-order-that one of-the members of-you be-destroyed and not the whole body of-you be-thrown into Gehenna. 30And if the right hand of-you offends you, cut┘it└off and throw (it) away-from you, for it-is-better for-you in-order-that one of-the members of you be-destroyed and not the whole body of-you go-away into Gehenna. 31&amp;quot;And it-was-said, &amp;lsquo;Whoever2 divorces the wife of-him, let-him-give her (a) certificate-of-divorce.&amp;rsquo; 32But I say to-you that everybody [the] divorcing the wife of-him—except of-(the)-matter of-sexual-immorality—treats her to-be-(an) adulteress, and whoever2 marries (a)-divorced-one commits-adultery. 33&amp;quot;Again you-heard that it-was-said to-the ancients, &amp;lsquo;Yousg-shall┘not└swear-falsely,&amp;rsquo; but, &amp;lsquo;you-shall-perform to-the Lord the oaths of-you.&amp;rsquo; 34But I say to-you not to-swear at-all, neither by [the] sky because it-is (the) throne of-[the] God, 35nor by the earth because it-is (the) footstool of-the feet of-him, nor by Jerusalem because it-is (the) city of-the Great King, 36neither shall-you-swearsg by the head of-you, because you-are┘not└able to-make one hair white or black. 37But let┘the word of-youpl└be yes, yes; no, no; but the thing more than-these is of [the] evil/the evil-one. 38&amp;quot;You-heaerd that it-was-said, &amp;lsquo;(An) eye for (an) eye&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;(a) tooth for (a) tooth.&amp;rsquo; 39But I say to-you not to-lash-back-at [the] evil, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek [of-you]ms, turn the other to-him also. 40And to-the-one wanting to-sue you and to-take the tunic/shirt of-you, let┘him also└have the/your cloak. 41And whoever forces you (to go) one mile, go with him two. 42Give to-the-one asking you, and do┘not└turn-away-from the-one wanting to-borrow from you. 43&amp;quot;You-heard that it-was-said, &amp;lsquo;Love the neighbor of-you,&amp;rsquo; and hate the enemy of-you. 44But I say to-you, love the enemies of-you, and pray for the-ones persecuting you, 45in-order-that you-may-become sons of-the father of-you [the] in heaven[s], because he-raises-up the sun of-him on evil-ones and good-ones and rains on just-ones and unjust-ones. 46For if you-love the-ones loving you, what reward do-you-have? Do┘not even [the] tax-collectors└do the same-thing? 47And if you greet the brothers of-you only, what are-you-doing more? Do┘not even [the] Gentiles└do the same-thing? 48So be perfect/mature like the heavenly [the] Father of-you is perfect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And if not, you-do┘not└have (a) reward from the Father of-you in [the] heaven[s]. 2&amp;quot;So when you-do alms, do┘not└blow (a) trumpet in-front-of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets in-order-that they-may-be-glorified by [the] men. Truly I-say to-you, they-have the reward of-them. 3But you doing alms, let┘the left (hand) of-you not└know what the right (hand) of-you is-doing, 4in-order-that the alms of-you may-be in [the] secret, and the Father of-you the-One seeing in [the] secret will-reward you. 5&amp;quot;And when you-praypl, do┘not└be like the hypocrites, because they-love to-pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of-the streets, in-order-that they-may-appear to-[the] men. Truly I-say to-you, they-have the reward of-them. 6And when yousg pray, go into the private-room of-you and having-shut the door of-you, pray to-the Father of-you in [the] secret; and the Father of-you the-One seeing in [the] secret will-reward you. 7And prayingpl, do┘not└babble like the Gentiles; they-suppose that they-will-be-listened-to in [the] much-speaking of-them. 8So do┘not└be-like them, for the Father of-you knows of-what-things you-have need before [the] knows of-what-things you-have need before [the] your asking him. 9Thus therefore you pray:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First take-out the log in the eye of-you, and then you-will-see-clearly to-take-out the piece-of-sawdust from the eye of-the brother of-you. 6&amp;quot;Do┘not└give the holy-thing to-[the] dogs or cast the pearls of-you before [the] pigs, lest-at-any-time they-will-trample them with the feet of-them and, having-turned, they-attach you. 7&amp;quot;Ask and you-will-receive, seek and you-will-find, knock and it-will-be-opened to-you. 8For every one asking receive and the-one seeking finds and to-the-one knocking it-will-be-opened. 9Or, what man of you, whom the son of-him will-ask-for (a) loaf, he-will┘not┘┘└give him (a) stone, └└will-he? 10Or also, (if) he-will-ask-for (a) fish, he-will┘not┘┘└give him (a) snake, └└will-he? 11If then you, being evil, know to-give good gifts to-the children of-you, more by-much the Father of-you [the] in [the] heaven[s] will-give good-things to-the ones asking him. 12So all-things as-many-as-ever2 you-want [in-order]-that [the] men may-do to/for-you, thus you do also to-for them, for this is the Law and the prophets. 13Go-in through the narrow gate, because the gate (is) wide and the way (is) wide leading to [the] destruction, and many are the-ones going-in through it, 14because the gate (is) narrow and the road [the] leading to [the] life (is) restricted, and few are the-ones finding it. 15&amp;quot;Beware of [the] false-prophets, who come to-you in clothing of-sheep, but inwardly they-are savage wolves. 16By the fruits of-them you-will-know them. They-do┘not┘┘└gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, └└do-they? 17Thus every good tree bears good fruit[s], and (a) worthless tree bears bad fruit[s]. 18(A) good tree is┘not└able to-bear bad fruit[s], neither (does) (a) worthless tree (bear) good fruit. 19Every tree not bearing good fruit is-cut-down and is-thrown in the fire. 20So by/from the fruits of-them you-will-know them. 21&amp;quot;Not every one saying to-me, &amp;lsquo;Lord, Lord,&amp;rsquo; will-enter into the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s], but the-one doing the will of the Father of-me [the] in [the] heaven[s]. 22Many will-say to-me in that [the] day, &amp;lsquo;Lord, Lord, did-we┘not└prophesy in-[the] your name, and in-[the] your name cast-out demons, and in-[the] your name do many miracles?&amp;rsquo; 23And then I-will-confess to-them [that], &amp;lsquo;I┘never└knew you. Go-away from me, [the]-ones working [the] lawlessness.&amp;rsquo; 24&amp;quot;So everyone who hears [the] these words of-me and does them will-be-likened to-(a)-wise man who built the house of-him on [the] bedrock. 25And [the] rain fell and the/a flood[s] came and the wind[s] blew and best-against [the] that house, and it-did┘not└fall, for it-was-built on [the] bedrock. 26And every one hearing [the] these words of-me and not doing them will-be-likened to-(a)-foolish man who built the house of-him on [the] sand. 27And [the] rain fell and the/a flood[s] came and the wind[s] blew and beat-against [the] that house, and it-fell, and the fall of-it (was) great.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You-received freely; give freely. 9Do┘not└get gold or silver or copper for the money-belts of-you, 10no knap-stack for (the) road, neither two cloaks, neither shoes, neither (a) rod; for the worker (is) worthy of-the food of-him. 11And into whatever2 town or village you-enter, find-out who in it is worthy, and┘stay└there until2 you-leave;  12and entering into the house, greet it. 13And if the house (is) worthy, let┘the peace of-you└go onto it; and if it-is not worthy, let┘the peace of-you└return to you. 14And whoever2 does┘not└receive you nor listen-to the words of-you, going outside the house or[the] that town, wipe-off the dust of-the feet of-you. 15Truly I-say to-you, it-will-be more-bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah in (the) day of-judgment than for-[the] that town. 15&amp;quot;Behold, I-am-sending you like sheep in (the) midst of-wolves. So be wise as [the] snakes and harmless as [the] doves. 17And beware of [the] men. For they-will-deliver you to (the) courts, and they-will-scourge you in the synagogues of-them. 18And also you-will-be-led to governors and kings for-the-sake-of me for (a) witness to-them and to the Gentiles. 19And when they-deliver you, do┘not└worry how or what you-will-say, for it-will-be-given to-you in that [the] hour what you-shall-say. 20For you are not the-ones speaking, but the Spirit of-the Father of-you [the] speaking in you. 21And brother will-deliver-up brother to death and father (will deliver up) son, and children will-rise-up against parents and they-will-have┘them└put-to-death. 22And you-will-be hated by all on-account-of the name of-me. 23And when they-persecute you in [the] this city, flee into the other, for truly I-say to-you, you-will┘certainly not└finish the towns of-[the] Israel until2 the Son of-[the] Man comes. 24&amp;rdquo;(A) disciple is┘not└above the/his teacher, neither (is) (a) servant above the lord of-him. 25(It is) sufficient for-(a)-disciple [in-order]-that he-may-be as the teacher of-him and the servant (to be) as the lord of-him. If-they-called the master-of-the house Beelzebub, more by-much the household-members of-him! 26&amp;quot;So do┘not└be-afraid-of them, for nothing is covered that will be-revealed, and hidden that will-be-made known. 27What I-say to-you in the cark speak in the daylight, and what you-hear in the ear preach on the housetops. 28And do┘not└be-afraid of the-ones killing the body, not being-able to-kill the soul. But fear instead the-One able to-destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. 29Are┘not└two sparrows sold for-(an)-assarion? And one of them does┘not└fall on the ground without the Father of-you. 30And even the hairs of-the head are all numbered. 31So do┘not└fear. You are-worth many sparrows. 32&amp;quot;So everybody who confesses [in] me before [the] men, I┘also└will-confess [in him] before the Father of-me [the] in [the]ms heaven[s]. 33And whoever2 denies me before [the] men, I-will┘also└deny [him] before the Father of-me [the] in [the] heaven[s]. 34&amp;quot;Do┘not└think that I-came to-put peace on the earth. I-did┘not└come to-put peace, but (a) sword. 35For I-came to-divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[14]ms 15&amp;quot;Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-go-around [the] sea and [the] land to-make one proselyte, and when he-becomes (one), you-make him twice-more (the) son of-Gehenna than yourselves.&amp;rdquo; 16&amp;quot;Woe to-you, blind guides the-ones saying, &amp;lsquo;Whoever2 swears by the sanctuary it-is nothing, but whoever2 swears by the gold of-the sanctuary, he-is-under-obligation.&amp;rsquo; 17Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple [the] having-sanctified the gold? 18And &amp;lsquo;whoever2 swears by the altar, it-is nothing, but whoever2 swears by the gift [the] on it, he-is-under-obligation.&amp;rsquo; 19Blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar [the] sanctifying the gift? 20Therefore the-one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all-things [the] on it. 21And the-one having-sworn by the sanctuary swears by it and by the-One dwelling-in it, 22and the-one having-sworn by [the] heaven swears by the throne of-[the] God and by the-one sitting on it. 23&amp;quot;Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

And it-was-necessary to-do these-things and┘not to-neglect└those. 24Blind guides! The-ones straining-out the gnat and swallowing the camel! 25&amp;quot;Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-clean the outside of-the cup and the plate, but inside they-are-full of greed and self-indulgence. 26Foolish Pharisees! Cleanse first the inside of-the cup in-order-that the outside may┘also└become clean. 27&amp;quot;Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-are-like whitewashed tombs, which outside appear attractive, but inside they-are-full of (the) bones of-dead-(men) and all uncleanness. 28Thus also you outside appear to-[the] men righteous, but inside you-are full of-hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29&amp;quot;Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-build the tombs of-the prophets and decorate the graves of-the righteous; 30and you-say, &amp;lsquo;If we-were in the days of-the fathers of-us, we-would┘not└have-been fellows in the blood of-the prophets.&amp;rsquo; 31So-that you-testify to-yourselves that you-are sons of-the-ones having-murdered the prophets. 32And you fill-up the measure of-the fathers of-you. 33Snakes! Nests of-vipers! How will you-escape from the condemnation of-[the] Gehenna? 34On-account-of this, behold, I send to you prophets and wise-ones and scribes. Some-of them you-will-kill and you-will-crucify, and some-of them you-will-scourge in the synagogues of-you and persecute from city to city, 35in-order-that may-come on you all righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of-Abel the righteous to the blood of-Zechariah, son of-Berechiah, whom you-murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 36Truly I-say to-you, all these-things will-come on [the] this generation. 37&amp;quot;Jerusalem! Jerusalem! The-one murdering the prophets and stoning the-ones sent to it. How-many-times did-I-want to-gather the children of-you which way/like (a) hen gathers the chicks of-her under the/her wings, and you-did┘not└want-(to). 38Behold, the house of-you is-left to-you desolate. 39For I-say to-you, you-will┘certainly not└see me from now till you-say, &amp;lsquo;Blessed (is) the-One coming in (the) name of–(the)-Lord.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to-see the grave. 2And behold (a) great earthquake happened, for (an) angel of (the) Lord, having-descended from heaven and having-come-to (it), rolled┘the stone└away and sat-down on it. 3And the sight of-him was like lightning and the garment of-him (was) white like snow. 4And from the fear of-him, the-ones keeping watch shook and became like dead-(men). 5And the angel, having-answered said to the women, &amp;ldquo;Do┘not you└be-afraid, for I-know that you-are-seeking Jesus the-One crucified. 6He-is not here, for he-arose even-as he-said. Come, see the place where he-was-lying. 7And quickly having-gone, say to-the disciples of-him [that], &amp;lsquo;He-arose from the dead-(ones), and behold, he-goes-ahead-of you into the Galilee. You-will-see him there.&amp;rsquo; Behold, I-told you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
