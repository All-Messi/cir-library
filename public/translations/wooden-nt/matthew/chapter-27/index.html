<p><span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The Judas the traitor, having-seen that he-was-condemned, having-regretted, returned the thirty [the] silver[s]-shekels to-the chief-priests and elders, 4saying, &ldquo;I-sinned, having-betrayed innocent blood.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-thrown the silver-shekels into the sanctuary, he-departed; and having-gone-away, he-hanged himself. 6And the chief-priests, having taken the silver-shekels, said, &ldquo;It-is┘not└lawful to-put them in the Treasury, because it-is (the) price of-blood.&rdquo; 7And having-taken counsel, they-bought from them the field of-the potter as (a) grave for-[the] foreigners. 8Wherefore [the] that field was-called Field of-Blood unto the today. 9Then the-thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was-fulfilled, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And [the] Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, &ldquo;Are you the king of-the Jews?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And he sitting on the judgment-seat, the wife of-him sent to him, saying, &ldquo;Nothing to-you and [the] that righteous-(man), for I-suffered many-things today in (a) dream/by dream because-of him.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And the/he said, &ldquo;For what evil-thing did-he-do?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And [the] Pilate, having-seen that he-was-availing nothing, but rather (that) (a) riot is/was-becoming, having-taken water, he-washed the/his hands in-front-of the crowd, saying, &ldquo;I-am-innocent of the blood of-the-one. You see-to-it.&quot;</span></p>

Then [the] Pilate commanded (it) to-be-turned-over (to him). 59And having-taken the body, [the] Joseph wrapped it in (a) clean linen-cloth, 60and put it in the new tomb of-him, which was-hewn in the bedrock; and having-rolled┘(a) large stone└to-the door of-the tomb, he-left. 61And Mary the Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting across-from the grave. 62And on-the next-day, which is after [the] Preparation, the chief-priests and the Pharisees gather to Pilate, 63saying, &ldquo;Lord, we-remember that that [the] deceiver said, still living, &lsquo;After three days I-am-resurrecting.&rsquo; 64So command the grave to-be-made-safe until the third day, lest, having-come, the disciples of-him steal him and say to-the people, &lsquo;He-was-resurrected from the dead,&rsquo; and the last deception will-be worse than-the first.&rdquo; 65[The] Pilate said to-them, &ldquo;You-have (a) guard.
