For by whom you-judge the other person, you-condemn yourself, for you┘the-one judging└practice the same things. 2Now we-know that the judgment of-[the] God is according-to truth against the-ones doing [the] such-things. 3Now do-you-suppose this, O man the-one judging the-ones practicing [the] such-things and doing them, that you will-escape the judgment of-[the] God? 4Or do-you-disregard the wealth of-the kindness of-him and [the] forbearance and [the] patience, not-knowing that the kindness of-[the] God is-leading you to-repentance? 5But on-account-of the stubbornness and unrepentant heart of-you, you-are-storing-up for-yourself wrath in the day of-wrath and (the) revelation of-[the] righteous-judgment of-[the] God, 6who will-pay-back to-each according-to the works of-him—7to-the-ones seeking according-to (the) perseverance of-good work, glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; 8but to-the-ones of selfish-ambition and disobeying the truth, but following-after [the] injustice, wrath and anger. 9(There will be) trouble and distress on every soul of-man the-one working [the] evil, both of-(the) Jew first and also of-(the) Greek, 10but glory and honor and peace to-every-one [the] working [the] good, both Jew first and Greek. 11For respect-of-person is not with [the] God. 12For as-many-as sinned without-(the)-Law, will┘also└perish with-(the)-Law; and as-many-as sinned under (the) Law, will-be-condemned by (the) Law. 13For not the hearers of-(the)-Law are righteous with [the] God, but the doers of-(the)-Law will-be-made-righteous. 14For when Gentiles the-ones not having the Law do by nature the-things of-the law, these, not having he Law, are (a) law for-themselves, 15who show the work of-the Law written on the hearts of-them, (the) conscience of-them testifying-with (them) and (the/their) [the] thoughts accusing or else defending between one-another 16in the day when [the] God judges by Christ Jesus the hidden-things of-[the] men according-to the gospel of-me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For, first-of-all, (that) they-were-entrusted-with the oracles of-[the] God. 3For what? If some disbelieved, the disbelief of-them will┘not┘┘└cancel-out the faithfulness of-[the] God, └└will it? 4May-it┘not└be!

[The] God the-one inflicting [the] wrath (is) not┘unjust└is he? (I am talking according-to (a) man.) 6May-it┘not└be! Because how will┘[the] God└judge the world? 7But if the truth of-[the] God abounded to the glory of-him in [the] my lie, why am-I┘still also└judged as (a) sinner? 8And (why) not (say), even-as we-are-slandered and even-as some say we say [that], &amp;ldquo;Let-us-do [the] evil-things in-order-that [the] good-things may-come&amp;rdquo;?—the condemnation of-whom is just.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Let-us-remain-in [the] sin in-order-that [the] grace may increase? 2May-it┘not└be! Whoever-of us died to-[the] sin—how will-we┘still└live in it? 3Or do you┘not└know that as-many┘of-us┘┘└as └└were-baptized into Christ Jesus were-baptized into the death of-him? 4So we-were-buried-with him by [the] baptism into [the] death in-order-that as Christ was-raised from (the) dead by the glory of-the Father, so also we might-walk in the newness of-life. 5For if we-have-become united-with the likeness of-the death of-him, certainly we-will-be also (in the likeness) of-the resurrection (of him); 6knowing this: that the old man/self of-us was-crucified-with (him), in-order-that the body of-[the] sin might-be-destroyed, [the] our no-longer serving [the] sin. 7For the-one having-died has-been-justified from [the] sin. 8And if we-died with Christ, we-believe/trust that we will┘also└live-with him, 9knowing that Christ, having-been-raised from (the) dead does┘not└die anymore—death no-longer is-lord-of him. 10For what he-died, he-died to-[the] sin once; and what he-lives, he-lives to-[the] God. 11So also we consider ourselves [to be]ms dead with-respect-to [the] sin, but living to-[the] God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if the/a husband dies, she-is-released from the law of-the husband. 3So then, the husband living, she-will-be called (an) adulteress if she-becomes to-another man. But if the/a husband dies, she-is-free from the law, unto her not being (an) adulteress, having-become to-another man; 4so-that, my brothers, you also were-put-to-death with-respect-to-the Law through the body of-[the] Christ, unto [the] your becoming to-another, to-the-one having-been-raised from (the) dead in-order-that we-might-bear-fruit to-[the] God. 5For when we-were in the flesh, the passions/lusts of-[the] sins that (were) through the Law were-at-work in the members of-us unto [the] bearing-fruit to-[the] death. 6But now we-were-released from the Law, having-died in that-to-which we-were-held-fast with-the-result-that us to-be-serving in (the) newness of-(the)-spirit, and not (in the) oldness of-(the)-letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if somebody does┘not└have (the) spirit of-Christ, this-one is not of-him. 10But if Christ (is) in you, the body (is) dead on-account-of sin, but the spirit (is) life on-account-of righteousness. 11But if the Spirit of-the-One having-resurrected Jesus from (the) dead dwells in youpl, the-One having-resurrected Christ from (the) dead will┘also└give-life-to the mortal bodies of-you through the Spirit of-him dwelling in youpl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do┘not└be wise toward yourselves. 17Do┘not└repay evil for evil; have-in-mind-to-do good-things in-front-of all men. 18If possible with-respect-to the-thing of you, be-at-peace with all men. 19Do┘not└avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to-[the] wrath, for it-has-been-written,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;romans-chapter-13&#34;&gt;Romans Chapter 13&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Let┘every person└submit to-higher authorities, for there-is not (an) authority except2 by God. And the-ones existing have-been established by God. 2So the-one resisting the authority has-resisted the ordained-thing of-[the] God, and the-ones having-resisted will-receive condemnation for-themselves. 3For [the] rulers are not (a) fear to [the/a] good work but to [the/a] evil. Now you-want not to—be-afraid-of the authority? Do the good-thing, and you-will-have praise from it. 4For he-is (a) helper of-God to-you for [the] good. But if you-do the evil-thing, be afraid; for he-does┘not└bear the sword in-vain. For he-is (a) minister/helper of-God, (an) avenger for wrath to-the-one doing the evil-thing. 5Wherefore (it is a) necessity to-submit, not only on-account-of [the] wrath, but also on-account-of [the] conscience. 6For on-account-of this also you-pay taxes. For they-are ministers/helpers of God, devoting-themselves-to this very-thing. 7Pay to-all their/the dues, [the] tribute to-whom [the] tribute, [the] tax to-whom [the] tax, [the] respect to-whom [the] respect, [the] honor to-whom [the] honor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To his-own Lord he-stands or falls. And he-will-stand, for the Lord is-able to-make┘him└stand. 5For one regards day above day, and another regards every day. Let┘each└be-fully-convinced in [the] his-own mind. 6The-one regarding the day observes (it) to-(the)-Lord. And the-one eating eats to-(the)-Lord, for he-thanks [the] God; and the-one not eating does not eat to-(the)-Lord and thanks [the] God. 7For nobody of-us lives to-himself, and nobody dies to-himself. 8For if we-live, we-live to-the Lord; and if we-die, we-die to-the Lord. So both if we-live and if we-die, we-are of-the Lord. 9For to this Christ died and lived, in-order-that he-might-be-Lord of (the) dead and (the) living. 10And why do┘ yousg └criticize the brother of-you? Or also why do┘you└look-down-on the brother of-you? For we┘all└will-stand before the judgment-seat of-[the] God, 11for it-has-been-written,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
