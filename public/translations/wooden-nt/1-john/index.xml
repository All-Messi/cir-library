      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-john-chapter-2&#34;&gt;1 John Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; My little-children, I-am-writing these-things to-you in-order-that you-may┘not└keep-sinning.  And if anybody does-sin, we-have (an) Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.  2And he┘himself└is (the) propitiation for the sins of-us, and not only for [the] our (sins), but also for the whole world.  3And in this we-know that we-have-known him:  if we-are-keeping the commandments of-him.  4The-one saying [that], &amp;ldquo;I-have-known him,&amp;rdquo; and is┘not└keeping the commandments of-him, is (a) liar, and in this-one the truth is not.  5And whoever2 keeps the word of-him—truly in this-one the love of-[the] God has-been-completed/perfected.  By this we-know that we-are in him.  6The-one saying to-reside in him—he himself ought to-walk thus, even-as that-One walked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-john-chapter-3&#34;&gt;1 John Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; You-know what-kind-of love the Father has-given to-us in-order-that we-may-be-called children of-God, and we-are.  On-account-of this, the world does┘not└know us because it-did┘not└know him.  2Beloved, now we-are children of-God, and not-yet did-it-appear what we-will-be.  We-know that if he-appears, we-will-be like him, because we-will-see him even-as he-is.  3And every the-one having [the] this truth on him purifies himself even-as that-One is pure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Every the-one doing [the] sin also does [the] lawlessness—and [the] sin is [the] lawlessness.  5And you-know that that-One was-manifested in-order-that he-might-take-away [the] sins, and sin is not in him.  6Every the-one remaining in him does┘not└practice-sinning.  Every the-one practicing-sin has┘not└seen him neither has-known him.  7Little-children, let┘nobody└deceive you.  The-one doing [the] righteousness is righteous, even-as that-One is righteous.  8The-one doing [the] sin is of the devil, because from (the) beginning the devil sins.  Unto this the Son of-[the] God was-manifested in-order-that he-might-destroy the works of-the devil.  9Every the-one having-been-begotten by-[the] God does┘not└do sin, because (the) seed of-him remains in him, and he-is┘not└able to-sin because he-has-been-begotten by [the] God.  10In this the children of-[the] God are manifest and the children of-the devil.  Every the-one not doing righteousness is not from [the] God, and the-one not loving the brother of-him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-john-chapter-4&#34;&gt;1 John Chapter 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Beloved, do┘not└believe every spirit, but test the spirits if/whether they-are from [the] God, because many false-prophets have-gone-out into the world.  2By this you-know the Spirit of-[the] God:  every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has-come in (the) flesh is from [the] God.  3And every spirit that does┘not└confess [the] Jesus is not of/from [the] God.  And this is the (spirit) of-the antichrist that you-have-heard that he-is-coming, and now is already in the world.  4You are of/from [the] God, little-children; and you-have-overcome them, because greater is the-One in you than the-One in the world.  5They are of/from the world; because-of this they-speak of/from the world, and the world listens-to them.  6We are of/from [the] God.  The-one knowing [the] God listens-to us.  Who is not of/from [the] God, does┘not└listen-to us.  By this we-know the Spirit of-[the] truth and the spirit of-[the deception.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-john-chapter-5&#34;&gt;1 John Chapter 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Every the-one believing that Jesus is the Christ has-been-begotten by [the] God, and every the-one loving the-One having-begotten loves also the-One having-been-begotten by him.  2By this we-know that we-love the children of-[the] God:  when we-love [the] God and do the commandments of-him.  3For this is the love of-[the] God:  [in-order]-that we-keep the commandments of-him, and the commandments of-him are not heavy/hard.  4Because every the-one having-been-begotten by [the] God overcomes the world, and this is the victory [the] having-overcome the world:  the faith of-us.  5And who is the-one overcoming the world unless2 the-one believing that Jesus is the Son of-[the] God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
