Grace, mercy, (and) peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Lord of-us. Even-a&#x9;3As I-urged you to-remain in Ephesus, going into Macedonia, in-order-that you-may-instruct certain-ones not to-teach-strange-doctrine, 4nor to-pay-attention to-myths and endless genealogies, which bring-about speculation[s] rather than (the) economy of-God [the] in faith.  5But the goal of-[the] instruction is love out-of (a) pure heart and (a) good conscience and (a) sincere faith, 6which some, having-lost-their-way, turned-away-from into empty-talk, 7desiring to-be teachers-of-the-Law, not understanding either what-things they-say-or about what-things they-confidently-assert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Teach and encourage these-things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;verse&#34; id=&#34;v3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;verse-num&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; If anybody teaches-otherwise and does┘not└agree-with sound words [the] of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ and the teaching according-to godliness, 4he-has-become-conceited, understanding nothing, but having-(an)-unhealthy-desire about questions and quarrels-about-words, out-of which arises jealousy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, 5constant-arguings of-men depraved with-respect-to the mind and having-been-deprived of-the truth, supposing [the] godliness to-be (a) means-of-gain.  6But [the] godliness with contentment is (a) great means-of-gain.  7For we-have-brought nothing into the world; because neither are-we-able to-take┘anything└out.  8But having-food and shelter[s]/covering[s], we-will-be-content with-these.  9But the-ones wanting to-be rich fall into temptation and (a) snare/trap and many ignorant/foolish and harmful desires that sink/plunge [the] men into ruin and destruction.  10For the love-of-money is (the) root of-all [the] evil-things, longing-for which some were-deceived/wandered-away from the faith and impaled themselves through with-many pains/sorrows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
