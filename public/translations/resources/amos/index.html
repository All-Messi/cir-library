<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1The Message of Amos, Shepherd from Tekoa, That He Saw About Israel</p>
<p>at the Time of Uzziah, King of Judah, and Jeroboam Ben-Joash, King of Israel,</p>
<p>Two Years Before the Earthquake</p>
<p>2He said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh will roar from Zion;</p>
<p>he’ll thunder from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The shepherds’ pastures will dry up;</p>
<p>the grass on Carmel’s summit will wither away.”</p>
<p>God’s Judgment on Israel’s Neighbors</p>
<p>3Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Damascus and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:e said, He said</p>
<p>they threshed the people of Gilead</p>
<p>with sledges that had iron teeth.</p>
<p>4So I’ll send down fire on the house of Hazael,</p>
<p>consume the fortresses of Benhadad,</p>
<p>5break the bars on the gates of Damascus,</p>
<p>eliminate the people in the Valley of Aven</p>
<p>and the one that holds the scepter from Beth-eden.</p>
<p>The people of Syria will go to Kir in exile.” 		Amos 1:1-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Gaza and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they deported an entire population to Edom.</p>
<p>7So I’ll send down fire on the walls of Gaza</p>
<p>and consume its fortresses.</p>
<p>8I’ll eliminate the people from Ashdod</p>
<p>and the one that holds the scepter in Ashkelon.</p>
<p>I’ll unleash my power on Ekron,</p>
<p>and the remnant of Philistines will perish.” 	Amos 1:6-8</p>
<p>9Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Tyre and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they delivered an entire population to Edom</p>
<p>and broke the treaty between kin.</p>
<p>10So I’ll send down fire on the walls of Tyre</p>
<p>and burn its fortresses.”		Amos 1:9-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Edom and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they pursued their brothers with a sword</p>
<p>and tossed mercy aside.</p>
<p>In their anger they slashed them again and again;</p>
<p>they kept up their fury without end.</p>
<p>12So I’ll send down fire on Teman</p>
<p>and burn the fortresses in Bozrah.”	Amos 1:11-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of the Ammonites and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back their punishment:</p>
<p>they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead</p>
<p>when they extended their borders.</p>
<p>14So I’ll kindle a fire on the walls of Rabbah</p>
<p>and burn its fortresses</p>
<p>amid war cries like a storm.</p>
<p>15Their king will go into exile with his officials.” 	Amos 1:13-15</p>
<p>2:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Moab and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they burned the king of Edom’s bones into lime.</p>
<p>2So I’ll burn the fortresses in Kerioth;</p>
<p>Moab will die amid turmoil,</p>
<p>war cries, and bugle blasts.</p>
<p>3I’ll eliminate judges from him</p>
<p>and slay his officials with him.” 		Amos 2:1-3</p>
<p>God’s Judgment on Judah and Israel</p>
<p>4Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Judah and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they rejected the Law of Yahveh</p>
<p>and didn’t keep his statutes.</p>
<p>The same lies have led them astray</p>
<p>that their ancestors followed.</p>
<p>5So I’ll send down fire on Judah</p>
<p>and burn the fortresses in Jerusalem.”		Amos 2:4-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“For three sins of Israel and for four,</p>
<p>I won’t hold back its punishment:</p>
<p>they sell the good for money,</p>
<p>the poor for a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>7They walk on the heads of the poor in the dust</p>
<p>and abandon those who are suffering.</p>
<p>A man and his father sleep with the same girl</p>
<p>to profane my holy name.</p>
<p>8They lie down beside every altar</p>
<p>on cloaks taken as pledges.</p>
<p>In God’s Temple they drink the wine</p>
<p>of the people they’ve fined.		Amos 2:6-8</p>
<p>9“Yet I was the One that destroyed the Amorites for you,</p>
<p>though they were as tall as cedars and strong as oaks.</p>
<p>I destroyed their fruit above and their roots below.</p>
<p>10I was the One that brought you up from Egypt,</p>
<p>and led you in the desert for 40 years</p>
<p>to take over the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p>11Then I raised up some of your offspring to be prophets</p>
<p>and some of your young men to be Nazirites.</p>
<p>Isn’t that so, Israel? 		Amos 2:9-11</p>
<p>12“But you made Nazirites drink wine</p>
<p>and told prophets not to prophesy!</p>
<p>13I’ll weigh you down like a wagon</p>
<p>overloaded with bundles,</p>
<p>14The swift won’t be able to flee;</p>
<p>the strong will lose their strength;</p>
<p>the powerful won’t save their lives.</p>
<p>15The archers won’t stand their ground;</p>
<p>the swift won’t escape;</p>
<p>the cavalry won’t save themselves.</p>
<p>16The bravest among the troops</p>
<p>will drop their weapons and run</p>
<p>when that time comes.” 		Amos 2:12-16</p>
<p>Witnesses Summoned Against Israel</p>
<p>3:1Listen to what Yahveh says against you, Israel, against the entire family he brought out of Egypt:</p>
<p>2“Of all the families in the world, only you have me;</p>
<p>so I’ll punish you for your sins.</p>
<p>3Can two men walk together unless they’ve agreed on their route?</p>
<p>4Does a lion roar in the woods before it’s made a kill?</p>
<p>Does a young lion growl in his den if he’s taken nothing?</p>
<p>5Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if there’s no bait in it?</p>
<p>Does a trap snap shut if nothing trips it?</p>
<p>6If a bugle blows in the city, won’t the people be afraid?</p>
<p>If a catastrophe falls on a city, hasn’t Yahveh planned it?</p>
<p>7For certain Yahveh God doesn’t do anything</p>
<p>without revealing his secret counsel to his prophets.</p>
<p>8A lion has roared! Who’s not afraid?</p>
<p>The Lord Yahveh has spoken! Who can refuse to prophesy?”</p>
<p>Amos 3:1-8</p>
<p>9Declare on the fortresses in Ashdod and Egypt:</p>
<p>“Gather in the mountains around Samaria and see the great turmoil and oppression in it. 10They don’t know how to do what’s right; they store up violence and devastation in their fortresses.”</p>
<p>11So the Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“An enemy will surround the land,</p>
<p>pull down your fortresses,</p>
<p>and loot your strongholds.</p>
<p>12Like a shepherd snatches from a lion’s mouth</p>
<p>a couple legs or part of an ear,</p>
<p>so I’ll deliver the Israelites living in Samaria</p>
<p>like the corner of a couch and the cover on a bed.</p>
<p>13Listen and testify against Jacob’s house.</p>
<p>14When I punish Israel’s sins, I’ll punish Bethel’s altars too.</p>
<p>I’ll cut off the horns of the altar, and they’ll fall on the ground.</p>
<p>15I’ll strike their winter palaces and summer homes;</p>
<p>stately residences full of ivory will perish;</p>
<p>the mansions will come to an end.” 	  	Amos 3:9-15</p>
<p>Israel Does Not Learn</p>
<p>4:1Listen to this, you cows of Bashan living in Samaria,</p>
<p>you women that oppress the poor and crush the needy,</p>
<p>that tell their husbands, “Bring the wine so we can get drunk!”</p>
<p>2The Lord Yahveh has sworn by his holiness,</p>
<p>“The time’s coming when they’ll take you away with meat hooks,</p>
<p>the last of you like fish on hooks.</p>
<p>3You’ll leave through the breaches in the walls,</p>
<p>each one straight ahead.</p>
<p>You’ll be thrown out into Harmon/Mt. Hermon.”	Amos 4:1-3</p>
<p>4“Go sacrifice at Bethel and sin;</p>
<p>multiply your disobedience in Gilgal!</p>
<p>Bring your sacrifices every morning,</p>
<p>your tithes every three days.</p>
<p>5Offer a thank offering with yeast in it;</p>
<p>declare freewill offerings and brag about it.</p>
<p>That’s what you like to do, you people in Israel.</p>
<p>6“I brought hunger to all your towns,</p>
<p>clean teeth everywhere you live;</p>
<p>yet you haven’t come back to me. 	Amos 4:4-6</p>
<p>7“I kept it from raining</p>
<p>when it was still three months till harvest.</p>
<p>Then I’d let it rain on one city</p>
<p>and not on another.</p>
<p>One place would get rain;</p>
<p>the place that didn’t, would dry up.</p>
<p>8So two or three towns would stagger to another to get a drink,</p>
<p>but they wouldn’t get enough;</p>
<p>yet you haven’t come back to me.</p>
<p>9“I struck you with blight and mildew,</p>
<p>and laid waste your orchards and vineyards.</p>
<p>The locusts ate your fig trees and olives;</p>
<p>yet you haven’t come back to me.” 		Amos 4:7-9</p>
<p>10“I sent a plague among you like I did in Egypt;</p>
<p>I killed your young men with the sword</p>
<p>along with your captured horses.</p>
<p>I made the stench in your camp fill your nostrils;</p>
<p>yet you haven’t come back to me.</p>
<p>11“I overthrew you like I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah;</p>
<p>your survivors were like charred stakes snatched from the fire;</p>
<p>yet you haven’t come back to me. 	Amos 4:10-11</p>
<p>12“Because I’m going to do this to you, Israel,</p>
<p>prepare to meet your God.”</p>
<p>13The One that builds mountains and creates wind,</p>
<p>and reveals to people what he’s thinking,</p>
<p>the One that turns dawn into darkness</p>
<p>and walks on mountaintops—</p>
<p>Yahveh God of Hosts.	Amos 4:12-13</p>
<p>A Call to Repentance</p>
<p>5:1Listen to the dirge I’m chanting for you, Israel:</p>
<p>2“She’s fallen;</p>
<p>virgin Israel won’t get up again.</p>
<p>She’s abandoned on the ground;</p>
<p>no one will help get her up.</p>
<p>3The city that goes out 1,000 strong</p>
<p>will have 100 left;</p>
<p>the one that goes out 100 strong</p>
<p>will have 10.”	Amos 5:1-3</p>
<p>4Yahveh tells Israel,</p>
<p>“Rely on me so you can live.</p>
<p>5Don’t rely on Bethel or go to Gilgal or Beersheba;</p>
<p>Gilgal is headed for captivity,</p>
<p>and Bethel will cease to exist.</p>
<p>6Rely on me so you can live,</p>
<p>so I don’t break out like fire, House of Joseph,</p>
<p>and burn in Bethel with no one to quench it,</p>
<p>7you that pervert justice into bitter oppression</p>
<p>and toss goodness on the ground.” 	Amos 5:4-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh is the One that made Pleiades and Orion,</p>
<p>that changes deep darkness into morning</p>
<p>and darkens day into night,</p>
<p>that calls water out of the ocean</p>
<p>and pours it out on land.</p>
<p>9He’s the One that flashes destruction at the strong</p>
<p>and demolishes their fortresses.	Amos 5:8-9</p>
<p>10They hate the one that reproves in the gate;</p>
<p>they abhor anyone that speaks with integrity.</p>
<p>11So, since you impose heavy rent on the poor</p>
<p>and exact tribute on their grain,</p>
<p>though you build houses out of well-hewn stone,</p>
<p>you won’t live in them;</p>
<p>though you plant lush vineyards,</p>
<p>you won’t drink their wine.</p>
<p>12I know about your many, serious sins,</p>
<p>you that distress decent people, accept bribes,</p>
<p>and deprive the poor of justice in court.</p>
<p>13In such cases, prudent people keep quiet</p>
<p>because it’s an evil time.	Amos 5:10-13</p>
<p>14Do what’s good so you can live,</p>
<p>so Yahveh God of Hosts will be with you</p>
<p>like you said.</p>
<p>15Hate evil, love good;</p>
<p>establish justice in court!</p>
<p>Maybe Yahveh God of Hosts</p>
<p>will show grace to the remnant in Joseph.	Amos 5:14-15</p>
<p>16So, Yahveh God of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“What wailing there is in all the squares!</p>
<p>What mourning in every street!’</p>
<p>They’re calling on farmers to moan</p>
<p>and professional mourners to lament.</p>
<p>17In all the vineyards there’ll be wailing,</p>
<p>because I’ll pass through your midst.”	Amos 5:16-17</p>
<p>The Day of Yahveh</p>
<p>18What longing you have for the day of Yahveh!</p>
<p>But what good will it do you?</p>
<p>That day will be darkness for you, not light.</p>
<p>19It will be like a man that runs from a lion</p>
<p>and meets a bear;</p>
<p>or goes home, leans his hand on the wall,</p>
<p>and gets bit by a snake.</p>
<p>20Won’t the day of Yahveh be darkness instead of light,</p>
<p>gloom without brightness?	Amos 5:18-20</p>
<p>21“I despise your festivals;</p>
<p>I don’t delight in your solemn assemblies.</p>
<p>22Though you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings,</p>
<p>I won’t accept them.</p>
<p>I won’t even look at your peace offerings of grain-fed animals.</p>
<p>23Take away your noisy songs;</p>
<p>I don’t want to listen to your lyres.</p>
<p>24Instead, make justice run down like water</p>
<p>and goodness like a constant-flowing stream.	Amos 5:21-24</p>
<p>25“Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings in the desert for 40 years, Israel? 26Well, you also carried along Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god, images you made for yourselves. 27So I’ll send you into exile beyond Damascus,” Yahveh says, whose name is The God of Hosts.   Amos 5:25-27</p>
<p>Woe to the Complacent</p>
<p>6:1“Misfortune awaits those of you at ease in Zion,</p>
<p>who feel secure in Samaria,</p>
<p>you notable leaders of that foremost nation</p>
<p>that the House of Israel comes to.</p>
<p>2Go over to Calneh and look at what happened there;</p>
<p>go from there to Hamath the great city;</p>
<p>then go down to Gath of the Philistines.</p>
<p>Are you better than those kingdoms?</p>
<p>Is their territory bigger than yours?</p>
<p>3Are you trying to push away the time of catastrophe?</p>
<p>You’re only bringing the violence nearer.	Amos 6:1-3</p>
<p>4“Misfortune awaits you that stretch out on ivory beds,</p>
<p>that lounge on your couches,</p>
<p>that eat lambs from the flock</p>
<p>and calves from the stall,</p>
<p>5that sing idle songs to the sound of a lyre</p>
<p>and invent musical instruments like David did,</p>
<p>6that drink wine by the bowlful</p>
<p>and anoint yourselves with the finest oils,</p>
<p>but don’t grieve over Joseph’s demise.</p>
<p>7You’ll be at the front of the exiles;</p>
<p>your partying on couches is over with.”	Amos 6:4-7</p>
<p>8The Lord Yahveh has sworn by himself,</p>
<p>Yahveh God of Hosts has declared:</p>
<p>“I abhor Jacob’s pride;</p>
<p>I detest his fortresses.</p>
<p>So I’ll deliver up to its enemies</p>
<p>this city and everything in it.” 	Amos 6:8</p>
<p>9It will be that, if ten die in one house 10and the relative that comes to dispose of their bodies says, “Is anyone else here?” any survivor may start to swear, “No, . . .” But the relative will interrupt, “Don’t finish your oath. Don’t even mention Yahveh.” 	Amos 6:9-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh is going to command</p>
<p>to smash big houses to pieces</p>
<p>and crush little ones to bits.</p>
<p>12Do horses run on rocks?</p>
<p>Do people plow the sea with oxen?</p>
<p>Yet you’ve turned justice into poison</p>
<p>and made the fruit of goodness bitter.</p>
<p>13To you that celebrate in Lo-debar</p>
<p>and say, “We’ve taken Karnaim by our own power.”</p>
<p>14Yahveh God of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“I’m going to raise up a nation against you, Israel;</p>
<p>“they’ll oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Arabah Valley.”	Amos 6:11-14</p>
<p>A Vision of Locusts</p>
<p>7:1The Lord Yahveh showed me a vision. He formed a locust swarm after the spring crop sprouted and the king had mowed his share. 2The swarm had finished eating the vegetation, and I said,</p>
<p>“Lord Yahveh, please pardon!</p>
<p>How will Joseph make it?</p>
<p>He’s too small!”</p>
<p>3Yahveh changed his mind.</p>
<p>“It won’t happen.” 		Amos 7:1-3</p>
<p>A Vision of Fire</p>
<p>4The Lord Yahveh showed me another vision: he had called for fire to punish them. It had burned up the depths of the sea and was beginning to burn up the landscape. 5I said,</p>
<p>“Lord Yahveh, please stop!</p>
<p>How can Joseph make it?</p>
<p>He’s too small!”</p>
<p>6Yahveh changed his mind.</p>
<p>“This won’t happen either.”		Amos 7:4-6</p>
<p>A Vision of a Plumb Line</p>
<p>7He showed me that he was standing by a wall with a plumb line in his hand.</p>
<p>8He said, “What do you see, Amos?”</p>
<p>“A plumb line.”</p>
<p>“I’m about to put a plumb line on my people Israel;</p>
<p>I’m not going to spare them anymore.</p>
<p>9The high places of Isaac will be desolate,</p>
<p>the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste;</p>
<p>I’ll attack Jeroboam’s dynasty with a sword.” 		Amos 7:7-9</p>
<p>Amaziah Accuses Amos of Conspiracy</p>
<p>10Then Amaziah, priest at Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel,</p>
<p>“Amos has plotted against you in Israel. The land can’t endure what he keeps saying: 11‘Jeroboam will die by the sword;</p>
<p>Israel will go into exile.’”</p>
<p>12So Amaziah told Amos, “Get out of here, you seer! Go to Judah and prophesy for food! 13Don’t prophesy at Bethel anymore. It’s a king’s sanctuary and a national place of worship.”</p>
<p>14Amos answered him,</p>
<p>“I wasn’t a prophet or a prophet’s son. I was a shepherd that tended fig trees. 15But Yahveh took me from following flocks and told me to prophesy to his people. 16Listen to what he says. You tell me not to prophesy against Israel or preach against Isaac. 17So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Your wife will be a prostitute in the city,</p>
<p>your children will fall by the sword,</p>
<p>your property will be parceled up,</p>
<p>and you’ll die in an unclean land.</p>
<p>Israel will go into exile.’”   	Amos 7:10-17</p>
<p>A Vision of Ripe Fruit</p>
<p>8:1The Lord Yahveh showed me a basket of ripe fruit.</p>
<p>2“What do you see, Amos?”</p>
<p>“A basket of ripe fruit.”</p>
<p>“My people Israel are also ripe—for punishment. I won’t spare them any longer. 3The singing at the palace will turn into wailing. There’ll be lots of corpses silently thrown out everywhere.”</p>
<p>4Listen to this, you that run over the needy and trample on the humble, 5saying,</p>
<p>“When’s the new moon going to be over</p>
<p>so we can buy grain?</p>
<p>When will the Sabbath be past</p>
<p>so we can open the wheat market,</p>
<p>make the bushel smaller, the shekel heavier,</p>
<p>and cheat with dishonest scales;</p>
<p>6so we can buy the helpless for money</p>
<p>and the poor for a pair of shoes,</p>
<p>and sell the chaff with the wheat?”		Amos 8:1-6</p>
<p>7Yahveh has sworn by Jacob’s arrogance,</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget what they’ve done.</p>
<p>8“Because of it, won’t the land quake</p>
<p>and everybody in it mourn?</p>
<p>It will swell up like the Nile,</p>
<p>flood all over, and recede.</p>
<p>9At that time, I’ll make the sun go down at noon</p>
<p>and make the earth dark in broad daylight.</p>
<p>10I’ll turn your festivals into mourning</p>
<p>and your singing into funeral chants.</p>
<p>I’ll put burlap around everybody’s waist</p>
<p>and make every head bald,</p>
<p>like the mourning for an only son;</p>
<p>the end will be a bitter day.”	Amos 8:7-10</p>
<p>11The Lord Yahveh says.</p>
<p>“The time’s coming when</p>
<p>I’ll send a famine on the land,</p>
<p>not a famine of bread and water,</p>
<p>but a famine of hearing from Yahveh.</p>
<p>12People will stagger from sea to sea,</p>
<p>from north to east,</p>
<p>here to there,</p>
<p>looking for a message from Yahveh,</p>
<p>but not finding any.</p>
<p>13At that time, beautiful virgins</p>
<p>and strong young men will faint from thirst.</p>
<p>14The ones that swear by the guilt of Samaria,</p>
<p>who say, ‘As your god lives, Dan,’</p>
<p>‘As the way to Beersheba lives’—</p>
<p>will fall and never get up.”	Amos 8:11-14</p>
<p>A Vision of the Lord by the Altar</p>
<p>9:1I saw Yahveh standing by the altar. He said,</p>
<p>“Strike the capitals till the thresholds shake;</p>
<p>shatter them on the people’s heads.</p>
<p>What’s left, I’ll slay with the sword;</p>
<p>no fugitive will get away or refugee escape.</p>
<p>2Though they dig down to Sheol,</p>
<p>I’ll bring them up.</p>
<p>Though they fly up to the sky,</p>
<p>I’ll bring them down.</p>
<p>3Though they hide on top of Carmel,</p>
<p>I’ll look for them and banish them.</p>
<p>Though they hide on the floor of the sea,</p>
<p>I’ll tell a sea serpent to bite them.</p>
<p>4Even if their enemies take them into exile,</p>
<p>I’ll command a sword to slay them.</p>
<p>I’m determined to oppose them.”	Amos 9:1-4</p>
<p>5The Lord Yahveh of Hosts—</p>
<p>who touches the land</p>
<p>and turns it into lava that makes the people mourn,</p>
<p>and the ground floods like the Nile and goes down again;</p>
<p>6the One who builds upper rooms that reach into the sky</p>
<p>and lays their foundations on the earth,</p>
<p>who draws up water from the sea</p>
<p>and pours it out as rain on the land—</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh.	Amos 9:5-6</p>
<p>7“Aren’t you like Nubia to me, Israel?</p>
<p>Haven’t I brought Israel up from Egypt,</p>
<p>the Philistines from Crete,</p>
<p>the Syrians from Kir?</p>
<p>8I keep my eye on sinful kingdoms and destroy them;</p>
<p>but I won’t completely destroy the House of Jacob.</p>
<p>9I’ll give the command</p>
<p>to shake the House of Jacob among all nations</p>
<p>like grain in a sieve,</p>
<p>but not a kernel will fall on the ground.</p>
<p>10All the sinners among my people will die by the sword</p>
<p>who say, ‘Catastrophe won’t overtake us.’</p>
<p>A Promise of Restoration</p>
<p>11At that time, I’ll rebuild David’s fallen shelter</p>
<p>and fix the breaches in its walls.</p>
<p>I’ll raise it up from its ruins</p>
<p>and rebuild it like it was in the old days,</p>
<p>12so they can possess what’s left of Edom</p>
<p>and all the nations that wear my name.”  	Amos 9:7-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“The time’s coming,</p>
<p>when reaping will last till plowing will</p>
<p>and grape treading will go on till sowing time,</p>
<p>when new wine will drip from the mountains</p>
<p>and flow from the hills.</p>
<p>14I’ll return my people Israel from captivity.</p>
<p>They’ll rebuild the ruined towns and live in them,</p>
<p>plant vineyards and drink their wine,</p>
<p>plant gardens and eat their produce.</p>
<p>15I’ll plant them in their own country;</p>
<p>they won’t be uprooted again from the land</p>
<p>I’ve given them.”	Amos 9:13-15</p>
