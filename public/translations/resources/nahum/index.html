        <p>NAHUM</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1The Oracle of Nahum</p>
<p>The Book of the Vision of Nahum</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Anger Against Nineveh</p>
<p>2Yahveh is an exclusive God</p>
<p>that avenges with anger.</p>
<p>He carries out vengeance on his adversaries;</p>
<p>he stores up anger for his enemies.</p>
<p>3He doesn’t get mad quick,</p>
<p>but he does exert his power;</p>
<p>he doesn’t let the guilty go free.</p>
<p>He displays his power in storms and tornadoes;</p>
<p>clouds are dust beneath his feet.	Nah 1:1-3</p>
<p>4At his command seas and rivers dry up,</p>
<p>Bashan and Carmel wither,</p>
<p>Lebanon’s blossoms wilt.</p>
<p>5In his presence, mountains quake and hills melt;</p>
<p>earth trembles and its people perish.			Nah 1:4-5</p>
<p>6Who can withstand his indignation?</p>
<p>Who can endure his furious anger?</p>
<p>He pours out wrath like fire</p>
<p>and cracks rocks in pieces.</p>
<p>7Yahveh is good, a fortress in times of trouble;</p>
<p>he knows who takes refuge in him.</p>
<p>8But with an overwhelming flood</p>
<p>he brings his opponents to a complete end</p>
<p>and chases his enemies into the dark.	Nah 1:6-8</p>
<p>9Whatever you’re plotting against Yahveh</p>
<p>he’ll put an end to;</p>
<p>he doesn’t need to take revenge twice.</p>
<p>10His enemies, like tangled thornbushes and staggering people,</p>
<p>he’ll completely burn up like stubble.</p>
<p>11Who is this counselor of yours</p>
<p>that plots against Yahveh with bad advice?</p>
<p>12This is what Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Though strong and numerous,</p>
<p>the Assyrians will perish and disappear.</p>
<p>Though I’ve let them punish you before,</p>
<p>I won’t let them do it again.</p>
<p>13I’ll break their yoke off your neck</p>
<p>and tear their shackles off your feet.”	Nah 1:9-13</p>
<p>14Yahveh has issued an edict about you, Assyria:</p>
<p>“No offspring will carry on your name;</p>
<p>I’ll remove idol and image</p>
<p>from the temples of your gods.</p>
<p>I’ll get your grave ready</p>
<p>because you’re contemptible.” 	Nah 1:14</p>
<p>15Over the mountains, a messenger is coming with good news,</p>
<p>someone that’s announcing peace!</p>
<p>Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows;</p>
<p>those wicked invaders will never attack you again.</p>
<p>I’ll completely destroy them.	Nah 1:15</p>
<p>Nineveh to Fall</p>
<p>2:1Attackers are advancing to crush you, Nineveh.</p>
<p>Man the ramparts, guard the road,</p>
<p>muster your forces, get ready.</p>
<p>2Yahveh is going to restore majesty to Jacob,</p>
<p>splendor to Israel;</p>
<p>because plunderers have stripped it</p>
<p>and cut the branches off its grapevines.	Nah 2:1-2</p>
<p>3The shields of the valiant flash red;</p>
<p>the soldiers wear scarlet uniforms;</p>
<p>the chariots glitter like steel</p>
<p>as they muster into formation;</p>
<p>they rattle their cypress spears.</p>
<p>4The chariots rush madly down the streets</p>
<p>and race wildly around the squares.</p>
<p>They shine like torches,</p>
<p>dashing here and there like lightning.</p>
<p>5The king orders his officers;</p>
<p>they scramble around in their haste</p>
<p>and hurry to the wall to set up defenses.</p>
<p>6But their enemy tears open the gates of the river</p>
<p>to undermine the palace.</p>
<p>7They strip it and loot it.</p>
<p>Its young women moan like pigeons</p>
<p>and beat their chests.	Nah 2:3-7</p>
<p>8Nineveh is like a leaking reservoir.</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop! deserting residents!”</p>
<p>but none of them even look back.</p>
<p>9Plunder the silver!</p>
<p>Plunder the gold!</p>
<p>Treasure without limit,</p>
<p>wealth of all kinds!</p>
<p>10The city is desolate and in ruins!</p>
<p>Hearts melt and knees knock!</p>
<p>Loins throb in pain; faces turn pale!			Nah 2:8-10</p>
<p>11Where’s that lion’s den now,</p>
<p>that feeding place for young lions,</p>
<p>where the lion brought its prey,</p>
<p>where its cubs stayed unthreatened,</p>
<p>12where it tore off enough for its cubs</p>
<p>and strangled prey for its lionesses?</p>
<p>It filled its lair with prey, with mutilated meat.</p>
<p>13Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“I’m your enemy.</p>
<p>I’ll burn your chariots in smoke,</p>
<p>kill your young lions with a sword,</p>
<p>and leave you with no nations to prey on.</p>
<p>Your ambassadors won’t be bringing reports anymore.”</p>
<p>Nah 2:11-1</p>
<p>Woe to Nineveh</p>
<p>3:1Misfortune awaits bloody Nineveh,</p>
<p>filled with lies and pillage</p>
<p>and plunder without limit.</p>
<p>2Do you hear the crack of whips, rattling wheels,</p>
<p>galloping horses, rushing chariots!?</p>
<p>3Do you see cavalry charging,</p>
<p>swords flashing, spears gleaming,</p>
<p>many slain, piles of corpses,</p>
<p>countless bodies,</p>
<p>and people stumbling over them!?</p>
<p>4That’s all because of your continual prostitution,</p>
<p>that charming mistress of sorceries;</p>
<p>you sell nations by your prostitution,</p>
<p>countries by your sorceries.</p>
<p>5“I’m your enemy,” Yahveh of hosts says;</p>
<p>“I’ll pull your skirts up over your faces,</p>
<p>and show the nations your nakedness,</p>
<p>the kingdoms your disgrace.</p>
<p>6I’ll throw filth on you</p>
<p>make you disgusting,</p>
<p>make a spectacle out of you!</p>
<p>7Everybody that sees you will back away and say,</p>
<p>‘Nineveh lies in ruins!</p>
<p>Who’s going to grieve over her?’</p>
<p>Where will her comforters come from?”	Nah 3:1-7</p>
<p>8Are you any better than Thebes</p>
<p>that sat by the Nile</p>
<p>with water all around it,</p>
<p>with the river as its wall and rampart?</p>
<p>9Nubia was its strength,</p>
<p>Egypt too, with no limit;</p>
<p>Put and the Libyans allied with it.</p>
<p>10Yet Thebes was carried away into captivity.</p>
<p>Its little ones were dashed to pieces</p>
<p>at the head of every street;</p>
<p>they cast lots for its honorable men</p>
<p>and tied up its leaders with chains.			Nah 3:8-10</p>
<p>11You’ll get drunk too, Nineveh, go into a stupor,</p>
<p>and look for refuge from your enemy.</p>
<p>12Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit;</p>
<p>if you shake them, their figs fall into your mouth.</p>
<p>13Your troops are women!</p>
<p>Your gates stand wide open for your enemies;</p>
<p>fires consume your bars.	Nah 3:11-13</p>
<p>14Draw water for your siege!</p>
<p>Strengthen your fortifications!</p>
<p>Get in the clay pits to tread mortar!</p>
<p>Put it in brick molds!</p>
<p>15But fire will burn you up;</p>
<p>the sword will cut you down</p>
<p>and eat you up like locusts.</p>
<p>Though you have multiplied like crawling locusts</p>
<p>and propagated like grasshoppers,</p>
<p>16though your traders have come to outnumber the stars—</p>
<p>nevertheless, like crawling locusts</p>
<p>your enemy will strip your land and fly away.</p>
<p>17Though your guards are also like grasshoppers</p>
<p>and your marshals resemble locust swarms</p>
<p>settling in stone walls on a cold day,</p>
<p>when the sun comes up, they fly away,</p>
<p>nobody knows where.					Nah 3:14-17</p>
<p>18Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria;</p>
<p>your nobles lie dead on the ground.</p>
<p>Your people have scattered to the mountains,</p>
<p>and there’s nobody to round them up.</p>
<p>19There’s no relief for your injury;</p>
<p>your wound won’t heal.</p>
<p>Everybody that hears about your destruction</p>
<p>claps their hands.</p>
<p>Who hasn’t come under your endless cruelty?	Nah 3:15b-19</p>
