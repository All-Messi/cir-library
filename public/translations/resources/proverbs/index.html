        <p>PROVERBS</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1Proverbs of Solomon Ben-David, King of Israel</p>
<p>2for knowing wisdom and instruction,</p>
<p>for understanding words that give insight,</p>
<p>3for receiving instruction in smart living,</p>
<p>goodness, justice, and equity;</p>
<p>4for giving prudence to the simple,</p>
<p>and knowledge and discretion to the young;</p>
<p>5for increasing learning in the wise</p>
<p>and gaining skill at understanding;</p>
<p>6for understanding proverbs and wise sayings,</p>
<p>riddles and profound speech.		Prov 1:1-6</p>
<p>7Respect for Yahveh is the first thing about being wise;</p>
<p>foolish people despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p>8Listen, son, to your father’s instruction;</p>
<p>don’t leave your mother’s teaching;</p>
<p>9they’ll be a crown for your head</p>
<p>and a garland for your neck.				Prov 1:7-9</p>
<p>10Son, if sinners tempt you, don’t give in to them.</p>
<p>11If they say, “Come on,</p>
<p>let’s lie in wait to shed blood</p>
<p>and ambush innocent people for fun.</p>
<p>12Let’s swallow them alive and whole like Sheol,</p>
<p>like people that go down to the Pit.</p>
<p>13We’ll get precious wealth</p>
<p>and fill our houses with plunder.</p>
<p>14Throw in your lot with us,</p>
<p>and we’ll share the take”—</p>
<p>15don’t go with them;</p>
<p>stay off that road.</p>
<p>16They hurry to do harm;</p>
<p>they rush to shed blood.				Prov 1:10-16</p>
<p>17There’s no point in spreading a net</p>
<p>while the bird’s watching.</p>
<p>18Sinners lie in wait for their own blood;</p>
<p>they ambush their own lives.</p>
<p>19That’s how it is with people that profit from violence;</p>
<p>it steals their own lives.				Prov 1:17-19</p>
<p>20Wisdom shouts in the street;</p>
<p>it raises its voice in the marketplace.</p>
<p>21It cries out from the top of the wall,</p>
<p>and says at the city gate:</p>
<p>22“How long, simpletons, will you like being simpletons,</p>
<p>and you scoffers delight in scoffing,</p>
<p>and you foolish people hate knowledge?</p>
<p>23Pay attention when I correct you;</p>
<p>I’ll pour out my spirit on you</p>
<p>and tell you what you need to know.</p>
<p>24I called and you wouldn’t listen;</p>
<p>I held out my hand, and you paid no attention.</p>
<p>25You ignored my advice;</p>
<p>you didn’t want me to correct you.</p>
<p>26So I’ll laugh at your misfortune</p>
<p>and mock you when panic strikes,</p>
<p>27when what you dread comes like a tornado,</p>
<p>when distress come crashing down on you.		Prov 1:20-27</p>
<p>28Then you’ll call out to me, and I won’t answer;</p>
<p>you’ll look for me, but not find me</p>
<p>29because you disregarded knowledge</p>
<p>and chose not to respect Yahveh.</p>
<p>30You wouldn’t accept my advice;</p>
<p>you despised being corrected;</p>
<p>31so you’ll eat the fruit of how you lived</p>
<p>founder on your own schemes.</p>
<p>32The waywardness of simpleminded people gets them killed;</p>
<p>the complacency of fools destroys them.</p>
<p>33But the ones that listen to me, live securely;</p>
<p>they’re at ease without dreading misfortune.”	Prov 1:28-33</p>
<p>2:1Son, if you accept what I say</p>
<p>and value my commandments,</p>
<p>2if you’re attentive to wisdom</p>
<p>and inclined to understanding,</p>
<p>3if you cry out for insight</p>
<p>and call out for comprehension,</p>
<p>4if you look for it like silver</p>
<p>and search for it like treasure—</p>
<p>5then you’ll understand the importance of reverence for Yahveh,</p>
<p>and find out what it means to know God.			Prov 2:1-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh gives wisdom;</p>
<p>knowledge and insight come from him.</p>
<p>7He stores up wisdom for godly people</p>
<p>and shields those who maintain integrity</p>
<p>8and guard justice.</p>
<p>He preserves his saints.</p>
<p>9Then you’ll understand goodness and justice,</p>
<p>equity and every proper course of action.</p>
<p>10Wisdom will come into your heart,</p>
<p>and knowledge will be pleasant to you.			Prov 2:6-10</p>
<p>11Discretion will come to you;</p>
<p>knowledge will watch over you</p>
<p>12to deliver you from the evil way,</p>
<p>from people that say perverse things,</p>
<p>13who leave the paths of godliness</p>
<p>to walk in the dark,</p>
<p>14who enjoy sinning</p>
<p>and revel in its perversity,</p>
<p>15whose paths are crooked,</p>
<p>whose ways are treacherous;</p>
<p>16to deliver you from immoral women,</p>
<p>from the seductive woman</p>
<p>17that leaves the husband of her youth</p>
<p>and forgets her covenant with God,</p>
<p>18whose house lies on the road to death,</p>
<p>whose footprints lead to the dead.</p>
<p>19No man that enters her house ever comes back;</p>
<p>they don’t reach the paths that lead to life.	Prov 2:11-19</p>
<p>20Follow the road good people take;</p>
<p>keep to the paths they follow,</p>
<p>21because the godly will live in the land;</p>
<p>the blameless will stay here.</p>
<p>22But sinners will be removed from the land;</p>
<p>the treacherous will be uprooted from their country.	Prov 2:20-22</p>
<p>3:1Son, don’t forget what I’ve taught you;</p>
<p>take my commandments to heart;</p>
<p>2they’ll add peace and length to your life.</p>
<p>3Don’t let kindness and truth slip away from you;</p>
<p>tie them around your neck;</p>
<p>write them on your heart.</p>
<p>4That way you’ll find blessing</p>
<p>and have a good reputation with God and people.</p>
<p>5Trust in Yahveh with all your heart;</p>
<p>don’t rely on your own perception.</p>
<p>6Acknowledge him in everything you do,</p>
<p>and he’ll make straight paths for you to follow.</p>
<p>7Don’t get the idea that you’re smart;</p>
<p>respect the LORD and turn your back on sin.</p>
<p>8It will heal your body and refresh your very bones.	Prov 3:1-8</p>
<p>9Honor Yahveh with your substance,</p>
<p>the firstfruits of your crops.</p>
<p>10Your barns will be full;</p>
<p>your vats will overflow with new wine. 			Prov 3:9-10</p>
<p>11Son, don’t reject Yahveh’s discipline</p>
<p>or give up when he corrects you;</p>
<p>12heY corrects the ones he cares about,</p>
<p>like a father that disciplines a son he delights in.</p>
<p>13They are blessed who find wisdom,</p>
<p>that gain insight.</p>
<p>14It’s more profitable than silver;</p>
<p>it brings greater gains than fine gold.</p>
<p>15It’s more precious than jewels;</p>
<p>nothing you desire can compare with it.</p>
<p>16Its left hand holds wealth and honor;</p>
<p>long life is in its right hand.</p>
<p>17Its ways are pleasant;</p>
<p>its paths are peaceful.</p>
<p>18It’s a life-giving tree for people that pick its fruit;</p>
<p>everybody that holds onto it is happy.			Prov 3:11-18</p>
<p>19Yahveh founded the earth with wisdom</p>
<p>and established the heavens with understanding.</p>
<p>20He broke up the depths with his knowledge,</p>
<p>and caused dew to settle from the sky.			Prov 3:19-20</p>
<p>21Son, keep sound wisdom and discretion nearby;</p>
<p>don’t let them out of your sight.</p>
<p>22They’ll refresh your soul</p>
<p>and adorn your neck.</p>
<p>23Then you’ll walk along your road</p>
<p>surefooted without stumbling.</p>
<p>24When you lie down, you won’t feel afraid;</p>
<p>when you go to bed, your sleep will be sweet.</p>
<p>25Don’t be afraid of sudden panic</p>
<p>or the ruin that sinful people may bring;</p>
<p>26because you’ll have confidence with Yahveh;</p>
<p>he’ll keep your foot out of the snare.			Prov 3:21-26</p>
<p>27Don’t withhold good from people that need it</p>
<p>when you can give it.</p>
<p>28Don’t tell them,</p>
<p>“Come back tomorrow, and you can have it.”</p>
<p>29Don’t devise misfortune against the one</p>
<p>that’s living safely beside you.</p>
<p>30Don’t be difficult with people</p>
<p>if they’ve done you no wrong.</p>
<p>31Don’t envy the violent</p>
<p>or choose to do what they do.</p>
<p>32Yahveh detests crooked people,</p>
<p>but he’s close to godly ones.</p>
<p>33HeY puts a curse on the house of the sinful,</p>
<p>but blesses the homes of the righteous.</p>
<p>34He scoffs at scoffers,</p>
<p>but is gracious to the humble.</p>
<p>35The wise inherit honor;</p>
<p>the foolish get disgrace.				Prov 3:27-35</p>
<p>4:1Listen to my instruction, children;</p>
<p>pay attention and learn.</p>
<p>2I’ll give you helpful guidance;</p>
<p>don’t abandon it.</p>
<p>3When I was my father’s son,</p>
<p>my mother’s tender only boy,</p>
<p>4he taught me,</p>
<p>“Hold fast to what I say;</p>
<p>keep my commandments and live.</p>
<p>5Gain wisdom! Get insight!</p>
<p>don’t forget it or leave it.</p>
<p>6Keep it with you, and it’ll protect you;</p>
<p>love it, and it’ll watch over you.</p>
<p>7This is the main thing about wisdom: get it;</p>
<p>whatever else you get, get that.</p>
<p>8Value it highly, and it’ll elevate you;</p>
<p>it will bring you honor if you embrace it.</p>
<p>9It will put a beautiful wreath on your head</p>
<p>and present you with a splendid crown.”		Prov 4:1-9</p>
<p>10Accept what I’m telling you, son,</p>
<p>and you’ll live a long time.</p>
<p>11I’ve directed you in the way of wisdom,</p>
<p>and led you in godly paths.</p>
<p>12When you walk, you won’t be hampered;</p>
<p>when you run, you won’t stumble.</p>
<p>13Latch hold of instruction and don’t let it go;</p>
<p>guard it, and it will determine your destiny.	Prov 4:10-13</p>
<p>14Don’t follow the road that sinners travel</p>
<p>or walk the path of perverse people.</p>
<p>15Avoid it; don’t pass by it;</p>
<p>turn and go the other way.</p>
<p>16They can’t sleep unless they mistreat someone;</p>
<p>they lose sleep unless they can trip somebody up.</p>
<p>17They eat the bread of wickedness,</p>
<p>and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p>18But the path of goodness is like dawn’s early light;</p>
<p>it shines brighter and brighter till it’s fully day.</p>
<p>19The way of sinners is like darkness;</p>
<p>they don’t know what they’re stumbling over.</p>
<p>20Pay attention to me, son;</p>
<p>listen to what I’m telling you;</p>
<p>21don’t let it out of your sight;</p>
<p>keep it inside you.</p>
<p>22It gives life to those who find it</p>
<p>and health to their whole body.</p>
<p>23Watch over your heart diligently,</p>
<p>because the springs of life flow out of it.</p>
<p>24Put away a deceitful mouth;</p>
<p>put devious lips far from you.</p>
<p>25Look straight ahead;</p>
<p>fix your gaze in front of you.</p>
<p>26Keep your eye on the path you’re walking,</p>
<p>and all your ways will be safe.</p>
<p>27Don’t stray from them;</p>
<p>go the other way from sin.				Prov 4:20-27</p>
<p>5:1Pay attention to my wisdom, son;</p>
<p>listen to what I understand</p>
<p>2so you can use discretion</p>
<p>and express knowledge.</p>
<p>3An immoral woman’s lips drip honey;</p>
<p>her speech is more soothing than oil;</p>
<p>4but in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood,</p>
<p>as sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p>5Her feet go down to death;</p>
<p>her steps lead to Sheol.</p>
<p>6She doesn’t ponder the path of life;</p>
<p>she wanders without realizing it.			Prov 5:1-6</p>
<p>7Listen to me, sons;</p>
<p>don’t turn aside from what I’m telling you.</p>
<p>8Stay away from her;</p>
<p>don’t go near her house,</p>
<p>9so you won’t be giving your vigor to others</p>
<p>and your years to someone cruel;</p>
<p>10so a stranger won’t be filled with your strength</p>
<p>and the fruit of your act go to an alien;</p>
<p>11and you groan at the end of life</p>
<p>because you’ve misused your body;</p>
<p>12and you say, “How I hated instruction!</p>
<p>my heart despised being corrected!</p>
<p>13I didn’t listen to my teachers,</p>
<p>or pay attention to my instructors!</p>
<p>14I’ve come to the point of total ruin</p>
<p>and have to face public disgrace.”		Prov 5:7-14</p>
<p>15Drink water from your own cistern,</p>
<p>fresh water from your own well.</p>
<p>16Should your spring be spilled</p>
<p>like water running down the street?</p>
<p>17Let it be for yours alone,</p>
<p>not for a stranger too.	Prov 5:15-17</p>
<p>18Let your fountain be blessed;</p>
<p>be happy with the wife of your youth.</p>
<p>19Like a lovely deer, a graceful doe,</p>
<p>be satisfied with her breasts;</p>
<p>be stimulated by her love.</p>
<p>20Son, why be stimulated by an immoral woman?</p>
<p>why embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p>21The LORD watches everyone</p>
<p>to see which direction they’re going.</p>
<p>22Their own iniquities capture the wicked;</p>
<p>they get caught in the web of their own sins.</p>
<p>23They die from ignorance</p>
<p>and get lost over foolishness.				Prov 5:18-23</p>
<p>6:1Son, if you sign for your neighbor</p>
<p>or give a pledge for a stranger,</p>
<p>2if you get snared by a promise you’ve made</p>
<p>or caught by what you’ve said,</p>
<p>3do this to deliver yourself:</p>
<p>since you’re at his disposal,</p>
<p>humble yourself and plead with him</p>
<p>to take away your obligation.</p>
<p>4Don’t sleep or slumber;</p>
<p>5deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hunter,</p>
<p>like a bird from a fowler.				Prov 6:1-5</p>
<p>6Go observe ants, lazy guy;</p>
<p>watch what they do and wise up.</p>
<p>7Though they don’t have a chief, an officer, or ruler,</p>
<p>8they prepare their food in the summer;</p>
<p>at harvest time they gather provisions for winter.</p>
<p>9How long will you lie around?</p>
<p>When will you get up from napping?</p>
<p>10“A little sleep, a little slumber,</p>
<p>a little folding of the hands to rest”—</p>
<p>11your poverty will come on you like a bandit;</p>
<p>your need will attack you like an armed man. 	Prov 6:6-11</p>
<p>12A worthless, wicked man is one</p>
<p>that goes around lying,</p>
<p>13that winks with his eye,</p>
<p>signals with his feet,</p>
<p>gestures with his fingers,</p>
<p>14that plots in his mind</p>
<p>and constantly stirs up conflict.</p>
<p>15Tragedy will come crashing down on him;</p>
<p>all at once he’ll be crushed beyond recovery.		Prov 6:11-15</p>
<p>16Six things the LORD despises;</p>
<p>no, make that seven that disgust him:</p>
<p>17arrogant eyes,</p>
<p>lying tongues,</p>
<p>blood-shedding hands,</p>
<p>18plotting hearts,</p>
<p>feet in a hurry to do harm,</p>
<p>19witnesses who perjure themselves</p>
<p>and people that stir up conflict between friends.	Prov 6:16-19</p>
<p>20Son, observe your father’s commands;</p>
<p>don’t leave your mother’s teaching.</p>
<p>21Tie them next to your heart;</p>
<p>hang them around your neck.</p>
<p>22They’ll guide you when you walk,</p>
<p>watch over you while you sleep,</p>
<p>and advise you when you wake up.</p>
<p>23A commandment is a lamp;</p>
<p>teaching is a light;</p>
<p>corrections that discipline lead to life.		Prov 6:20-23</p>
<p>24They keep your eyes off an immoral woman,</p>
<p>a loose woman with smooth talk.</p>
<p>25Don’t desire her beauty</p>
<p>or let her catch your attention with her eyes.</p>
<p>26A prostitute leaves a man with little to eat;</p>
<p>an immoral woman stalks his very life.</p>
<p>27Can a man carry fire in his arms</p>
<p>and not singe his clothes?</p>
<p>28Can he walk on hot coals</p>
<p>and not burn his feet?</p>
<p>29Can a man go to his neighbor’s wife</p>
<p>and not suffer for it?					Prov 6:24-29</p>
<p>30People don’t despise a thief</p>
<p>that steals because he’s hungry;</p>
<p>31but when he’s caught, he still needs to repay it seven times over;</p>
<p>even if he has to sell everything in his house to make it right.</p>
<p>32A man that commits adultery lacks good judgment;</p>
<p>he’s looking to destroy himself.</p>
<p>33He’ll find wounds and disgrace</p>
<p>and shame he can’t erase.</p>
<p>34Jealousy makes a husband furious;</p>
<p>he won’t restrain his revenge.</p>
<p>35He won’t accept ransom</p>
<p>or be content with your gifts.			Prov 6:30-35</p>
<p>7:1Take my advice, son;</p>
<p>treasure up my commandments inside you.</p>
<p>2Keep my commands so you can have a life;</p>
<p>guard my teachings like the pupil in your eye.</p>
<p>3Tie them on your fingers;</p>
<p>write them on your heart.</p>
<p>4Call wisdom your sister and insight your friend,</p>
<p>5so they can keep you away from the adulteress</p>
<p>that flatters with her words.				Prov 7:1-5</p>
<p>6At the window of my house</p>
<p>I looked out through the lattice</p>
<p>7and saw among the naïve</p>
<p>a young man with no sense.</p>
<p>8He was going down the street near her corner</p>
<p>on the way to her house,</p>
<p>9in the evening at dusk.</p>
<p>During the night after dark,</p>
<p>10a woman comes to meet him,</p>
<p>dressed like a prostitute, coy at heart.</p>
<p>11She’s loud and rebellious, not content to stay home—</p>
<p>12now in the streets, now in the squares,</p>
<p>lurking at every corner.				Prov 7:6-12</p>
<p>13She grabs him and kisses him,</p>
<p>and says to him with a brazen face,</p>
<p>14“It was time for me to offer peace offerings;</p>
<p>I paid my vows today.</p>
<p>15So I’ve come out to meet you,</p>
<p>to look for you eagerly, and I found you.</p>
<p>16I’ve decorated my couch with covers,</p>
<p>with colored linens from Egypt.</p>
<p>17I’ve sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p>18Come on, let’s drink our fill of love till morning;</p>
<p>let’s delight ourselves with love.</p>
<p>19My husband’s gone on a long trip;</p>
<p>20he’s taken a moneybag with him</p>
<p>and won’t be back till full moon.”			Prov 7:13-20</p>
<p>21She entices him with persuasion,</p>
<p>and seduces him with flattery.</p>
<p>22Finally he follows her like a bull to slaughter,</p>
<p>like a stag heading for a trap.</p>
<p>23An arrow pierces his liver;</p>
<p>like a bird swooping to a snare,</p>
<p>he doesn’t realize it will cost him his life.		Prov 7:21-23</p>
<p>24So pay attention to what I’m saying, sons.</p>
<p>25Don’t let your heart turn to its own ways</p>
<p>or stray into its own paths;</p>
<p>26doing that has thrown down so many victims</p>
<p>and slain them.</p>
<p>27Her house lies on the road to Sheol,</p>
<p>that descends to the den of death.				Prov 7:24-27</p>
<p>8:1Wisdom calls out,</p>
<p>and intelligence raises its voice.</p>
<p>2It takes its stand on high places,</p>
<p>where footpaths meet.</p>
<p>3It shouts at the city gates,</p>
<p>4“I’m calling out to you;</p>
<p>my voice is aimed at everyone.</p>
<p>5Learn prudence, simple ones;</p>
<p>gain wisdom, foolish people.</p>
<p>6Listen, so I can tell you nobler things;</p>
<p>important things come from me.			Prov 8:1-6</p>
<p>7I tell the truth</p>
<p>because I detest sinfulness.</p>
<p>8Everything I say is good;</p>
<p>there’s nothing devious in it.</p>
<p>9What I say makes sense to anyone that has insight;</p>
<p>it’s right to those who learn.</p>
<p>10Take instruction rather than silver;</p>
<p>receive knowledge instead of gold</p>
<p>11because wisdom is worth more than jewels;</p>
<p>nothing you want compares with it.			Prov 8:7-11</p>
<p>12“I, wisdom, and good judgment live together;</p>
<p>I discover knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p>13Respecting Yahveh means hating sin,</p>
<p>pride and arrogance,</p>
<p>corrupt behavior and perverse speech.</p>
<p>14I offer advice about wise living</p>
<p>and provide insight and strength.</p>
<p>15Kings reign by me,</p>
<p>and rulers decree justice.</p>
<p>16Officials and nobles govern by me,</p>
<p>as does everyone that judges justly.</p>
<p>17I love the ones that love me,</p>
<p>that diligently search me out.</p>
<p>18I have wealth and honor to offer,</p>
<p>lasting riches and goodness.</p>
<p>19My fruit has more value than pure gold;</p>
<p>my yield outperforms the finest silver.</p>
<p>20I walk in the way of goodness,</p>
<p>on the paths of justice,</p>
<p>21to endow with wealth the ones that love me.	Prov 8:12-21</p>
<p>22“Yahveh created me at the very beginning,</p>
<p>before anything else he did in ancient times.</p>
<p>23I was in place from everlasting,</p>
<p>from the beginning of time on earth.</p>
<p>24I came before there were any oceans</p>
<p>or any springs abounded with water,</p>
<p>25before the mountains were born</p>
<p>or any hills existed,</p>
<p>26before he made soil and fields</p>
<p>and dust on the ground.				Prov 8:22-26</p>
<p>27I was there when he put the heavens in place,</p>
<p>and drew the horizons around the ocean;</p>
<p>28when he set the sky above</p>
<p>and established the fountains in the deep;</p>
<p>29when he set the shorelines for the seas</p>
<p>so water couldn’t cross their boundaries;</p>
<p>when he marked out the foundations for the earth.</p>
<p>30I stood beside him like a general contractor,</p>
<p>serving as his daily delight,</p>
<p>celebrating with him,</p>
<p>31rejoicing in the world he was making,</p>
<p>and delighting in humankind.				Prov 8:27-31</p>
<p>32“So now, my children, listen to me</p>
<p>because I bless those who keep my ways.</p>
<p>33Obey instruction in order to be wise;</p>
<p>don’t neglect it.</p>
<p>34Blessed are those who pay attention to what I say,</p>
<p>who watch at my gates each day</p>
<p>and wait at my doorpost.</p>
<p>35The ones that find me find life</p>
<p>and gain Yahveh’s blessing.</p>
<p>36But those who miss out on me hurt themselves;</p>
<p>The ones that hate me love death.”			Prov 8:32-36</p>
<p>9:1Wisdom has built her house;</p>
<p>She’s carved its seven columns.</p>
<p>2She’s done her butchering, mixed her wine,</p>
<p>and set her table.</p>
<p>3She’s sent her maids</p>
<p>to call out from the heights of the city:</p>
<p>4“Whoever is naïve, turn in here!”</p>
<p>She says to the one that lacks good judgment,</p>
<p>5“Come in and eat my food;</p>
<p>drink the wine I’ve mixed.</p>
<p>6Abandon your foolish ways and start having a life;</p>
<p>conduct yourself with good judgment.”		Prov 9:1-6</p>
<p>7If you correct a scoffer, you’ll be abused;</p>
<p>if you reprove sinners, you’ll get insulted.</p>
<p>8Don’t reprove scoffers; they’ll hate you.</p>
<p>reprove the wise, and they’ll love you.</p>
<p>9Instruct the wise, and they’ll be wiser still;</p>
<p>teach the good, and they’ll be better yet.</p>
<p>10Respect for Yahveh is basic to wisdom;</p>
<p>knowing the Holy One clarifies your thinking.</p>
<p>11It’ll multiply your days</p>
<p>and add years to your life.</p>
<p>12If you’re wise, you’re wise for yourself;</p>
<p>if you scoff at wisdom, it’ll be to your detriment.		Prov 9:7-12</p>
<p>13A foolish woman is loud;</p>
<p>she’s naïve and ignorant.</p>
<p>14She sits in the doorway of her house</p>
<p>or takes a seat on the high places in town.</p>
<p>15She calls out to those who are going by,</p>
<p>who are following straight paths:</p>
<p>16“Whoever is naïve, turn in here,”</p>
<p>she claims to the one that doesn’t know any better.</p>
<p>17“Stolen water is refreshing;</p>
<p>bread eaten in secret tastes good.”</p>
<p>18But they don’t know that the dead are there,</p>
<p>that her guests lie in Sheol.				Prov 9:13-18</p>
<p>10:1Proverbs of Solomon</p>
<p>A wise son makes a happy father,</p>
<p>but a foolish one grieves his mother.</p>
<p>2Ill-gotten gain doesn’t gain you anything,</p>
<p>but goodness delivers you from death.</p>
<p>3Yahveh won’t let good people go hungry;</p>
<p>he thwarts what the wicked want.</p>
<p>4A lazy hand makes for poverty;</p>
<p>a diligent one produces wealth.</p>
<p>5They who gather crops in the summer are smart;</p>
<p>those who sleep at harvest time are shameful.</p>
<p>6Blessings come to the good,</p>
<p>but the sinful harbor violent intentions.		Prov 10:1-6</p>
<p>7Good people leave blessed memories behind,</p>
<p>but sinful people’s names rot away.</p>
<p>8The wise in heart accept commands,</p>
<p>but babbling fools come to ruin.</p>
<p>9If you live with integrity, you’ll live with confidence,</p>
<p>but people soon find out if you’re crooked.</p>
<p>10The one that winks causes trouble;</p>
<p>babbling fools come to ruin.</p>
<p>11Good people’s words are life-giving fountains;</p>
<p>What sinners harbor discord.</p>
<p>12Hatred stirs up conflict,</p>
<p>but love atones for all sins.</p>
<p>13Wisdom comes from people that have insight;</p>
<p>but a rod is for the back of fools.</p>
<p>14The wise store up knowledge,</p>
<p>but ruin is at hand for foolish people.			Prov 10:7-14</p>
<p>15For the rich, wealth is a fortress;</p>
<p>For the poor, poverty is their ruin.</p>
<p>16Life is good people’s pay;</p>
<p>punishment is bad people’s payback.</p>
<p>17Listening to instruction puts you on the route to life;</p>
<p>abandoning correction gets you lost.</p>
<p>18Hiding hatred makes you a liar;</p>
<p>spreading slander makes you a fool.</p>
<p>19Talking too much makes you likely to sin;</p>
<p>so be wise and limit what you say.</p>
<p>20The words of good people are like fine silver;</p>
<p>what sinners say isn’t worth repeating.	Prov 10:15-20</p>
<p>21What good people say feeds many;</p>
<p>foolish people starve to death from ignorance.</p>
<p>22Yahveh’s blessing makes you rich,</p>
<p>and he doesn’t add sorrow to it.</p>
<p>23Sin is fun for fools;</p>
<p>so is wisdom for the wise.</p>
<p>24What sinners fear tends happen;</p>
<p>what good people want they tend to receive.</p>
<p>25After a windstorm passes, sinners have been blown away,</p>
<p>but the godly have a firm foundation.</p>
<p>26To those who hire them,</p>
<p>lazy people irritate like vinegar on teeth</p>
<p>and smoke in the eyes.	Prov 10:21-26</p>
<p>27Respecting Yahveh lengthens your life,</p>
<p>sinfulness cuts it short.</p>
<p>28Good people’s hopes result in happiness,</p>
<p>but the expectations of the sinful fade away.</p>
<p>29Yahveh’s way is your fortress if you’re godly,</p>
<p>but it destroys sinners.</p>
<p>30Good people won’t be displaced,</p>
<p>but the sinful will be expelled from their land.</p>
<p>31The mouth of good people overflows with wisdom,</p>
<p>but the perverse tongue of the wicked will be cut off.</p>
<p>32The good say what’s acceptable,</p>
<p>but the sinful say perverse things.			Prov 10:27-32</p>
<p>11:1 Yahveh detests a false balance;</p>
<p>he delights in accurate weights.</p>
<p>2Dishonor follows pride;</p>
<p>but wisdom lies with the humble.</p>
<p>3The integrity of the wise gives them direction;</p>
<p>the dishonesty of the treacherous destroys them.</p>
<p>4Wealth won’t help you when judgment comes,</p>
<p>but goodness delivers you from death.</p>
<p>5Goodness smooths the way for the blameless,</p>
<p>but the sinful collapse under the weight of their own sin.</p>
<p>6Their goodness delivers the godly,</p>
<p>their greed snares deceivers.				Prov 11:1-6</p>
<p>7When sinners die, their aspirations die as well;</p>
<p>hope perishes with the godless.</p>
<p>8Good people leave trouble behind,</p>
<p>but sinners head right for it.</p>
<p>9The godless destroy their neighbors with their mouths,</p>
<p>but knowledge lets the righteous escape.</p>
<p>10A city celebrates when things go well for the godly;</p>
<p>there’s also happy shouting over the demise of the sinful.</p>
<p>11The godly are a blessing that builds up a city;</p>
<p>the mouths of sinners tear it down.</p>
<p>12Belittling you neighbor doesn’t help anybody;</p>
<p>be silent and just let it rest.</p>
<p>13Gossips go around telling secrets;</p>
<p>reliable people keep private matters private.</p>
<p>14Without wise leaders a nation falls;</p>
<p>victory comes from having many advisors.	Prov 11:7-14</p>
<p>15Standing good for a stranger’s debt</p>
<p>means you’re likely to pay it;</p>
<p>avoid guaranteeing it and stay safe.</p>
<p>16A gracious woman earns respect;</p>
<p>a violent man just gets rich.</p>
<p>17Kindness repays you;</p>
<p>cruelty destroys you.</p>
<p>18Sinners get rich by deception;</p>
<p>people that sow goodness make a legitimate living.</p>
<p>19Steadfast goodness promotes life;</p>
<p>chasing after evil gets you killed.</p>
<p>20Yahveh detests the perverse in heart;</p>
<p>he delights in those blameless in their living.</p>
<p>21Sinful people will certainly suffer for it,</p>
<p>but the children of the just will be rescued.</p>
<p>22A beautiful woman with no discretion</p>
<p>is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.	Prov 11:15-22</p>
<p>23The godly look forward to good things;</p>
<p>the sinful are simply waiting for wrath.</p>
<p>24Give liberally and grow richer;</p>
<p>withhold what you should give</p>
<p>and be in need.</p>
<p>25The generous prosper;</p>
<p>those who refresh other people will be refreshed.</p>
<p>26People curse the one that hoards grain</p>
<p>but bless the one that sells it to people that need it.</p>
<p>27Whoever seeks the good finds favor,</p>
<p>and trouble comes to the one that’s looking for it.</p>
<p>28People that rely on their wealth will fall;</p>
<p>but the godly will flourish like green leaves.	Prov 11:23-28</p>
<p>29Bring trouble on your family,</p>
<p>and you’ll inherit the wind;</p>
<p>the foolish serve the wise.</p>
<p>30Good people become a tree of life,</p>
<p>the wise win friends.</p>
<p>31If the righteous are rewarded on earth,</p>
<p>how much more godless sinners!	Prov 11:29-31</p>
<p>12:1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge;</p>
<p>whoever hates to be corrected stays ignorant.</p>
<p>2Yahveh gives grace to the good,</p>
<p>but condemns those who concoct evil.</p>
<p>3Sinfulness brings instability,</p>
<p>but godliness grows deep roots.</p>
<p>4A good wife is her husband’s crown,</p>
<p>but one that embarrasses him is like cancer in his bones.</p>
<p>5You can trust the thinking of the righteous,</p>
<p>but the advice of sinners is treacherous.</p>
<p>6The words of sinners are like a murderous ambush,</p>
<p>but the words of the godly rescue people.	Prov 12:1-6</p>
<p>7The sinful are overthrown and disappear,</p>
<p>but the godly stand firm.</p>
<p>8People are commended for using good sense;</p>
<p>people with perverted minds are despised.</p>
<p>9The humble who work as servants are better off</p>
<p>than those who honor themselves and go hungry.</p>
<p>10Good people care about their animals’ life;</p>
<p>sinful people are cruel to everything.</p>
<p>sinful people are cruel to everything.</p>
<p>11Plow your ground and you’ll have plenty to eat;</p>
<p>chasing after fantasies shows poor judgment.</p>
<p>12Sinners are jealous of each other’s plunder,</p>
<p>but the goodly produce their own things.	Prov 12:7-12</p>
<p>13Their own words trap siinful people;</p>
<p>good people avoid trouble like that.</p>
<p>14Good people gain satisfaction</p>
<p>from the effects of their words;</p>
<p>their actions also return to reward them.</p>
<p>15Fools think their way is the right way;</p>
<p>but the wise are willing to listen.</p>
<p>16Fools fly off the handle when insulted,</p>
<p>but the prudent stay calm.</p>
<p>17Honest witnesses tell the truth;</p>
<p>false ones just make up something.</p>
<p>18Cutting remarks spoken rashly thrust like daggers,</p>
<p>but wise words heal wounds.	Prov 12:13-18</p>
<p>19A truthful tongue lasts a lifetime,</p>
<p>but lying lips don’t endure.</p>
<p>20Deceit lies in hearts that lay plots,</p>
<p>but advisors of peace have joy.</p>
<p>21Harm tends not to fall on good people;</p>
<p>sinners are always in trouble.</p>
<p>22Yahveh detests liars</p>
<p>but delights in reliable people.</p>
<p>23Prudent people hold back telling how much they know;</p>
<p>foolish people talk too much.</p>
<p>24The diligent rule;</p>
<p>the lazy end up enslaved.	Prov 12:19-24</p>
<p>25Anxiety weighs people down;</p>
<p>an encouraging word raises them up.</p>
<p>26Godly people serve as guides for their friends;</p>
<p>sinful ones get them lost.</p>
<p>27Lazy people don’t achieve their goals;</p>
<p>diligent ones gain precious possessions.</p>
<p>28Life lies along the road good people follow;</p>
<p>there’s no death there.	Prov 12:25-28</p>
<p>13:1Wise children accept their father’s discipline,</p>
<p>but scoffers don’t pay attention to correction.</p>
<p>2From the influence of your words,</p>
<p>people respond willingly;</p>
<p>but treacherous people want to force things through.</p>
<p>3Be careful what you say, and you’ll save yourself;</p>
<p>talk too much, and you’ll do yourself in.</p>
<p>4Lazy people want but don’t get;</p>
<p>the diligent have a rich supply.</p>
<p>5Good people hate lies,</p>
<p>but sinners act disgracefully.</p>
<p>6Goodness protects the blameless;</p>
<p>sinfulness undermines the sinful.	Prov 13:1-6</p>
<p>7One person acts rich but is poor;</p>
<p>another pretends to be poor but is wealthy.</p>
<p>8The rich can pay a ransom to save their lives,</p>
<p>but the poor don’t get kidnapped for ransom.</p>
<p>9The light of the godly shines bright,</p>
<p>but the lamp of the sinful flickers out.</p>
<p>10Insolence causes division;</p>
<p>accepting advice brings wisdom.</p>
<p>11Easy wealth soon dwindles away;</p>
<p>what we work for increases.</p>
<p>12Hope delayed makes a heart sick,</p>
<p>but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.	Prov 13:7-12</p>
<p>13Instruction destroys people that hate it;</p>
<p>a commandment rewards those who respect it.</p>
<p>14Wise teaching is your fountain of life</p>
<p>for avoiding the snares of death.</p>
<p>15Good sense leads to blessing,</p>
<p>but a treacherous mind creates hardship.</p>
<p>16Prudent people act with insight;</p>
<p>fools flaunt their foolishness.</p>
<p>17An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble,</p>
<p>but a faithful envoy can bring detente.</p>
<p>18We risk poverty and shame by neglecting self-discipline;</p>
<p>honor comes to us if we value correction.	Prov 13:13-18</p>
<p>19Seeing dreams come true is pleasant to the soul,</p>
<p>but fools hate to quit sinning.</p>
<p>20When you live with the wise you become wise;</p>
<p>companions of fools will suffer with them.</p>
<p>21Misfortune follows sinners,</p>
<p>but prosperity rewards the righteous.</p>
<p>22Good people leave an inheritance for their grandchildren;</p>
<p>sinners lay up wealth for the godly.</p>
<p>23Even fallow ground yields enough to feed the poor,</p>
<p>but injustice sweeps it all away.</p>
<p>24Those who spare the rod don’t love their children;</p>
<p>if you care about them, you’ll discipline them.</p>
<p>25Good people have enough to satisfy their appetite,</p>
<p>but a sinner’s stomach never feels full.	Prov 13:19-25</p>
<p>14:1A wise woman builds up her home;</p>
<p>a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.</p>
<p>2We show respect for Yahveh by pursuing godliness;</p>
<p>being crooked in our ways means we don’t respect him.</p>
<p>3The tongues of fools become a rod for their back;</p>
<p>the lips of the wise save them.</p>
<p>4A manger stays clean where there are no oxen,</p>
<p>but abundant crops come in by their strength.</p>
<p>5A truthful witness tells no lies;</p>
<p>a false one lies with every breath.</p>
<p>6Scoffers look for wisdom but don’t find it;</p>
<p>knowledge comes easy for insightful people. 	Prov 14:1-6</p>
<p>7Stay away from foolish people;</p>
<p>you won’t learn anything from them.</p>
<p>8Prudent people know where they’re going,</p>
<p>but fools mislead themselves.</p>
<p>9Fools make fun of guilt,</p>
<p>but the godly favor the guiltless.</p>
<p>10The heart knows its bitterness;</p>
<p>no one else can share its joy.</p>
<p>11The house of the sinful faces demolition,</p>
<p>but the tent of the godly stands steady.</p>
<p>12There is a way that seems right,</p>
<p>but it leads to death.	Prov 14:7-12</p>
<p>13Laughter can hide a heavy heart;</p>
<p>joy can give way to grief.</p>
<p>14Perverse people get a fill of their own ways;</p>
<p>good people get satisfaction from theirs.</p>
<p>15Simpleminded people believe anything,</p>
<p>the prudent watch where they step.</p>
<p>16The wise take caution and get away from sin,</p>
<p>but fools are arrogant and reckless.</p>
<p>17Short-tempered people do foolish things;</p>
<p>people despise people that scheme.</p>
<p>18The naïve inherit foolishness,</p>
<p>but the prudent wear knowledge like a crown.	Prov 14:13-18</p>
<p>19Evil bows to good;</p>
<p>sinners will bow at the gates of the godly.</p>
<p>20Even neighbors dislike the poor,</p>
<p>but lots of people like the rich.</p>
<p>21Whoever despises another commits sin,</p>
<p>but those gracious to the poor find happiness.</p>
<p>22Won’t they take a loss that devise evil?</p>
<p>Those who devise good receive kindness and truth.</p>
<p>23There’s profit in work;</p>
<p>mere talk produces poverty.</p>
<p>24The wise wear their wealth like a crown;</p>
<p>the foolish dress in their own foolishness.	Prov 14:19-24</p>
<p>25A truthful witness saves lives,</p>
<p>but a false witness is a traitor.</p>
<p>26Those who respect the LORD feel confident;</p>
<p>their children have a reliable refuge.</p>
<p>27Respecting Yahveh provides a fountain of life</p>
<p>so people can avoid the snares of death.</p>
<p>28A growing population speaks well for a king;</p>
<p>what’s the point of a prince without subjects?</p>
<p>29Wise people control their temper;</p>
<p>short-tempered people show their lack of good sense.</p>
<p>30A peaceful heart makes a healthy body,</p>
<p>but jealousy is like cancer of the bone.	Prov 14:25-30</p>
<p>31People that oppress the poor insult their Maker;</p>
<p>those who are gracious to them honor him.</p>
<p>32Sinful people get crushed by the disasters</p>
<p>they bring on themselves,</p>
<p>but the righteous have a refuge when they die.</p>
<p>33Wisdom rests in intelligent people,</p>
<p>but it’s not evident among fools.</p>
<p>34Goodness raises the quality of a nation;</p>
<p>sin’s a disgrace to any people.</p>
<p>35A king favors a servant that acts wisely,</p>
<p>but he lashes out at one that disgraces him.	Prov 14:31-35</p>
<p>15:1A gentle answer deflects anger;</p>
<p>harsh words make tempers flare.</p>
<p>2The wise dispense knowledge;</p>
<p>fools expound foolishness.</p>
<p>3Yahveh sees everything;</p>
<p>he watches the evil and the good.</p>
<p>4Gentle words are a tree of life,</p>
<p>but perverse talk breaks people’s spirit.</p>
<p>5Fools reject their father’s discipline,</p>
<p>but those attentive to correction become prudent.</p>
<p>6There’s wealth in the house of the godly,</p>
<p>but the earnings of the sinful bring trouble.	Prov 15:1-6</p>
<p>7The lips of the wise give good advice;</p>
<p>the hearts of fools have nothing to offer.</p>
<p>8Yahveh detests the sacrifices of sinners,</p>
<p>but delights in the prayers of the righteous.</p>
<p>9He detests the way of the wicked,</p>
<p>but loves people who pursue goodness.</p>
<p>10Those who abandon the way incur harsh discipline;</p>
<p>those who reject discipline die.</p>
<p>11Sheol and Abaddon lie open before Yahveh;</p>
<p>how much more our hearts!</p>
<p>12Scoffers don’t like people that rebuke them;</p>
<p>so they stay away from the wise.	Prov 15:7-12</p>
<p>13A cheerful heart makes a happy face,</p>
<p>but a sad heart breaks the spirit.</p>
<p>14The mind of the wise is hungry for insight,</p>
<p>but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.</p>
<p>15Negative people have nothing but bad days,</p>
<p>but with a happy heart they enjoy a continual feast.</p>
<p>16It’s better to have a little with reverence for Yahveh</p>
<p>than to have a lot with turmoil attached.</p>
<p>17A plate of vegetables with someone you love tastes better</p>
<p>than a roast from a grain-fed cow with someone you don’t like.</p>
<p>18Hot-tempered people stir up quarrels,</p>
<p>but controlling anger calms contentions. 	Prov 15:13-18</p>
<p>19Briers overgrow lazy people’s paths,</p>
<p>but the upright travel on an open road.</p>
<p>20Wise children make a happy father;</p>
<p>foolish ones despise their mother.</p>
<p>21Foolishness is fun for the foolish,</p>
<p>but the wise walk on a straight path.</p>
<p>22Without advice plans go awry,</p>
<p>but with many advisors they succeed.</p>
<p>23Everyone enjoys giving a good answer,</p>
<p>and a timely word delights those who hear it!</p>
<p>24The path of the wise leads upward</p>
<p>away from Sheol below.	Prov 15:19-24</p>
<p>25Yahveh tears down the house of the proud</p>
<p>but protects the widow’s home.</p>
<p>26Yahveh detests evil plans</p>
<p>but delights in pure words.</p>
<p>27Those greedy for gain bring trouble home;</p>
<p>those who refuse bribes live in peace.</p>
<p>28The godly think before they speak;</p>
<p>sinners blurt out evil without thinking.</p>
<p>29Yahveh stands far away from the sinful,</p>
<p>but he listens to the prayers decent people offer.</p>
<p>30A cheerful look makes the heart happy;</p>
<p>good news refreshes us deep inside.	Prov 15:25-30</p>
<p>31If you listen to constructive correction,</p>
<p>you’ll live among the wise.</p>
<p>32If you ignore instruction, you only hurt yourself;</p>
<p>by heeding correction, you gain insight.</p>
<p>33Respecting Yahveh teaches wisdom;</p>
<p>humility comes before honor.	Prov 15:31-33</p>
<p>16:1We have intentions,</p>
<p>but Yahveh provides the proper course of action.</p>
<p>2Our ways may seem pure to us,</p>
<p>but Yahveh weighs our motives.</p>
<p>3Commit your work to Yahveh,</p>
<p>and you’ll succeed.</p>
<p>4Yahveh has a purpose for everything,</p>
<p>even for sinners in troubled times.</p>
<p>5Yahveh detests arrogant people</p>
<p>and makes sure they’re punished.</p>
<p>6Loyalty and faithfulness atone for sin;</p>
<p>respecting Yahveh avoids evil.	Prov 16:1-6</p>
<p>7When we please Yahveh,</p>
<p>he even makes our enemies live in peace with us.</p>
<p>8A little with goodness is better</p>
<p>than a lot with dishonesty.</p>
<p>9You can make your plans,</p>
<p>but Yahveh directs the steps you’ll take.</p>
<p>10A king needs to make inspired decisions;</p>
<p>he can’t afford to err in his judgments.</p>
<p>11Yahveh requires accurate scales and balances;</p>
<p>he sets the standard for every weight in the bag.</p>
<p>12An evil king is especially detestable;</p>
<p>a throne needs to be based on goodness.	Prov 16:7-12</p>
<p>13Godly words delight a king;</p>
<p>he loves people that tell the truth.</p>
<p>14A king’s anger is a death sentence;</p>
<p>the wise will appease it.</p>
<p>15There’s life in a king’s countenance;</p>
<p>his blessing is like clouds that bring spring rain.</p>
<p>16Getting wisdom is better than getting gold!</p>
<p>Choose insight above silver.</p>
<p>17The road of the upright leads away from evil;</p>
<p>those who watch where they’re going preserve their life.</p>
<p>18Pride goes before destruction,</p>
<p>and an arrogant spirit before a fall.	Prov 16:13-18</p>
<p>19Better to nurture a humble spirit</p>
<p>than share plunder with the proud.</p>
<p>20By attending to Yahveh’s word, we find what’s good;</p>
<p>he blesses us who trust in him.</p>
<p>21The wise in heart we consider insightful;</p>
<p>their pleasant words seem more persuasive.</p>
<p>22Wisdom is a fountain of life to the wise,</p>
<p>but foolishness disciplines fools.</p>
<p>23The wise think carefully about what they say,</p>
<p>which adds power to their comments.</p>
<p>24Pleasant words are like honeycomb,</p>
<p>sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.	Prov 16:19-24</p>
<p>25There’s a way that seems right,</p>
<p>but it leads to death.</p>
<p>26The workers’ appetite works for them</p>
<p>because their hunger drives them on.</p>
<p>27Worthless people plot evil;</p>
<p>what they say is like a scorching fire.</p>
<p>28Perverse persons spread conflict;</p>
<p>slanderers alienate friends.</p>
<p>29Violent people tempt their friends</p>
<p>and lead them off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>30Those who wink devise perverse things;</p>
<p>they who purse their lips bring about evil.	Prov 16:25-30</p>
<p>31A gray head is a crown of honor</p>
<p>gained by a good life.</p>
<p>32Those who are slow to lose their temper</p>
<p>are stronger than the powerful;</p>
<p>the ones that rule their spirit</p>
<p>are better than troops that capture a city.</p>
<p>33We cast lots in the lap,</p>
<p>but Yahveh determines how they fall.	Prov 16:31-33</p>
<p>17:1A dry morsel eaten in peace tastes better</p>
<p>than a feast in a house full of conflict.</p>
<p>2A wise servant will rule a shameful son</p>
<p>and share in the inheritance among brothers.</p>
<p>3Fire refines silver and a furnace purifies gold,</p>
<p>but Yahveh assays the heart.</p>
<p>4Wrongdoers pay attention to gossip;</p>
<p>liars latch onto slander.</p>
<p>5People that mock the poor insult their Maker;</p>
<p>those who rejoice over their misfortune will get their just due.</p>
<p>6Grandchildren are the crown of old age;</p>
<p>parents are the pride of their children.	Prov 17:1-6</p>
<p>7Fine speech doesn’t fit with being a fool;</p>
<p>much less is lying appropriate for leaders.</p>
<p>8A bribe is a lucky charm in its owner’s sight;</p>
<p>whoever uses it prospers!</p>
<p>9Forgiving fosters love,</p>
<p>but dwelling on faults alienates friends.</p>
<p>10A rebuke penetrates deeper into thoughtful people</p>
<p>than 100 blows affect a fool.</p>
<p>11Rebellious people are looking for trouble;</p>
<p>so a cruel messenger will confront them.</p>
<p>12Facing a bear robbed of her cubs</p>
<p>is safer than confronting a fool for his folly.	Prov 17:7-12</p>
<p>13Misfortune never leaves the house of anyone</p>
<p>that repays a good deed with a bad one.</p>
<p>14Starting an argument is like opening a floodgate;</p>
<p>so stop a quarrel before it starts.</p>
<p>15Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent</p>
<p>are equally detestable to Yahveh.</p>
<p>16Why spend money on educating fools</p>
<p>when they don’t care about learning?</p>
<p>17A friend loves despite the circumstance;</p>
<p>adversity forges friendship.</p>
<p>18It’s not good judgment</p>
<p>to guarantee another person’s debt.	Prov 17:13-18</p>
<p>19Loving sin amounts to loving conflict;</p>
<p>trusting in tall walls invites invasion.</p>
<p>20A crooked heart doesn’t prosper;</p>
<p>a lying tongue calls for retaliation.</p>
<p>21The parents of a fool feel discouraged;</p>
<p>there’s no joy in life for the father of a fool.</p>
<p>22A happy heart is good medicine;</p>
<p>a broken spirit weakens health.</p>
<p>23Sinners accept secret bribes</p>
<p>to pervert the course of justice.</p>
<p>24Sensible people find wisdom nearby;</p>
<p>fools think they’ll find it far away.	Prov 17:19-24</p>
<p>25Foolish children are a grief to their father</p>
<p>and bring bitterness to the one that gave them birth.</p>
<p>26It’s wrong to punish the godly for their godliness</p>
<p>or flog noble people for being noble.</p>
<p>27Wise people speak with restraint;</p>
<p>cool heads display better insight.</p>
<p>28Even fools, people consider wise</p>
<p>as long as they keep their mouth shut;</p>
<p>people suppose fools are smart when they close their lips.</p>
<p>Prov 17:25-28</p>
<p>18:1Unfriendly people pursue selfish ends;</p>
<p>and don’t use common sense.</p>
<p>2Fools don’t delight in learning,</p>
<p>only in telling what they think.</p>
<p>3When sinners come, contempt comes with them;</p>
<p>and with dishonor comes disgrace.</p>
<p>4Wise thoughts are deep water;</p>
<p>wisdom is the spring for a babbling brook.</p>
<p>5Don’t cater to bad people</p>
<p>or deprive the good of justice.</p>
<p>6Fools’ lips instigate conflict;</p>
<p>their mouths are asking for a slap.	Prov 18:1-6</p>
<p>7The mouths of fools bring about their ruin;</p>
<p>their lips serve as snares to them.</p>
<p>8Rumors are like delicious morsels;</p>
<p>they just work their way down inside you!</p>
<p>9People that aren’t productive</p>
<p>are relatives of those who destroy.</p>
<p>10Yahveh’s name is a strong tower;</p>
<p>escape to it for safety.</p>
<p>11The wealth of the rich is their fortified city;</p>
<p>in their imagination it’s like a high wall.</p>
<p>12Pride goes before destruction;</p>
<p>humility precedes honor.	Prov 18:7-12</p>
<p>13Popping off an answer before listening to the question</p>
<p>is foolish and shameful.</p>
<p>14The human spirit can survive a sick body,</p>
<p>but who can endure a broken spirit?</p>
<p>15The wise search for knowledge;</p>
<p>the prudent acquire it.</p>
<p>16Generosity opens doors</p>
<p>and connects you with important people.</p>
<p>17The first to argue a case in court</p>
<p>sounds convincing till someone cross-examines.</p>
<p>18Casting lots ends contentions;</p>
<p>it settles disputes between powerful contenders.	Prov 18:13-18</p>
<p>19Winning back an offended brother</p>
<p>is harder than conquering a fortified city;</p>
<p>arguments become like the barred gates of a fortress.</p>
<p>20What the mouth says satisfies the inner self;</p>
<p>what the lips express brings satisfaction.</p>
<p>21The tongue wields the power of life and death;</p>
<p>those who love it will reap its consequences.</p>
<p>22A man that finds a wife finds something good</p>
<p>and obtains Yahveh’s blessing.</p>
<p>23The poor ask for help;</p>
<p>the rich answer roughly.</p>
<p>24Someone with lots of “friends” may come to ruin,</p>
<p>but there’s a friend that sticks closer than a brother.	Prov 18:19-24</p>
<p>19:1The honest poor are better off</p>
<p>than dishonest fools.</p>
<p>2It’s not good to not know;</p>
<p>enthusiasm doesn’t compensate for ignorance.</p>
<p>3When people’s foolishness brings them to ruin,</p>
<p>they blame Yahveh.</p>
<p>4Wealth draws lots of friends</p>
<p>that desert you if poverty comes.</p>
<p>5False witnesses will get their just due;</p>
<p>perjurers won’t get off free.</p>
<p>6Many ask for generous people’s blessing;</p>
<p>everybody makes friends with bighearted people.	Prov 19:1-6</p>
<p>7Relatives of the poor despise them,</p>
<p>and their friends leave!</p>
<p>Appealing to them won’t bring them back.</p>
<p>8People that gain wisdom care about themselves;</p>
<p>they prosper who cherish understanding.</p>
<p>9False witnesses won’t go unpunished;</p>
<p>liars perish.</p>
<p>10Living in luxury isn’t fitting for a fool,</p>
<p>much less for a slave to rule over princes.</p>
<p>11Discretion gives you control over anger;</p>
<p>you learn to delight in overlooking sin.</p>
<p>12A king’s anger is like a lion’s roar;</p>
<p>his blessing falls like dew on grass.	Prov 19:7-12</p>
<p>13A foolish child destroys a father;</p>
<p>a nagging wife is like constant dripping.</p>
<p>14Houses and wealth people inherit from parents,</p>
<p>but a prudent wife comes from Yahveh.</p>
<p>15Laziness lulls people to sleep;</p>
<p>shiftless people go hungry.</p>
<p>16Those who keep the commandments keep their life;</p>
<p>people that are careless about their way will lose it.</p>
<p>17Those gracious to the poor lend to Yahveh;</p>
<p>he’ll reward them for the good they do.</p>
<p>18Discipline your children while there’s hope</p>
<p>so you won’t ruin their lives.	Prov 19:13-18</p>
<p>19Let angry people suffer the consequences;</p>
<p>bail them out, and you’ll have it to do again.</p>
<p>20Listen to advice and respond to discipline</p>
<p>so you can gain wisdom for later on.</p>
<p>21People make their plans,</p>
<p>but Yahveh’s counsel is what prevails.</p>
<p>22Loyalty makes everyone better;</p>
<p>poor people are better at it than liars.</p>
<p>23Respecting Yahveh leads to life;</p>
<p>you can sleep in peace without worrying about misfortune.</p>
<p>24Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate,</p>
<p>but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.	 Prov 19:19-24</p>
<p>25Punish scoffers so the simpleminded can learn prudence;</p>
<p>reprove the wise and they’ll be wiser still.</p>
<p>26Children that mistreat their parents</p>
<p>are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.</p>
<p>27If you stop paying attention to discipline, child,</p>
<p>you’ll never learn what you need to know.</p>
<p>28A worthless witness makes mockery of justice;</p>
<p>a sinful mouth eats sin.</p>
<p>29Penalties are designed for scoffers,</p>
<p>and scourging for the backs of fools.	Prov 19:25-29</p>
<p>20:1Wine is a mocker, beer is a brawler;</p>
<p>whoever errs in them is not wise.</p>
<p>2A king’s anger is like a lion’s growl;</p>
<p>stirring it up forfeits your life.</p>
<p>3Staying away from conflict honors you;</p>
<p>any fool can fight.</p>
<p>4Anyone too lazy to plow</p>
<p>will beg for food at harvest time.</p>
<p>5A purpose in your heart is like deep water,</p>
<p>but you can draw it out with thoughtful effort.</p>
<p>6Many claim to be loyal,</p>
<p>but who can find someone that’s actually loyal?	Prov 20:1-6</p>
<p>7How blessed the children are</p>
<p>whose parents carry themselves with integrity.</p>
<p>8A king on a just throne</p>
<p>winnows evil with his eyes.</p>
<p>9Who can say, “I’ve cleansed my heart;</p>
<p>I’m pure from sin”?</p>
<p>10Yahveh detests false weights and measures.</p>
<p>11Even kids mark themselves by what they do</p>
<p>if their actions are pure and good.</p>
<p>12The hearing ear and seeing eye—</p>
<p>Yahveh made them both.	Prov 20:7-12</p>
<p>13Don’t love sleep too much; you’ll end up poor;</p>
<p>keep your eyes open, and you’ll have enough to eat.</p>
<p>14“It’s no good,” buyers say;</p>
<p>but when the seller’s gone, they brag about the bargain.</p>
<p>15Gold and precious stones abound,</p>
<p>but knowledge has more value.</p>
<p>16Take his cloak who signs for a stranger;</p>
<p>hold him in pledge for foreigners.</p>
<p>17Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet,</p>
<p>but afterward it feels like gravel in your mouth.</p>
<p>18Make plans in consultation with the other players;</p>
<p>wage war with guidance.	Prov 20:13-18</p>
<p>19Gossips tell secrets;</p>
<p>so don’t associate with people that talk too much.</p>
<p>20Curse father and mother,</p>
<p>and your lamp will go out when it gets dark.</p>
<p>21Inheritance gained too early in life</p>
<p>won’t be a blessing in the end.</p>
<p>22Don’t say, “I’ll get even with him”;</p>
<p>wait and let Yahveh do it.</p>
<p>23Yahveh detests false weights;</p>
<p>dishonest scales don’t please him.</p>
<p>24Yahveh orders our steps;</p>
<p>so how can we fully understand our way?	Prov 20:19-24</p>
<p>25You set a trap for yourself by making a rash vow to God</p>
<p>and only thinking about it after you’ve vowed.</p>
<p>26A wise king winnows sinners</p>
<p>and drives the threshing wheel over them.</p>
<p>27The human spirit is Yahveh’s lamp;</p>
<p>it searches out the inner self.</p>
<p>28Loyalty and truth keep a king in office;</p>
<p>he holds onto his throne by goodness.</p>
<p>29A young man’s strength is his glory;</p>
<p>an old man’s glory is his gray hair.</p>
<p>30Punishment cleanses evil away;</p>
<p>discipline purifies the heart.	Prov 20:25-30</p>
<p>21:1A king’s heart in Yahveh’s hand</p>
<p>is like a stream he can direct where he wants.</p>
<p>2Your own way seems right to you,</p>
<p>but Yahveh weighs your heart.</p>
<p>3Yahveh wants goodness and justice</p>
<p>more than sacrifice.</p>
<p>4Arrogant eyes and a proud heart</p>
<p>are wicked people’s lamp—and sin.</p>
<p>5Diligent planning gives you an advantage;</p>
<p>getting in a hurry gets you poverty.</p>
<p>6Getting rich by lying is a dissipating vapor</p>
<p>that ends in death.	Prov 21:1-6</p>
<p>7Sinful people’s violence sweeps them away</p>
<p>because they refuse to do what’s right.</p>
<p>8A guilty person’s road is full of curves,</p>
<p>but the conduct of the pure makes a straight path.</p>
<p>9It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop</p>
<p>than inside the house with a contentious woman.</p>
<p>10Evil people desire evil</p>
<p>and don’t show compassion to anyone.</p>
<p>11Punishing scoffers makes them wise;</p>
<p>instructing the wise makes them wiser still.</p>
<p>12Good people watch out for the sinful</p>
<p>and turn them to ruin.	Prov 21:7-12</p>
<p>13If you shut out the cry from the poor,</p>
<p>you’ll cry out yourself and not be heard.</p>
<p>14A secret gift calms anger;</p>
<p>a present turns it away.</p>
<p>15Good people enjoy carrying out justice;</p>
<p>justice distresses sinners.</p>
<p>16If you stray from understanding,</p>
<p>you’ll end up among the dead.</p>
<p>17People that love pleasure become poor;</p>
<p>they who love wine and comfort never get rich.</p>
<p>18Sinners are ransoms for the righteous;</p>
<p>the unfaithful replace the good.	Prov 21:13-18</p>
<p>19It’s better to live in the desert</p>
<p>than with a contentious, “complainy” woman.</p>
<p>20Precious treasure and oil are in the houses of the wise,</p>
<p>but foolish people waste them.</p>
<p>21Pursue goodness and loyalty,</p>
<p>and you’ll arrive at life, goodness, and honor.</p>
<p>22The wise scale the walls of the powerful</p>
<p>and bring down the fortress they trust in.</p>
<p>23Watch your mouth and guard your tongue,</p>
<p>and you’ll stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>24“Scoffers” is the name for proud, haughty people</p>
<p>that conduct themselves with arrogance.	Prov 21:19-24</p>
<p>25Lazy people’s desires end up killing them</p>
<p>because they refuse to work.</p>
<p>26The greedy never get enough</p>
<p>while the godly give liberally.</p>
<p>27God despises sinners’ sacrifices,</p>
<p>especially when they bring them with selfish motives.</p>
<p>28False witnesses perish,</p>
<p>but good listeners testify forever.</p>
<p>29Sinners bluff,</p>
<p>but the godly think before they act.</p>
<p>30No wisdom, insight, or counsel</p>
<p>can prevail against Yahveh.</p>
<p>31A horse is trained for battle,</p>
<p>but victory comes from Yahveh.				Prov 21:25-31</p>
<p>22:1A good name means more than great wealth;</p>
<p>being blessed is better than having silver and gold.</p>
<p>2The rich and the poor have this in common:</p>
<p>Yahveh made them both.</p>
<p>3Prudent people see evil and avoid it;</p>
<p>but the simpleminded rush on ahead and suffer for it.</p>
<p>4Wealth, honor, and life are rewards</p>
<p>for humility and reverence for Yahveh.</p>
<p>5Briers and snares lie along the path of perverse people;</p>
<p>those who watch what they’re doing avoid such things.</p>
<p>6Train up children in the way they should go;</p>
<p>and when they’re older, they won’t stray from it.	Prov 22:1-6</p>
<p>7The rich rule the poor;</p>
<p>borrowers become servants to lenders.</p>
<p>8Those who sow sin reap disaster,</p>
<p>and their fury won’t subdue the opposition.</p>
<p>9Generous people will be blessed</p>
<p>because they give some of their food to the poor.</p>
<p>10Get rid of scoffers, and contention leaves too;</p>
<p>conflict and dishonor stop.</p>
<p>11The one that loves a pure heart</p>
<p>and has gracious speech becomes a king’s friend.</p>
<p>12Yahveh preserves knowledge</p>
<p>and overthrows what unreliable people say.	Prov 22:7-12</p>
<p>13Lazy people claim, “There’s a lion outside;</p>
<p>I’ll surely get killed in the streets!”</p>
<p>14An immoral woman’s mouth is a deep pit;</p>
<p>the one Yahveh curses falls into it.</p>
<p>15Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a kid,</p>
<p>but discipline drives it out.</p>
<p>16Those who oppress the poor to get ahead—</p>
<p>or regale the rich—come to poverty themselves.</p>
<p>Prov 22:13-16</p>
<p>17Listen to the wise</p>
<p>and apply your mind to my instruction;</p>
<p>18it will be pleasant if you retain it</p>
<p>so you’re ready to pass it on.</p>
<p>19I’m teaching you today</p>
<p>so you’ll trust in Yahveh.</p>
<p>20Haven’t I written helpful things</p>
<p>about advice and knowledge,</p>
<p>21to make you sure of the truth</p>
<p>so you can report correctly to the one that sent you?</p>
<p>22Don’t rob the poor, who can’t resist,</p>
<p>or try to crush them in court;</p>
<p>23Yahveh will argue their case</p>
<p>and sentence to death those who’ve robbed them.	Prov 22:17-23</p>
<p>24Don’t associate with people prone to anger</p>
<p>or go around with hotheaded types;</p>
<p>25you’ll pick up their habits</p>
<p>and entangle yourself in a net.</p>
<p>26Don’t give pledges or sign for debts.</p>
<p>27If you can’t pay,</p>
<p>why let someone take your bed from under you?</p>
<p>28Don’t remove the ancient boundary markers</p>
<p>that your ancestors have set.</p>
<p>29Do you see people skilled at their work?</p>
<p>They’ll serve kings, not just ordinary people.	Prov 22:24-29</p>
<p>23:1When you’re dining with a ruler,</p>
<p>consider carefully what he sets in front of you.</p>
<p>2Put a knife to your throat</p>
<p>if you have a big appetite.</p>
<p>3Don’t crave very many of his delicacies;</p>
<p>they may be there to test you.</p>
<p>4Don’t wear yourself out trying to get wealthy;</p>
<p>quit concerning yourself with riches.</p>
<p>5When you stare at wealth, it disappears;</p>
<p>it grows wings like an eagle and flies to the sky.	Prov 23:1-5</p>
<p>6Don’t eat with stingy people</p>
<p>or crave their delicacies;</p>
<p>7what they think to themselves is what they really are:</p>
<p>they may tell you to eat up and drink,</p>
<p>but they don’t mean it!</p>
<p>8You’ll vomit the morsel you’ve eaten</p>
<p>and waste your compliments.</p>
<p>9Don’t speak where fools can hear you;</p>
<p>they’ll despise the wisdom of what you say.</p>
<p>10Don’t move an ancient boundary marker</p>
<p>or trespass in the fields of the fatherless,</p>
<p>11because their Rescuer is powerful;</p>
<p>he’ll sue you in court.</p>
<p>12Apply your heart to instruction</p>
<p>and your ears to knowledge.					Prov 23:6-12</p>
<p>13Don’t withhold discipline from your children;</p>
<p>punishment won’t kill them.</p>
<p>14Use a switch on them</p>
<p>and deliver their souls from Sheol.</p>
<p>15Son, if your heart’s wise, mine will be glad;</p>
<p>16I’ll be happy when you become an honest man.</p>
<p>17Don’t envy sinners;</p>
<p>always live in reverence for Yahveh.</p>
<p>18There most certainly is a future;</p>
<p>your hopes won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p>19Listen and be wise;</p>
<p>direct your heart on the right course.	Prov 23:13-19</p>
<p>20Don’t pal around with heavy drinkers or big eaters;</p>
<p>21drunks and gluttons end up poor,</p>
<p>and laziness will dress them in rags.</p>
<p>22Listen to your father;</p>
<p>don’t look down on your mother when she’s old.</p>
<p>23Buy truth and don’t sell it;</p>
<p>get wisdom, instruction, and insight.</p>
<p>24Parents delight in well-behaved children;</p>
<p>mature offspring make them happy.</p>
<p>25Make father happy;</p>
<p>let her enjoy life who gave you birth.	Prov 23:20-25</p>
<p>26Give me your heart, son;</p>
<p>observe my ways.</p>
<p>27A prostitute is a deep pit;</p>
<p>an immoral woman is a narrow well.</p>
<p>28She lurks around like a robber</p>
<p>and makes men unfaithful.	 Prov 23:26-28</p>
<p>29Who has misfortune? Who is sad?</p>
<p>Who has to cope with conflict?</p>
<p>Who complains?</p>
<p>Who is wounded for no reason?</p>
<p>Whose eyes are bloodshot?</p>
<p>30Those who linger long over wine,</p>
<p>who look around for mixed wine.</p>
<p>31Don’t gaze at wine when it’s red,</p>
<p>when it sparkles in the cup,</p>
<p>when it goes down smoothly.</p>
<p>32Afterward it strikes like a serpent;</p>
<p>it bites like a viper.</p>
<p>33You’ll have hallucinations</p>
<p>and say crazy stuff.</p>
<p>34You’re like somebody asleep, bobbing on the ocean</p>
<p>or swaying on the rigging of a ship.</p>
<p>35“They strike me, but it doesn’t hurt;</p>
<p>they beat me, but I don’t feel it.</p>
<p>When I wake up,</p>
<p>I’ll want another drink.”	Prov 23:29-35</p>
<p>24:1Don’t envy bad people</p>
<p>or want to be around them;</p>
<p>2their minds devise violence;</p>
<p>their lips stir up trouble.</p>
<p>3Wisdom builds a house;</p>
<p>intelligence establishes a home;</p>
<p>4knowledge fills its rooms with precious, pleasant wealth.</p>
<p>5The wise are strong;</p>
<p>knowledge increases their strength;</p>
<p>6they wage war with effective strategy;</p>
<p>they win the victory because of their many advisors.</p>
<p>7Wisdom is out of the reach of fools;</p>
<p>they have nothing to say in the city gate.</p>
<p>8People call them schemers who plot misfortune;</p>
<p>9devising foolishness is sin;</p>
<p>scoffing is detestable.	Prov 24:1-9</p>
<p>10If adversity makes you weak,</p>
<p>you’re not very strong to start with.</p>
<p>11Rescue those unjustly sentenced to death;</p>
<p>save those who are staggering to their execution.</p>
<p>12If you try to excuse yourself by claiming ignorance,</p>
<p>won’t he know better than that who weighs your heart?</p>
<p>Doesn’t he know you that keeps your soul?</p>
<p>Won’t he render to you what you deserve?</p>
<p>13Son, eat honey; it’s good;</p>
<p>honeycomb tastes sweet.</p>
<p>14Understand that wisdom is like that to your soul;</p>
<p>if you find it, you’ll have a bright future,</p>
<p>and your hope won’t fade away.	Prov 24:10-14</p>
<p>15Don’t lie in wait at godly people’s house, you wicked;</p>
<p>don’t raid their resting place.</p>
<p>16Good people fall seven times and get up again;</p>
<p>but for sinners, one disaster is more than enough.</p>
<p>17Don’t be glad when your enemies stumble</p>
<p>or celebrate when they fall.</p>
<p>18Yahveh won’t be pleased;</p>
<p>he’ll turn his anger away from them.</p>
<p>19Don’t worry about sinners or envy them;</p>
<p>20they have no future; their lamp will flicker out.	Prov 24:15-20</p>
<p>21Son, revere Yahveh, respect the king,</p>
<p>and don’t associate with unstable people;</p>
<p>22their disaster will rise up unexpectedly,</p>
<p>and ruin you with them.</p>
<p>23These are sayings of the wise:</p>
<p>Showing partiality in judgment is unjust.</p>
<p>24Anyone that tells sinners they’re good,</p>
<p>people will curse and nations abhor.</p>
<p>25But those who rebuke sinners will receive delight;</p>
<p>blessing will come to them.</p>
<p>26Giving an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.	Prov 24:21-26</p>
<p>27Finish your work in the field first;</p>
<p>then come and build your house.</p>
<p>28Don’t testify against someone for no reason</p>
<p>or deceive by what you say.</p>
<p>29Don’t say, “I’ll do to him what he’s done to me;</p>
<p>I’ll render to him his deeds in return.”</p>
<p>30I went past a lazy person’s field,</p>
<p>past the vineyard of someone without common sense.</p>
<p>31Thistles had taken it over;</p>
<p>nettles covered the ground;</p>
<p>its walls were broken down.</p>
<p>32I thought about what I saw;</p>
<p>I looked and learned:</p>
<p>33“A little sleep, a little slumber,</p>
<p>a little folding of the hands to rest.”</p>
<p>34Your poverty will descend on you like a raider;</p>
<p>your need will attack you like an armed robber.	Prov 24:27-34</p>
<p>25:1</p>
<p>More of Solomon’s Proverbs That the Men of Hezekiah,</p>
<p>King of Judah, Transcribed</p>
<p>2It’s God’s privilege not to reveal things</p>
<p>it’s a king’s responsibility to figure them out.</p>
<p>3A king’s mind is as unsearchable</p>
<p>as the sky is high and the earth is deep.</p>
<p>4Remove the dross from silver,</p>
<p>and a silversmith can make something out of it.</p>
<p>5Keep corrupt advisors away from a king,</p>
<p>and goodness will make his throne secure.	Prov 25:1-5</p>
<p>6Don’t claim a privileged position in a king’s presence</p>
<p>or put yourself in a place designated for nobles.</p>
<p>7It’s better to be told to come up higher</p>
<p>than to be put down lower</p>
<p>in the presence of a prince.</p>
<p>What you’ve seen</p>
<p>8don’t rush to court over;</p>
<p>what will you do at the end of the trial</p>
<p>if the one you accuse puts you to shame?</p>
<p>9When you’re arguing with your neighbor,</p>
<p>don’t betray another person’s confidence;</p>
<p>10people may find out and accuse you of gossiping,</p>
<p>and you won’t regain your good reputation.	Prov 25:6-10</p>
<p>11Words fitly spoken in the proper place</p>
<p>are like golden apples in a silver setting.</p>
<p>12A wise correction to an attentive ear</p>
<p>is like a gold earring or jewelry.</p>
<p>13An employer’s reliable messenger</p>
<p>refreshes like cold snow at harvest time.</p>
<p>14People that brag falsely about what they’ll do</p>
<p>are like clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p>15Patience can persuade a prince;</p>
<p>a soft tongue can break a bone.</p>
<p>16Have you found honey?</p>
<p>Don’t eat too much of it and make yourself sick.</p>
<p>17Don’t visit your friends too often;</p>
<p>they’ll get tired of you.</p>
<p>18Someone that slanders</p>
<p>is like a club, a sword, a sharp arrow.	Prov 25:11-18</p>
<p>19Depending on undependable people in hard times</p>
<p>is like chewing with a broken tooth</p>
<p>or walking on a sprained ankle.</p>
<p>20Singing to a heavy heart</p>
<p>is like removing your coat on a cold day</p>
<p>or pouring vinegar on lye.</p>
<p>21If your enemies are hungry, feed them;</p>
<p>if they’re thirsty, give them a drink;</p>
<p>22you’ll be dumping hot coals on their head,</p>
<p>and Yahveh will reward you.	Prov 25:19-22</p>
<p>23A north wind brings rain;</p>
<p>a back-biting tongue brings angry looks.</p>
<p>24It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop</p>
<p>than inside a house with a contentious woman.</p>
<p>25Good news from a distant land</p>
<p>is like cool water to a weary soul.</p>
<p>26Good people that cave in to sinful people</p>
<p>are like trampled springs and polluted wells.</p>
<p>27Don’t eat too much honey;</p>
<p>don’t seek your own honor.</p>
<p>28Someone that’s out of control</p>
<p>is like an unwalled city; it’s open to attack.	Prov 25:23-28</p>
<p>26:1Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,</p>
<p>honor is out of place on a fool.</p>
<p>2Like a flitting sparrow, like a fluttering swallow,</p>
<p>an undeserved curse doesn’t land on its intended victim.</p>
<p>3A whip is for a horse,</p>
<p>a bridle is for a donkey,</p>
<p>a rod is for the back of a fool.</p>
<p>4Don’t answer fools’ arguments;</p>
<p>you’ll dignify them with a response.</p>
<p>5Answer fools’ arguments;</p>
<p>otherwise, they’ll think they’ve won.</p>
<p>6Trusting a fool to deliver a message</p>
<p>is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison. 	Prov 26:1-6</p>
<p>7A proverb in the mouth of a fool</p>
<p>is like legs hanging from the lame.</p>
<p>8Honoring a fool</p>
<p>is as dangerous as putting a stone in a sling.</p>
<p>9A proverb in the mouth of a fool</p>
<p>is like a thorn in the hand of a drunk.</p>
<p>10Whoever hires a fool or passerby</p>
<p>is like an archer that shoots at random.</p>
<p>11A fool that repeats his folly</p>
<p>is like a dog that returns to its vomit.</p>
<p>12There’s more hope for fools</p>
<p>than for people that think they’re smart.	Prov 26:7-12</p>
<p>13Lazy people claim there’s a lion in the road!</p>
<p>There’s surely a lion in the public square!</p>
<p>14Like a door swinging on its hinges,</p>
<p>lazy people turn on their beds.</p>
<p>15Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate</p>
<p>but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.</p>
<p>16Lazy people think their smarter</p>
<p>than seven wise advisors.</p>
<p>17A passerby that meddles in other people’s conflict</p>
<p>is like someone taking a dog by the ears.	Prov 26:13-17</p>
<p>18-19Someone that lies</p>
<p>and says, “Just kidding,”</p>
<p>is as dangerous as a maniac</p>
<p>that’s shooting flaming arrows.</p>
<p>20For lack of wood a fire goes out;</p>
<p>where there’s no gossip, quarreling dies down.</p>
<p>21Contentious people spark conflict</p>
<p>like charcoal on hot embers or wood on fire.</p>
<p>22Rumors are like delicious morsels;</p>
<p>they work their way down deep inside you!</p>
<p>23Warm lips and a base heart</p>
<p>are like silver glaze on a clay pot.	Prov 26:18-23</p>
<p>24People disguise disdain with words</p>
<p>while storing up deceit in their heart;</p>
<p>25don’t trust them when they pretend to be kind to you,</p>
<p>because they have seven evils in their minds;</p>
<p>26though they coat their disdain with lies,</p>
<p>it’ll eventually come out for all to see.</p>
<p>27You dig a pit for others, only to fall in it yourself;</p>
<p>you roll a boulder uphill only to have it roll back and crush you.</p>
<p>28A lying tongue despises its victims;</p>
<p>a flattering mouth brings ruin.	Prov 26:24-28</p>
<p>27:1Don’t brag about tomorrow;</p>
<p>you don’t know what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>2Let somebody else praise you, not your own mouth;</p>
<p>a stranger, not your own lips.</p>
<p>3A rock is heavy and sand weighs a lot,</p>
<p>but a fool’s resentment outweighs either one.</p>
<p>4Anger and wrath are bad enough,</p>
<p>but jealousy is even worse.</p>
<p>5Open rebuke is better than secret love.</p>
<p>6A friend’s wounds may be sincere,</p>
<p>but an enemy’s kisses deceive.	Prov 27:1-6</p>
<p>7A person that’s full hates honey;</p>
<p>one that’s famished thinks bitter tastes sweet.</p>
<p>8If you wander away from home,</p>
<p>you’re like a bird that wanders off from its nest.</p>
<p>9Oil and perfume make you feel good,</p>
<p>and a friend’s advice is sweet.</p>
<p>10Don’t abandon a friend, yours or your father’s;</p>
<p>that way, if misfortune comes,</p>
<p>you won’t have to impose on your brother’s house;</p>
<p>a near neighbor is better than a distant brother.</p>
<p>11Be wise and make me happy, child,</p>
<p>so I can answer critics that try to disgrace me.</p>
<p>12The prudent foresee danger and take precautions;</p>
<p>the simpleminded plunge ahead and pay the price.	Prov 27:7-12</p>
<p>13Get security from someone that guarantees a foreigner’s debt;</p>
<p>get a deposit for a promiscuous woman.</p>
<p>14Loudly blessing a friend in the morning</p>
<p>will be taken as an enemy’s curse.</p>
<p>15A contentious wife is like a steady rain;</p>
<p>16whoever tries to restrain her</p>
<p>may as well try to restrain the wind</p>
<p>or hold onto something with an oily hand.	Prov 27:13-16</p>
<p>17Like iron sharpens iron,</p>
<p>one person sharpens another.</p>
<p>18If you tend a fig tree, you&rsquo;ll eat its fruit;</p>
<p>if you aid your master’s interests, you’ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>19As water reflects a face,</p>
<p>the heart reflects the real person.</p>
<p>20Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;</p>
<p>neither are people’s wants.</p>
<p>21A crucible is for silver, and a furnace is for gold;</p>
<p>a person is put to the test by flattery.</p>
<p>22Though you grind fools in a mortar</p>
<p>with a pestle like crushed grain,</p>
<p>you won’t separate them from their foolishness.	Prov 27:17-22</p>
<p>23Keep tabs on the condition of your flocks;</p>
<p>pay close attention to your herds,</p>
<p>24because wealth doesn’t last forever,</p>
<p>and a crown isn’t permanent.</p>
<p>25When the hay’s all in</p>
<p>and new growth starts to appear</p>
<p>and the grass on the hillsides is in the barn,</p>
<p>26lambs will provide wool for your clothes,</p>
<p>and your goats will be worth enough to buy a field;</p>
<p>27you’ll have enough goats’ milk for yourself,</p>
<p>your family, and your servant girls.	Prov 27:23-27</p>
<p>28:1Sinners run when no one’s chasing,</p>
<p>but the good are as bold as lions.</p>
<p>2When a country sins, lots of leaders vie for control;</p>
<p>but wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability.</p>
<p>3The poor that oppress the poor</p>
<p>are like a driving rain that destroys crops.</p>
<p>4Those who leave the Law commend the sinful,</p>
<p>but those who keep it contend with them.</p>
<p>5Bad people don’t understand justice,</p>
<p>those who look to Yahveh understand it.</p>
<p>6Being poor and honest</p>
<p>is better than being rich and dishonest.	Prov 28:1-6</p>
<p>7Young people that keep the Law are wise offspring,</p>
<p>but companions of gluttons humiliate their parents.</p>
<p>8Whoever increases wealth by charging high interest,</p>
<p>gathers it for the one that’s kind to the poor.</p>
<p>9When people quit listening to the Law,</p>
<p>even their prayers become offensive.</p>
<p>10They who mislead the godly</p>
<p>fall into their own pit,</p>
<p>but the honest inherit good things.</p>
<p>11The rich may think they’re smart,</p>
<p>but poor people with insight can see through them.</p>
<p>12When the godly triumph, everybody’s glad;</p>
<p>but when the sinful take over, people leave. 		Prov 28:7-12</p>
<p>13Concealing your sins won’t make you prosper,</p>
<p>but confessing and abandoning them will foster mercy.</p>
<p>14How blessed they are who fear doing wrong,</p>
<p>but those who harden their hearts are headed for trouble.</p>
<p>15An evil ruler is as dangerous to poor people</p>
<p>as a roaring lion or a charging bear.</p>
<p>16A leader that oppresses isn’t using good judgment;</p>
<p>anyone that hates unjust gain prolongs life.</p>
<p>17Corrupt leaders, loaded down with the guilt of human blood,</p>
<p>will be fugitives till death; nobody will take their side.</p>
<p>18People that live with integrity will be rescued,</p>
<p>but those who are perverse will suddenly fall.	Prov 28:13-18</p>
<p>19The man that plows his ground will have plenty to eat,</p>
<p>but one that follows fantasies will be poor in the midst of plenty.</p>
<p>20Reliable people receive many blessings,</p>
<p>but those who want to get rich quick get into trouble.</p>
<p>21Showing partiality is never good;</p>
<p>yet some would sin to get a piece of bread.</p>
<p>22A miser hurries to get rich</p>
<p>and doesn’t realize that want will overtake him.</p>
<p>23Someone that rebukes finds more approval</p>
<p>than someone that flatters.</p>
<p>24People that steal from their parents,</p>
<p>and claim it’s not sin,</p>
<p>are no better than murderers.	Prov 28:19-24</p>
<p>25Arrogant people stir up conflict,</p>
<p>but those who trust in Yahveh prosper.</p>
<p>26People are foolish to trust in themselves;</p>
<p>it’s the ones that live wisely that stay safe.</p>
<p>27If you give to the poor, you’ll never be poor;</p>
<p>but if you close your eyes to poverty, you’ll be cursed.</p>
<p>28When corrupt leaders rise to power, people go into hiding;</p>
<p>when they meet disaster, the godly flourish. 	Prov 28:25-28</p>
<p>29:1If you stiffen your neck after repeated correction,</p>
<p>you’ll suddenly be broken beyond recovery.</p>
<p>2When good people rule, people are happy;</p>
<p>when corrupt leaders take over, the citizens groan.</p>
<p>3A son that loves wisdom makes his father happy,</p>
<p>but one that visits prostitutes squanders his wealth.</p>
<p>4A good king creates a stable country,</p>
<p>but one that accepts bribes ruins it.</p>
<p>5Flattering your friends</p>
<p>spreads a net for them to step in.</p>
<p>6Bad people’s sins become their downfall,</p>
<p>but the righteous can sing and celebrate.	Prov 29:1-6</p>
<p>7The godly care about the rights of the poor;</p>
<p>sinful people don’t care about such things.</p>
<p>8Scoffers can set a city in an uproar,</p>
<p>but the wise defuse anger.</p>
<p>9When the wise argue with the foolish,</p>
<p>the foolish get mad or mock; there’s no quiet response.</p>
<p>10Bloodthirsty people hate anybody that’s blameless,</p>
<p>but the godly are concerned about other people’s lives.</p>
<p>11Fools lose their temper;</p>
<p>the wise keep it in check.</p>
<p>12If a ruler is willing to listen to lies,</p>
<p>his advisors become corrupt.	Prov 29:7-12</p>
<p>13The poor and the oppressor have this in common:</p>
<p>Yahveh makes both of them able to see.</p>
<p>14If a king judges the poor fairly,</p>
<p>his throne will be permanently secure.</p>
<p>15Discipline gives children wisdom,</p>
<p>but kids that get their way are an embarrassment to their mother.</p>
<p>16When corrupt leaders get control, sin multiplies;</p>
<p>but the godly will see them fall.</p>
<p>17Correct your children,</p>
<p>and they’ll bring you comfort and delight.</p>
<p>18Where there’s no revelation, people cast off restraint;</p>
<p>but those who keep the Law stay happy.	Prov 29:13-18</p>
<p>19Words alone won’t correct a slave;</p>
<p>though he understands, he won’t respond.</p>
<p>20There’s more hope for a fool</p>
<p>than for someone that’s rash with words</p>
<p>21A slave pampered from childhood</p>
<p>will turn out to be a rebel.</p>
<p>22Angry people stir up conflict;</p>
<p>hotheads commit a lot of sins.</p>
<p>23Pride brings humiliation;</p>
<p>humility lifts up to places of honor.</p>
<p>24Helping a thief puts you in jeopardy:</p>
<p>you’ve taken an oath against perjury,</p>
<p>but you can’t tell the truth in court.	Prov 29:19-24</p>
<p>25Fearing other people entraps you;</p>
<p>trusting Yahveh makes you secure.</p>
<p>26People look to rulers for approval,</p>
<p>but justice comes from Yahveh.</p>
<p>27The wicked despise the righteous,</p>
<p>and the righteous despise them back.	Prov 29:25-27</p>
<p>30:1The Words of Agur Ben-Jakeh, an Oracle</p>
<p>Agur says to Ithiel and Ucal:</p>
<p>2Surely I’m too stupid to be human;</p>
<p>I don’t have common sense.</p>
<p>3I haven’t mastered wisdom;</p>
<p>I don’t know the Holy One.</p>
<p>4Who but God goes up to the sky and back down</p>
<p>or grasps the wind in his fist?</p>
<p>Who wraps up the ocean in his cloak</p>
<p>or sets the boundaries of land?</p>
<p>What’s his name? What’s his son’s name?</p>
<p>Tell me if you know!	Prov 30:1-4</p>
<p>5Every message from God proves true;</p>
<p>he’s a shield for those who take refuge in him.</p>
<p>6Don’t add to what he says;</p>
<p>otherwise, he’ll reprove you</p>
<p>and expose you as a liar.</p>
<p>7I ask you for two things before I die:</p>
<p>8first, keep me from being deceived*;</p>
<p>second, don’t give me poverty or wealth;</p>
<p>just give me what I need;</p>
<p>9so, on the one hand, I won’t be full and deny you, saying,</p>
<p>“Who needs Yahveh?”</p>
<p>or, on the other hand, lack what I need and steal to get it,</p>
<p>and so profane the name of my God.</p>
<p>10Don’t slander a slave to his master,</p>
<p>or he’ll curse you and you’ll pay for it.	Prov 30:5-10</p>
<p>11Some curse their father</p>
<p>and don’t bless their mother.</p>
<p>12Some consider themselves pure,</p>
<p>but they’re unwashed and filthy.</p>
<p>13Some—how lofty their eyes!</p>
<p>how high their brows!—</p>
<p>14some have teeth like swords</p>
<p>and fangs like knives;</p>
<p>they devour the poor and needy. 				Prov 30:11-14</p>
<p>15A leech has two daughters</p>
<p>that cry, “More, give me more.”</p>
<p>Three things are never satisfied,</p>
<p>no, make that four that never say, “That’s enough”:</p>
<p>16Sheol,</p>
<p>a barren womb,</p>
<p>desert ground,</p>
<p>and a blazing fire	Prov 30:15-16</p>
<p>17The eye that mocks father or scorns mother</p>
<p>the ravens in the valley will pluck out,</p>
<p>the vultures will eat.</p>
<p>18Three things are too amazing for me,</p>
<p>no, make that four I don’t understand:</p>
<p>19how an eagle flies in the sky,</p>
<p>how a snake slithers on a ledge,</p>
<p>how a ship moves on the ocean,</p>
<p>and how a man is drawn to a maiden.</p>
<p>20An adulterous woman “consumes” a man,</p>
<p>“wipes her mouth,” and says,</p>
<p>“I haven’t done anything wrong.”			Prov 30:17-20</p>
<p>21Under three things the ground trembles,</p>
<p>no, make that four, it can’t endure:</p>
<p>22a slave that becomes king,</p>
<p>a well-fed fool,</p>
<p>23an unloved woman that gets a husband,</p>
<p>and a maid that replaces her mistress.</p>
<p>24Four things are small but especially wise:</p>
<p>25ants aren’t strong,</p>
<p>but they store up their food in the summer;</p>
<p>26rock badgers aren’t powerful,</p>
<p>but they make their homes in the rocks;</p>
<p>27locusts don’t have a king,</p>
<p>but they march out in ranks;</p>
<p>28lizards are easy to catch with your hands,</p>
<p>yet they’re in kings’ palaces.	Prov 30:21-28</p>
<p>29Three things are stately in their stride,</p>
<p>no, four that walk with majestic bearing:</p>
<p>30a lion, powerful and unafraid among the animals;</p>
<p>31a strutting rooster,</p>
<p>a billy goat,</p>
<p>and a king leading his army.</p>
<p>32If you’ve been foolish by acting proud</p>
<p>or putting other people down,</p>
<p>cover your mouth in shame.</p>
<p>33As churning cream makes butter</p>
<p>and punching a nose makes it bleed,</p>
<p>so stirring up anger causes quarrels.	Prov 30:29-33</p>
<p>31;1The Words of King Lemuel</p>
<p>The Oracle His Mother Taught Him</p>
<p>2Please listen, son,</p>
<p>son of my womb, son of my vows;</p>
<p>3don’t waste your strength</p>
<p>on the kind of women that destroy kings.</p>
<p>4Lemuel, it’s not for kings to guzzle wine</p>
<p>or for rulers to get addicted to alcohol;</p>
<p>5the fear is that they’ll forget the Law</p>
<p>and not give justice to the oppressed.</p>
<p>6Give alcohol to the dying</p>
<p>and wine to those in pain;</p>
<p>7let them drink and forget their condition,</p>
<p>and not remember their suffering anymore.</p>
<p>8Speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves;</p>
<p>9judge justly and defend the poor and needy.		Prov 31:1-9</p>
<p>Tribute to a Worthy Woman</p>
<p>10Who can find a capable wife of noble character?</p>
<p>She’s worth more than jewels.</p>
<p>11Her husband can rely on her,</p>
<p>and he’ll not lack anything of value.</p>
<p>12She’ll do him good her whole life.</p>
<p>13She looks for wool and linen,</p>
<p>and enjoys working with her hands.</p>
<p>14Like a merchant ship,</p>
<p>she brings her food from a distance.</p>
<p>15She gets up before daylight to feed her family</p>
<p>and assign the day’s jobs to her maids.</p>
<p>16She inspects a field and buys it,</p>
<p>and plants a vineyard from her earnings.	Prov 31:10-16</p>
<p>17She wraps her waist with strength</p>
<p>and makes her arms strong.</p>
<p>18She makes sure her efforts are profitable,</p>
<p>and her lamp doesn’t go out at night.</p>
<p>19She reaches for the distaff,</p>
<p>and her hands hold the spindle.</p>
<p>20She reaches out to the poor and needy.</p>
<p>21She’s not worried when it snows</p>
<p>because she has dressed her family in scarlet.</p>
<p>22She wears purple and fine linen</p>
<p>and makes her own bedclothes.				Prov 31:17-22</p>
<p>23The community knows her husband in the city gates,</p>
<p>where he sits among the leaders of the land.</p>
<p>24She makes sashes and linen garments</p>
<p>to sell to the merchants.</p>
<p>25She dresses in strength and dignity</p>
<p>and smiles at the future.</p>
<p>26She speaks wisely and teaches kindly.</p>
<p>27She takes care of her household</p>
<p>and doesn’t idle away her time.</p>
<p>28Her children grow up and bless her;</p>
<p>her husband, too, and praises her:</p>
<p>29“Lots of women do nobly,</p>
<p>but you excel them all.”</p>
<p>30Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,</p>
<p>but praise a woman that respects Yahveh.</p>
<p>31Reward her for what she does,</p>
<p>and let her work speak for her in the community.	Prov 31:23-31</p>
