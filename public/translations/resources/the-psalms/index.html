        <p>THE PSALMS</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>BOOK 1</p>
<p>Psalm 1</p>
<p>1People are blessed that don’t</p>
<p>take advice from the wicked</p>
<p>or stand among sinners</p>
<p>or sit with scoffers,</p>
<p>2but delight in the Law of Yahveh</p>
<p>and meditate on it day and night.</p>
<p>3They’re like trees planted beside a river</p>
<p>that bear fruit in season,</p>
<p>whose leaves don’t wither.</p>
<p>They’re successful at what they do.</p>
<p>4Sinners aren’t like that:</p>
<p>they’re like chaff that wind blows away;</p>
<p>5they won’t withstand judgment</p>
<p>or stand among the godly.</p>
<p>6Yahveh watches over the godly,</p>
<p>but the wicked perish.		Ps 1:1-6</p>
<p>Psalm 2</p>
<p>1Why do the nations get together</p>
<p>to plot pointless schemes?</p>
<p>2Kings take their stand</p>
<p>and rulers hold counsel</p>
<p>against Yahveh and his Anointed One [Messiah]:</p>
<p>3“Let’s break their bonds</p>
<p>and throw them away.”</p>
<p>4The One that’s in heaven laughs;</p>
<p>Yahveh scoffs at them.</p>
<p>5He’ll speak to them in his anger</p>
<p>and terrify them with his fury:</p>
<p>6“I’ve installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain.”	Ps 2:1-6</p>
<p>7“I’ll tell Yahveh’s decree:</p>
<p>‘You’re my Son;</p>
<p>I’ve inaugurated you today.</p>
<p>8Just ask me, and I’ll give you the nations to inherit,</p>
<p>the most distant lands to possess.</p>
<p>9You’ll rule them with an iron scepter</p>
<p>and shatter them like clay pots.’”</p>
<p>10So, kings, be wise;</p>
<p>rulers, be warned.</p>
<p>11Serve Yahveh with reverence;</p>
<p>celebrate with trembling.</p>
<p>12Kiss the Son so he won’t be angry</p>
<p>and you perish along the way;</p>
<p>his anger is easily sparked.</p>
<p>They’re so fortunate who take refuge in him!		Ps 2:7-12</p>
<p>Psalm 3</p>
<p>A Psalm of David When He Fled from His Son Absalom</p>
<p>1Yahveh, I have so many enemies;</p>
<p>so many are working against me;</p>
<p>2so many are saying,</p>
<p>“God’s not going to help him.”		Ps 3:1-2</p>
<p>3But you’re my shield, Yahveh, my glory,</p>
<p>the One that holds my head up.</p>
<p>4When I call out to you,</p>
<p>you answer from your holy mountain.</p>
<p>5I lie down to sleep and wake up again</p>
<p>because you sustain me.</p>
<p>6I won’t be afraid if 10,000 oppose me.</p>
<p>7Arise, Yahveh; rescue me.</p>
<p>Slap my enemies;</p>
<p>knock out their teeth.</p>
<p>8Victory comes from you;</p>
<p>bless your people!		Ps 3:3-8</p>
<p>Psalm 4</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>with Stringed Instruments</p>
<p>1Righteous God, answer when I call!</p>
<p>Take time for me in my distress;</p>
<p>listen graciously to my prayer.</p>
<p>2People, how long will you try to ruin my reputation?</p>
<p>How long will you love unfounded accusations and outright lies?</p>
<p>3Just remember that Yahveh sets good people apart for himself;</p>
<p>he’ll listen when I call out to him.		Ps 4:1-3</p>
<p>4If you’re angry, don’t sin;</p>
<p>just think it to yourself in bed; don’t act it out.</p>
<p>5Offer sacrifices with the right attitude</p>
<p>and trust in Yahveh.</p>
<p>6Many say, “Who will show us something good?”</p>
<p>Smile on us, Yahveh.</p>
<p>7You make me happier</p>
<p>than those who have big crops and new wine.</p>
<p>8I lie down to sleep in peace</p>
<p>because you make me able to live safely. 		Ps 4:4-8</p>
<p>Psalm 5</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>with Flute Accompaniment</p>
<p>1Listen to me, Yahveh;</p>
<p>Pay attention to my groaning.</p>
<p>2Hear my call for help, my God and King,</p>
<p>because I pray only to you.</p>
<p>3You hear me in the mornings,</p>
<p>when I offer my prayers and wait.</p>
<p>4You’re not amused by sinfulness</p>
<p>because there’s nothing bad about you.</p>
<p>5Braggards can’t stand in your presence</p>
<p>because you send away everyone that sins.</p>
<p>6You destroy liars</p>
<p>and abhor bloodthirsty people.</p>
<p>7But I’ll go into your house under your enduring love</p>
<p>and bow in reverence in your holy Temple.	Ps 5:1-7</p>
<p>8Because I have enemies, Yahveh,</p>
<p>lead me in your goodness;</p>
<p>make your way clear to me.</p>
<p>9You can’t believe a word they say;</p>
<p>they set their heart on destruction;</p>
<p>their throat’s an open grave;</p>
<p>they flatter with their tongues.</p>
<p>10Hold them guilty, God;</p>
<p>make their own schemes trip them up!</p>
<p>Cast them out because of their many sins</p>
<p>because they’re rebelling against you.</p>
<p>11Let everybody be happy that takes refuge in you;</p>
<p>let them always sing for joy.</p>
<p>Defend them</p>
<p>so those who love you can be happy in you.</p>
<p>12You bless good people</p>
<p>and cover them with your favor like a shield.	Ps 5:8-12</p>
<p>Psalm 6</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>with Stringed Instruments;</p>
<p>Set to The Sheminith [To the Eight-String Lyre]</p>
<p>1Don’t lash out at me, Yahveh,</p>
<p>or take me to task in your anger.</p>
<p>2Be gracious to me because I’m weak;</p>
<p>heal me because I’m troubled deep inside.</p>
<p>3I’m really scared;</p>
<p>how long, Yahveh, before you save me?</p>
<p>4Come back and rescue me;</p>
<p>because of your enduring love, save me;</p>
<p>5because nobody talks about you when they’re dead;</p>
<p>who gives you gratitude in Sheol?	Ps 6:1-5</p>
<p>6I’m worn out from moaning;</p>
<p>I flood my bed with tears every night</p>
<p>and drench my couch with weeping.</p>
<p>7My eyes melt from grief,</p>
<p>worn out over my adversaries.</p>
<p>8Go away, all you sinners,</p>
<p>because Yahveh has heard me call.</p>
<p>9He’s heard my plea</p>
<p>and accepts my prayer.</p>
<p>10He’ll disgrace my enemies and greatly distress them;</p>
<p>they’ll suddenly retreat, humiliated.	Ps 6:6-10</p>
<p>Psalm 7</p>
<p>A Shiggaion of David that He Sang</p>
<p>to Yahveh About Cush a Benjamite</p>
<p>1Yahveh my God, I’ve taken refuge in you;</p>
<p>protect me from persecutors</p>
<p>2so they won’t tear me apart like a lion does,</p>
<p>and drag me away with no one to rescue me.</p>
<p>3Yahveh my God, if I’ve done wrong,</p>
<p>if there’s any injustice in me,</p>
<p>4if I’ve betrayed a friend</p>
<p>or plundered an adversary for no reason,</p>
<p>5chase me down and slay me;</p>
<p>trample me on the ground,</p>
<p>lay my honor in the dust.			Ps 7:1-5</p>
<p>6Rise up in anger, Yahveh,</p>
<p>against my angry enemies;</p>
<p>wake up and decree justice on my behalf.</p>
<p>7Gather the nations around you</p>
<p>and rule them from on high.</p>
<p>8You that judge all people,</p>
<p>judge me by my goodness and integrity.</p>
<p>9Put an end to people’s sinfulness;</p>
<p>establish goodness</p>
<p>because our good God tests hearts and minds.</p>
<p>10You’re my shield who saves the godly in heart,</p>
<p>11a just judge that’s angry with sinners every day.	Ps 7:6-11</p>
<p>12For someone that doesn’t repent,</p>
<p>God sharpens his sword,</p>
<p>bends his bow, and strings it;</p>
<p>13he has his deadly weapons ready</p>
<p>and makes arrows with flaming shafts.</p>
<p>14Wicked people conceive evil,</p>
<p>get pregnant with sin,</p>
<p>and give birth to lies.</p>
<p>15They dig a pit and hollow it out,</p>
<p>and fall into the hole they’ve dug to trap others.</p>
<p>16Their scheming comes back on them;</p>
<p>their violence crashes down on their own heads.</p>
<p>17I’ll give Yahveh the thanks his goodness calls for</p>
<p>and sing praise to theY Most High.	Ps 7:12-17</p>
<p>Psalm 8</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to The Gittith</p>
<p>1Yahveh, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!</p>
<p>You display your splendor higher than the sky!</p>
<p>2Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies</p>
<p>you’ve established a defensive wall</p>
<p>against your adversaries,</p>
<p>to silence enemies that want revenge.		Ps 8:1-2</p>
<p>3When I look at the sky, the work of your fingers,</p>
<p>the moon and stars you’ve set in place,</p>
<p>4what are we that you give us any thought</p>
<p>or care about us?</p>
<p>5You’ve made us a little lower than the angels</p>
<p>and crowned us with glory and honor!</p>
<p>6You’ve given us responsibility over what you’ve made</p>
<p>and put it under our control:</p>
<p>7sheep and oxen, wild animals in the countryside,</p>
<p>8birds in the sky, fish in the sea,</p>
<p>whatever swims through the ocean.</p>
<p>9Yahveh, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!</p>
<p>Ps 8:3-9</p>
<p>Psalm 9</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to the tune of “Death of the Son”</p>
<p>1I’ll thank you, Yahveh, with all my heart</p>
<p>and call attention to the amazing things you’ve done.</p>
<p>2I’ll gladly celebrate over you</p>
<p>and sing your praise, Most High.</p>
<p>3When my enemies retreated,</p>
<p>they staggered and died in front of you</p>
<p>4because you judged in my favor;</p>
<p>you sat on your throne and judged justly.</p>
<p>5You’ve rebuked the nations,</p>
<p>destroyed the wicked,</p>
<p>and blotted out their names forever.</p>
<p>6Your enemies have ended up in permanent ruins;</p>
<p>you’ve uprooted their towns;</p>
<p>the very memory of them is gone.	Ps 9:1-6</p>
<p>7But Yahveh reigns as king forever,</p>
<p>rendering judgment from his throne.</p>
<p>8He judges the world justly,</p>
<p>delivers verdicts evenhandedly,</p>
<p>9a stronghold for oppressed people,</p>
<p>a fortress in troubled times,</p>
<p>10trusted by those who know him</p>
<p>because he doesn’t abandon the ones who depend on him.</p>
<p>Ps 9:7-10</p>
<p>11Sing praises to Yahveh that lives in Zion;</p>
<p>tell what all he’s done.</p>
<p>12He that avenges murder remembers the helpless;</p>
<p>he doesn’t forget the cries of those who suffer.</p>
<p>13Be gracious to me, Yahveh;</p>
<p>look at how those who hate me treat me.</p>
<p>Lift me up from death</p>
<p>14so I can publicly praise you</p>
<p>and celebrate in Zion’s gates over your deliverance.</p>
<p>15The nations fall into the pit they dig</p>
<p>and catch their feet in the net they hide.</p>
<p>16Yahveh makes himself known</p>
<p>for carrying out judgment.</p>
<p>Sinners snare themselves in their own traps. 	Ps 9:11-16</p>
<p>[Higgaion]</p>
<p>17The sinful go down to Sheol;</p>
<p>so does every nation that forgets God.</p>
<p>18Needy people won’t be overlooked forever;</p>
<p>the hopes of the depressed won’t perish.</p>
<p>19Don’t let people prevail, Yahveh;</p>
<p>judge the nations.</p>
<p>20Put them in fear;</p>
<p>remind them that they’re mere mortals.			Ps 9:17-20</p>
<p>Psalm 10</p>
<p>1Why stand so far away, Yahveh?</p>
<p>Why hide when trouble comes?</p>
<p>2Sinners hunt down the poor in arrogance</p>
<p>and get themselves caught in their own schemes.</p>
<p>3They brag about their sinful desires;</p>
<p>they bless the greedy and curse Yahveh.</p>
<p>4In their arrogance, they don’t trust in him;</p>
<p>they just keep acting like there’s no God.	Ps 10:1-4</p>
<p>5Yet they always seem to prosper;</p>
<p>they don’t see your coming judgments from on high;</p>
<p>they sneer at adversaries</p>
<p>6and keep telling themselves, “We’re all set;</p>
<p>nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.”</p>
<p>7They curse, deceive, and oppress;</p>
<p>scheming and sin are on the tip of their tongue.</p>
<p>8They lie in ambush in villages,</p>
<p>kill innocent people in private,</p>
<p>and search for the unfortunate in stealth.</p>
<p>9They lurk in hiding places like lions in a den</p>
<p>and sneak around to pounce on helpless people</p>
<p>when they snare them in their nets.</p>
<p>10They crouch and slink down;</p>
<p>the unfortunate fall under their power.</p>
<p>11They tell themselves, “God won’t remember;</p>
<p>he doesn’t pay attention to what’s going on;</p>
<p>he won’t even see it.”	Ps 10:5-11</p>
<p>12Raise up your hand, Yahveh;</p>
<p>remember the helpless.</p>
<p>13Why do sinners renounce you?</p>
<p>Why tell themselves you won’t call them to account?</p>
<p>14You do see trouble and distress;</p>
<p>so you will take care of it.</p>
<p>Poor people commit themselves to you,</p>
<p>and you defend orphans.</p>
<p>15Break the arms of bad people;</p>
<p>search out sinners till there’s none left to find.</p>
<p>16Yahveh, you’re King forever;</p>
<p>nations perish at your hand.</p>
<p>17You listen to what the humble need</p>
<p>and increase your mercy toward them.</p>
<p>18You vindicate the orphan and the oppressed</p>
<p>so worldly people can’t abuse them anymore.	Ps 10:12-18</p>
<p>Psalm 11</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1I rely on Yahveh’s protection;</p>
<p>so why tell me,</p>
<p>“Flee like a bird to the mountains</p>
<p>2because the ungodly are bending the bow;</p>
<p>they’re putting their arrow to the string</p>
<p>to shoot from the shadows at the godly in heart.</p>
<p>3If the foundations of society collapse,</p>
<p>what can good people do?”</p>
<p>4Yahveh is in his holy Temple;</p>
<p>he rules from heaven,</p>
<p>watching everyone,</p>
<p>examining each one.</p>
<p>5He tests the good and the bad</p>
<p>and hates the ones that love violence.</p>
<p>6He’ll rain burning coals on sinners;</p>
<p>he’ll punish them with fire, sulfur, and scorching wind</p>
<p>7because he’s good and loves goodness.</p>
<p>Good people get to meet him face to face.		Ps 11:1-7</p>
<p>Psalm 12</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to The Eight-String Lyre</p>
<p>1Help, Yahveh; there aren’t any decent people left;</p>
<p>the faithful are disappearing.</p>
<p>2Neighbors lie to one another</p>
<p>and speak with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.</p>
<p>3May Yahveh cut off their flattering lips</p>
<p>and bragging tongues 4that say</p>
<p>“We can talk our way out of anything;</p>
<p>they’re our lips; who’s going to stop us?”</p>
<p>5Yahveh says, “Since the oppressed are suffering violence</p>
<p>and the needy groan,</p>
<p>I’ll come to give them the protection they long for.” 	Ps 12:1-5</p>
<p>6Your promises are pure, Yahveh,</p>
<p>like silver refined in a furnace seven times.</p>
<p>7Keep us; protect us from this generation</p>
<p>8that struts around, displaying its contempt. 	Ps 12:6-8</p>
<p>Psalm 13</p>
<p>1Yahveh, are you going to forget about me forever?</p>
<p>How long will you ignore me?</p>
<p>2How long must I counsel myself in constant sorrow?</p>
<p>How long will my enemies lord it over me?</p>
<p>3Think about me and respond to me, Yahveh my God;</p>
<p>brighten my eyes so they don’t grow dull as in death,</p>
<p>4so my enemies won’t brag about defeating me</p>
<p>and celebrate over my downfall.</p>
<p>5I rely on your enduring love;</p>
<p>I’m happy because you’ve delivered me.</p>
<p>6I’ll sing to you, Yahveh,</p>
<p>because you’ve blessed me wonderfully.		Ps 13:1-6</p>
<p>Psalm 14</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Fools keep telling themselves there’s no God,</p>
<p>corrupt people that do corrupt things;</p>
<p>none of them does what’s right.</p>
<p>2Yahveh looks down from heaven</p>
<p>to see if there’s anybody that lives wisely,</p>
<p>if anybody seeks him.</p>
<p>3But they’ve all veered off course and become corrupted;</p>
<p>not a one of them does what’s right, not a one.</p>
<p>4Don’t sinners realize what they’re doing</p>
<p>when they eat up my people like bread</p>
<p>and refuse to call on me?</p>
<p>5Terror will overwhelm them later</p>
<p>because I’m taking the good people’s side.</p>
<p>6Oppressors try to frustrate the endeavors of the oppressed,</p>
<p>but I’m their refuge.</p>
<p>7Oh that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion!</p>
<p>When Yahveh restores his captive people,</p>
<p>Jacob will celebrate; Israel will be happy.		Ps 14:1-7</p>
<p>Psalm 15</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, who can live in your Tabernacle?</p>
<p>Who can reside on your holy hill?</p>
<p>2Those who act with integrity,</p>
<p>who do what’s right and tell the truth;</p>
<p>3who don’t mistreat their neighbors</p>
<p>or join in gossiping about their friends;</p>
<p>4who despise reprobates,</p>
<p>but honor people that respect Yahveh,</p>
<p>who even swear to their own disadvantage</p>
<p>and carry it through,</p>
<p>5that don’t charge interest</p>
<p>or accept bribes against innocent people.</p>
<p>People like that will always be secure.	Ps 15:1-5</p>
<p>Psalm 16</p>
<p>A Mikhtam of David</p>
<p>1Protect me, Yahveh; you’re my refuge.</p>
<p>2I say, “You’re my Lord;</p>
<p>apart from you, I don’t have anything good.”</p>
<p>3The godly people on earth are the noble ones I delight in.</p>
<p>4Trouble multiplies</p>
<p>for those who rush off to some other god;</p>
<p>I won’t pour out blood offerings with them</p>
<p>or even say their names.</p>
<p>5Yahveh is my permanent possession, my cup;</p>
<p>he holds in safekeeping what’s allotted to me.</p>
<p>6The boundary lines of my inheritance fall in good places;</p>
<p>it’s a beautiful land.	Ps 16:1-6</p>
<p>7I’ll bless Yahveh that guides me;</p>
<p>even at night my heart teaches me.</p>
<p>8I keep himY continually beside me,</p>
<p>at my right hand so I don’t get unsettled.</p>
<p>9So I’m happy and celebrate;</p>
<p>my body will also rest secure</p>
<p>10because you won’t abandon me in Sheol,</p>
<p>or let your Holy One decay.</p>
<p>11You’ll show me how to live;</p>
<p>there’s total joy when you’re around,</p>
<p>with eternal delights with you.	Ps 16:7-11</p>
<p>Psalm 17</p>
<p>A Prayer of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, listen to my call for justice;</p>
<p>pay attention to my sincere prayer.</p>
<p>2Declare me innocent</p>
<p>because you see that I’m righteous.</p>
<p>3You’ve visited me at night and tested my heart;</p>
<p>you’ve put me on trial and found nothing wrong;</p>
<p>I’m determined not to say anything sinful.</p>
<p>4Your word has kept me from following</p>
<p>the example of cruel people.</p>
<p>5My steps have stayed on your path;</p>
<p>my feet haven’t slipped.	Ps 17:1-5</p>
<p>6I’m calling on you, God,</p>
<p>because you answer me.</p>
<p>7Demonstrate your amazing, enduring love</p>
<p>for the ones that take refuge in you</p>
<p>from people that rebel against you.</p>
<p>8Keep me as the pupil of your eye;</p>
<p>hide me under your wings</p>
<p>9from sinners who plunder,</p>
<p>from deadly enemies that surround me,</p>
<p>10that have no mercy in their hearts,</p>
<p>and brag arrogantly.</p>
<p>11They’ve tracked me down and surrounded me,</p>
<p>and threaten to knock me to the ground.</p>
<p>12They’re like lions eager to maul me,</p>
<p>like young lions lurking in ambush.	Ps 17:6-12</p>
<p>13Confront them, Yahveh; knock them down;</p>
<p>deliver me from sinners with the sword</p>
<p>14that’s in your hand,</p>
<p>from people who’ve cast their lot in this life,</p>
<p>whose stomach you fill with your treasure.</p>
<p>They’re satisfied with having children</p>
<p>and leaving their wealth to their babies.</p>
<p>15But because I’m righteous,</p>
<p>I’ll be satisfied by seeing you when I wake up.	 Ps 17:13-15</p>
<p>Psalm 18 (2 Samuel 22)</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,</p>
<p>Yahveh’s servant, who sang this song to him</p>
<p>when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>1“I love you, Yahveh, my strength;</p>
<p>2my fortress, my deliverer,</p>
<p>my God, my Rock, my Refuge;</p>
<p>my shield, the place that saves me, my stronghold.”</p>
<p>3I called on him who deserves praise,</p>
<p>and he saved me from my enemies.</p>
<p>4The waves of death entangled me;</p>
<p>the torrents of destruction flooded over me.</p>
<p>5the cords of Sheol tied me down;</p>
<p>the snares of death had entrapped me.</p>
<p>6In my desperation, I cried out to Yahveh,</p>
<p>and he heard me in his Temple.	Ps 18:1-6</p>
<p>7Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook</p>
<p>because he was angry.</p>
<p>8Smoke poured out of his nostrils;</p>
<p>consuming fire flared from his mouth;</p>
<p>glowing coals erupted from him.</p>
<p>9He lowered the sky too</p>
<p>and came down with dense darkness under his feet.</p>
<p>10He rode on a cherub</p>
<p>and came flying swiftly on the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>11He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion,</p>
<p>with dark rain clouds veiling his advance</p>
<p>12and hiding the brightness around him,</p>
<p>while hailstones and lightning bolts broke through his clouds.</p>
<p>13Yahveh thundered from the sky;</p>
<p>the Most High raised his voice;</p>
<p>hailstones and lightning bolts resounded.</p>
<p>14He shot his arrows and scattered my enemies;</p>
<p>lightning flashes routed them.</p>
<p>15Then the water in the ocean receded;</p>
<p>the seabed was exposed</p>
<p>at his rebuke,</p>
<p>at the blast from his nostrils.	Ps 18:7-15</p>
<p>16He reached down from on high and grabbed me</p>
<p>and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.</p>
<p>17He delivered me from enemies</p>
<p>that hated me,</p>
<p>that were too strong for me.</p>
<p>18They attacked me at a time of distress,</p>
<p>but Yahveh was my buttress.</p>
<p>19He brought me out to a safe place</p>
<p>and rescued me because he delighted in me.</p>
<p>20Yahveh rewarded me for my goodness,</p>
<p>for my innocence;</p>
<p>21I’d kept his ways</p>
<p>and hadn’t sinned by leaving him;</p>
<p>22his ordinances all stayed with me;</p>
<p>I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.</p>
<p>23I stood blameless in his presence</p>
<p>because I’d kept myself from sinning.</p>
<p>24So Yahveh rewarded me for my goodness,</p>
<p>for my innocence.	Ps 18:16-24</p>
<p>25To the kind you’re kind;</p>
<p>with the blameless you’re blameless;</p>
<p>26with the pure you’re pure;</p>
<p>with the treacherous you’re shrewd.</p>
<p>27You rescue the humble</p>
<p>but bring down the haughty.</p>
<p>28You’re my lamp, Yahveh my God,</p>
<p>and shine light into my darkness.</p>
<p>29With your help, I can crush a whole battalion</p>
<p>I can scale any wall.	Ps 18:25-29</p>
<p>30God’s way is perfect;</p>
<p>Yahveh’s promise proves true;</p>
<p>he’s a shield for everyone that depends on his protection.</p>
<p>31Who is God except Yahveh?</p>
<p>Who is a rock but our God,</p>
<p>32who wraps me in strength</p>
<p>and makes my way safe?</p>
<p>33He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves</p>
<p>and stands me securely on high ground.</p>
<p>34He trains my hands for battle</p>
<p>and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow.</p>
<p>35He’s given me his deliverance as a shield;</p>
<p>his help has made me great.</p>
<p>36He’s widened the path where I step</p>
<p>so my feet don’t slip.	Ps 18:30-36</p>
<p>37I chased my enemies and overtook them;</p>
<p>I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.</p>
<p>38I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again;</p>
<p>they fell under my feet</p>
<p>39because you wrapped me in strength for battle</p>
<p>and subdued my assailants.</p>
<p>40You’ve made my enemies retreat;</p>
<p>I destroyed the ones that hated me.</p>
<p>41They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;</p>
<p>they even cried out to Yahveh, but he didn’t answer.</p>
<p>42I pulverized them like dust in the wind,</p>
<p>emptied them out like dirt on the street.</p>
<p>43You delivered me from conflict with the people</p>
<p>and placed me at the head of nations;</p>
<p>people I didn’t know now serve me.</p>
<p>44Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;</p>
<p>45they lose heart and come cringing out of their fortresses.</p>
<p>Ps 18:37-45</p>
<p>46Yahveh lives; praise be to my Rock;</p>
<p>exalted be God that delivers me,</p>
<p>47that avenges me,</p>
<p>that subdues nations under me.</p>
<p>48that rescues me from my enemies,</p>
<p>lifts me above my attackers,</p>
<p>and delivers me from violent people.</p>
<p>49So I’ll thank you among the nations, Yahveh,</p>
<p>and sing your praises.</p>
<p>50You give victory for your king</p>
<p>and show enduring love to your anointed one,</p>
<p>to me [David] and my descendants forever.		Ps 18:46-50</p>
<p>Psalm 19</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>1The heavens show God’s glory;</p>
<p>the sky displays his workmanship.</p>
<p>2Day in and day out they speak;</p>
<p>night after night they display intelligence.</p>
<p>3There’s no speech or words;</p>
<p>there’s nothing to hear.</p>
<p>4Their testimony goes out to the whole world,</p>
<p>their message to the ends of the earth;</p>
<p>in them he’s pitched a tent for the sun.</p>
<p>5It’s like a groom coming out of his room,</p>
<p>excited like a man in shape to run a race.</p>
<p>6It rises at one side of the sky</p>
<p>and makes its circuit to the other;</p>
<p>nothing escapes its warmth.		Ps 19:1-6</p>
<p>7The Law of Yahveh is perfect for reviving the soul;</p>
<p>his Testimony is reliable for making simple people wise.</p>
<p>8The precepts of Yahveh are right, bringing happiness;</p>
<p>his commandments are clear, enlightening the mind.</p>
<p>9Respect for Yahveh is pure, lasting forever;</p>
<p>his judgments are true and altogether just.</p>
<p>10They’re worth more than lots of fine gold;</p>
<p>they’re sweeter than honey that drips from the honeycomb.</p>
<p>11They warn me</p>
<p>and reward me when I keep them.</p>
<p>12Who can see their own mistakes?</p>
<p>So declare me innocent of my unseen faults.</p>
<p>13Restrain me from presumptuous sins;</p>
<p>don’t let them gain control of me.</p>
<p>Then I’ll be blameless and relieved for not sinning.</p>
<p>14May what I think and say</p>
<p>be acceptable to you, Yahveh, my Rock, my Redeemer.	Ps 19:7-14</p>
<p>Psalm 20</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1When trouble comes, may Yahveh answer you!</p>
<p>May Jacob’s God set you safely on high!</p>
<p>2May he send help from the sanctuary</p>
<p>and support you from Zion!</p>
<p>3May he remember your many meal offerings</p>
<p>and find your burnt offerings acceptable.</p>
<p>4May he grant you your heart’s desire</p>
<p>and make your plans successful.</p>
<p>5You’ll sing for joy over his deliverance</p>
<p>and hoist your banners in his name.</p>
<p>May Yahveh give you your petitions.		Ps 20:1-5</p>
<p>6We know Yahveh saves his anointed ones;</p>
<p>he answers them from his holy heaven</p>
<p>with the saving strength of his right hand.</p>
<p>7Some nations boast about chariots and horses,</p>
<p>but we’ll boast about Yahveh our God.</p>
<p>8Those nations will collapse and fall,</p>
<p>but we’ll rise up and stand tall.</p>
<p>9Give us victory, Yahveh, when we call.	Ps 20:6-9</p>
<p>Psalm 21</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, the king delights in your strength;</p>
<p>he’s happy because you’ve helped him.</p>
<p>2You’ve given him his heart’s desire;</p>
<p>you didn’t withhold his request.</p>
<p>3You met him with blessings</p>
<p>and crowned him with fine gold.</p>
<p>4He asked you for life,</p>
<p>and you gave him life everlasting.</p>
<p>5He has great honor because you delivered him</p>
<p>and endowed him with splendor and majesty.</p>
<p>6You make him blessed forever</p>
<p>and happy because you’re with him.		Ps 21:1-6</p>
<p>7The king trusts in Yahveh;</p>
<p>because of the enduring love of the Most High,</p>
<p>he won’t be deposed.</p>
<p>8You’ll discover all your enemies;</p>
<p>you’ll find out who hates you.</p>
<p>9You’ll throw them into a blazing furnace in your anger;</p>
<p>you’ll burn them up in your wrath</p>
<p>10and destroy their offspring.</p>
<p>11Though they’ve devised a coup to harm you,</p>
<p>they won’t succeed.</p>
<p>12You’ll put them to flight</p>
<p>when you snap your bowstring at their faces.</p>
<p>13Be honored in your strength, Yahveh;</p>
<p>we’ll sing praises about your power.		Ps 21:7-13</p>
<p>Psalm 22</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to The Hind of the Dawn</p>
<p>1My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>
<p>Why are you so far from helping me,</p>
<p>so far from my groaning?</p>
<p>2I call out in the daytime, but you don’t answer;</p>
<p>I don’t get any relief at night.</p>
<p>3Yet you’re holy,</p>
<p>enthroned on Israel’s praises.</p>
<p>4Our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.</p>
<p>5They called out to you, and you saved them;</p>
<p>they relied on you, and you didn’t disappoint them. 	Ps 22:1-5</p>
<p>6But I’m a worm, not a man;</p>
<p>people scorn me and despise me.</p>
<p>7Everybody that sees me makes fun of me;</p>
<p>they make faces at me and shake their heads at me and say,</p>
<p>8“Entrust yourself to Yahveh; let him deliver you;</p>
<p>let him rescue you because he delights in you!”</p>
<p>9Yet you’re the One that delivered me from the womb</p>
<p>and made me trust when I was on my mother’s breasts.</p>
<p>10I’ve depended on you from birth;</p>
<p>you’ve been my God from my mother’s womb.	 	Ps 22:6-10</p>
<p>11Don’t be distant because trouble’s near;</p>
<p>there’s nobody else to help me.</p>
<p>12Many bulls have surrounded me;</p>
<p>fierce bulls from Bashan have gathered around me.</p>
<p>13They bellow at me</p>
<p>like ravening, roaring lions.</p>
<p>14I’m being poured out like water;</p>
<p>all my bones are out of joint;</p>
<p>my heart’s melting like wax.</p>
<p>15My strength has dried up like a potsherd,</p>
<p>my tongue is sticking to my jaws,</p>
<p>and you’ve laid me down dead in the dust.</p>
<p>16Dogs have surrounded me;</p>
<p>an crowd has ganged up on me;</p>
<p>they’ve pierced my hands and feet.</p>
<p>17I can count all my bones;</p>
<p>people are staring at me;</p>
<p>18they’re dividing up my clothes</p>
<p>and gambling for my garments.		Ps 22:11-18</p>
<p>19Don’t be distant, Yahveh;</p>
<p>you’re my only help; hurry and help me.</p>
<p>20Deliver me from the sword;</p>
<p>rescue me from the dog’s paws;</p>
<p>21save me from the lion’s mouth</p>
<p>and the wild ox’s horns.	Ps 22:19-21</p>
<p>22I’ll tell my brothers about you</p>
<p>and praise you when your people gather.</p>
<p>23You that respect Yahveh, praise him;</p>
<p>stand in awe of him, descendants of Israel,</p>
<p>24because he hasn’t looked down on the oppressed</p>
<p>or ignored them;</p>
<p>when they’ve appealed to him for help, he’s listened. 	Ps 22:22-24</p>
<p>25The theme of my praise in the great assembly comes from you;</p>
<p>I’ll fulfill my vows in front of people that respect you.</p>
<p>26The poverty-stricken will eat and be satisfied;</p>
<p>those who rely on Yahveh will praise him.</p>
<p>May their hearts live forever!	Ps 22:25-26</p>
<p>27The most distant places will remember and turn to Yahveh;</p>
<p>all the families in the nations will worship him</p>
<p>28because the kingdom belongs to him;</p>
<p>he rules the nations.</p>
<p>29Prosperous people will eat and worship;</p>
<p>everyone that goes down to dust will bow to him,</p>
<p>all those who can’t keep themselves alive.</p>
<p>30Posterity will serve him;</p>
<p>one generation will tell the next one about him.</p>

<p>2He beds me down in green pasture</p>
<p>and leads me beside still water.</p>
<p>3He refreshes me</p>
<p>and guides me along good paths for his honor.</p>
<p>4Even though I walk through the darkest valley,</p>
<p>I won’t be afraid, because he’s with me;</p>
<p>his rod and staff reassure me.</p>
<p>5You set a table for me in front of my enemies;</p>
<p>you anoint my head with oil;</p>
<p>my cup runs over.</p>

<p>and I’ll live in Yahveh’s house forever.	Ps 23:1-6</p>
<p>Psalm 24</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahveh,</p>
<p>the world and those who live here.</p>
<p>2He positioned land higher than seas,</p>
<p>more elevated than ocean currents.</p>
<p>3Who can climb his mountain</p>
<p>and stand in his holy place?</p>
<p>4People with clean hands and pure hearts,</p>
<p>who don’t offer themselves up to idols</p>
<p>or lie under oath.</p>
<p>5They’ll receive a blessing from Yahveh,</p>
<p>goodness from the God who keeps them safe.</p>

<p>and worship him—even the House of Jacob.	Ps 24:1-6</p>

<p>1I hold my life up to you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>2I trust you;</p>
<p>don’t let me down</p>
<p>or let my enemies celebrate over my defeat.</p>
<p>3Nobody that waits for you will be discredited;</p>
<p>people who deal treacherously</p>
<p>are the ones that will be discredited.	Ps 25:1-3</p>
<p>4Yahveh, let me know your ways;</p>
<p>teach me your paths;</p>
<p>5lead me in your truth</p>
<p>because you keep me safe;</p>
<p>I’ll always depend on you.</p>
<p>6Remember your mercy and enduring love</p>
<p>that have existed from ages past.</p>
<p>7Don’t keep in mind the sins I committed when I was young;</p>
<p>remember me in the light of your enduring love.	Ps 25:4-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh is good and just,</p>
<p>so he instructs sinners in his way</p>
<p>9and leads the humble in what’s right.</p>
<p>10Everything he does comes from truth and enduring love</p>
<p>for those who keep his covenant and testimonies.</p>
<p>11For your own honor,</p>
<p>pardon my sin because it’s great. 	Ps 25:8-11</p>

<p>He’ll instruct you in what to choose</p>
<p>13so you’ll keep succeeding</p>
<p>and your offspring will inherit the land.</p>
<p>14People that respect Yahveh are his friends;</p>
<p>he’ll make his covenant known to them.</p>
<p>15I keep looking to him</p>
<p>because he untangles my feet from my enemies’ net.	Ps 25:12-15</p>

<p>1Declare me innocent, Yahveh,</p>
<p>because I’ve conducted myself with integrity</p>
<p>and trusted in you without wavering.</p>
<p>2Examine me, put me on trial,</p>
<p>test my motives and attitude.</p>
<p>3I keep my eye on your unfailing love</p>
<p>and follow you faithfully.</p>
<p>4I don’t sit with deceitful people</p>
<p>or run around with pretenders.</p>
<p>5I detest the company of unreliable people</p>
<p>and refuse to join in with sinners.</p>
<p>6I’ll wash my hands to express my innocence</p>
<p>and frequent your altar, Yahveh,</p>
<p>7singing my gratitude</p>
<p>and telling about the wonderful things you’ve done.	Ps 26:1-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh, I love the Temple where you live,</p>
<p>the place where your glory lies.</p>
<p>9Don’t carry off my soul with sinners,</p>
<p>or my life with bloodthirsty people</p>
<p>10that devise sinful schemes</p>
<p>and hand out bribes left and right.</p>
<p>11But I maintain my integrity;</p>

<p>1Yahveh is my light and salvation;</p>

<p>He defends me;</p>
<p>who am I going to dread?</p>
<p>2When bad people come to devour me,</p>
<p>they stumble and fall.</p>
<p>3Though an army attacks me, it won’t frighten me;</p>
<p>though war breaks out against me, I’ll stay confident.	Ps 27:1-3</p>
<p>4I ask Yahveh for one thing—what I look for most:</p>
<p>to live in his house my whole life,</p>
<p>to see his beauty and meditate in his Temple.</p>
<p>5When trouble comes, he’ll shelter me;</p>
<p>he’ll hide me in a secret place</p>
<p>and station me on a high rock.</p>
<p>6I’ll hold up my head above my enemies;</p>
<p>in his Tabernacle I’ll offer sacrifices with shouts of joy</p>
<p>and sing praises to Yahveh.	Ps 27:4-6</p>
<p>7Listen when I call out, Yahveh;</p>
<p>be gracious and answer me.</p>
<p>8You said, “Seek me,”</p>
<p>my heart and soul responded, “I’ll seek you.”</p>
<p>9Don’t ignore me</p>
<p>or turn away angry.</p>
<p>You’ve been my help;</p>
<p>don’t abandon me, God my Savior.</p>
<p>10Even if my parents exposed me I as an infant to die,</p>
<p>you would pick me up.	Ps 27:7-10</p>
<p>11Teach me your way, Yahveh;</p>
<p>lead me on a level path away from my enemies.</p>
<p>12Don’t turn me over to them,</p>
<p>because lying witnesses have taken the stand against me,</p>
<p>the kind that threatens violence with every breath.</p>
<p>13I’d have despaired if I hadn’t believed</p>
<p>I’d see Yahveh’s goodness while I was alive.</p>
<p>14So wait for him;</p>
<p>be strong and courageous.</p>
<p>Yes, wait for him.	Ps 27:11-14</p>

<p>otherwise, I’ll be like someone going down to the Pit.</p>
<p>2Help me when I plead for help,</p>
<p>when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary.</p>
<p>3Don’t drag me away with the wicked,</p>
<p>with those who sin,</p>
<p>who offer their neighbors peace</p>
<p>while selfish motives lurk in their hearts.</p>
<p>4Pay them back according to their deeds,</p>
<p>in proportion to the sin they practice.</p>
<p>5Since they don’t appreciate</p>
<p>what you’ve made and done,</p>
<p>tear them down and don’t rebuild them.	Ps 28:1-5</p>
<p>6Bless Yahveh for listening to my petition.</p>
<p>7He’s my strength and shield;</p>
<p>I trust him and he helps me;</p>
<p>so I celebrate and thank him with songs.</p>
<p>8He’s his people’s strength,</p>

<p>attribute to Yahveh honor and strength.</p>
<p>2Honor him like he deserves;</p>
<p>worship him in his holy splendor.	Ps 29:1-2</p>
<p>3The sound from Yahveh carries out over the water;</p>
<p>our glorious God thunders across the ocean expanse.</p>
<p>4His voice is loud and majestic</p>
<p>5and blows down cedars in Lebanon.</p>
<p>6He makes Lebanon skip like a calf</p>
<p>and Sirion [Mt. Hermon] jump around like a young wild ox.</p>
<p>7The sound from Yahveh flashes out lightning bolts</p>
<p>8and shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh;</p>
<p>9it makes deer go into labor</p>
<p>and strips the trees bare.</p>
<p>In his Temple everyone shouts, “Glory!”</p>
<p>10Yahveh sits like a king above the flood,</p>
<p>enthroned forever.</p>
<p>11He gives his people courage</p>
<p>and blesses them with peace.	Ps 29:3-11</p>
<p>Psalm 30</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>A Song at the Dedication of the Temple</p>
<p>1I’ll praise you, Yahveh, because you’ve rescued me;</p>
<p>you haven’t let my enemies celebrate victory over me.</p>
<p>2I appealed to you for help, my God,</p>
<p>and you restored my health;</p>
<p>3you brought me up from Sheol;</p>
<p>you kept me from going down to the Pit.</p>
<p>4Sing praise to Yahveh, his holy people;</p>
<p>thank him 5because his anger is only for a little while,</p>
<p>but his blessing lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p>Weeping may go on all night,</p>
<p>but rejoicing comes in the morning.	Ps 30:1-5</p>
<p>6In my good fortune, I said, “I’ll never be shaken.”</p>
<p>7Your blessing, Yahveh, made me feel as stable as a mountain;</p>
<p>but then you hid from me, and I was shattered.</p>
<p>8I called out to you in a petition:</p>
<p>9“What does my death accomplish if you let me go down to the Pit?</p>
<p>Will dust praise you and tell about your faithfulness?</p>
<p>10“Hear me, Yahveh; be gracious and help me.”</p>
<p>11You turned my mourning into dancing;</p>
<p>you removed my burlap of mourning</p>
<p>and dressed me in happiness.</p>
<p>12Now I can sing praise to you unrestrained;</p>
<p>I can be eternally grateful to you.	Ps 30:6-12</p>
<p>Psalm 31</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1I take refuge in you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>never let me be disgraced;</p>
<p>in your goodness protect me.</p>
<p>2Listen to me, rescue me quickly;</p>
<p>be a rock for me,</p>
<p>a strong fortress to save me.</p>
<p>3You’re my rock and fortress;</p>
<p>for your honor, lead me and guide me.</p>
<p>4Free me out of the trap people secretly laid for me</p>
<p>because you’re my protection.</p>
<p>5I’m entrusting my spirit to you;</p>
<p>rescue me, Yahveh, true God. 	Ps 31:1-5</p>
<p>6I detest those who respect worthless idols;</p>
<p>I trust in you, Yahveh.</p>
<p>7I’ll be happy in your enduring love,</p>
<p>because you see my difficulties</p>
<p>and know the trouble I’m in,</p>
<p>8because you haven’t handed me over to my enemies;</p>
<p>you’ve set me on a spacious place.	Ps 31:6-8</p>
<p>9Be gracious to me in my distress, Yahveh;</p>
<p>my eyes are melting away with grief,</p>
<p>my soul and body are getting weak as well</p>
<p>10because I live in constant sorrow;</p>
<p>I spend my years in sighing.</p>
<p>My strength is failing because of sin;</p>
<p>my body is wasting away.</p>
<p>11Because I have so many enemies,</p>
<p>my neighbors despise me,</p>
<p>my acquaintances abhor me,</p>
<p>and people shun me in the streets.</p>
<p>12I’m forgotten like someone long dead,</p>
<p>out of mind like a broken pot.</p>
<p>13I hear people’s slander;</p>
<p>there’s terror on every side;</p>
<p>my enemies conspire against me</p>
<p>and lay plots to kill me.	Ps 31:9-13</p>
<p>14But I trust you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>I swear, “You’re my God.”</p>
<p>15My future’s in your hands;</p>
<p>rescue me from my enemies,</p>
<p>from those who persecute me.</p>
<p>16Smile at me;</p>
<p>save me with your enduring love.</p>
<p>17Don’t let my enemies disgrace me, Yahveh,</p>
<p>because I’m calling on you.</p>
<p>Put sinners to disgrace;</p>
<p>let them be silent in Sheol.</p>
<p>18Make lying lips be mute</p>
<p>that insult the good with pride and contempt.	Ps 31:14-18</p>
<p>19How great your goodness is</p>
<p>that you’ve stored up for those who respect you,</p>
<p>that you’ve shown to people that take refuge in you</p>
<p>so others can see.</p>
<p>20You secretly hide them with you away from people’s plots,</p>
<p>and shelter them from the conflict that tongues can cause.</p>
<p>21Bless Yahveh</p>
<p>because he showed me his enduring love</p>
<p>when I was surrounded like a city under siege.</p>
<p>22I despaired in my alarm, “I can’t see you!”</p>
<p>but you heard my appeal.	Ps 31:19-22</p>
<p>23Love Yahveh, all you holy people!</p>
<p>He preserves the faithful</p>
<p>and repays those who act arrogantly.</p>
<p>24Be strong and courageous,</p>
<p>you that rest your hopes in him!	Ps 31:23-24</p>
<p>Psalm 32</p>
<p>A Maskil. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1How blessed they are whose sin God forgives,</p>
<p>whose transgression he covers;</p>
<p>2whose disobedience Yahveh doesn’t hold against them,</p>
<p>whose spirit doesn’t harbor deceit!</p>
<p>3When I didn’t acknowledge my sin,</p>
<p>my body wasted away,</p>
<p>I moaned all day,</p>
<p>4your hand weighed on me day and night,</p>
<p>my strength drained away in the summer heat.</p>
<p>5When I acknowledged it and said, “I’ll confess my sin to Yahveh,”</p>
<p>you forgave me.</p>
<p>6So everyone that’s godly needs to pray to you</p>
<p>while there’s time;</p>
<p>so when distress floods in,</p>
<p>it won’t overwhelm them.</p>
<p>7You’re our hiding place</p>
<p>for protecting us from trouble</p>
<p>and surrounding us with songs about deliverance.	Ps 32:1-7</p>
<p>8I’ll teach you the way to go;</p>
<p>I’ll focus my attention on you and advise you.</p>
<p>9Don’t be like a senseless horse or mule</p>
<p>that needs a bit and bridle to make it obey.</p>
<p>10Sinful people incur lots of sorrow,</p>
<p>but enduring love surrounds those who trust Yahveh.</p>
<p>11Be happy and celebrate in him;</p>
<p>shout for joy, all of you with godly hearts.	Ps 32:8-11</p>
<p>Psalm 33</p>
<p>1Sing for joy to Yahveh, good people;</p>
<p>praise is fitting for the godly.</p>
<p>2Give himY thanks with a lyre;</p>
<p>sing praises to him with a ten-string harp.</p>
<p>3Sing a new song to him;</p>
<p>play skillfully and shout for joy.</p>
<p>4You can believe what heY says</p>
<p>and rely on what he does.</p>
<p>5He loves goodness and justice,</p>
<p>and fills the world with his enduring love.	Ps 33:1-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh made the sky with a word,</p>
<p>all its host with the breath from his mouth.</p>
<p>7He gathered the water in the ocean</p>
<p>and stored up the depths in reservoirs.</p>
<p>8The whole world must respect him</p>
<p>and stand in awe of him.</p>
<p>9He spoke and it happened;</p>
<p>he commanded and it occurred.</p>
<p>10Yahveh overrides the counsel of nations</p>
<p>and frustrates the peoples’ plans.</p>
<p>11His counsel stands forever;</p>
<p>his plans endure across the generations.	Ps 33:6-11</p>
<p>12The nation is blessed whose God is Yahveh,</p>
<p>the people he’s chosen for his inheritance.</p>
<p>13Yahveh looks down from heaven at everyone;</p>
<p>14from where he sits, he sees the whole human race.</p>
<p>15He made their hearts;</p>
<p>so he understands what they do.</p>
<p>16A king doesn’t prevail by his large army;</p>
<p>a soldier doesn’t save himself by his great strength.</p>
<p>17A warhorse gives false hope for victory;</p>
<p>it doesn’t deliver anyone by its power.	Ps 33:12-17</p>
<p>18Yahveh watches over those who respect him,</p>
<p>who place their hope in his enduring love</p>
<p>19to deliver them from death</p>
<p>and keep them alive at famine time.</p>
<p>20We wait for him, our help and shield,</p>
<p>21and celebrate in him because we trust in him.</p>
<p>22Send down your enduring love to us, Yahveh,</p>
<p>because we’ve put our hope in you.	Ps 33:18-22</p>
<p>Psalm 34</p>
<p>A Psalm of David When He Faked Insanity</p>
<p>Before Abimelech, Who Drove Him Away</p>
<p>1I’ll bless Yahveh at all times</p>
<p>and praise him constantly.</p>
<p>2I’ll make my boast about him;</p>
<p>the helpless will hear it and take heart.</p>
<p>3Let’s tell how great Yahveh is;</p>
<p>let’s honor him together.</p>
<p>4I looked to Yahveh; he answered me</p>
<p>and freed me from my fears.</p>
<p>5People that look to him are radiant;</p>
<p>they never look subdued.</p>
<p>6I cried out in my suffering, and heY listened</p>
<p>and saved me from my troubles.</p>
<p>7An angel of Yahveh camps around people that respect him,</p>
<p>and he rescues them.	Ps 34:1-7</p>
<p>8Taste and find out how good Yahveh is,</p>
<p>how blessed everyone is that takes refuge in him!</p>
<p>9Respect him, his holy people;</p>
<p>those who do, have everything they need.</p>
<p>10Young lions get hungry,</p>
<p>but anyone that looks to Yahveh has everything good.</p>
<p>11Come, children, listen to me;</p>
<p>I’ll teach you to respect Yahveh.</p>
<p>12Who wants to live</p>
<p>a long time and prosper?</p>
<p>13Keep your tongue from sinning</p>
<p>and your lips from lying.</p>
<p>14Quit doing bad and do good;</p>
<p>look for peace and pursue it.	Ps 34:8-14</p>
<p>15Yahveh watches over good people</p>
<p>and hears them cry out to him.</p>
<p>16He turns against those who practice sin,</p>
<p>and erases the memory of them.</p>
<p>17When good people call for help; he listens</p>
<p>and rescues them from their troubles.</p>
<p>18He’s close to the brokenhearted</p>
<p>and saves those whose spirit is crushed.</p>
<p>19Good people face lots of trouble,</p>
<p>but Yahveh delivers them.</p>
<p>20They keep all their bones;</p>
<p>not a one of them will be broken.</p>
<p>21Sin slays the sinful;</p>
<p>God punishes those who hate the righteous.</p>
<p>22He redeems his servants;</p>
<p>he doesn’t condemn anyone that takes refuge in him.	Ps 34:15-22</p>
<p>Psalm 35</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, oppose the ones that oppose me;</p>
<p>fight those who fight me.</p>
<p>2Put on buckler and shield,</p>
<p>and come to my aid.</p>
<p>3Draw spear and javelin against my pursuers;</p>
<p>tell me you’ll save me.</p>
<p>4Dishonor the ones that want to kill me;</p>
<p>drive back and humiliate those who scheme against me.</p>
<p>5Make them like chaff in the wind,</p>
<p>with the angel of Yahveh blowing them.</p>
<p>6Make their path dark and slippery,</p>
<p>with the angel of Yahveh chasing them;</p>
<p>7for no reason they hid a net to catch me</p>
<p>and dug a pit to trap me.</p>
<p>8Bring destruction on them unawares;</p>
<p>have the net they hide catch them;</p>
<p>have them fall into that very destruction.	Ps 35:1-8</p>
<p>9I’ll be happy in Yahveh</p>
<p>and celebrate over his salvation.</p>
<p>10My very bones say, “Yahveh who is like you</p>
<p>that delivers the oppressed from people too strong for them,</p>
<p>and saves the needy from the one that robs them?”</p>
<p>11Malicious witnesses testify against me</p>
<p>and accuse me of things I don’t do.</p>
<p>12They repay me bad for good; I’m heartbroken.</p>
<p>13But when they were sick, I wore burlap;</p>
<p>I humbled myself with fasting</p>
<p>and prayed with my chin on my chest.</p>
<p>14I went about as if it was my friend or brother;</p>
<p>I bent over mourning as if it was my mother.</p>
<p>15But when I stumbled, they celebrated and ganged up on me;</p>
<p>strikers that I didn’t even know gathered against me</p>
<p>and slandered me for no reason.</p>
<p>16Like godless jesters at a feast,</p>
<p>they gnashed their teeth at me.	Ps 35:9-16</p>
<p>17Lord, how long will you just watch?</p>
<p>Rescue me from their ravages;</p>
<p>save me from those lions.</p>
<p>18I’ll thank you in the great community</p>
<p>and praise you in the mighty throng.</p>
<p>19Don’t let my enemies celebrate over me,</p>
<p>or wink maliciously who hate me.</p>
<p>20They don’t talk about peace;</p>
<p>they scheme against those who are peaceful in the land.</p>
<p>21They open their mouth wide against me,</p>
<p>“Aha, aha, we saw him do it!”	Ps 35:17-21</p>
<p>22You can see what they’re doing, Yahveh;</p>
<p>don’t stand back and not say anything.</p>
<p>23Stir yourself up, awake for my justice,</p>
<p>for my cause, my Lord and my God.</p>
<p>24Judge me, Yahveh, according to your goodness;</p>
<p>don’t let my enemies celebrate over me.</p>
<p>25Don’t let them say to themselves, “Just what we’d hoped!”</p>
<p>don’t let them say, “We’ll eat him alive!”</p>
<p>26Humiliate them who celebrate over my distress;</p>
<p>dress them in shame and dishonor</p>
<p>who vaunt themselves up over me.	Ps 35:22-26</p>
<p>27Shout for joy you that are in favor of my vindication;</p>
<p>say again and again, “Yahveh is great;</p>
<p>he delights in his servant’s prosperity.”</p>
<p>28I’ll declare your goodness and praise all day long.	Ps 35:27-28</p>
<p>Psalm 36</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Psalm of David, Yahveh’s Servant</p>
<p>1Sin speaks to sinful people’s hearts;</p>
<p>they don’t respect God at all.</p>
<p>2They flatter themselves</p>
<p>that he can’t discover their sin.</p>
<p>3Their words deceive;</p>
<p>they’ve stopped being wise and doing good.</p>
<p>4They devise schemes in bed</p>
<p>and carry them out in the morning with no qualms	Ps 36:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh, your enduring love reaches the stars;</p>
<p>your faithfulness is as high as the sky;</p>
<p>6your goodness as mighty as the mountains;</p>
<p>your justice as deep as the ocean;</p>
<p>your provision sufficient for everything that breathes.</p>
<p>7How precious that enduring love is!</p>
<p>All humanity finds protection under your wings.</p>
<p>8They drink their fill from the abundance in your house,</p>
<p>from your river of delights.</p>
<p>9You’re their fountain of life;</p>
<p>in your light they see light.</p>
<p>10Maintain your enduring love to all who know you,</p>
<p>your goodness to the godly in heart. 	Ps 36:5-10</p>
<p>11Don’t let the proud tramp on me</p>
<p>or the sinful shove me away.</p>
<p>12Let sinners fall where they sin,</p>
<p>thrown down so they can’t get up.	Ps 36:10-12</p>
<p>Psalm 37</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Don’t worry about bad people</p>
<p>or envy those who do wrong;</p>
<p>2they’ll wither like grass</p>
<p>and fade like flowers.</p>
<p>3Trust in Yahveh and do good</p>
<p>so you can live in the land and enjoy security.</p>
<p>4Delight in Yahveh,</p>
<p>and he’ll give you what your heart desires.</p>
<p>5Commit your way to him and trust in him,</p>
<p>and he’ll act on your behalf.</p>
<p>6He’ll bring forth your goodness like the dawn</p>
<p>and your vindication like the midday sun.	Ps 37:1-6</p>
<p>7Rest in Yahveh and wait patiently for him;</p>
<p>don’t worry about people that prosper</p>
<p>by carrying out dishonest schemes.</p>
<p>8Stop being mad at them; set anger aside;</p>
<p>don’t concern yourself with them;</p>
<p>that only leads to your own sinning.</p>
<p>9They’ll be destroyed,</p>
<p>but those who depend on Yahveh will inherit the land.</p>
<p>10Sinners will soon be gone;</p>
<p>you can look all over for them,</p>
<p>but they won’t be there.</p>
<p>11It’s the humble will inherit the land</p>
<p>and delight in abundant prosperity.	Ps 37:7-11</p>
<p>12The wicked plot against the good</p>
<p>and gnash their teeth at them.</p>
<p>13But Yahveh laughs at them,</p>
<p>because he sees what’s going to happen to them.</p>
<p>14Sinners draw the sword and bend the bow</p>
<p>to bring down the poor and needy,</p>
<p>and slay the godly;</p>
<p>15but their sword will pierce their own heart,</p>
<p>and their bow will break.	Ps 37:12-15</p>
<p>16The little that good people have is better</p>
<p>than the abundance sinners possess;</p>
<p>17because Yahveh will break the arms of sinners</p>
<p>and sustain the good.</p>
<p>18He knows the time of the blameless;</p>
<p>their inheritance lasts forever.</p>
<p>19They aren’t discouraged in hard times</p>
<p>and have plenty during famine.</p>
<p>20But the sinful perish;</p>
<p>Yahveh’s enemies are like flowers in a pasture;</p>
<p>they dissipate like smoke.</p>
<p>21The wicked borrow and don’t repay,</p>
<p>but the good are generous and give.</p>
<p>22Those he blesses will inherit the land;</p>
<p>the ones he curses will die.	Ps 37:16-22</p>
<p>23Yahveh guides the steps of the godly</p>
<p>and delights in their lives.</p>
<p>24If they fall, they won’t fall headlong</p>
<p>because Yahveh will hold their hand.</p>
<p>25I was young once; now I’m old;</p>
<p>yet I’ve not seen good people abandoned</p>
<p>or their children beg for bread.</p>
<p>26They’re gracious and generous;</p>
<p>their descendants are a blessing.</p>
<p>27Quit doing bad things and do good,</p>
<p>so you’ll live forever.	Ps 37:23-27</p>
<p>28Yahveh loves justice</p>
<p>and doesn’t abandon his holy people;</p>
<p>he keeps them forever,</p>
<p>but cuts off the descendants of the wicked.</p>
<p>29The godly will inherit the land</p>
<p>and live there permanently.</p>
<p>30The godly utter wisdom and speak justice.</p>
<p>31The Law of their God is in their heart;</p>
<p>their feet don’t slip.</p>
<p>32Sinners spy on them</p>
<p>and try to kill them.</p>
<p>33Yahveh won’t abandon the godly to their power</p>
<p>or let them be condemned when they’re judged.</p>
<p>34Wait for Yahveh and keep his way,</p>
<p>and he’ll raise you up to inherit the land;</p>
<p>you’ll see the wicked destroyed. 	Ps 37:28-34</p>
<p>35I’ve seen a violent, wicked people spread themselves out</p>
<p>like tall trees in their native soil.</p>
<p>36Then they passed away and were gone;</p>
<p>I looked for them, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>37Take note of blameless, watch the godly</p>
<p>because peaceful people prosper;</p>
<p>38but sinners will be destroyed</p>
<p>along with their future.</p>
<p>39The salvation of the godly comes from Yahveh,</p>
<p>their refuge when trouble comes.</p>
<p>40Yahveh helps them and delivers them,</p>
<p>protects them from sinners and saves them</p>
<p>because they take refuge in him. 	Ps 37:35-40</p>
<p>Psalm 38</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>for a Memorial</p>
<p>1Yahveh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath</p>
<p>or discipline me in your furious anger.</p>
<p>2Your arrows have pierced deep into me;</p>
<p>your hand has come down hard on me.</p>
<p>3Because of your indignation, my body’s not sound;</p>
<p>by my sin I’ve ruined my health.</p>
<p>4My iniquities have piled up higher than my head</p>
<p>and weighed me down.</p>
<p>5My wounds have festered and grown foul.</p>
<p>My foolish choices 6have doubled me over;</p>
<p>I grieve all the time;</p>
<p>7I’m burning up with fever;</p>
<p>my health is broken.</p>
<p>8I’m numb and crushed,</p>
<p>and groan from inner conflict.	Ps 38:1-8</p>
<p>9Yahveh, you know what I long for;</p>
<p>you hear my sighs.</p>
<p>10My heart’s pounding, my strength’s failing;</p>
<p>the sparkle in my eyes is gone.</p>
<p>11My friends and loved ones stand back from my sickness;</p>
<p>my relatives stay well away from me.</p>
<p>12Those who want to kill me lay snares for me;</p>
<p>the ones that want to injure me threaten destruction,</p>
<p>constantly plotting treachery.	Ps 38:9-12</p>
<p>13But like someone deaf, I don’t hear;</p>
<p>like a mute I don’t speak.</p>
<p>14Yes, I’m like somebody that can’t hear,</p>
<p>someone with no arguments to offer.</p>
<p>15I’m depending on you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>you’ll have to answer for me:</p>
<p>16Don’t let them celebrate over me</p>
<p>or gloat when my foot slips.</p>
<p>17I’m ready to fall;</p>
<p>my sorrow continually looms in front of me.</p>
<p>18I’m confessing my iniquity;</p>
<p>I’m anxious about my sin.</p>
<p>19But my enemies are vigorous and strong;</p>
<p>they hate me for no reason.</p>
<p>20and repay bad for good</p>
<p>because I follow after what’s good.</p>
<p>21Don’t leave me, Yahveh;</p>
<p>stay close by!</p>
<p>22Hurry and help me, Lord my savior!	Ps 38:13-22</p>
<p>Psalm 39</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to Jeduthun</p>
<p>1I said, “I’ll watch what I do</p>
<p>so I won’t sin with my tongue;</p>
<p>I’ll put a muzzle on my mouth</p>
<p>while sinful people come around.”</p>
<p>2But when I kept silent even about what was good,</p>
<p>it was of no avail;</p>
<p>my agitation grew worse.</p>
<p>3The more I thought about it</p>
<p>the more the fire burned within me;</p>
<p>so I spoke up:</p>
<p>4“Yahveh, show me my end,</p>
<p>how long I’ll live;</p>
<p>let me realize how fleeting my life is.</p>
<p>5You’ve made my days like handbreadths;</p>
<p>my lifetime is only a moment to you.</p>
<p>We all stand like a mere breath.</p>
<p>6We walk around like shadows in turmoil for nothing;</p>
<p>we accumulate wealth without knowing who will inherit it.</p>
<p>Ps 39:1-6</p>
<p>7“Now Lord, what is it I’m waiting for?</p>
<p>You’re my only hope.</p>
<p>8Save me from my sins;</p>
<p>don’t let fools humiliate me.</p>
<p>9I can’t open my mouth; I’m unable to speak</p>
<p>because you’re the one that disabled me.</p>
<p>10Stop striking me;</p>
<p>I’m exhausted from your blows.</p>
<p>11You discipline us for our sins</p>
<p>and consume like a moth what’s precious to us.</p>
<p>Clearly, we’re all nothing more than a breath.	Ps 39:7-11</p>
<p>12“Hear my prayer, Yahveh;</p>
<p>don’t ignore my tears</p>
<p>because I’m a passing guest,</p>
<p>a nomad like my ancestors.</p>
<p>13Leave me alone so I can be happy again</p>
<p>before I’m gone and don’t exist anymore.”	Ps 39:12-13</p>
<p>Psalm 40</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1I waited patiently for Yahveh;</p>
<p>he listened to my call for help.</p>
<p>2He brought me up out of the pit of despair,</p>
<p>out of the muddy clay,</p>
<p>set my feet on solid rock,</p>
<p>and made my footsteps secure.</p>
<p>3He put a new song in me, a song about praising God;</p>
<p>other people will hear it, see what he’s done, and trust in himY.</p>
<p>4How blessed people are that trust in Yahveh</p>
<p>instead of turning to proud or deceitful people.</p>
<p>5Yahveh my God, you’ve done so many amazing things;</p>
<p>your good intentions for us are too many to tell.</p>
<p>Nobody compares with you.</p>
<p>If I tried to tell about your wonderful acts,</p>
<p>I couldn’t recount them all.	Ps 40:1-5</p>
<p>6You don’t delight in sacrifices and meal offerings;</p>
<p>you haven’t required burnt offerings and sin offerings;</p>
<p>you’ve pierced my ears. [you gave me a bodyLXX.]</p>
<p>7Then I said, “I’m coming;</p>
<p>it’s written about me in the scroll;</p>
<p>8I delight in doing your will, my God;</p>
<p>I have your Law at heart.”</p>
<p>9In the great assembly</p>
<p>I’ve proclaimed the good news about goodness;</p>
<p>I didn’t hold back</p>
<p>10or keep to myself the truth about your goodness;</p>
<p>I spoke openly about your saving power,</p>
<p>about your enduring love and truth.	Ps 40:6-10</p>
<p>11Yahveh, don’t withhold your mercy from me;</p>
<p>let your enduring love and truth keep protecting me.</p>
<p>12Troubles beyond number surround me;</p>
<p>my own sins overtake me</p>
<p>till I can’t see any way to escape them.</p>
<p>13Yahveh, please hurry and help me.</p>
<p>14Embarrass and humiliate those who keep trying to destroy me;</p>
<p>disgrace the ones that delight in hurting me.</p>
<p>15Make them appalled at their disgrace</p>
<p>who say to me, “Aha, aha!”</p>
<p>16Make them happy who look to you,</p>
<p>who love your salvation and chant,</p>
<p>“Yahveh is great.”</p>
<p>17Keep me in your thoughts</p>
<p>because I’m in misery and need you,</p>
<p>my helper, my deliverer.</p>
<p>Don’t delay.			Ps 40:11-17</p>
<p>Psalm 41</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1How blessed people are that have regard for the poor;</p>
<p>Yahveh will deliver them when they have need.</p>
<p>2He’llY protect them, keep them alive, and call them blessed;</p>
<p>3sustainY them when they’re sick and restore them to health.</p>
<p>Ps 41:1-3</p>
<p>4I said, “Be gracious to me, Yahveh;</p>
<p>heal my soul because I’ve sinned against you.”</p>
<p>5My enemies say rude things about me:</p>
<p>“When’s he going to die</p>
<p>so we can forget about him?”</p>
<p>6When they come to visit me,</p>
<p>they say things they don’t mean;</p>
<p>they just come to gather threads</p>
<p>they can weave into gossip when they leave.</p>
<p>7Everybody that hates me whispers behind my back</p>
<p>and makes up hurtful things to say about me:</p>
<p>8“He has some deadly disease;</p>
<p>he’ll never get out of bed again.”</p>
<p>9Even the close friend that I trusted, that I ate with,</p>
<p>has turned against me.	Ps 41:4-9</p>
<p>10But you, Yahveh, be gracious and restore me</p>
<p>so I can pay them back.</p>
<p>11I know you’re pleased with me;</p>
<p>you haven’t let my enemies triumph over me.</p>
<p>12You’ve upheld me in my integrity</p>
<p>and brought me into your eternal presence.</p>
<p>13Bless Yahveh God of Israel</p>
<p>from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p>Amen and Amen.	Ps 41:10-13</p>
<p>BOOK 2</p>
<p>Psalm 42</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Maskil of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1My soul pants for God</p>
<p>like a deer pants for water.</p>
<p>2My soul is thirsty for the living God;</p>
<p>when will I ever see him?</p>
<p>3My tears have been my food day and night</p>
<p>as people ask me all the time, “Where’s your God?”</p>
<p>4I think about these things as I pour out my soul.</p>
<p>I used to go with the throng,</p>
<p>leading the procession to the house of God,</p>
<p>singing for joy and giving thanks</p>
<p>in the great celebration.</p>
<p>5Why despair, my soul?</p>
<p>Why be disturbed?</p>
<p>Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him</p>
<p>for the help his presence brings.</p>
<p>6I’m in despair, God;</p>
<p>so I remember you from the land of the Jordan,</p>
<p>from the peaks of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.</p>
<p>7The sounds of your crashing waves echo back and forth;</p>
<p>your waves and breakers are sweeping over me.	Ps 42:1-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh directs his enduring love to me in the daytime;</p>
<p>I sing his songs at night, prayers to my living God.</p>
<p>9I say to God, my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me?</p>
<p>Why do I go around mourning</p>
<p>because my enemies oppress me?”</p>
<p>10Like breaking my bones, they taunt me;</p>
<p>people ask me all the time, “Where’s your God?”</p>
<p>11Why despair, my soul?</p>
<p>Why be disturbed?</p>
<p>Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him</p>
<p>for the help his presence brings.	Ps 42:8-11</p>
<p>Psalm 43</p>
<p>1Declare me innocent, God;</p>
<p>defend me against this ungodly nation;</p>
<p>deliver me from liars!</p>
<p>2You’re the God that I rely on for courage;</p>
<p>why reject me?</p>
<p>Why do I go around mourning</p>
<p>because my enemies oppress me?</p>
<p>3Send your light and truth to lead me,</p>
<p>to bring me to the holy hill where you live.	Ps 43:1-3</p>
<p>4Then I can go to your altar, my greatest source of joy,</p>
<p>and praise you with a harp.</p>
<p>5Why despair, my soul?</p>
<p>Why be disturbed?</p>
<p>Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him,</p>
<p>my helper and my God.	Ps 43:4-5</p>
<p>Psalm 44</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Maskil of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1God, our ancestors have told us</p>
<p>what you did in their time long ago.</p>
<p>2You drove out nations and planted this one;</p>
<p>you struck them and scattered them abroad.</p>
<p>3Our ancestors didn’t conquer the land with their sword;</p>
<p>their own arm didn’t save them.</p>
<p>Your right hand, your arm,</p>
<p>the light of your presence did it</p>
<p>when you showed them favor.	Ps 44:1-3</p>
<p>4You’re my King, God;</p>
<p>ordain victories for Jacob in our day too.</p>
<p>5By your power we’ll push back our adversaries</p>
<p>and tramp down our attackers.</p>
<p>6We don’t trust in our bow;</p>
<p>our sword won’t save us.</p>
<p>7You are the one that must save us from our enemies</p>
<p>and disgrace those who hate us.</p>
<p>8We take pride in you always</p>
<p>and give you thanks forever.	Ps 44:4-8</p>
<p>9Yet now you’ve set us aside to dishonor;</p>
<p>you don’t go out with our armies.</p>
<p>10You’ve made us retreat from our enemies;</p>
<p>those who hate us have plundered our land.</p>
<p>11You’ve butchered us like sheep</p>
<p>and scattered us among the nations.</p>
<p>12You sell us cheap</p>
<p>and make no profit from doing it.</p>
<p>13You make us a disgrace to our neighbors,</p>
<p>something to scoff at,</p>
<p>14a byword the world over,</p>
<p>a laughingstock among the nations.	Ps 44:9-14</p>
<p>15All day long we’re disgraced and humiliated</p>
<p>16because people insult us;</p>
<p>we have enemies and avengers everywhere.</p>
<p>17That’s all come on us though we haven’t forgotten you</p>
<p>or been unfaithful to your covenant.</p>
<p>18Our heart hasn’t deserted you;</p>
<p>we haven’t strayed from your way;</p>
<p>19yet you’ve crushed us in a place filled with jackals</p>
<p>and covered us with the shadow of death.	Ps 44:15-19</p>
<p>20If we’d forgotten you</p>
<p>or raised our hands to a foreign god,</p>
<p>21wouldn’t you have found it out?</p>
<p>You know all our inner secrets.</p>
<p>22But for the sake of your honor, our lives are always in danger;</p>
<p>we’re like sheep headed for slaughter.</p>
<p>23Wake up, Yahveh; why are you sleeping?</p>
<p>don’t reject us forever.</p>
<p>24Why ignore us</p>
<p>and forget our suffering and oppression?</p>
<p>25We’re struck down to the dirt;</p>
<p>our bodies stick to the ground.</p>
<p>26Get up and help us;</p>
<p>redeem us like your enduring love suggests. 	Ps 44:20-26</p>
<p>Psalm 45</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. Set to Lilies</p>
<p>A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. A Song About Love</p>
<p>1My heart is overflowing with a noble theme</p>
<p>as I recite my verses to the King;</p>
<p>my tongue is like the pen of a gifted poet.</p>
<p>2You’re more handsome than the sons of men;</p>
<p>gracious words stream from on your lips;</p>
<p>God has blessed you forever.</p>
<p>3Strap your sword to your thigh, Mighty Warrior,</p>
<p>in your splendor and majesty!</p>
<p>4 In your majesty, ride on to victory,</p>
<p>defending truth, humility, and goodness;</p>
<p>have your right hand display awesome deeds.</p>
<p>5Your sharp arrows pierce your enemies’ hearts;</p>
<p>nations fall under you.	Ps 45:1-5</p>
<p>6Your throne is eternal, God;</p>
<p>your kingdom’s scepter is a godly one.</p>
<p>7You love goodness and hate sinfulness;</p>
<p>so God, your God, has anointed you</p>
<p>with more happiness than your companions.</p>
<p>8Your robes have the fragrance of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;</p>
<p>stringed instruments entertain you in ivory palaces.</p>
<p>9Yourmas maids of honor include kings’ daughters;</p>
<p>at yourmas right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. Ps 45:6-9</p>
<p>10Listen, daughter; pay attention;</p>
<p>forget your people and your father’s family</p>
<p>11The king delights in your beauty;</p>
<p>since he’s your lord, bow to him.</p>
<p>12The people from Tyre will shower youfem with gifts;</p>
<p>wealthy citizens will sue yourfem favor.</p>
<p>13The princess looks beautiful</p>
<p>in her gown interwoven with gold.</p>
<p>14She’ll be led to the king in embroidered robes</p>
<p>with bridesmaids in her train.</p>
<p>15With happiness and celebration,</p>
<p>they’ll enter the palace of the king.	Ps 45:10-15</p>
<p>16Yourmas sons will take the place of yourmas fathers;</p>
<p>you’llmas make them rulers over many lands.</p>
<p>17I’ll perpetuate yourmas memory in every generation;</p>
<p>the nations will be eternally grateful to youmas.	Ps 45:16-17</p>
<p>Psalm 46</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>Set to Alamoth. A Song</p>
<p>1God is our refuge and strength,</p>
<p>an ever-present help when trouble comes.</p>
<p>2So we won’t be afraid</p>
<p>though the ground tremors,</p>
<p>though the mountains cascade into the sea,</p>
<p>3though its water roars and foams,</p>
<p>though the land quakes at its tsunamis.</p>
<p>4There’s a river of joy that flows into the city of God,</p>
<p>the sacred place where the Most High lives.</p>
<p>5God is there; it’s unmovable;</p>
<p>from the break of day, he protects it.</p>
<p>6When nations rage and kingdoms totter,</p>
<p>his voice thunders and earth melts away.</p>
<p>7Yahveh of Hosts is with us;</p>
<p>the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:1-7</p>
<p>8Come and look at what Yahveh does:</p>
<p>he brings destruction on the earth;</p>
<p>9he stops wars all over the world;</p>
<p>he breaks bows and snaps spears in two;</p>
<p>he burns chariots.</p>
<p>10“So be still and know that I’m God,</p>
<p>exalted in every nation,</p>
<p>honored all over the world.”</p>
<p>11Yahveh of hosts is with us;</p>
<p>the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:8-11</p>
<p>Psalm 47</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1Clap your hands, everybody;</p>
<p>shout to God with joy;</p>
<p>2because you are to revere Yahveh Most High,</p>
<p>the great King over the whole world.</p>
<p>3He subdued people groups under us,</p>
<p>put nations beneath our feet,</p>
<p>4and chose our inheritance for us,</p>
<p>the pride of Jacob that he loves.	Ps 47:1-4</p>
<p>5God has ascended with a shout,</p>
<p>with a trumpet fanfare.</p>
<p>6Sing praises to God, sing praises;</p>
<p>sing praises to our King, sing praises;</p>
<p>7because God is King over the whole world;</p>
<p>sing praises with a beautiful psalm.</p>
<p>8He reigns over the nations on his holy throne.</p>
<p>9The rulers of the people have gathered together</p>
<p>with the people of Abraham’s God;</p>
<p>because the shields of the earth belong to him;</p>
<p>he’s highly honored.	Ps 47:5-9</p>
<p>Psalm 48</p>
<p>A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1Yahveh is great and deserves great praise</p>
<p>in the city of our God on his holy mountain.</p>
<p>2Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon, is high and beautiful—</p>
<p>the joy of the whole earth, the city of the great King.</p>
<p>3In its towers God reveals himself as a strong defense.</p>
<p>4Kings joined forces</p>
<p>and advanced against that strong defense.</p>
<p>5But as soon as it came into view,</p>
<p>they panicked and fled.</p>
<p>6Panic seized them</p>
<p>like the anguish of a woman in childbirth.</p>
<p>7Yahveh destroyed them</p>
<p>like ships of Tarshish capsized by an east wind.</p>
<p>8As we’ve heard, so we’ve seen</p>
<p>in the city of Yahveh of Hosts, our God;</p>
<p>he’ll make it safe forever.	Ps 48:1-8</p>
<p>9In your Temple we think about your enduring love.</p>
<p>10Like your name, God, your praise is everywhere;</p>
<p>your right hand is filled with goodness.</p>
<p>11Let Mount Zion be happy,</p>
<p>and the residents of Judah celebrate your goodness.</p>
<p>12Walk around Zion and count its towers;</p>
<p>13inspect its ramparts and tour its fortresses</p>
<p>so you can tell the next generation;</p>
<p>14because God is God forever;</p>
<p>he’ll guide us till we die.	Ps 48:9-14</p>
<p>Psalm 49</p>
<p>For the Choir Director</p>
<p>A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1Hear this, every nation;</p>
<p>listen, everyone on earth,</p>
<p>2low and high, rich and poor alike.</p>
<p>3My words are wise;</p>
<p>my thoughts are full of insight.</p>
<p>4I listen to proverbs</p>
<p>and expound my riddles on a harp.</p>
<p>5Why should I be afraid when there’s adversity,</p>
<p>when my enemies’ sins are all around me,</p>
<p>6people who trust in their wealth</p>
<p>and brag about how rich they are?</p>
<p>7Nobody can use wealth to redeem a brother from death</p>
<p>or pay God a ransom for him—</p>
<p>8redeeming a life is too expensive;</p>
<p>you may as well forget about</p>
<p>9living on forever and not seeing the Pit.	Ps 49:1-9</p>
<p>10Even the wise die—</p>
<p>just like the ignorant and senseless—</p>
<p>and leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p>11They act like their houses will last forever,</p>
<p>like where they live will be there for all generations;</p>
<p>so they name their lands after themselves.</p>
<p>12But in all their pomp, they won’t endure;</p>
<p>they’ll perish like animals.</p>
<p>13This is the fate of the foolish</p>
<p>and those who agree with them:</p>
<p>14like sheep they’re appointed to Sheol;</p>
<p>death will be their shepherd.</p>
<p>The godly will rule them in the morning;</p>
<p>Sheol will consume their form</p>
<p>far from their stately homes.</p>
<p>15But God will redeem me from its power</p>
<p>and take me to himself.	Ps 49:10-15</p>
<p>16Don’t be afraid when people get rich,</p>
<p>when their houses appreciate in value;</p>
<p>17because when they die, they won’t take anything with them;</p>
<p>what they gloried in won’t go down with them to the grave.</p>
<p>18Though they congratulate themselves while they’re alive,</p>
<p>though other people praise them for being successful,</p>
<p>19they’ll go to their ancestors</p>
<p>and never see the light of day.</p>
<p>20People in all their pomp who don’t have intelligence</p>
<p>amount to being like animals when they die.	Ps 49:16-20</p>
<p>Psalm 50</p>
<p>A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>1The Mighty One, God, Yahveh, has spoken</p>
<p>and calls to earth from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>2He shines forth out of Zion in perfect beauty.</p>
<p>3Our God comes; he doesn’t stay quiet;</p>
<p>a fire consumes in front of him;</p>
<p>a storm rages around him.</p>
<p>4He calls on the sky above and the earth beneath</p>
<p>to witness the judgment of his people.</p>
<p>5“Gather my people to me</p>
<p>that I’ve made a covenant with by sacrifice.”</p>
<p>6The heavens declare his justice</p>
<p>because God himself is judge.	Ps 50:1-6</p>
<p>7“Listen, my people, and I’ll speak;</p>
<p>Israel, I’ll bring my charges against you.</p>
<p>I’m God, your God.</p>
<p>8I don’t have any complaint about your sacrifices</p>
<p>or burnt offerings that are always in front of me.</p>
<p>9But I don’t need any bulls from your barns</p>
<p>or male goats from your pens;</p>
<p>10every animal in the forest already belongs to me,</p>
<p>the livestock on a thousand hills.</p>
<p>11I know every bird in the mountains;</p>
<p>everything that moves in the field is mine.</p>
<p>12If I was hungry, I wouldn’t say anything to you about it,</p>
<p>because the whole world belongs to me and everything in it.</p>
<p>13Will I eat the meat of bulls</p>
<p>or drink the blood of male goats?</p>
<p>14Offer to me a sacrifice of thanksgiving;</p>
<p>keep your vows to the Most High.</p>
<p>15Call on me when there’s trouble;</p>
<p>then I’ll rescue you, and you’ll honor me.”	Ps 50:7-15</p>
<p>16But God says to the sinful,</p>
<p>“What reason do you have to recite my statutes</p>
<p>or discuss my covenant?</p>
<p>17You hate discipline</p>
<p>and disregard what I tell you.</p>
<p>18Thieves are your friends;</p>
<p>you associate with adulterers.</p>
<p>19You give your mouth free reign;</p>
<p>your tongue tells lies.</p>
<p>20You sit around and gossip about your brother;</p>
<p>you slander your mother’s son.</p>
<p>21I didn’t speak up when you did those things,</p>
<p>so you thought it didn’t matter to me;</p>
<p>but now I’ll charge you</p>
<p>and lay out my case against you. 	Ps 50:16-21</p>
<p>22“Consider this, you that forget about me,</p>
<p>or I’ll tear you to pieces,</p>
<p>and there won’t be anyone to save you.</p>
<p>23Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me;</p>
<p>I’ll show you my deliverance if you keep to my path.” 	Ps 50:22-23</p>
<p>Psalm 51</p>
<p>Psalm for the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,</p>
<p>When Nathan the Prophet Came to Him,</p>
<p>After He’d Slept with Bathsheba</p>
<p>1Be gracious to me, God, in proportion to your enduring love;</p>
<p>according to your great mercy, blot out my transgressions.</p>
<p>2Wash me thoroughly from my sin;</p>
<p>cleanse me from my iniquity.</p>
<p>3I know my failings;</p>
<p>my sin always weighs on my mind.</p>
<p>4I’ve sinned against you and you only;</p>
<p>I did what you consider evil;</p>
<p>so you’re justified in what you say to me,</p>
<p>blameless when you condemn me.	Ps 51:1-4</p>
<p>5I was born in sin;</p>
<p>in iniquity my mother conceived me.</p>
<p>6You want truth in the inward self;</p>
<p>you’ll make me know wisdom in myself.</p>
<p>7Purify me with hyssop, and I’ll be clean;</p>
<p>wash me, and I’ll be whiter than snow.</p>
<p>8Fill me with joy and happiness again,</p>
<p>and let the bones you broke mend up.</p>
<p>9Don’t look at my sins;</p>
<p>blot out my iniquities.	Ps 51:5-9</p>
<p>10Create a clean heart in me, God;</p>
<p>renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>
<p>11Don’t banish me from your presence</p>
<p>or take your Holy Spirit away from me.</p>
<p>12Restore to me the joy your salvation brings;</p>
<p>grant me a willing attitude to obey.</p>
<p>13Then I’ll teach transgressors your ways;</p>
<p>sinners will be converted to you.</p>
<p>14Deliver me from being guilty of murder</p>
<p>so I can joyfully sing about your goodness.</p>
<p>15Yahveh, open my lips,</p>
<p>so I can express your praises.</p>
<p>16You don’t delight in sacrifice; otherwise, I’d give it;</p>
<p>you’re not pleased with burnt offerings.</p>
<p>17The sacrifice you want is a broken spirit;</p>
<p>you appreciate a repentant heart.</p>
<p>18In your good favor, do good to Zion;</p>
<p>build up the walls around Jerusalem.</p>
<p>19Then you’ll delight in godly sacrifices,</p>
<p>in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;</p>
<p>then young bulls will again be offered on your altar.	Ps 51:10-19</p>
<p>Psalm 52</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,</p>
<p>When Doeg the Edomite Came and Told Saul,</p>
<p>“David has gone to Ahimelech’s house.”</p>
<p>1God’s enduring love lasts all day;</p>
<p>so why brag about sinning, great soldier?</p>
<p>2Your tongue cuts like a razor.</p>
<p>3You like evil more than good,</p>
<p>falsehood more than truth.</p>
<p>4You like words that devour</p>
<p>and a lying tongue that deceives.</p>
<p>5But God will strike you down once and for all;</p>
<p>he’ll pull you out of your tent</p>
<p>and uproot you from the land of the living. 	Ps 52:1-5</p>
<p>6Good people will see it and be amazed;</p>
<p>they’ll laugh at you and say,</p>
<p>7“Look at the men that wouldn’t take refuge in God,</p>
<p>but trusted in their great wealth</p>
<p>and used their strength to destroy.”</p>
<p>8But I’m like a green olive tree in God’s house;</p>
<p>I’ll always trust in his enduring love.</p>
<p>9I’ll be eternally grateful for what he’s done,</p>
<p>and depend on him in front of his holy people</p>
<p>because that’s good.	Ps 52:6-9</p>
<p>Psalm 53</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. Set to Mahalath</p>
<p>A Maskil of David</p>
<p>1Fools tell themselves there’s no God.</p>
<p>They’re corrupt and commit disgusting sins;</p>
<p>none of them does what’s good.</p>
<p>2God looks down from heaven</p>
<p>to see if anybody understands,</p>
<p>if anybody looks to him.</p>
<p>3Every one of them has turned aside and become corrupt;</p>
<p>not a one does what’s good, not a one.	Ps 53:1-3</p>
<p>4Won’t sinners ever learn?</p>
<p>They eat up my people like bread</p>
<p>and don’t pray to me.</p>
<p>5They’ll be in a panic like never before,</p>
<p>because I’ll scatter the bones of your attackers;</p>
<p>you’ll put them to shame because I’ve rejected them.</p>
<p>6Oh that deliverance would come out of Zion!</p>
<p>When I restore the fortunes of my people,</p>
<p>Jacob will celebrate, Israel will be happy.	Ps 53:4-6</p>
<p>Psalm 54</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,</p>
<p>When the Ziphites Came and Told Saul,</p>
<p>“Isn’t David hiding among us?”</p>
<p>On Stringed Instruments</p>
<p>1Deliver me, God, by your name;</p>
<p>vindicate me by your power.</p>
<p>2Listen to my prayer; hear what I have to say.</p>
<p>3Foreigners have attacked me;</p>
<p>violent people have tried to kill me;</p>
<p>they don’t care about you.</p>
<p>4But God helps me; Yahveh sustains my life.</p>
<p>5He pays back my adversaries</p>
<p>and destroys them in his faithfulness.</p>
<p>6I’ll sacrifice to him willingly</p>
<p>and thank him because he’s good.</p>
<p>7He’s delivered me from all my trouble</p>
<p>so I could triumph over my enemies.	Ps 54:1-7</p>
<p>Psalm 55</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David</p>
<p>On Stringed Instruments</p>
<p>1Hear my prayer, God;</p>
<p>don’t ignore my plea.</p>
<p>2Listen and answer;</p>
<p>trouble has overwhelmed me; I’m distracted</p>
<p>3by the threats of my enemies,</p>
<p>by bringing suffering on me</p>
<p>and bearing angry grudges against me.	Ps 55:1-3</p>
<p>4My heart’s pounding;</p>
<p>terror of death has fallen on me.</p>
<p>5Fear and trembling have come over me;</p>
<p>horror has overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>6I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove!</p>
<p>I’d fly off and find peace.</p>
<p>7I’d flee far away</p>
<p>and lodge out in the countryside.</p>
<p>8I’d hurry to my shelter</p>
<p>from the howling wind and raging storm.”	Ps 55:4-8</p>
<p>9Lord, destroy their plans; confuse their languages,</p>
<p>because all I see is violence and conflict in the city.</p>
<p>10Day and night they patrol the walls,</p>
<p>but sin and scheming threaten inside it.</p>
<p>11Ruin is rampant within it;</p>
<p>oppression and cheating never leave the streets.	Ps 55:9-11</p>
<p>12It’s not an enemy that’s disparaging me;</p>
<p>I could handle that;</p>
<p>it’s not foes that hate me and rise up against me,</p>
<p>I could hide from them.</p>
<p>13But it’s you, my equal,</p>
<p>my companion, my familiar friend.</p>
<p>14We used to be close friends</p>
<p>that walked in God’s Temple together.</p>
<p>15Let death overtake my enemies;</p>
<p>let them go down alive to Sheol,</p>
<p>because there’s evil where they live.	Ps 55:12-15</p>
<p>16I’ll call on Yahveh my God to deliver me.</p>
<p>17Morning, noon, and night, he’ll hear my groaning</p>
<p>18and deliver my life in peace from my attackers,</p>
<p>because lots of people are opposing me.</p>
<p>19The One who sits enthroned from of old</p>
<p>will punish the ones that don’t change or respect him.</p>
<p>20As for that companion of mine,</p>
<p>he betrays his friends and breaks his promises</p>
<p>against those who are at peace with him.	 Ps 55:16-20</p>
<p>21His speech is smoother than butter,</p>
<p>but there’s war in his heart;</p>
<p>his words are more soothing than oil,</p>
<p>but secretly they’re drawn daggers.</p>
<p>22Put your burdens on Yahveh, and he’ll take care of you;</p>
<p>he won’t let the godly fall.</p>
<p>23You, God, will bring the wicked down to the deepest pit;</p>
<p>bloodthirsty, devious people won’t live half their time,</p>
<p>but I’ll trust in you.           	 Ps 55:21-23</p>
<p>Psalm 56</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,</p>
<p>When the Philistines Seized Him in Gath</p>
<p>Set to The Pigeon in Far-Off Terebinths</p>
<p>1Be gracious, God; people are walking all over me,</p>
<p>oppressing me all the time, 2attacking me.</p>
<p>3When I’m afraid, I put my trust in you.</p>
<p>4In you, whose word I praise, I’ve put my trust;</p>
<p>what can mortals do to me?</p>
<p>5All day long they try to frustrate my purposes;</p>
<p>they think up ways to harm me.</p>
<p>6They stir up conflict, they lurk, they watch my every step,</p>
<p>looking for a chance to kill me.</p>
<p>7Because they’re sinful, throw them out;</p>
<p>in anger put them down, God!	Ps 56:1-7</p>
<p>8You’ve kept track of my wanderings</p>
<p>and collected my tears in your bottle;</p>
<p>aren’t they recorded in your scroll?</p>
<p>9My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help;</p>
<p>I know this one thing: you’re with me.</p>
<p>10In God, whose word I praise,</p>
<p>in Yahveh, whose word I praise,</p>
<p>11I’ve put my trust so I won’t be afraid;</p>
<p>what can mortals do to me?</p>
<p>12I have to perform my vows to you;</p>
<p>I’ll give thank offerings for your help,</p>
<p>13because you’ve delivered me from death</p>
<p>and my feet from stumbling</p>
<p>so I can walk with you in the light of life.	Ps 56:8-13</p>
<p>Psalm 57</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,</p>
<p>When He Fled from Saul in the Cave</p>
<p>Set to Do Not Destroy</p>
<p>1Be gracious to me, God,</p>
<p>because I depend on you to protect me;</p>
<p>in the shadow of your wings I take refuge</p>
<p>till danger passes.</p>
<p>2I call out to God Most High,</p>
<p>who accomplishes everything for me;</p>
<p>3he sends help from heaven to rescue me</p>
<p>and discredits whoever tries to run over me. 	Ps 57:1-3</p>
<p>4I live among lions;</p>
<p>I have to lie among those who breathe fire,</p>
<p>people whose teeth are spears and arrows,</p>
<p>whose tongues are sharp swords.</p>
<p>5Be raised up higher than the sky, God;</p>
<p>shine your glory on the whole world.</p>
<p>6They’ve set a trap for me to step in;</p>
<p>they’ve dug a pit for me—I’m weary from stress—</p>
<p>but they’ve fallen into it themselves!	Ps 57:4-6</p>
<p>7My heart is steadfast, God; it’s steadfast;</p>
<p>I’ll sing; yes, I’ll sing praises!</p>
<p>8Wake up, my glory;</p>
<p>wake up, harp and lyre;</p>
<p>I’ll wake up the dawn with my songs.</p>
<p>9I’ll give you thanks, God, among the peoples</p>
<p>and sing praises to you among the nations.</p>
<p>10Your enduring love is as high as the sky;</p>
<p>your truth reaches up to the clouds.</p>
<p>11Be raised up higher than the sky, God;</p>
<p>shine your glory on the whole world.	Ps 57:7-11</p>
<p>Psalm 58</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David</p>
<p>Set to Do Not Destroy</p>
<p>1Leaders, do you decree what’s right?</p>
<p>Do you judge justly?</p>
<p>2No, you plot injustice in your hearts</p>
<p>and spread violence in the land.</p>
<p>3The sinful go astray from the womb;</p>
<p>they lie from the time they’re born.</p>
<p>4They have venom like vipers,</p>
<p>and stop up their ears like deaf cobras</p>
<p>5so they don’t hear their charmers’ voices</p>
<p>or those skilled at casting spells.	Ps 58:1-5</p>
<p>6Pull out their fangs, God;</p>
<p>break the teeth out of the young lions.</p>
<p>7Make them disappear like water that drains away;</p>
<p>make their arrows shafts without points.</p>
<p>8Make sinners be like snails that dissolve as they go along,</p>
<p>like a miscarriage that never sees the sun.</p>
<p>9Before your pots can feel the heat of burning briers;</p>
<p>he’ll sweep them away with a whirlwind,</p>
<p>whether green or on fire.	Ps 58:6-9</p>
<p>10Good people will celebrate when they see God pay them back;</p>
<p>he’ll wash their feet in the sinners’ blood.</p>
<p>11People will say, “There’s surely a reward for good people;</p>
<p>there’s certainly a God that judges on earth!”	Ps 58:10-11</p>
<p>Psalm 59</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,</p>
<p>When Saul Sent Men to Watch the House and Kill Him</p>

<p>1Deliver me from my enemies, God;</p>
<p>set me on high away from my attackers.</p>
<p>2Save me from sinners;</p>
<p>rescue me from bloodthirsty people.</p>
<p>3They lie in ambush to kill me;</p>
<p>fierce enemies stir up conflict against me, Yahveh,</p>
<p>but not for my transgression.</p>
<p>4For no fault of mine, they run to attack me;</p>
<p>get up to see and help me!		Ps 59:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh God of Hosts, God of Israel,</p>
<p>wake up and punish the nations;</p>
<p>don’t extend grace to any that are treacherous.</p>
<p>6They come back in the evening</p>
<p>and roam the city, howling like dogs.</p>
<p>7They growl with their mouth;</p>
<p>they have swords in their lips;</p>
<p>they say, “Who’s going to hear us?”</p>
<p>8But you laugh at them, Yahveh;</p>
<p>you scoff at the nations.	Ps 59:5-8</p>
<p>9I’ll watch for you, my Strength, my fortress.</p>
<p>10You’ll meet me in your enduring love;</p>
<p>and let me look down in triumph at my enemies.</p>
<p>11Don’t kill them; otherwise, my people will forget;</p>
<p>scatter them with your power</p>
<p>and bring them to their knees, Yahveh our shield.</p>
<p>12For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips,</p>
<p>catch them in their pride, their curses, and the lies they tell.</p>
<p>13In your anger, destroy them so they’ll be out of the way,</p>
<p>so people will know that you rule in Jacob</p>
<p>and everywhere.</p>
<p>14They come back in the evening</p>
<p>and roam the city, howling like dogs.</p>
<p>15They wander around looking for food</p>
<p>and growl if they’re not satisfied.	Ps 59:9-15</p>
<p>16But I’ll sing about your strength,</p>
<p>every morning about your enduring love.</p>
<p>You’ve been my fortress,</p>
<p>my refuge in trouble.</p>
<p>17I’ll sing praise to you, my Strength,</p>
<p>the God who shows me enduring love.	Ps 59:16-17</p>
<p>Psalm 60</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,</p>
<p>to teach when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah,</p>
<p>and Joab came back and struck 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt</p>
<p>1You’ve rejected us, God, and broken us;</p>
<p>you’ve been angry, but restore us now.</p>
<p>2You’ve made the land quake; you’ve split it open;</p>
<p>now repair the faults and stop the tremors.</p>
<p>3You’ve made your people endure hardship</p>
<p>and given us wine that makes us stagger.</p>
<p>4You’ve raised a banner for those who respect you</p>
<p>as a rallying point for truth.</p>
<p>5Save us now with your right hand and answer us,</p>
<p>deliver your beloved.	Ps 60:1-5</p>
<p>6In his kindness God has answered;</p>
<p>“I’ll celebrate by dividing up Shechem</p>
<p>and measuring out the Valley of Succoth.</p>
<p>7Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;</p>
<p>Ephraim is my helmet; Jacob is my scepter.</p>
<p>8Moab will be my washbasin;</p>
<p>I’ll scrape off my shoes on Edom</p>
<p>and shout in triumph over Philistia!”	Ps 60:6-8</p>
<p>9Who will take me to a fortified city?</p>
<p>Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
<p>10Have you rejected us, God?</p>
<p>You’re not going out with our armies.</p>
<p>11Help us against our enemies;</p>
<p>we have no hope of human deliverance!</p>
<p>12Through you we can do valiantly;</p>
<p>you’ll tread down our adversaries.	Ps 60:9-12</p>

<p>2With a faint heart I call to you from the end of the earth;</p>
<p>lead me to the rock that’s higher than me.</p>
<p>3You’re my refuge, my strong tower against the enemy.</p>
<p>4Let me live in your tent forever</p>
<p>and take shelter under your wings.</p>
<p>5You’ve heard my vows, God,</p>
<p>and given me the inheritance that comes to those who respect you.</p>
<p>6Lengthen the king’s life;</p>
<p>make his lifetime like many generations.</p>
<p>7Have him sit enthroned in your presence forever;</p>
<p>appoint enduring love and truth to preserve him.</p>

<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to Jeduthun</p>
<p>1I wait for God alone</p>
<p>because my victory comes from him.</p>
<p>2He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;</p>
<p>I won’t be shaken.</p>
<p>3How long will youpl assail me</p>
<p>so you can murder me,</p>
<p>like a leaning wall or crumbling fence?</p>
<p>4Your only intention is to knock me down;</p>
<p>you enjoy lying about me;</p>
<p>you bless out loud but curse inside.	Ps 62:1-4</p>
<p>5My soul, wait in silence for God</p>
<p>because my hope lies only in him.</p>
<p>6He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;</p>
<p>I won’t be shaken.</p>
<p>7My deliverance and glory rest with him,</p>
<p>my strong rock and refuge.</p>
<p>8Always trust him, people;</p>
<p>pour out your heart to him, our refuge.	Ps 62:5-8</p>
<p>9Common people have no value;</p>
<p>the powerful aren’t what they seem.</p>
<p>Either one rises higher in the balances;</p>
<p>they’re both lighter than air.</p>
<p>10Don’t put confidence in extortion;</p>
<p>don’t place empty hopes in stealing.</p>
<p>If wealth does increase, don’t set your heart on it.</p>
<p>11God has spoken once;</p>
<p>I’ve heard it twice</p>
<p>that power belongs to God</p>
<p>12and Yahveh has enduring love;</p>
<p>he pays people according to their work.	Ps 62:9-12</p>

<p>When He Was in the Wilderness of Judah</p>
<p>1God, you’re my God; I look to you in earnest;</p>
<p>my soul thirsts for you;</p>
<p>my flesh yearns for you in this dry, weary land.</p>
<p>2So I’ve looked at you in the sanctuary</p>
<p>and seen your power and glory.</p>
<p>3 I’ll praise you</p>
<p>because your enduring love is better than life;</p>
<p>4I’ll bless you as long as I live</p>
<p>and lift up my hands in your name.</p>
<p>5You satisfy my soul like the finest food;</p>
<p>I offer praises gladly.	Ps 63:1-5</p>
<p>6I remember you when I’m in bed;</p>
<p>I think about you during the night.</p>
<p>7You’ve been my help;</p>
<p>I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.</p>
<p>8My soul clings to you;</p>
<p>your right hand upholds me.</p>
<p>9But those who are trying to destroy me</p>
<p>will end up in the ground.</p>
<p>10The sword will overwhelm them;</p>
<p>they’ll become prey for foxes.</p>
<p>11But the king will celebrate in God;</p>
<p>everybody that swears by him will glory</p>
<p>while liars’ mouths will be stopped.	Ps 63:6-11</p>
<p>Psalm 64</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Listen to my complaint, God;</p>
<p>keep me from living in dread of my enemies.</p>
<p>2Hide me from the secret plots of bad people,</p>
<p>from the schemes of sinners</p>
<p>3that sharpen their tongue like a sword,</p>
<p>that aim bitter words like arrows,</p>
<p>4that shoot at innocent people from hiding places,</p>
<p>and do it suddenly without qualms.</p>
<p>5They latch onto sinful purposes</p>
<p>and talk secretly about setting traps;</p>
<p>they say, “Who will notice?”</p>
<p>6They look for ways to be unjust,</p>
<p>“We’re ready with a well-conceived plot,”</p>
<p>because the human mind and heart are cunning.	Ps 64:1-6</p>
<p>7But God will wound them with an arrow</p>
<p>8and make them trip over their tongues!</p>
<p>Everybody that sees them will shake their heads.</p>
<p>9Then everybody will be respectful</p>
<p>and talk about what God’s done</p>
<p>and ponder what he’s made.</p>
<p>10Good people will be happy in Yahveh</p>
<p>and take refuge in him;</p>

<p>3Sins overwhelm us, but you forgive them.</p>

<p>and bring close to you to live in your courts;</p>

<p>the holy Temple.	Ps 65:1-4</p>
<p>5You answer us with awesome deeds, God who keeps us safe,</p>
<p>who is trusted in every land and the farthest sea.</p>
<p>6You established the mountains by your power</p>
<p>and dressed yourself with strength,</p>
<p>7you that still the roaring seas</p>
<p>and the disturbances among the nations.</p>
<p>8They who live at the ends of the earth</p>
<p>stand in awe at your wonders;</p>
<p>you make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.	Ps 65:5-8</p>
<p>9You take care of the earth and water it;</p>
<p>you greatly enrich the ground and provide the water</p>
<p>to grow the grain;</p>
<p>that’s how you’ve ordained things to work.</p>
<p>10You water the plowed ground abundantly and level its ridges;</p>
<p>you soften its clods with showers and bless its growth.</p>
<p>11You crown the year with abundant harvests;</p>
<p>paths get overgrown with lush vegetation.</p>
<p>12The pastures in the countryside drip with dew;</p>
<p>the hills blossom with rejoicing.</p>
<p>13The meadows are clothed with flocks;</p>
<p>the valleys are covered with grain;</p>
<p>they shout and sing for joy.	Ps 65:9-13</p>

<p>out of fear for your power.</p>
<p>4All the earth worships you and praises you;</p>
<p>they sing praises to you.”	Ps 66:1-4</p>
<p>5Come and see what God has done;</p>
<p>it’s awesome what he’s done for people.</p>
<p>6He turned the Red Sea into dry ground;</p>
<p>the people crossed through the Jordan on foot;</p>
<p>they celebrated over him there.</p>
<p>7He rules by his power forever;</p>
<p>he keeps watch over the nations;</p>
<p>the rebellious don’t make an uprising.	Ps 66:5-7</p>
<p>8Bless our God, you nations;</p>
<p>sound his praise abroad.</p>
<p>9He keeps us alive</p>
<p>and doesn’t let our feet slip.</p>
<p>10You’ve tried us, God,</p>
<p>and refined us like silver.</p>
<p>11You caught us in your net</p>
<p>and laid a heavy load in our lap.</p>
<p>12You put a ruler over us</p>
<p>and passed us through fire and water;</p>
<p>yet you brought us out into a large place.</p>
<p>13I’ll come to your Temple with burnt offerings</p>
<p>and keep the vows 14I made when I was in trouble.</p>
<p>15I’ll offer you burnt offerings of healthy animals</p>
<p>with the smoke of rams;</p>
<p>I’ll offer bulls and male goats.	Ps 66:8-15</p>
<p>16Come and listen, you that respect God,</p>
<p>and I’ll tell you what he’s done for me.</p>
<p>17I appealed to him with my mouth</p>
<p>and extolled him with my tongue.</p>
<p>18If I cherish sinfulness in my heart,</p>
<p>Yahveh won’t hear me.</p>
<p>19But he’s certainly heard me;</p>
<p>he’s listened to my prayer.</p>
<p>20Bless God,</p>
<p>who hasn’t ignored my prayer</p>
<p>or withdrawn his enduring love.	Ps 66:16-20</p>

<p>4So sing to God, sing praises to him;</p>
<p>lay out a highway for the One that rides through deserts,</p>
<p>whose name is Yahveh,</p>
<p>and celebrate with him.	Ps 68:1-4</p>
<p>5God in his holy Temple</p>
<p>is a father for the fatherless and a judge for widows;</p>
<p>6he makes a home for the lonely</p>
<p>and leads prisoners out to prosperity;</p>
<p>only the rebellious live in a parched land.</p>
<p>7God of Israel, when you went out ahead of your people</p>
<p>and marched through the desert,</p>
<p>8the ground shook,</p>
<p>the sky poured down rain,</p>
<p>Sinai itself quaked in front of you.</p>
<p>9You sent widespread, abundant rain, God,</p>
<p>and refreshed your inheritance when it was parched.</p>
<p>10The animals settled in it;</p>
<p>in your goodness you provided for the poor.	Ps 68:5-10</p>
<p>11The Lord gives the command,</p>
<p>and a host of women sing the good news:</p>
<p>12“Kings and their armies flee</p>
<p>the women that stayed home divide the spoil!”</p>
<p>13Even those who stayed among the flocks found treasure</p>
<p>like the wings of a dove covered with silver</p>
<p>and pinions covered with glistening gold.</p>
<p>14The Almighty scattered the enemy kings there</p>
<p>like blowing snow in Zalmon.</p>
<p>15The mountain in Bashan is majestic,</p>
<p>a mountain range with many peaks.</p>
<p>16Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy</p>
<p>at the mountain God wanted for his home?</p>
<p>He’ll certainly live there forever.</p>
<p>17God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands;</p>
<p>Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.</p>
<p>18When you ascended on high and led captivityLXX captive,</p>
<p>and received gifts from people, even rebellious people—</p>
<p>so Yahveh God might live there.	 Ps 68:11-18</p>
<p>15The mountain in Bashan is majestic,</p>
<p>a mountain range with many peaks.</p>
<p>16Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy</p>

<p>He’ll certainly live there forever.</p>
<p>17God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands;</p>
<p>Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.</p>
<p>18He has ascended on high and led captivityLXX captive,</p>
<p>and received gifts among people,</p>
<p>even among the rebellious so Yahveh God might live there.</p>
<p>Ps 68:15-18</p>
<p>19Bless Yahveh, who carries our burdens every day,</p>
<p>who keeps us safe 20and rescues us;</p>
<p>deliverance from death comes from Yahveh the Lord.</p>
<p>21He’ll bash in the heads of his enemies,</p>
<p>the hairy crowns of those who keep doing their guilty deeds.</p>
<p>22The Lord said, “I’ll bring them down from Bashan</p>
<p>and bring them up from the ocean depths</p>
<p>23so you can wash your feet in their blood</p>
<p>and your dogs can have their share of your enemies.”	Ps 68:19-23</p>
<p>24They’ve seen your solemn procession, God,</p>
<p>the procession of God, my King, into the sanctuary—</p>
<p>25singers first, then musicians,</p>
<p>with young women playing tambourines.</p>
<p>26Bless God as a community,</p>
<p>Yahveh, the fountain of Israel.</p>
<p>27There’s Benjamin, the youngest, leading them,</p>
<p>the officials of Judah in the throng,</p>
<p>the officials of Zebulun and Naphtali.</p>
<p>28Summon your strength, God;</p>
<p>show us your power like you have before.</p>
<p>29Kings will bring you gifts</p>
<p>because of your Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>30Scare off the beast that lives in the reeds,</p>
<p>the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.</p>
<p>Trample underfoot its bars of silver;</p>
<p>scatter the nations that delight in war.</p>
<p>31Let envoys bring gifts out of Egypt;</p>
<p>let Nubia quickly submit to God.	Ps 68:24-31</p>
<p>32Sing to God, kingdoms on earth;</p>
<p>sing praises to Yahveh,</p>
<p>33that rides high in the ancient sky,</p>
<p>that thunders out his loud voice.</p>
<p>34Attribute power to God,</p>
<p>whose majesty shines on Israel,</p>
<p>whose strength is displayed in the sky.</p>
<p>35He’s awesome in his sanctuary;</p>
<p>the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.</p>
<p>Bless God!	Ps 68:32-35</p>
<p>Psalm 69</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>Set to Lilies</p>
<p>1Save me, God;</p>
<p>I’m in water up to my neck!</p>
<p>2I’ve sunk in deep mud, where there’s no foothold;</p>
<p>a flood is sweeping over me.</p>
<p>3I’m worn out from crying; my throat’s dry;</p>
<p>my eyes are red from crying, waiting for my God.</p>
<p>4The people that hate me for no reason</p>
<p>outnumber the hairs on my head;</p>
<p>those who want to destroy me are powerful;</p>
<p>they’re trying to make me repay what I didn’t steal.	Ps 69:1-4</p>
<p>5God, you know about my foolish choices;</p>
<p>I can’t hide the things I’ve done wrong.</p>
<p>6May those who put their hope in you</p>
<p>not be disgraced because of me;</p>
<p>may the ones who look to you</p>
<p>not be dishonored by what I’ve done;</p>
<p>7because I’ve endured humiliation for your sake;</p>
<p>I have shame written all over my face.</p>
<p>8I’m alienated from my brothers;</p>
<p>my mother’s sons treat me like a foreigner.</p>
<p>9I’m consumed with zeal for your Temple;</p>
<p>the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.</p>
<p>10When I humble myself with fasting, they mock me;</p>
<p>11when I wear burlap, they make my name a byword.</p>
<p>12Those who sit in the city gate talk about me;</p>
<p>drunks make up songs about me.	Ps 69:5-12</p>
<p>13But, I pray to you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>at an acceptable time, in your great enduring love,</p>
<p>answer me with your sure salvation.</p>
<p>14Save me from sinking in the mud;</p>
<p>deliver me from my enemies and from deep water.</p>
<p>15May the flood not overwhelm me</p>
<p>or the deep drown me</p>
<p>or the Pit close over me.	Ps 69:13-15</p>
<p>16Answer me, Yahveh, because your enduring love is good;</p>
<p>turn to me according to your great mercy.</p>
<p>17Don’t abandon me,</p>
<p>because I’m in distress; answer me quickly.</p>
<p>18Come close to my soul and redeem it;</p>
<p>ransom me from my enemies.</p>
<p>19You know my disgrace, shame, and dishonor;</p>
<p>all my adversaries stand in your presence.	Ps 69:16-19</p>
<p>20Insults have broken my heart; I’m heartsick.</p>
<p>I looked for sympathy, but there wasn’t any,</p>
<p>and for comforters, but I couldn’t find any.</p>
<p>21Instead, they gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink.</p>
<p>22May their table become a snare</p>
<p>and their peace a trap.</p>
<p>23May their eyes go blind</p>
<p>and their loins tremble feebly.</p>
<p>24Pour out indignation on them;</p>
<p>overwhelm them with furious anger.</p>
<p>25Make their camp desolate</p>
<p>and their tents deserted.</p>
<p>26They persecute the one you yourself have struck;</p>
<p>they strike even more the ones you’ve already wounded.</p>
<p>27Pile their sins high;</p>
<p>don’t let them experience your goodness.</p>
<p>28Erase them from the Book of Life;</p>
<p>don’t enroll them with the godly.	Ps 69:20-28</p>
<p>29I’m miserable with pain;</p>
<p>save me, God; set me safely up high.</p>
<p>30I’ll praise God with song</p>
<p>and magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>31That will please Yahveh more</p>
<p>than a young bull with horns and hoofs.</p>
<p>32The humble will see it and be happy;</p>
<p>you that look to God for help will revive your hearts.</p>
<p>33Yahveh listens to the needy;</p>
<p>he doesn’t look down on his imprisoned people.	Ps 69:29-33</p>
<p>34Let earth and sky praise him,</p>
<p>the seas and everything that’s in them.</p>
<p>35God will save Zion and rebuild the towns in Judah</p>
<p>so the people can settle there and own it.</p>
<p>36The descendants of his servants will inherit it;</p>
<p>those who love him will live there.	Ps 69:34-36</p>
<p>Psalm 70</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>for a Memorial</p>
<p>1Hurry and deliver me, Yahveh;</p>
<p>come quick to help me.</p>
<p>2Discredit those who want to kill me;</p>
<p>turn them back and</p>
<p>dishonor the people that delight in harming me.</p>
<p>3Because of their disgrace,</p>
<p>turn them back those who say, “Aha, Aha.”</p>
<p>4May the ones that depend on you be happy in you;</p>
<p>may those who love your deliverance repeatedly say,</p>
<p>“God is great.”</p>
<p>5But I’m poor and needy, Yahveh!</p>
<p>you’re my deliverer; don’t delay.	Ps 70:1-5</p>
<p>Psalm 71</p>
<p>1I’ve taken refuge in you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>don’t let me be discredited.</p>
<p>2In your goodness, rescue me;</p>
<p>listen to me and save me.</p>
<p>3Be my rock of refuge that I can always go to;</p>
<p>give orders to save me</p>
<p>because you’re my rock and fortress.</p>
<p>4Rescue me from sinners,</p>
<p>from the grasp of cruel men.</p>
<p>5You’re my hope, Lord Yahveh,</p>
<p>my confidence since I was young.</p>
<p>6the One that took me from my mother’s womb</p>
<p>and sustained me since I was born.	Ps 71:1-6</p>
<p>7Many have marveled over me</p>
<p>because you’ve been my strong refuge.</p>
<p>8I’m full of your praise</p>
<p>and glory all the time.</p>
<p>9Don’t set me aside in my old age</p>
<p>or leave me as my strength begins to fail.</p>
<p>10My enemies speak against me;</p>
<p>they who want to kill me consult with each other,</p>
<p>11“God has left him.</p>
<p>Let’s go get him;</p>
<p>he doesn’t have anybody to defend him.”	Ps 71:7-11</p>
<p>12God, stay close by to help me.</p>
<p>13Consume my adversaries with shame;</p>
<p>cover their faces with dishonor that try to harm me.</p>
<p>14But I’ll keep hoping</p>
<p>and praising you on and on.</p>
<p>15I’ll tell about your goodness</p>
<p>and how many times you’ve saved me,</p>
<p>though I can’t count how often that’s happened.</p>
<p>16I’ll praise the great deeds of the Lord Yahveh</p>
<p>and tell about the goodness you alone have.	Ps 71:12-16</p>
<p>17You’ve been teaching me since I was young;</p>
<p>I still talk about your wonderful deeds.</p>
<p>18Even when I’m old and grey, don’t leave me, Yahveh,</p>
<p>till I tell this generation about your strength</p>
<p>and future people about your power.</p>
<p>19Your goodness is as high as the sky,</p>
<p>you that have done great things.</p>
<p>Who is like you?</p>
<p>20You let me face troubles and distresses,</p>
<p>but you revive me afterwards</p>
<p>and lift me out of deep despair.</p>
<p>21You increase your greatness toward me</p>
<p>and comfort me once again.</p>
<p>22I’ll praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God;</p>
<p>and sing praises with a lyre, you Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>23I’ll shout for joy when I sing to you;</p>
<p>my soul that you’ve redeemed will praise you.</p>
<p>24I’ll talk about your goodness,</p>
<p>because the ones that were trying to harm me</p>
<p>have been discredited.	Ps 71:17-24</p>
<p>Psalm 72</p>
<p>A Psalm of Solomon</p>
<p>1Give the king your judgments, God;</p>
<p>give your goodness to his son.</p>
<p>2May he judge your people fairly,</p>
<p>your oppressed ones with justice.</p>
<p>3Let the mountains bring prosperity to the people;</p>
<p>may the hills bring goodness.</p>
<p>4May he defend the downtrodden,</p>
<p>save the children of the needy,</p>
<p>and crush their oppressors.	Ps 72:1-4</p>
<p>5Let them respect you as long as the sun lasts,</p>
<p>as long as the moon endures—throughout all generations.</p>
<p>6May the king rule like rain on mown grass,</p>
<p>like showers that water the ground.</p>
<p>7May good people flourish in his time</p>
<p>and have abundant peace till the moon disappears.	Ps 72:5-7</p>
<p>8May he rule from sea to sea,</p>
<p>from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>9Let desert nomads bow to him,</p>
<p>and his enemies lick dust.</p>
<p>10Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring presents,</p>
<p>and the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.</p>
<p>11Let all kings bow to him</p>
<p>and every nation serve him.</p>
<p>12He’ll deliver the needy when they call for help,</p>
<p>the oppressed with no one to help them.</p>
<p>13He’ll have mercy on the poor and needy</p>
<p>and save their lives.</p>
<p>14He’ll rescue them from oppression and violence;</p>
<p>their blood is precious to him;</p>
<p>15so may they live long and receive the gold of Sheba;</p>
<p>let them pray to him continually</p>
<p>and bless him all day long.	Ps 72:6-15</p>
<p>16May grain be abundant in the land;</p>
<p>may it wave on tops of the hills.</p>
<p>May it produce like Lebanon;</p>
<p>may its people blossom in the city like grass in the pasture.</p>
<p>17May the king’s name last forever</p>
<p>and grow as long as the sun shines.</p>
<p>Let people bless themselves by him</p>
<p>and all nations call him blessed.</p>
<p>18Bless Yahveh, the God of Israel,</p>
<p>who alone does wonderful things.</p>
<p>19Bless his glorious name forever;</p>
<p>may the whole world be full of his glory.</p>
<p>Amen and Amen.</p>

<p>BOOK 3</p>
<p>Psalm 73</p>
<p>A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>1God is good to Israel,</p>
<p>to those whose hearts are pure.</p>
<p>2I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;</p>
<p>3because I envied the prosperity of the arrogant.</p>
<p>4They don’t seem to suffer when they die;</p>
<p>their bodies are healthy and well.</p>
<p>5They don’t have trouble like other people;</p>
<p>they aren’t stricken like everyone else.</p>
<p>6So pride is the gold chain around their neck;</p>
<p>violence is their clothes.</p>
<p>7Their eyes are puffy with fatness;</p>
<p>they have everything they could want.</p>
<p>8They mock, and talk about oppressing,</p>
<p>and talk down to the oppressed.</p>
<p>9They brag against the sky itself;</p>
<p>their words strut across the world.	Ps 73:1-9</p>
<p>10So his people turn to them</p>
<p>and drink in all their claims.</p>
<p>11They say, “How does God know any of this?</p>
<p>Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”</p>
<p>12They’re the sinful,</p>
<p>always at ease as their wealth grows.</p>
<p>13It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing</p>
<p>and washed my hands in innocence for no reason,</p>
<p>14because I’m stricken all day</p>
<p>and endure grief every morning.	Ps 73:10-14</p>
<p>15If I’d talked the way I felt,</p>
<p>I’d have betrayed your people.</p>
<p>16When I tried to understand why sinners prosper,</p>
<p>I was troubled by it</p>
<p>17till I went to God’s sanctuary;</p>
<p>then I understood their destiny.</p>
<p>18You put them on slippery places</p>
<p>and make them slide into ruin.</p>
<p>19They’re quickly destroyed,</p>
<p>completely swept away by sudden desolation!</p>
<p>20They’re like dreamers when they wake up, Yahveh;</p>
<p>their phantoms disappear.	Ps 73:15-20</p>
<p>21When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,</p>
<p>22I was senseless and ignorant</p>
<p>like an animal in your presence.</p>
<p>23Nevertheless, I’m continually with you;</p>
<p>you’ve taken me by the hand.</p>
<p>24You’ll guide me with your advice</p>
<p>and afterward receive me into glory.</p>
<p>25Who do I have in heaven but you?</p>
<p>I want you more than anything on earth.</p>
<p>26My own flesh and heart may grow weak,</p>
<p>but you’re my strength and portion forever.</p>
<p>27Those who are far from you perish;</p>
<p>you destroy those who are not faithful to you.</p>
<p>28Your nearness to me is good for me;</p>
<p>I’ve made you my refuge</p>
<p>so I can tell everybody how you operate.	Ps 73:21-28</p>
<p>Psalm 74</p>
<p>A Maskil of Asaph</p>
<p>1Why have you thrown us away forever, God?</p>
<p>Why does your anger smoke at the sheep in your pasture?</p>
<p>2Remember your community that you bought so long ago,</p>
<p>that you redeemed as a tribe for your heritage,</p>
<p>Mount Zion, where you’ve lived.</p>
<p>3Direct your attention to its continuing ruins;</p>
<p>the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>4Your adversaries have roared in your sanctuary</p>
<p>and set up their own standards for signs.</p>
<p>5It’s like someone that used an axe in a forest;</p>
<p>6they broke down its carved work with hatchets and hammers.</p>
<p>7They burned the sanctuary to the ground</p>
<p>and defiled your home.</p>
<p>8They said to themselves, “We’ll completely subdue them”;</p>
<p>they set fire to your meeting places in the land.</p>
<p>9We don’t see miraculous signs anymore;</p>
<p>there aren’t any prophets;</p>
<p>nobody knows how long this will last.</p>
<p>10How long will your adversaries scoff, God,</p>
<p>and mock you? Forever?</p>
<p>11Why hold back from doing something?</p>
<p>Why keep your right hand against your chest?	Ps 74:1-11</p>
<p>12Yet you’re my king from ancient times,</p>
<p>who provided deliverance on the earth.</p>
<p>13You divided the sea by your power</p>
<p>and bashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.</p>
<p>14You crushed Leviathan’s heads</p>
<p>and made it into food for animals in the open country.</p>
<p>15You opened springs and torrents,</p>
<p>and dried up flowing rivers.</p>
<p>16Day and night belong to you;</p>
<p>you put the sun and stars in place.</p>
<p>17You established boundaries for the land</p>
<p>and marked out summer and winter.	Ps 74:12-17</p>
<p>18Remember, Yahveh, that your enemies are scorning you;</p>
<p>foolish people are ridiculing you.</p>
<p>19Don’t deliver your turtledove to a wild animal;</p>
<p>don’t forget forever the life of your hurting people.</p>
<p>20Have regard for your covenant</p>
<p>because the land is filled with violent places.</p>
<p>21Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed;</p>
<p>let the poor and needy praise you.</p>
<p>22Stand up for yourself, God;</p>
<p>remember how foolish people scoff at you all day long.</p>
<p>23Don’t forget the clamor of your adversaries,</p>
<p>the constant uproar of those who rebel against you.	Ps 74:18-23</p>
<p>Psalm 75</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>A Song; Set to Do Not Destroy</p>
<p>1Thank you, God, for being close by;</p>
<p>people declare your wonderful deeds.</p>
<p>2“When I set a time for judgment;</p>
<p>I’ll judge even-handedly.</p>
<p>3The earth and everybody in it melt;</p>
<p>I’m the One that firmly set its pillars.</p>
<p>4I said to people that brag, ‘Stop it,’</p>
<p>and to sinners, ‘Don’t lift up your horns;</p>
<p>5don’t raise them up high</p>
<p>or talk with such arrogance.’”	Ps 75:1-5</p>
<p>6Exaltation doesn’t come from the east or west,</p>
<p>7but from God, the judge;</p>
<p>he puts one person down and raises another up.</p>
<p>8There’s a cup of foaming wine in his hand;</p>
<p>he has mixed it well and pours it out;</p>
<p>sinners have to drain it and drink its dregs.</p>
<p>9I’ll sing praise to Jacob’s God;</p>
<p>I’ll declare it forever.</p>
<p>10He’ll cut off the horns of the wicked,</p>
<p>but lift up the righteous. 	Ps 75:6-10</p>
<p>Psalm 76</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>A Song. On Stringed Instruments</p>
<p>1God is known in Judah;</p>
<p>his name is great in Israel.</p>
<p>2His home is in Salem;</p>
<p>he lives on Zion.</p>
<p>3He has broken flaming arrows there,</p>
<p>shields, swords, and weapons of war.</p>
<p>4You’re glorious, more majestic</p>
<p>than mountains full of beasts of prey.</p>
<p>5Our stouthearted enemies have been stripped of their spoil;</p>
<p>they’ve sunk into deep sleep;</p>
<p>none of the soldiers could raise a hand against us.</p>
<p>6At your rebuke, God of Jacob,</p>
<p>horse and rider were thrown down into dead sleep.</p>
<p>7You’re to be respected;</p>
<p>who can withstand you when you’re angry?	Ps 76:1-7</p>
<p>8You rendered judgment from heaven;</p>
<p>the earth lay silent in fear</p>
<p>9when you arose to measure out judgment,</p>
<p>to save the oppressed on earth.</p>
<p>10People’s wrath only heightens your honor;</p>
<p>you dress yourself with the ashes of their anger.</p>
<p>11Make your vows to Yahveh your God and fulfill them;</p>
<p>let everyone bring gifts to the One they need to respect.</p>
<p>12He breaks the pride of princes;</p>
<p>kings on earth respect him.	Ps 76:8-12</p>
<p>Psalm 77</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>Set to Jeduthun</p>
<p>1I raise my voice up to God; I call out loud;</p>
<p>it rises to him so he’ll hear me.</p>
<p>2When trouble comes, I turn to Yahveh for help.</p>
<p>All night I reach out to him,</p>
<p>but I get no reassurance.</p>
<p>3When I think about him, I’m shaken;</p>
<p>I sigh and feel faint.</p>
<p>4He won’t let me sleep;</p>
<p>I’m in such distress I can’t pray.</p>
<p>5I think about days gone by, years ago.</p>
<p>6I remember singing during the night,</p>
<p>meditating and pondering in my mind.	Ps 77:1-6</p>
<p>7Will Yahveh reject me forever now?</p>
<p>Won’t he ever be kind to me again?</p>
<p>8Has his enduring love stopped permanently?</p>
<p>Have his promises come to an end?</p>
<p>9Has he forgotten to be gracious?</p>
<p>In his anger has he withdrawn his mercy?</p>
<p>10I said, “It’s my destiny</p>
<p>that Yahveh has turned against me.”</p>
<p>11Then I reconsider what all you’ve done, Yahveh,</p>
<p>and recall your wonders from of old.</p>
<p>12I think about everything you do.</p>
<p>13Your way is holy;</p>
<p>What god is as great as you?</p>
<p>14You work wonders</p>
<p>and demonstrate your power among the nations.</p>
<p>15You’ve rescued your people by your strength,</p>
<p>descendants of Jacob and Joseph.	Ps 77:7-15</p>
<p>16When the water faced you, God,</p>
<p>it tremored to its depths.</p>
<p>17Clouds poured down water;</p>
<p>the sky thundered;</p>
<p>your arrows flashed.</p>
<p>18You thundered in the whirlwind;</p>
<p>lightning flashes lit up the landscape;</p>
<p>the ground shook.</p>
<p>19You went through the sea;</p>
<p>your path led into deep water,</p>
<p>but your footprints didn’t show.</p>
<p>20You led your people like a flock</p>
<p>by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	Ps 77:16-20</p>
<p>Psalm 78</p>
<p>Maskil of Asaph</p>
<p>1Listen to my instruction, my people;</p>
<p>pay attention to what I’m saying.</p>
<p>2I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,</p>
<p>3things we’ve heard and known from our ancestors.</p>
<p>4We won’t keep them from our children;</p>
<p>we’ll tell the next generation what we praise Yahveh for:</p>
<p>his strength, the amazing things he’s done.	Ps 78:1-4</p>
<p>5He established a Testimony in Jacob</p>
<p>and appointed a Law in Israel,</p>
<p>one that he commanded our ancestors</p>
<p>to teach their children;</p>
<p>6so the coming generation would know—</p>
<p>children not yet born—</p>
<p>so they’d grow up and tell their children</p>
<p>7to put their confidence in God,</p>
<p>not forget what he’s done,</p>
<p>and keep his commands.</p>
<p>8They weren’t to be like their ancestors,</p>
<p>stubborn and rebellious,</p>
<p>who didn’t prepare their heart,</p>
<p>whose spirit wasn’t faithful to God.</p>
<p>9The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows;</p>
<p>yet they retreated in battle.</p>
<p>10They didn’t keep God’s covenant</p>
<p>or follow his Law.	Ps 78:5-10</p>
<p>11They forgot what he’d done,</p>
<p>the miracles he’d shown them.</p>
<p>12He performed wonders for their ancestors to see</p>
<p>in Egypt and in the plain of Zoan.</p>
<p>13He divided the sea so they could pass through it</p>
<p>and made the water stand in a pile.</p>
<p>14He led them with a cloud in the daytime</p>
<p>and the light of fire at night.</p>
<p>15He split rocks open in the desert</p>
<p>to give them drinking water in abundance.</p>
<p>16He brought streams out of rock</p>
<p>and made water run like a river.</p>
<p>17Yet they continued to sin against him,</p>
<p>to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p>
<p>18In their heart they put him to trial</p>
<p>by asking for food they’d like better.</p>
<p>19They spoke against him</p>
<p>“Can God prepare a table in the desert?</p>
<p>20He struck the rock, and water gushed out</p>
<p>and streams overflowed.</p>
<p>Can he give us bread too?</p>
<p>Can he feed us meat?”	Ps 78:11-20</p>
<p>21When Yahveh heard it, he was furious;</p>
<p>his wrath burned like fire against Jacob;</p>
<p>his anger flared at Israel</p>
<p>22because they didn’t believe in him</p>
<p>or trust in him to deliver them.</p>
<p>23Yet he commanded the clouds above</p>
<p>and opened the doors in the sky,</p>
<p>24and rained down manna on them</p>
<p>and gave them bread from the sky to eat.</p>
<p>25People ate the bread of angels;</p>
<p>God sent them food in abundance.</p>
<p>26He made the east wind blow</p>
<p>and directed the south wind by his power.</p>
<p>27When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust—</p>
<p>winged fowl as abundant as sand by the sea—</p>
<p>28he let them fall in the camp around the tents.	Ps 78:21-28</p>
<p>29So they ate their fill of what they craved.</p>
<p>30Before they’d satisfied their desire,</p>
<p>while their food was in their mouths,</p>
<p>31God’s anger swelled up against them;</p>
<p>he killed their strongest</p>
<p>and cut down Israel’s picked men.</p>
<p>32In spite of that, they still sinned</p>
<p>and didn’t believe in his wonderful deeds.</p>
<p>33So he brought their days to an end in futility,</p>
<p>their years in terror.	Ps 78:29-33</p>
<p>34When he started taking their lives,</p>
<p>they finally repented and turned to  him diligently.</p>
<p>35They remembered that he was their rock,</p>
<p>that the Most High God was their redeemer.</p>
<p>36But they tried to flatter him and lie to him</p>
<p>37because they weren’t being honest with him</p>
<p>or faithful to his covenant.</p>
<p>38But in his mercy, he forgave their sin</p>
<p>and didn’t destroy them;</p>
<p>he often restrained his anger</p>
<p>and didn’t express all his wrath.</p>
<p>39He remembered that they were mortal,</p>
<p>wind that blows and doesn’t return.</p>
<p>40How often they rebelled against him in the desert</p>
<p>and grieved him there!</p>
<p>41Again and again they tested him</p>
<p>and pained the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 78:34-41</p>
<p>42They didn’t keep in mind his power</p>
<p>or his rescuing them from their foe</p>
<p>43as when he performed his signs in Egypt</p>
<p>and his miracles in the plain of Zoan:</p>
<p>44he turned their streams to blood</p>
<p>so they couldn’t drink from them;</p>
<p>45he sent swarms of flies that devoured them</p>
<p>and frogs to devour them;</p>
<p>46he gave their crops to caterpillars</p>
<p>and the product from their labor to locusts;</p>
<p>47he destroyed their grapevines with hail</p>
<p>and their sycamore-figs with sleet;</p>
<p>48he exposed their cattle to hailstones</p>
<p>and their flocks to lightning bolts;</p>
<p>49he let loose his hot anger on them:</p>
<p>fury, indignation, and distress—</p>
<p>a band of destroying messengers;</p>
<p>50he directed his anger against them,</p>
<p>not sparing them from plague and death;</p>
<p>51he struck Egypt’s firstborn,</p>
<p>the oldest sons in the tents of Ham.</p>
<p>52Then he led his own people out like sheep</p>
<p>and guided them in the desert like a flock.</p>
<p>53He led them safely so they weren’t afraid,</p>
<p>but the sea drowned their enemies.	Ps 78:42-53</p>
<p>54He brought them to his holy land,</p>
<p>to this hill country that he’d won.</p>
<p>55He drove out the nations in front of them,</p>
<p>divided up the land for an inheritance,</p>
<p>and enabled the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.</p>
<p>56Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God,</p>
<p>and didn’t observe his testimonies.</p>
<p>57They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.</p>
<p>58They provoked him with their high places</p>
<p>and aroused his jealousy with their carved images.	Ps 78:54-58</p>
<p>59When God heard it, he was angry</p>
<p>and came to abhor Israel.</p>
<p>60So he abandoned his house in Shiloh,</p>
<p>the Tabernacle he’d pitched among them.</p>
<p>61He let his powerful Ark be captured</p>
<p>and surrendered his honor to the adversary.</p>
<p>62He allowed the sword to destroy his people</p>
<p>and vented his anger on his inheritance.</p>
<p>63Fire consumed his young men;</p>
<p>virgins had no wedding songs.</p>
<p>64His priests fell by the sword,</p>
<p>and widows couldn’t weep.	Ps 78:59-64</p>
<p>65Then Yahveh woke up as from sleeping,</p>
<p>like a soldier aroused from drunkenness.</p>
<p>66He routed his adversaries</p>
<p>and put them to eternal shame.</p>
<p>67He rejected Joseph’s descendants</p>
<p>and chose not to keep the tribe of Ephraim,</p>
<p>68but chose Judah, Mount Zion that he loved.</p>
<p>69He built his sanctuary as high as the sky,</p>
<p>as enduring as the earth.</p>
<p>70He chose David his servant,</p>
<p>took him from the sheepfolds,</p>
<p>71from tending ewes that had young</p>
<p>to shepherding Jacob his people,</p>
<p>Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p>72He shepherded them with a godly heart</p>
<p>and led them with skillful hands.	Ps 78:65-72</p>
<p>Psalm 79</p>
<p>A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>1Other nations have invaded your inheritance, God;</p>
<p>they’ve defiled your holy Temple</p>
<p>and laid Jerusalem in ruins.</p>
<p>2They’ve given the buzzards your servants’ corpses,</p>
<p>and the wild animals the flesh of your holy people.</p>
<p>3They’ve poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem;</p>
<p>there wasn’t anybody to bury them.</p>
<p>4We’ve become a disgrace to our neighbors,</p>
<p>mocked and derided by the people around us.</p>
<p>5Yahveh, will you be angry forever?</p>
<p>Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?	Ps 79:1-5</p>
<p>6Pour out your wrath on nations that don’t know you,</p>
<p>that don’t call on you;</p>
<p>7they’ve devastated Jacob and laid waste his realm.</p>
<p>8Don’t hold our ancestors’ sins against us;</p>
<p>bring us mercy quickly because we’re in despair.</p>
<p>9For your honor, help us, God who delivers;</p>
<p>forgive our sins for your name’s sake.</p>
<p>10Why should the nations say, “Where’s their God?”</p>
<p>Show those nations your vengeance</p>
<p>for your servants’ blood that they shed.</p>
<p>11Listen to the moaning prisoner;</p>
<p>with your great power save those doomed to die.</p>
<p>12Repay our neighbors seven times over</p>
<p>for the taunts they’ve leveled at you, Yahveh,</p>
<p>13so we, your people, the sheep in your pasture,</p>
<p>can be eternally grateful to you</p>
<p>and recount your praise to all generations.	Ps 79:6-13</p>
<p>Psalm 80</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>Set to Lilies; A Testimony</p>
<p>1Listen, Shepherd of Israel,</p>
<p>you that lead Joseph like a flock;</p>
<p>show your glory,</p>
<p>you that are enthroned above the cherubs.</p>
<p>2Stir up your power against Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh;</p>
<p>and come to rescue us.</p>
<p>3Restore us, God;</p>
<p>look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:1-3</p>
<p>4Yahveh God of Hosts,</p>
<p>how long will you be angry with our prayers?</p>
<p>5You’ve fed us tears</p>
<p>and made us drink them in full measure.</p>
<p>6You made us a taunt to our neighbors;</p>
<p>they laugh at us among themselves.</p>
<p>7God of Hosts, restore us;</p>
<p>look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:4-7</p>
<p>8You took a grapevine out of Egypt,</p>
<p>drove out the Canaanite nations,</p>
<p>and planted it in their land.</p>
<p>9You cleared the ground for it;</p>
<p>it took deep root and spread across the whole land.</p>
<p>10It covered the mountains with its shadow</p>
<p>and God’s cedars with its branches.</p>
<p>11It grew its branches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea,</p>
<p>its shoots as far as the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>12Why did you tear down its walls</p>
<p>so everybody that goes by can pick its fruit?</p>
<p>13A boar from the woods roots it up;</p>
<p>whatever moves in the countryside feeds on it.	Ps 80:8-13</p>
<p>14God of Hosts, please come back now;</p>
<p>look down from heaven and take care of this grapevine,</p>
<p>15the root you planted,</p>
<p>the son you’ve raised for your use.</p>
<p>16Our enemies have cut it down and burned it;</p>
<p>may they perish at the rebuke from your angry look.</p>
<p>17Encourage the man at your right hand,</p>
<p>the son you made strong for yourself.</p>
<p>18Then we won’t turn away from you anymore;</p>
<p>revive us so we can call on you again.</p>
<p>19Yahveh God of Hosts, restore us;</p>
<p>look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:14-19</p>
<p>Psalm 81</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>Set to The Gittith</p>
<p>1Sing to God your Strength;</p>
<p>make a joyful sound to Jacob’s God.</p>
<p>2Sing, beat the tambourine,</p>
<p>pluck the lyre and harp.</p>
<p>3At the new moons blow your ram’s horn,</p>
<p>at the full moon and on your festival days.</p>
<p>4It’s a statute for Israel,</p>
<p>an ordinance from Jacob’s God.</p>
<p>5He established it as a Testimony in Joseph</p>
<p>when he displayed his power all over Egypt.</p>
<p>I heard a language I didn’t know, saying.	Ps 81:1-5</p>
<p>6“I’ll take the burden off your shoulders</p>
<p>and free you from heavy labor.</p>
<p>7You cried out in trouble, and I rescued you;</p>
<p>I answered you while I concealed myself in a thundercloud;</p>
<p>I tested you when you had no water at Meribah.</p>
<p>8Listen, my people, when I admonish you;</p>
<p>Israel, if only you’ll listen!</p>
<p>9There’s to be no foreign god among you;</p>
<p>don’t worship any alien deity.</p>
<p>10I’m Yahveh your God</p>
<p>who brought you out of Egypt.</p>
<p>Open your mouth, and I’ll fill it.”	Ps 81:6-10</p>
<p>11“But my people ignored me;</p>
<p>Israel wouldn’t obey.</p>
<p>12So I let them follow their stubborn heart</p>
<p>and go after their own devices.</p>
<p>13If only they’d listen!</p>
<p>If Israel would just follow my ways,</p>
<p>14I’d quickly subdue their enemies;</p>
<p>I’d turn my hand against their foes,</p>
<p>15I’d doom forever</p>
<p>those who hate me while pretending to obey me.</p>
<p>16I want to feed you with the finest wheat</p>
<p>and satisfy you with wild honey from the rocky cliffs.”	Ps 81:11-16</p>
<p>Psalm 82</p>
<p>A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>1God presides over the divine council</p>
<p>and judges you judges.</p>
<p>2So how long will youpl judge unjustly</p>
<p>by showingpl partiality to lawbreakers?</p>
<p>3Renderpl justice to the weak and fatherless;</p>
<p>standpl up for the oppressed and destitute.</p>
<p>4Rescuepl the weak and needy;</p>
<p>deliverpl them from bad people. 	Ps 82:1-4</p>
<p>5You don’t know or understand;</p>
<p>You’re walking around in the dark;</p>
<p>the very foundations of your world are unstable.</p>
<p>6I say, “You’re gods,</p>
<p>children of the Most High,</p>
<p>7but you’ll die like other mortals</p>
<p>and fall like anyone else.”</p>
<p>8You judge the world, God!</p>
<p>You’re the One that owns the nations.	Ps 82:5-8</p>
<p>Psalm 83</p>
<p>A Song. A Psalm of Asaph</p>
<p>1God, don’t keep quiet; don’t be silent.</p>
<p>2Your enemies are making an uproar;</p>
<p>those who hate you are exalting themselves.</p>
<p>3They’re plotting against your people,</p>
<p>conspiring against them 4and saying,</p>
<p>“Let’s wipe out their nation</p>
<p>so no one will remember them anymore.”</p>
<p>5Together they’re signing a treaty against you:</p>
<p>6Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;</p>
<p>7Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;</p>
<p>Philistia and the people in Tyre;</p>
<p>8Assyria has joined them too;</p>
<p>they’re allied with Lot’s descendants.	Ps 83:1-8</p>
<p>9Deal with them like you dealt with Midian,</p>
<p>with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River,</p>
<p>10that you destroyed at En-dor,</p>
<p>that became like manure on the ground.</p>
<p>11Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb</p>
<p>and their officials like Zebah and Zalmunna,</p>
<p>12who said, “Let’s take over God’s pastures.”	Ps 83:9-12</p>
<p>13Make them like whirling dust,</p>
<p>like chaff in the wind.</p>
<p>14Like a wildfire that burns a whole forest,</p>
<p>like a flame that sets mountains on fire;</p>
<p>15chase them with your storm;</p>
<p>terrify them with your tempest.</p>
<p>16Write shame all over their faces</p>
<p>till they submit to you, Yahveh.</p>
<p>17Frighten them forever;</p>
<p>let them die in disgrace</p>
<p>18so they’ll know that you</p>
<p>are supreme over the whole world.	Ps 83:13-18</p>
<p>Psalm 84</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>Set to The Gittith</p>
<p>1Your Temple is so beautiful, Yahveh of Hosts!</p>
<p>2I long, yes, even faint with longing for your courts;</p>
<p>my body and soul sing for joy to the living God.</p>
<p>3Even a sparrow finds a home for herself,</p>
<p>a swallow builds a nest to raise her young</p>
<p>near your altars, Yahveh of Hosts, my God and King.</p>
<p>4How blessed they are who live in your Temple</p>
<p>and continually sing your praises.</p>
<p>5How blessed people are whose strength comes from you,</p>
<p>who’ve resolved to make pilgrimages to Zion!</p>
<p>6As they pass through the Valley of Weeping,</p>
<p>they turn it into a spring;</p>
<p>autumn rains cover it with blessings.</p>
<p>7They grow from strength to more strength</p>
<p>till each one appears before God in Zion.	Ps 84:1-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh God of hosts, listen to my prayer;</p>
<p>listen to me, God of Jacob!</p>
<p>9Extend your favor to the shield</p>
<p>you anointed over us,</p>
<p>10because one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’d rather stand at the threshold of your Temple</p>
<p>than live at ease in the tents of sinners,</p>
<p>11because Yahveh is sun and shield,</p>
<p>who gives grace and honor</p>
<p>and doesn’t withhold anything good from those who do what’s right.</p>
<p>12Yahveh of hosts, how blessed they are who trust in you! Ps 84:8-12</p>
<p>Psalm 85</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1Yahveh, you blessed your land;</p>
<p>you restored the fortunes of Jacob;</p>
<p>2you forgave your people’s iniquity</p>
<p>and pardoned their sins;</p>
<p>3you withdrew your fury</p>
<p>and turned away from your hot anger.</p>
<p>4Restore us, our Deliverer;</p>
<p>end your displeasure with us.</p>
<p>5Will you be angry with us forever?</p>
<p>Will you extend your wrath to every generation?</p>
<p>6Won’t you revive us</p>
<p>so we can celebrate over you?</p>
<p>7Show us your enduring love, Yahveh;</p>
<p>grant us your salvation.	Ps 85:1-7</p>
<p>8I’ll listen to what our God Yahveh says,</p>
<p>because he offers peace to his holy people,</p>
<p>those who avoid foolish behavior.</p>
<p>9His salvation is nearby for those who respect him,</p>
<p>so there can be honor in our land.</p>
<p>10Truth and enduring love combine;</p>
<p>goodness and peace kiss each other.</p>
<p>11Faithfulness grows up from the ground,</p>
<p>and goodness looks down from the sky.</p>
<p>12Yahveh gives what’s good</p>
<p>so our land can yield its produce.</p>
<p>13Goodness goes ahead of him</p>
<p>and makes his footprints into a path.	Ps 85:8-13</p>
<p>Psalm 86</p>
<p>A Prayer of David</p>
<p>1Listen, Yahveh, and answer me</p>
<p>because I’m troubled and in need.</p>
<p>2Preserve my life because I’m a godly man;</p>
<p>save me because I trust in you.</p>
<p>3Be gracious to me</p>
<p>because I call out to you all the time.</p>
<p>4Make me happy</p>
<p>because I hold up my life to you.</p>
<p>5You’re good, ready to forgive,</p>
<p>and abundant in enduring love</p>
<p>to everyone that calls on you.</p>
<p>6Hear my prayer, Yahveh;</p>
<p>listen to my petition.</p>
<p>7When I’m in trouble, I call on you</p>
<p>because you answer me.</p>
<p>8There’s no one like you among the gods,</p>
<p>no other deeds like yours.</p>
<p>9All the nations you’ve made will come</p>
<p>to worship you and honor you,</p>
<p>10because you’re great and do great things;</p>
<p>only you are God.	Ps 86:1-10</p>
<p>11Teach me your way;</p>
<p>I’ll follow your truth;</p>
<p>make me consistently respect you.</p>
<p>12I’ll thank you, Yahveh my God, with all my heart</p>
<p>and honor you forever</p>
<p>13because you show me such enduring love;</p>
<p>you’ve rescued me from the depths of Sheol.	Ps 86:11-13</p>
<p>14Arrogant people are attacking me, God;</p>
<p>a gang of violent men wants to kill me;</p>
<p>they don’t care about you.</p>
<p>15But you’re a merciful, gracious God,</p>
<p>slow to get angry</p>
<p>and abundant in enduring love and faithfulness.</p>
<p>16Turn to me and be gracious;</p>
<p>give me your strength;</p>
<p>save your servant’s son.</p>
<p>17Show me a sign of your favor</p>
<p>so the ones that hate me can see it and be put to shame,</p>
<p>because you’ve helped me and reassured me.	Ps 86:14-17</p>
<p>Psalm 87</p>
<p>A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah</p>
<p>1The city that Yahveh founded stands on his holy mountain;</p>
<p>2he loves Zion more than the other places in Jacob.</p>
<p>3Glorious things are said about you, city of God.</p>
<p>4“I’ll count Rahab [Egypt] and Babylon among those who know me,</p>
<p>Philistia, Tyre, and Nubia too:</p>
<p>‘They’ve become citizens there,’” people will say.</p>
<p>5But they will say about Zion,</p>
<p>“This one and that one were born here”;</p>
<p>the Most High himself has made it so.</p>
<p>6When Yahveh registers the nations,</p>
<p>he’ll say, “They’ve all become citizens here.”</p>
<p>7Then those who sing and those who play flutes will say,</p>
<p>“The springs of all our joy are in you.”	Ps 87:1-7</p>

<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.</p>
<p>A Song. Set to Mahalath Leannoth</p>
<p>A Maskil of Herman the Ezrahite</p>
<p>1Yahveh God who keeps me safe,</p>
<p>I call out to you day and night.</p>
<p>2Let my prayer come to you;</p>
<p>listen to my call!</p>
<p>3I’ve had so much trouble;</p>
<p>I’m close to Sheol.</p>
<p>4I’m as good as dead,</p>
<p>like someone with no strength left.</p>
<p>5Abandoned among the dead</p>
<p>like someone slain in the grave,</p>
<p>I’m forgotten and cut off from you.</p>
<p>6You’ve put me in the Pit,</p>
<p>in regions dark and deep.</p>
<p>7Your anger overwhelms me;</p>
<p>wave after wave weighs heavily on me.</p>
<p>8You’ve made my friends avoid me</p>
<p>by making me someone they detest;</p>
<p>I’m trapped and can’t escape.</p>
<p>9My sight is blurry from tears;</p>
<p>I call on you every day, Yahveh,</p>
<p>and reach out to you for help.	Ps 88:1-9</p>
<p>10Do you perform wonders for the dead?</p>
<p>Do departed spirits rise and praise you?</p>
<p>11Do they declare your enduring love in the grave</p>
<p>or your faithfulness in the place of destruction?</p>
<p>12Are your wonders known in the dark</p>
<p>or your goodness in the land of forgetfulness?	Ps 88:10-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh, I call out to you for help;</p>
<p>in the mornings my prayers go up to you.</p>
<p>14Why are you rejecting me?</p>
<p>Why are you hiding from me?</p>
<p>15I’ve been attacked and close to death from my youth up;</p>
<p>I suffer from the terrors you bring; I’m overwhelmed.</p>
<p>16Your furious anger has swept over me;</p>
<p>your dreaded assaults have destroyed me.</p>
<p>17They surround me like water all the time</p>
<p>and engulf me completely.</p>
<p>18You’ve removed lover and friend far from me;</p>
<p>my companions lie in darkness.	Ps 88:13-18</p>
<p>Psalm 89</p>
<p>A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite</p>
<p>1I’ll sing forever about Yahveh’s enduring love</p>
<p>and make known his faithfulness to every generation,</p>
<p>2because I’ve said, “You build up enduring love;</p>
<p>in the heavens you establish your faithfulness.”</p>
<p>3Yahveh said, “I’ve made a covenant with my chosen one;</p>
<p>I’ve sworn to David my servant,</p>
<p>4‘I’ll make your descendants secure forever</p>
<p>and build up your throne to all generations.’”	Ps 89:1-4</p>
<p>5The sky praises your wonders</p>
<p>and extols your faithfulness in the assembly of your holy angels.</p>
<p>6Who in the sky can compare with you?</p>
<p>Who among the heavenly beings is like you,</p>
<p>7a God greatly respected in the council of holy angels</p>
<p>and awesome above everyone around him?</p>
<p>8Lord Yahveh of Hosts, who is like you?</p>
<p>You’re completely faithful.</p>
<p>9You rule the raging sea;</p>
<p>when its waves rise up, you quiet them.</p>
<p>10You’ve crushed Rahab like one that’s slain</p>
<p>and scattered your enemies with your strong arm.	Ps 89:5-10</p>
<p>11The sky is yours; the earth belongs to you;</p>
<p>you’ve founded the world and everything in it.</p>
<p>12You’ve created north and south;</p>
<p>Tabor and Hermon shout for joy over you.</p>
<p>13You have a powerful arm and a strong hand;</p>
<p>you lift your right hand high.</p>
<p>14Goodness and justice make the foundation for your throne;</p>
<p>enduring love and truth proceed ahead of you.</p>
<p>15How blessed people are who know the sound of joy,</p>
<p>who walk in the light of your presence, Yahveh.</p>
<p>16In your name they celebrate all day;</p>
<p>your goodness lifts their spirits.</p>
<p>17They glory in your strength;</p>
<p>your blessing honors them.</p>
<p>18Their shield belongs to Yahveh;</p>
<p>their king belongs to the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 89:11-18</p>
<p>19Long ago you said in a vision to your holy people,</p>
<p>“I’ve crowned a great man,</p>
<p>chosen from the common people.</p>
<p>20I found my servant David</p>
<p>and anointed him with my holy oil.</p>
<p>21My hand will make him secure;</p>
<p>my arm will give him strength.</p>
<p>22His enemies won’t outsmart him;</p>
<p>sinful people won’t oppress him.</p>
<p>23I’ll crush his adversaries</p>
<p>and strike down those who hate him.</p>
<p>24My faithfulness and enduring love will be with him,</p>
<p>and I’ll make him honored.	Ps 89:19-24</p>
<p>25I’ll establish his rule as far as the sea</p>
<p>and set his control over the rivers.</p>
<p>26He’ll call out to me, ‘My Father,</p>
<p>my God, the Rock that keeps me safe.’</p>
<p>27I’ll make him my firstborn,</p>
<p>the highest among the kings on earth.</p>
<p>28I’ll keep my enduring love for him forever</p>
<p>and confirm my covenant with him.</p>
<p>29I’ll make his descendants permanently secure,</p>
<p>his throne as eternal as the sky.	Ps 89:25-29</p>
<p>30“If his descendants leave my Law</p>
<p>and don’t follow my judgments,</p>
<p>31if they violate my statutes</p>
<p>and don’t keep my commandments,</p>
<p>32then I’ll bring a rod to bear on their sin</p>
<p>and stripes on their iniquity.</p>
<p>33But I won’t break off my enduring love from him</p>
<p>or deal falsely in my faithfulness.</p>
<p>34I won’t violate my covenant</p>
<p>or alter what I’ve said.</p>
<p>35Once I’ve sworn by my holiness,</p>
<p>I won’t lie to David.</p>
<p>36His descendants will continue permanently,</p>
<p>his throne will last like the sun with me.</p>
<p>37It’ll be secure as permanently as the moon,</p>
<p>as faithful as its witness in the sky.”	Ps 89:30-37</p>
<p>38But, you’ve thrown him away and rejected him;</p>
<p>you’re angry with your anointed.</p>
<p>39You’ve spurned the covenant with him</p>
<p>and profaned his crown in the dust.</p>
<p>40You’ve broken down his walls</p>
<p>and brought his fortresses to ruin.</p>
<p>41Everyone that passes by plunders him;</p>
<p>he’s become a disgrace to his neighbors.</p>
<p>42You’ve raised up his adversaries</p>
<p>and made them celebrate.</p>
<p>43You’ve turned back the edge of his sword</p>
<p>and haven’t made him stand in battle.</p>
<p>44You made his splendor cease</p>
<p>and threw his throne on the ground.</p>
<p>45You’ve shortened his youth</p>
<p>and covered him with shame.	Ps 89:38-45</p>
<p>46How long, Yahveh,</p>
<p>will you conceal yourself,</p>
<p>will your anger burn like fire?</p>
<p>47Remember how long life is.</p>
<p>What emptiness have you created people for?</p>
<p>48Who can live without dying?</p>
<p>Can anyone avoid Sheol?	Ps 89:46-48</p>
<p>49Where’s your former enduring love</p>
<p>that you faithfully swore to David?</p>
<p>50Remember the scorn your servants endure,</p>
<p>how I carry many people’s insults inside me</p>
<p>51that your enemies have used for taunts,</p>
<p>that they’ve mocked your anointed one with.</p>
<p>52Bless Yahveh forever!</p>
<p>Amen and Amen.	Ps 89:49-52</p>
<p>BOOK 4</p>
<p>Psalm 90</p>
<p>A Prayer of Moses the Man of God</p>
<p>1Yahveh, through all generations</p>
<p>you’ve been our dwelling place.</p>
<p>2Before the mountains were born</p>
<p>or you gave birth to the world,</p>
<p>from one end of time to the other, you’ve been God.	Ps 90:1-2</p>
<p>3You turn people back to dust and say,</p>
<p>“Return to dust, mortals.”</p>
<p>4A thousand years to you</p>
<p>are like yesterday,</p>
<p>like a watch in the night.</p>
<p>5You sweep us away like the dreams in our sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning we sprout like grass 6and flourish;</p>
<p>then toward evening we fade like blossoms</p>
<p>and wither away.</p>
<p>7Your anger consumes us;</p>
<p>your wrath scares us.</p>
<p>8You place our iniquities in front of you;</p>
<p>our secret sins are open to you.</p>
<p>9All our days pass away in your fury;</p>
<p>we finish our years with a sigh.</p>
<p>10We live for 70 years or by good health for 80 years;</p>
<p>yet whatever their length, they’re full of labor and pain</p>
<p>because they’re gone so soon, and we fly away.</p>
<p>11Who understands the power of your anger and fury</p>
<p>in comparison to the respect you deserve?</p>
<p>12So teach us to count our days</p>
<p>so we can grow in wisdom toward you.	Ps 90:3-12</p>
<p>13Come back to us, Yahveh; how long will it be?</p>
<p>Have pity on your servants.</p>
<p>14Satisfy us in the morning with your enduring love</p>
<p>so we can sing and be happy our whole life.</p>
<p>15Make us happy for as long as you’ve punished us,</p>
<p>for the years we’ve had misfortune.</p>
<p>16Let us see your work</p>
<p>and our children witness your majesty.</p>
<p>17Bless us, Yahveh our God;</p>
<p>make our efforts successful;</p>
<p>yes, make them succeed!	Ps 90:13-17</p>
<p>Psalm 91</p>
<p>1Those who live in the shelter of the Most High</p>
<p>will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
<p>2They’ll say about Yahveh,</p>
<p>“Our refuge and fortress, the God we trust!”	Ps 91:1-2</p>
<p>3He delivers you from the trapper’s snare</p>
<p>and deadly pestilence.</p>
<p>4He covers you with his pinions;</p>
<p>you can find refuge under his wings;</p>
<p>his faithfulness shields and protects you.</p>
<p>5You won’t be afraid of terrors at night,</p>
<p>of arrows that fly by day,</p>
<p>6of pestilence that lurks in the dark,</p>
<p>or destruction that lays waste at noon.</p>
<p>7A thousand may fall at your side,</p>
<p>ten thousand by your right hand;</p>
<p>but disaster won’t touch you.</p>
<p>8You’ll stand by and watch his recompense to the wicked,</p>
<p>9because you’ve made Yahveh your refuge,</p>
<p>the Most High your hiding place.</p>
<p>10Misfortune won’t fall on you;</p>
<p>no plague will get near you.	Ps 91:3-10</p>
<p>11He’ll make his angels responsible</p>
<p>for guarding you whatever you do.</p>
<p>12They’ll carry you</p>
<p>so you won’t trip over a rock.</p>
<p>13You’ll step on lions and cobras</p>
<p>and crush them.</p>
<p>14“I’ll rescue them that love me</p>
<p>and set up high those who know me.</p>
<p>15They’ll call on me, and I’ll answer them;</p>
<p>I’ll be with them in trouble,</p>
<p>rescue and honor them.</p>
<p>16I’ll satisfy them with long life</p>
<p>and give them salvation.”	Ps 91:11-16</p>
<p>Psalm 92</p>
<p>A Psalm</p>
<p>A Song for the Sabbath</p>
<p>1It’s good to thank you, Yahveh,</p>
<p>to sing praises to you, Most High;</p>
<p>2to declare your enduring love in the morning</p>
<p>and your faithfulness at night</p>
<p>3with a lute and a ten-stringed harp,</p>
<p>with melody on a lyre.</p>
<p>4Because you’ve made me happy by what you’ve done,</p>
<p>I’ll sing for joy over what you do.	Ps 92:1-4</p>
<p>5Your deeds are so great, Yahveh,</p>
<p>your thoughts so deep!</p>
<p>6Senseless people don’t realize,</p>
<p>ignorant mortals don’t understand</p>
<p>7that when sinners sprout up like grass</p>
<p>and the wicked flourish,</p>
<p>it’s only that they’ll be destroyed forever.</p>
<p>8But you’re on high forever.</p>
<p>9Your enemies will perish;</p>
<p>everybody that sins will scatter.	Ps 92:5-9</p>
<p>10You’ve made me as strong as a wild ox</p>
<p>and anointed me with fresh oil.</p>
<p>11I’ve looked in triumph at my enemies</p>
<p>and heard about the defeat of my attackers.</p>
<p>12Good people flourish like palm trees;</p>
<p>they grow like cedars in Lebanon.</p>
<p>13Planted in Yahveh’s Temple,</p>
<p>they flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
<p>14They bear fruit even when they’re old;</p>
<p>they’re still green and full of energy.</p>
<p>15They declare that Yahveh is good,</p>
<p>that he’s our rock; there’s nothing bad about him.	Ps 92:10-15</p>
<p>Psalm 93</p>
<p>1Yahveh reigns, robed in majesty,</p>
<p>dressed in strength.</p>
<p>The world stands firm; it won’t move.</p>
<p>2Your throne has been secure from of old;</p>
<p>you’re from eternity past.</p>
<p>3The floods have swelled;</p>
<p>the roar of their pounding waves has increased.</p>
<p>4But more than the thunder of overwhelming water,</p>
<p>more than the mighty ocean breakers against the shore,</p>
<p>Yahveh on high, you are powerful.</p>
<p>5Your decrees stand firm;</p>
<p>holiness adorns your Temple forever.	Ps 93:1-5</p>
<p>Psalm 94</p>
<p>1Yahveh God of vengeance, shine!</p>
<p>2Rise up, Judge of the whole world;</p>
<p>repay the proud.</p>
<p>3How long will you let sinners celebrate?</p>
<p>4How long will they pour out their arrogant words,</p>
<p>vaunt themselves up</p>
<p>5crush your people,</p>
<p>attack your heritage</p>
<p>6murder widows and foreigners and orphans,</p>
<p>7and say, “Yahveh’s not watching;</p>
<p>Jacob’s God is not paying attention.”	Ps 94:1-7</p>
<p>8You silly people, you pay attention;</p>
<p>when will you ever understand?</p>
<p>9Can’t he hear, who created the ear?</p>
<p>Can’t he see, who formed the eye?</p>
<p>10Won’t he that rebukes nations, discipline you;</p>
<p>doesn’t the Source of knowledge know what you’re doing?</p>
<p>11Yahveh knows that your thoughts</p>
<p>are nothing but hot air.</p>
<p>12The ones you discipline are blessed, Yahveh,</p>
<p>the ones you teach out of the Law;</p>
<p>13so you can grant them relief in adversity,</p>
<p>till you dig a pit for the wicked.</p>
<p>14Yahveh won’t abandon his people</p>
<p>or forsake his inheritance.</p>
<p>15The administration of justice will be good again,</p>
<p>and the godly will follow it.</p>
<p>16Who else will stand up for me against evil people?</p>
<p>Who else will take a stand for me against sinners? 	Ps 94:8-16</p>
<p>17If Yahveh hadn’t helped me,</p>
<p>I would soon have occupied the silent place.</p>
<p>18When I cried out, “I’m slipping,”</p>
<p>his enduring love kept me from falling.</p>
<p>19When my anxious thoughts multiplied,</p>
<p>he cheered me up.</p>
<p>20Can corrupt rulers be his allies</p>
<p>and plot schemes with their wicked laws?</p>
<p>21Can they gang up on good people</p>
<p>and condemn the innocent to death?</p>
<p>22No, because Yahveh is my fortress;</p>
<p>my God the Rock is my refuge.</p>
<p>23He’ll bring their sinfulness back on them</p>
<p>and destroy them with their own evil;</p>
<p>Yahveh our God will wipe them out.	Ps 94:17-23</p>
<p>Psalm 95</p>
<p>1Come, let’s sing to Yahveh;</p>
<p>let’s make a joyful sound to the Rock that saves us.</p>
<p>2Let’s go to him with thanksgiving</p>
<p>and sing to him with psalms.</p>
<p>3Yahveh is a great God,</p>
<p>a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>4He controls the deep sea;</p>
<p>he owns the mountain peaks</p>
<p>5and the ocean because he created them;</p>
<p>he made the dry land.	Ps 95:1-5</p>
<p>6Come, let’s bow in worship;</p>
<p>let’s kneel to Yahveh our Maker.</p>
<p>7He’s our God, and we’re sheep in his pasture,</p>
<p>the flock under his care.</p>
<p>If you hear him today,</p>
<p>8don’t harden your hearts like they did at Meribah</p>
<p>that day at Massah in the desert.</p>
<p>9Your ancestors kept testing me</p>
<p>though they’d been seeing my work for 40 years.</p>
<p>10I detested that generation and said,</p>
<p>“They err in their hearts;</p>
<p>they don’t know my ways.”</p>
<p>11So I swore in my anger,</p>
<p>“They certainly won’t enter my rest.”	Ps 95:6-11</p>
<p>Psalm 96</p>
<p>1Sing a new song to Yahveh;</p>
<p>sing to him, all the earth.</p>
<p>2Bless him in song;</p>
<p>proclaim every day the good news that he saves.</p>
<p>3Tell about his glory the world over,</p>
<p>his marvelous deeds among the nations.</p>
<p>4Yahveh is great and deserves great praise;</p>
<p>he’s to be respected more than all gods</p>
<p>5because the nations’ gods are idols,</p>
<p>but Yahveh created the sky.</p>
<p>6Honor and majesty lie in him;</p>
<p>strength and beauty fill his sanctuary.	Ps 96:1-6</p>
<p>7Families of the nations,</p>
<p>attribute to Yahveh honor and strength.</p>
<p>8Attribute to Yahveh the glory he deserves;</p>
<p>take an offering to his courts.</p>
<p>9Worship him in holy attire;</p>
<p>tremble at him, all the earth.</p>
<p>10Say among the nations, “Yahveh reigns;</p>
<p>yes, the world is firmly set; it won’t move;</p>
<p>he’ll judge the nations fairly.”</p>
<p>11Let the heavens be happy and the earth rejoice;</p>
<p>let the ocean roar and everything that’s in it;</p>
<p>12let the fields celebrate and all that grows there;</p>
<p>then the trees in the forest will sing 13to Yahveh</p>
<p>because he’ll judge the world with justice</p>
<p>and its people with truth.	Ps 96:7-13</p>
<p>Psalm 97</p>
<p>1Yahveh reigns; let the world rejoice;</p>
<p>let the distant shores be glad.</p>
<p>2Clouds and dense darkness surround him;</p>
<p>goodness and justice are the foundation for his throne.</p>
<p>3Fire goes forth ahead of him</p>
<p>and burns up his adversaries.</p>
<p>4His lightning lights up the world;</p>
<p>the world sees it and trembles.</p>
<p>5The mountains melt like wax</p>
<p>at hisY presence everywhere.</p>
<p>6The sky declares his goodness;</p>
<p>every nation can see his glory.	Ps 97:1-6</p>
<p>7Let those who worship carved images be discredited,</p>
<p>those who take pride in idols;</p>
<p>bow to him, all you gods.</p>
<p>8Zion hears that and is happy;</p>
<p>the towns in Judah celebrate</p>
<p>because of your justice, Yahveh,</p>
<p>9You’re greater than all gods.</p>
<p>10Hate evil, you that love Yahveh,</p>
<p>who preserves his holy people</p>
<p>and delivers them from sinners.</p>
<p>11Light is sown like seed for the godly,</p>
<p>like happiness for the godly in heart.</p>
<p>12Be happy in him, good people;</p>
<p>praise him for his holiness.	Ps 97:7-12</p>

<p>and revealed his goodness to the nations.</p>
<p>3He has remembered his enduring love</p>
<p>and faithfulness to Israel;</p>
<p>people the earth over have seen</p>
<p>the deliverance our God gives. 	Ps 98:1-3</p>
<p>4Make a joyful sound to Yahveh, all the earth;</p>
<p>break out in joyful song.</p>
<p>5Sing praises to him with lyre and melody;</p>
<p>6make a joyful sound with trumpets and rams’ horns</p>
<p>to the King, Yahveh.</p>
<p>7Let the ocean roar and everything in it,</p>
<p>the world and those who live here.</p>
<p>8Let the rivers clap their hands;</p>
<p>let the mountains sing 9to Yahveh</p>

<p>and its people fairly.	Ps 98:4-9</p>
<p>Psalm 99</p>
<p>1Yahveh reigns;</p>
<p>let the people tremble;</p>
<p>he sits on his throne above the cherubs;</p>
<p>let the earth quake!</p>
<p>2Yahveh is great in Zion;</p>
<p>he’s exalted above all nations.</p>
<p>3Let them praise his great, awesome name;</p>
<p>he is holy.</p>
<p>4The great King who loves justice</p>
<p>has established what’s fair for all.</p>

<p>and worship at his feet;	he is holy.	Ps 99:1-5</p>
<p>6Moses and Aaron were among his priests;</p>
<p>Samuel too was one who called on him;</p>
<p>they called on Yahveh and he answered them.</p>
<p>7He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;</p>
<p>they kept the testimonies and statutes he gave them.</p>
<p>8He was a forgiving God;</p>
<p>yet he disciplined them for their sins.</p>

<p>he is holy.	Ps 99:6-9</p>

<p>and sing praises to you, Yahveh.</p>
<p>2I’ll pay attention to the way that’s blameless;</p>
<p>when will you come to help me?</p>
<p>In my home I’ll walk in integrity.</p>
<p>3I won’t set anything base beside me;</p>
<p>I’ll hate what they do who fall away;</p>
<p>I’ll stay away from them.</p>
<p>4I’ll cast perverse things out of my heart</p>
<p>and have nothing to do with evil.</p>
<p>5I’ll withdraw from anyone that slanders another;</p>
<p>I won’t put up with people</p>
<p>that have haughty looks or arrogant hearts. 	Ps 101:1-5</p>

<p>to be my friends.</p>
<p>Those who follow the blameless way</p>
<p>are the ones that will be my servants.</p>
<p>7I won’t let deceivers serve in my Temple;</p>
<p>liars won’t maintain their relationship with me.</p>

<p>A Prayer by the Oppressed When They’re Faint</p>
<p>and Pour Out Their Complaint to Yahveh</p>
<p>1Listen to my prayer, Yahveh!</p>
<p>Let my cry come to you.</p>
<p>2Don’t turn away from me in my distress;</p>
<p>when I call, answer quickly.</p>
<p>3My days dissipate like smoke;</p>
<p>my bones lie scorched on a hearth.</p>
<p>4My heart is weak and withers away like grass;</p>
<p>I have no appetite 5in my loud groaning;</p>
<p>I’m skin and bones.</p>
<p>6I’m like a pelican in the desert,</p>
<p>like an owl in desolate places;</p>
<p>7I lie awake</p>
<p>like a lonely bird on a housetop.	Ps 102:1-7</p>
<p>8My enemies taunt me all day;</p>
<p>they ridicule me and use my name as a curse.</p>
<p>9I eat ashes for food</p>
<p>and mix my drink with tears</p>
<p>10because of your indignation,</p>
<p>because you’ve thrown me away.</p>
<p>11My days are like a shadow;</p>
<p>I wither like the grass.</p>
<p>12But you live forever, Yahveh;</p>
<p>you endure for all generations.</p>
<p>13Have mercy on Zion;</p>
<p>it’s time to be gracious to it;</p>
<p>the appointed time has come.</p>
<p>14Your servants delight in its very rocks</p>
<p>and have regard even for its dust.</p>
<p>15So the nations will respect Yahveh;</p>
<p>kings will respect your honor.</p>
<p>16Yahveh will build up Zion;</p>
<p>he’ll appear in his glory.</p>
<p>17He’ll have regard for the destitute;</p>
<p>he won’t disregard their prayer.	Ps 102:8-17</p>
<p>18Write this for the next generation,</p>
<p>so people not yet born will praise Yahveh:</p>
<p>19He looked down from his holy height;</p>
<p>from heaven he gazed at earth</p>
<p>20to hear the groaning prisoners,</p>
<p>to free those doomed to die;</p>
<p>21so people will celebrate Yahveh in Zion</p>
<p>and praise him in Jerusalem</p>
<p>22when the nations gather</p>
<p>and the kingdoms assemble to serve him.	Ps 102:18-22</p>
<p>23He weakened my strength</p>
<p>in the course of my life and shortened it.</p>
<p>24 I say to him,</p>
<p>My God, don’t take me away in the middle of life;</p>
<p>you live throughout all generations.</p>
<p>25You founded the earth long ago;</p>
<p>the sky is your handiwork.</p>
<p>26Even they will perish, but you’ll remain;</p>
<p>they’ll wear out like a robe,</p>
<p>and you’ll change them like clothes.</p>
<p>27But you’ll be the same; your years won’t end.</p>
<p>28Your people’s children will continue in security;</p>
<p>their descendants will thrive in your presence.”	Ps 102:23-28</p>
<p>Psalm 103</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Bless Yahveh, all that I am!</p>
<p>Everything that’s in me, bless him.</p>
<p>2Bless Yahveh, all that I am;</p>
<p>May I never forget how he helps me:</p>
<p>3he pardons my sins</p>
<p>and heals my diseases;</p>
<p>4he rescues me from the Pit</p>
<p>and crowns me with enduring love and mercy;</p>
<p>5he satisfies my years with good things,</p>
<p>and renews my youth like an eagle’s.	Ps 103:1-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh performs good deeds</p>
<p>and renders justice for people mistreated.</p>
<p>7He made his ways known to Moses</p>
<p>and demonstrated his acts to Israel.</p>
<p>8Yahveh is merciful and gracious,</p>
<p>slow to anger and abounding in enduring love.</p>
<p>9He won’t constantly confront us</p>
<p>or always be angry with us.</p>
<p>10He hasn’t dealt with us according to our sins</p>
<p>or rewarded us in proportion to our iniquities.</p>
<p>11As high as the sky is above the earth,</p>
<p>so great is his enduring love toward those who respect him.</p>
<p>12As far as the east is from the west,</p>
<p>that’s how far he’s removed our sins from us.</p>
<p>13Like a father that has mercy on his children,</p>
<p>Yahveh has mercy on those who respect him.</p>
<p>14He knows how we’re made;</p>
<p>he’s aware that we’re only dust.	Ps 103:6-14</p>
<p>15People are like grass,</p>
<p>they flourish like flowers in a field.</p>
<p>16When the wind blows on them, they’re gone</p>
<p>like they’d never been there.</p>
<p>17Yahveh’s enduring love is</p>
<p>from eternity past to future for them who respect him;</p>
<p>his goodness is to children’s children</p>
<p>18to those who keep his covenant,</p>
<p>that obey his commandments.	Ps 103:15-18</p>
<p>19Yahveh has secured his throne in the sky;</p>
<p>he’s sovereign everywhere.</p>
<p>20Bless Yahveh, angels, great in power,</p>
<p>who do what he says and obey him.</p>
<p>21Bless Yahveh, all his hosts</p>
<p>who serve him and do his will.</p>
<p>22Bless Yahveh, everything he’s created</p>
<p>everywhere he reigns.</p>
<p>Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!	Ps 103:19-22</p>
<p>Psalm 104</p>
<p>1Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!</p>
<p>Yahveh my God, you’re so great;</p>
<p>you’re dressed in splendor and majesty.</p>
<p>2You cover yourself with light as with a robe;</p>
<p>you’ve stretched out the sky like a tent.</p>
<p>3You laid the beams for your rooms on the water;</p>
<p>you make the clouds your chariot</p>
<p>and walk on the wind.</p>
<p>4You make the winds your messengers</p>
<p>and blazing fire your ministers.	Ps 104:1-4</p>
<p>5You built the earth on foundations</p>
<p>so it would never shift.</p>
<p>6You covered it with the ocean like a robe</p>
<p>deeper than the mountains.</p>
<p>7At your rebuke it receded;</p>
<p>at the sound of your thunder, it withdrew.</p>
<p>8The mountains rose up; the valleys sank down</p>
<p>to the level you determined for them to have.</p>
<p>9You set a boundary the water couldn’t cross</p>
<p>so it wouldn’t flow back over the earth again.	Ps 104:5-9</p>
<p>10You make springs in the valleys</p>
<p>so creeks flow between the mountains.</p>
<p>11They water the animals in the countryside</p>
<p>and quench the thirst of wild donkeys.</p>
<p>12Birds live beside them</p>
<p>and chirp in the trees.</p>
<p>13You water the mountains from your home above;</p>
<p>your work provides for the earth.	Ps 104:10-13</p>
<p>14You make grass grow for the livestock</p>
<p>and crops from people’s labor</p>
<p>so they could produce food from the ground</p>
<p>15and wine to cheer them up,</p>
<p>so they could make their faces shine with oil</p>
<p>and grow food to sustain them.</p>
<p>16Yahveh’s trees drink their fill,</p>
<p>Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,</p>
<p>17where birds build their nests</p>
<p>and storks make roosts in fir trees.	Ps 104:14-17</p>
<p>18High mountains are for wild goats,</p>
<p>and rocks provide cover for badgers.</p>
<p>19You made the moon to mark the seasons;</p>
<p>the sun knows where to set.</p>
<p>20You send darkness, and it becomes night;</p>
<p>wild animals prowl around in it.</p>
<p>21Young lions roar after their prey</p>
<p>and seek their food from God.</p>
<p>22When the sun comes up,</p>
<p>they go back and lie down in their dens,</p>
<p>23and people go out to work till evening.	Ps 104:18-23</p>
<p>24Yahveh, how many things you’ve done!</p>
<p>you’ve done them all with wisdom</p>
<p>and filled the earth with your creations.</p>
<p>25Yonder is the ocean, big and wide;</p>
<p>it teems with schools of fish without number,</p>
<p>marine life large and small.</p>
<p>26Ships move along on it,</p>
<p>Leviathan too, which you formed to play in it.	Ps 104:24-26</p>
<p>27They all depend on you</p>
<p>to feed them when it’s time.</p>
<p>28You give them food, and they gather it;</p>
<p>you open your hand and satisfy them with good.</p>
<p>29If you hide, they’re scared;</p>
<p>you take away their breath, and they die.</p>
<p>30You send out your breath, and they’re created;</p>
<p>you renew the surface of the ground.	Ps 104:27-30</p>
<p>31Let Yahveh’s honor endure forever;</p>
<p>let him delight in things he’s made.</p>
<p>32The world trembles at his look;</p>
<p>the mountains smoke at his touch.</p>
<p>33I’ll sing to Yahveh as long as I live;</p>
<p>I’ll sing praise to my God as long as I’m here.</p>
<p>34May my meditations please him;</p>
<p>I’ll be happy in him.</p>
<p>35Let sinners vanish from the earth;</p>
<p>let the wicked cease to exist.</p>
<p>Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!</p>
<p>Hallelujah!	Ps 104:31-35</p>
<p>Psalm 105</p>
<p>1Be grateful to Yahveh; call on him;</p>
<p>tell the nations what all he’s done.</p>
<p>2Sing praises to him;</p>
<p>talk about the amazing acts.</p>
<p>3Take pride in his holy name;</p>
<p>let the people be happy that rely on him.</p>
<p>4Rely on Yahveh and his strength;</p>
<p>depend on him always.</p>
<p>5Remember his amazing miracles,</p>
<p>the judgments he’s rendered,</p>
<p>6descendants of Abraham his servant,</p>
<p>children of Jacob, his chosen ones!</p>
<p>7He’s Yahveh our God,</p>
<p>who renders judgment all over the world.	Ps 105:1-7</p>
<p>8He remembers his eternal covenant,</p>
<p>the message he commanded to a thousand generations,</p>
<p>9his covenant with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.</p>
<p>10his statute confirmed to Jacob</p>
<p>as an ongoing covenant.</p>
<p>11He swore, “I’ll give you Canaan to inherit.”</p>
<p>12When they were just a few,</p>
<p>temporary residents,</p>
<p>13they wandered from nation to nation,</p>
<p>from kingdom to kingdom.</p>
<p>14He didn’t let anybody oppress them;</p>
<p>he reprimanded kings on their behalf:</p>
<p>15“Don’t touch my anointed ones;</p>
<p>don’t harm my prophets.”	Ps 105:8-15</p>
<p>16He called for a famine in the land</p>
<p>and cut off their food supply.</p>
<p>17He sent a man ahead of them,</p>
<p>Joseph, sold as a slave.</p>
<p>18They hurt his feet with restraints</p>
<p>and put an iron collar around his neck</p>
<p>19till God’s message came to him</p>
<p>and revealed what kind of man he was.</p>
<p>20The king released him;</p>
<p>the people’s ruler let him go.</p>
<p>21He made him master of his household,</p>
<p>steward over everything he owned,</p>
<p>22even to imprison his officials if he saw fit</p>
<p>so he could teach his elders wisdom.	Ps 105:16-22</p>
<p>23Then Israel/Jacob went down to Egypt</p>
<p>and lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.</p>
<p>24God multiplied his people</p>
<p>and made them stronger than their enemies,</p>
<p>25whose hearts he turned against his people</p>
<p>to mistreat them.</p>
<p>26Then he sent Moses his servant</p>
<p>and Aaron his chosen one</p>
<p>27to perform his amazing acts among them,</p>
<p>miracles in the land of Ham:</p>
<p>28he engulfed their land in darkness</p>
<p>when they defied him and his message;</p>
<p>29he turned their water to blood</p>
<p>and killed their fish;	Ps 105:23-29</p>
<p>30frogs overran the land</p>
<p>even into the king’s bedrooms;</p>
<p>31swarms of flies came,</p>
<p>and gnats infested the whole region;</p>
<p>32he gave them hail for rain,</p>
<p>and lightning flashed in the land;</p>
<p>33he struck down their grapevines and fig trees</p>
<p>and stripped their trees;</p>
<p>34he summoned countless young locusts to come</p>
<p>35and eat the vegetation in the country</p>
<p>and devour the produce from the ground;</p>
<p>36he struck the Egyptians’ firstborn,</p>
<p>the first issue of their strength.	Ps 105:30-36</p>
<p>37Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold;</p>
<p>nobody among the tribes faltered.</p>
<p>38The Egyptians were glad when they left</p>
<p>because they’d come to dread them.</p>
<p>39He spread a cloud over them</p>
<p>and sent fire to light up the night.</p>
<p>40They asked, and he brought quail</p>
<p>and satisfied them with manna from the sky.</p>
<p>41He opened a rock and water came out</p>
<p>and ran into the desert like a stream.</p>
<p>42He remembered his sacred promise</p>
<p>to Abraham his servant.</p>
<p>43He brought his people out with joy and celebration.</p>
<p>44He gave them the lands of nations,</p>
<p>and they harvested what those nations had grown;</p>
<p>45he did it so they would keep his statutes</p>
<p>and observe his laws.</p>
<p>Hallelujah!	Ps 105:37-45</p>
<p>Psalm 106</p>
<p>1Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Be grateful to Yahveh because he’s good;</p>
<p>his enduring love lasts forever.</p>
<p>2Who can recount all his mighty deeds?</p>
<p>Who can ever praise him enough?</p>
<p>3How blessed they are who maintain justice,</p>
<p>who practice goodness all the time!</p>
<p>4Remember me, Yahveh, when you’re gracious to your people;</p>
<p>come and rescue me</p>
<p>5so I can share in your holy people’s prosperity,</p>
<p>celebrate in your nation’s happiness,</p>
<p>and glory in your heritage.	Ps 106:1-5</p>
<p>6We and our ancestors have sinned,</p>
<p>committed iniquity, and behaved badly.</p>
<p>7Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of Yahveh’s amazing acts</p>
<p>or remember his abundant kindness;</p>
<p>instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.</p>
<p>8Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor</p>
<p>and demonstrate his power.</p>
<p>9He commanded the Red Sea to dry up,</p>
<p>and led them through its depths as through a desert.</p>
<p>10He saved them from those who hated them;</p>
<p>he rescued them from their enemy.</p>
<p>11The water drowned their adversaries;</p>
<p>not a one survived.</p>
<p>12Then they believed in him and praised him in song.	Ps 106:6-12</p>
<p>13But they soon forgot what he’d done</p>
<p>and didn’t wait for his direction,</p>
<p>14but made loud demands</p>
<p>and put him on trial in the desert.</p>
<p>15So he gave them what they asked for,</p>
<p>but sent a wasting disease among them.	Ps 106:13-15</p>
<p>16When men in the camp got jealous of Moses</p>
<p>and of Aaron, Yahveh’s holy priest,</p>
<p>17the ground opened up</p>
<p>and swallowed Dathan and Abiram’s rebels.</p>
<p>18Fire broke out among their companions</p>
<p>and consumed the sinful. 	Ps 106:16-18</p>
<p>19They made a calf at Horeb/Sinai</p>
<p>and worshiped a molten image;</p>
<p>20they exchanged their Glorious One</p>
<p>for an image of a bull that eats grass.</p>
<p>21They forgot God, who’d saved them</p>
<p>and done such great things in Egypt,</p>
<p>22amazing things in Ham,</p>
<p>awesome things at the Red Sea.</p>
<p>23So he said he’d destroy them.</p>
<p>If Moses, his chosen one, hadn’t stood in the gap</p>
<p>to turn away his wrath, he would’ve done it.</p>
<p>24They refused to enter the pleasant land</p>
<p>and didn’t believe what he promised;</p>
<p>25they grumbled in their tents</p>
<p>and didn’t listen to Yahveh.</p>
<p>26So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,</p>
<p>27disperse their descendants among the nations,</p>
<p>and scatter them in other lands.	Ps 106:19-27</p>
<p>28They joined in the worship of Baal-peor</p>
<p>and ate sacrifices to the dead.</p>
<p>29What they did provoked him</p>
<p>to send a plague out among them.</p>
<p>30Then Phinehas got up and intervened;</p>
<p>so the plague stopped.</p>
<p>31He’s been considered a good man ever since.	Ps 106:28-31</p>
<p>32They’d already provoked God at Meribah</p>
<p>and got Moses in serious trouble 33for speaking rashly.</p>
<p>34Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like Yahveh told them to,</p>
<p>35 but mixed in with them, learned their practices,</p>
<p>36and served their idols, which led to their downfall.</p>
<p>37They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons</p>
<p>38and thereby shed innocent blood,</p>
<p>the blood of their sons and daughters</p>
<p>that they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;</p>
<p>they polluted the land with blood.</p>
<p>39So they defiled themselves with their practices</p>
<p>and played the prostitute in their deeds.	Ps 106:32-39</p>
<p>40Yahveh’s anger so sparked against his people</p>
<p>that he abhorred his special possession.</p>
<p>41So he gave them over to the surrounding nations;</p>
<p>people that hated them ruled them;</p>
<p>42their enemies subdued them</p>
<p>and oppressed them.</p>
<p>43Many times he delivered them,</p>
<p>but they kept rebelling with their own intentions</p>
<p>and sank into sin.	Ps 106:40-43</p>
<p>44Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them</p>
<p>when he heard them cry out in distress.</p>
<p>45He remembered his covenant</p>
<p>and relented because of his enduring love.</p>
<p>46He even made their captors be kind to them.</p>
<p>47Save us, Yahveh our God;</p>
<p>retrieve us from the nations</p>
<p>so we can thank you and glory in praising you.</p>
<p>48Bless Yahveh God of Israel</p>
<p>from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
<p>Everybody say, “Amen.”</p>
<p>Hallelujah!	Ps 106:44-48</p>
<p>BOOK 5</p>
<p>Psalm 107</p>
<p>1Be grateful to Yahveh because he’s good;</p>
<p>his love endures forever.</p>
<p>2Let his redeemed say it,</p>
<p>the ones he rescued from their adversaries</p>
<p>3and gathered from other countries</p>
<p>east and west, north and south.	Ps 107:1-3</p>
<p>4Some wandered in trackless desert</p>
<p>and couldn’t find their way to any inhabited city.</p>
<p>5Hungry and thirsty,</p>
<p>their souls fainted inside them.</p>
<p>6Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,</p>
<p>and he delivered them from it;</p>
<p>7he led them straight to a city they could live in.</p>
<p>8They need to thank him for his enduring love</p>
<p>and his awesome acts for his people!</p>
<p>9He satisfies the thirsty</p>
<p>and fills the hungry with good things.	Ps 107:4-9</p>
<p>10Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow,</p>
<p>prisoners suffering in iron shackles,</p>
<p>11because they’d rebelled against what God said</p>
<p>and spurned the advice of the Most High.</p>
<p>12So he humbled them with labor;</p>
<p>they stumbled and nobody was there to help.</p>
<p>13Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,</p>
<p>and he delivered them from it.</p>
<p>14He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow</p>
<p>and broke their chains.</p>
<p>15They need to thank him for his enduring love</p>
<p>and his awesome acts for his people!</p>
<p>16because he shattered bronze gates</p>
<p>and cut iron bars in two.	Ps 107:10-16</p>
<p>17Some were fools</p>
<p>and suffered because they rebelled and sinned.</p>
<p>18The very sight of food was repulsive to them;</p>
<p>they came close to dying.</p>
<p>19Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,</p>
<p>and he delivered them from distress.</p>
<p>20He sent his message to heal them</p>
<p>and delivered them from destruction.</p>
<p>21They need to thank him for his enduring love</p>
<p>and his wonderful acts for his people!</p>
<p>22Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving</p>
<p>and tell about his deeds with joyful singing.	Ps 107:17-22</p>
<p>23Some went down to ships by the sea</p>
<p>and did business on the ocean;</p>
<p>24they, too, have seen what Yahveh can do,</p>
<p>his powerful acts on the great deep.</p>
<p>25He spoke and a storm arose</p>
<p>that whipped up the waves,</p>
<p>26waves that swelled up toward the sky</p>
<p>and crashed down to the depths;</p>
<p>sailors’ courage melted away in their terror.</p>
<p>27They reeled and staggered like drunks;</p>
<p>they were at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>28Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble,</p>
<p>and he delivered them from distress.</p>
<p>29He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.</p>
<p>30Then they were happy because they had quiet;</p>
<p>so he guided them to the port they desired.</p>
<p>31They need to thank him for his enduring love</p>
<p>and his wonderful acts for his people!</p>
<p>32Let them extol him in front of the community</p>
<p>and praise him at the elders’ seats.	Ps 107:23-32</p>
<p>33He transforms rivers into desert,</p>
<p>springs into thirsty ground,</p>
<p>34productive land into a salt waste</p>
<p>because sinful people live there.</p>
<p>35But he transforms a desert into a sea,</p>
<p>dry land into springs.</p>
<p>36He enables hungry people to live there</p>
<p>and build a city,</p>
<p>37sow fields, plant vineyards,</p>
<p>and gather a big harvest. 	Ps 107:33-37</p>
<p>38He blesses them and they multiply;</p>
<p>he keeps the number of their livestock from decreasing.</p>
<p>39When they’re decreased and brought low</p>
<p>through oppression, misery, and sorrow,</p>
<p>40he pours contempt on their rulers</p>
<p>and makes them wander in trackless wasteland.</p>
<p>41But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity</p>
<p>and makes their families like a flock.</p>
<p>42The godly see it and are happy,</p>
<p>but bad people don’t have anything they can say.</p>
<p>43Who is wise? Pay attention to these things</p>
<p>and think about Yahveh’s’s enduring love.	Ps 107:38-43</p>
<p>Psalm 108</p>
<p>A Song. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1I’m steadfast, God;</p>
<p>I’ll sing praises in my heart.</p>
<p>2Wake up, harp and lyre;</p>
<p>I’ll wake up at dawn!</p>
<p>3I’ll thank you, Yahveh, among the nations</p>
<p>and sing praises to you everywhere,</p>
<p>4because your enduring love is bigger than the sky;</p>
<p>your truth is as high as the heavens.</p>
<p>5Be lifted up, God, above the sky;</p>
<p>display your glory the world over.</p>
<p>6Save with your power and answer me</p>
<p>so your beloved can be delivered.	Ps 108:1-6</p>
<p>7God has spoken in his holiness:</p>
<p>“I’ll gladly divide up Shechem.</p>
<p>8Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;</p>
<p>Ephraim, my helmet;</p>
<p>Judah, my scepter;</p>
<p>9Moab, my washbasin;</p>
<p>I’ll wipe my feet on Edom</p>
<p>and shout in triumph over Philistia.”	Ps 108:7-9</p>
<p>10Who will take me to the besieged city?</p>
<p>Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
<p>11Are you rejecting us, God?</p>
<p>Aren’t you going out with our armies?</p>
<p>12Help us against our adversary</p>
<p>because human help can’t save us.</p>
<p>13Through you, we’ll do mightily;</p>
<p>you can tramp down our enemies.	Ps 108:10-13</p>
<p>Psalm 109</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1God that I praise, speak up for me!</p>
<p>2Deceitful people speak against me;</p>
<p>they slander me with lies.</p>
<p>3They surround me with hateful words</p>
<p>and fight me for no reason.</p>
<p>4In return for my love, they accuse me</p>
<p>even when I’m praying for them.</p>
<p>5They repay me evil for good,</p>
<p>hatred for love.	Ps 109:1-5</p>
<p>6Appoint someone corrupt over them,</p>
<p>an accuser to stand beside them.</p>
<p>7When they’re judged, pronounce them guilty;</p>
<p>count even their prayers as acts of sin.</p>
<p>8Shorten their lives</p>
<p>and give someone else their position of oversight.</p>
<p>9Make their children fatherless</p>
<p>and their wives widows.</p>
<p>10Have their children go begging,</p>
<p>looking for food far from their ruined homes.</p>
<p>11Have their creditors seize everything they own</p>
<p>and foreigners plunder what they’d labored to produce.</p>
<p>12May no one extend enduring love to them</p>
<p>or be gracious to their fatherless children.</p>
<p>13Cut off their posterity;</p>
<p>erase their names from the next generation.	Ps 109:6-13</p>
<p>14Yahveh, remember their fathers’ sins</p>
<p>and not blot out their mothers’ transgressions;</p>
<p>15always keep them in mind;</p>
<p>Have people forget they ever lived,</p>
<p>16because they didn’t show enduring love;</p>
<p>they persecuted poor, needy people,</p>
<p>and murdered the despondent.</p>
<p>17They loved to curse; put curses on them!</p>
<p>they didn’t like to bless; don’t bless them!</p>
<p>18They cover themselves with cursing like clothes;</p>
<p>it soaks into their bodies like water,</p>
<p>down to the bone like oil!</p>
<p>19Put it on them like a robe they have to wear all the time,</p>
<p>like a belt they always have on.</p>
<p>20Make such things Yahveh’s reward to accusers</p>
<p>that claim bad things about me.	Ps 109:14-20</p>
<p>21But Yahveh God, deal graciously with me</p>
<p>because your enduring love is good;</p>
<p>deliver me 22because I’m poor and needy</p>
<p>and wounded in my heart.</p>
<p>23I’m passing on like a lengthening shadow;</p>
<p>I’m brushed off like a locust.</p>
<p>24My knees are weak from fasting;</p>
<p>I’m skin and bones.</p>
<p>25I’m someone people scorn;</p>
<p>they just shake their heads at the sight of me.	Ps 109:21-25</p>
<p>26Help me, Yahveh my God;</p>
<p>in your enduring love, save me.</p>
<p>27Show them this is your doing.</p>
<p>28Let them curse, but you bless;</p>
<p>when they attack me, humiliate them,</p>
<p>and I’ll be happy.</p>
<p>29Dress those accusers in dishonor;</p>
<p>cover them with their humiliation like a cloak.	Ps 109:26-29</p>
<p>30I’ll praise Yahveh repeatedly;</p>
<p>I’ll praise him in front of everyone,</p>
<p>31because he stands by the needy</p>
<p>to save them from those who condemn them to death.</p>
<p>Ps 109:30-31</p>
<p>Psalm 110</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh said to my Lord,</p>
<p>“Sit at my right hand</p>
<p>till I make your enemies your footstool.”</p>
<p>2Yahveh will extend your mighty scepter from on Zion,</p>
<p>and say, “Rule your enemies.”</p>
<p>3Your soldiers will volunteer readily</p>
<p>when you muster your army in holy array;</p>
<p>your strength will be renewed</p>
<p>every morning like the dew.</p>
<p>4Yahveh has sworn and won’t change his mind,</p>
<p>“You’re a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”</p>
<p>5Yahveh is at your right hand</p>
<p>to shatter kings when it’s time to display his anger.</p>
<p>6He’ll render judgment against the nations by filling them with corpses;</p>
<p>he’ll shatter leaders worldwide.</p>
<p>7He’ll refresh himself from streams along the way</p>
<p>and raise up his head in triumph.	Ps 110-:1-7</p>
<p>Psalm 111</p>
<p>1Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I thank Yahveh with all my heart</p>
<p>in the presence of his godly people.</p>
<p>2His works are so outstanding</p>
<p>no one that delights in them</p>
<p>can quit thinking about them;</p>
<p>3their splendor and majesty</p>
<p>reflect his eternal goodness;</p>
<p>4he makes his amazing acts memorable</p>
<p>because they show his grace and mercy.</p>
<p>5He feeds those who respect him</p>
<p>and remembers his covenant with them;</p>
<p>6he demonstrated his power to his people</p>
<p>by giving them other nations’ land.	Ps 111:1-6</p>
<p>7His works are just and true;</p>
<p>so his people can trust his commandments</p>
<p>8to bring eternal security</p>
<p>when they practice them sincerely.</p>
<p>9He has provided redemption for his people</p>
<p>and ordained his covenant with them forever;</p>
<p>he’s holy and awesome.</p>
<p>10Respecting Yahveh is the most important thing about being wise;</p>
<p>doing what he commands brings understanding.</p>
<p>Praise him forever.	Ps 111:7-10</p>
<p>Psalm 112</p>
<p>1Hallelujah!</p>
<p>How blessed people are that respect Yahveh</p>
<p>and delight in what he calls on them to do.</p>
<p>2Their descendants will be successful</p>
<p>and a blessing to their own generation.</p>
<p>3They’ll have wealth and riches in their homes,</p>
<p>and their goodness will last forever.</p>
<p>4Godly people have light in the dark;</p>
<p>they’re gracious, merciful, and good.</p>
<p>5Goodness comes to those who graciously lend</p>
<p>and conduct their affairs with justice.</p>
<p>6Misfortune won’t overcome them,</p>
<p>and people will remember the good they’ve done. 	Ps 112:1-6</p>
<p>7Bad news doesn’t scare people like that</p>
<p>because they’ve committed themselves to Yahveh they trust;</p>
<p>8they’re confident and courageous</p>
<p>and face their adversaries with assurance.</p>
<p>9They give freely to the poor,</p>
<p>so their goodness lasts forever</p>
<p>in ongoing influence and honor.</p>
<p>10Sinners will see that and get mad;</p>
<p>they’ll grit their teeth—and leave;</p>
<p>what they wanted won’t happen.	Ps 112:7-10</p>
<p>Psalm 113</p>
<p>1Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Servants of Yahveh, praise him;</p>
<p>2bless him from now on forever;</p>
<p>3from sunrise to sunset, praise him.</p>
<p>4On high above the nations,</p>
<p>he displays his glory in the sky.</p>
<p>5Who is like Yahveh our God</p>
<p>that sits on high, 6but humbles himself to watch</p>
<p>what’s happening in the sky and on earth?</p>
<p>7Then he raises up the poor from the dust</p>
<p>and lifts the needy from the ash pile</p>
<p>8to seat them beside the princes of his people.</p>
<p>9He gives the barren woman a home</p>
<p>like a happy mother of children.</p>
<p>Hallelujah! 	Ps 113:1-9</p>
<p>Psalm 114</p>
<p>1When Israel left Egypt—</p>
<p>when the House of Jacob came out</p>
<p>from a nation with a different language—</p>
<p>2the land of Judah became his sanctuary;</p>
<p>Israel became his kingdom.</p>
<p>3The Red Sea saw them coming and backed away;</p>
<p>the Jordan quit flowing.</p>
<p>4The mountains jumped like rams;</p>
<p>the hills skipped around like lambs.</p>
<p>5What’s the matter with you, Sea, that you’re backing away,</p>
<p>or Jordan, that you’ve quit flowing,</p>
<p>6or mountains, that you jump like rams,</p>
<p>or hills, that you skip around like lambs?</p>
<p>7Earth, tremble at the Lord, Jacob’s God,</p>
<p>8who turned rock into water</p>
<p>and flint into a fountain.	Ps 114:1-8</p>
<p>Psalm 115</p>
<p>1Not to us, Yahveh, not to us,</p>
<p>but to you be honor</p>
<p>because of your enduring love and faithfulness.</p>
<p>2Why should the nations say,</p>
<p>“Where’s their God?”</p>
<p>3Our God is in heaven,</p>
<p>where he accomplishes what he intends.</p>
<p>4Their man-made idols are just silver and gold</p>
<p>5with mouths that can’t talk,</p>
<p>eyes that can’t see,</p>
<p>6ears that can’t hear,</p>
<p>noses that can’t smell,</p>
<p>7hands that can’t feel,</p>
<p>feet that can’t walk,</p>
<p>throats that can’t make a sound!</p>
<p>8The ones that make them will become like them,</p>
<p>likewise everybody that relies on them.	Ps 115:1-8</p>
<p>1Not to us, Yahveh, not to us,</p>

<p>9Israel, trust in Yahveh;</p>
<p>he’s your helper and shield.</p>
<p>10House of Aaron, trust in Yahveh;</p>
<p>he’s your helper and shield.</p>
<p>11All of you that respect Yahveh, trust in him;</p>

<p>12He cares about you; he’ll bless you;</p>
<p>Israel and Aaron;</p>
<p>13he’ll bless everyone that respects him,</p>
<p>least and greatest.</p>
<p>14May he increase you and your children;</p>
<p>15may the Maker of earth and sky bless you.	Ps 115:9-15</p>
<p>16The sky belongs to him,</p>
<p>but he’s given us the earth.</p>
<p>17The dead don’t praise Yahveh;</p>
<p>nobody does that descends into silence;</p>
<p>18but we’ll bless him</p>
<p>from now on forever.</p>

<p>Psalm 116</p>
<p>1I love Yahveh because he listens to my petitions;</p>
<p>2so I’ll call on him as long as I live.</p>
<p>3The snares of death were all around me;</p>
<p>the pains of Sheol came on me;</p>
<p>I suffered distress and sorrow.</p>
<p>4Then I called on Yahveh,</p>
<p>“Please save me.”	Ps 116:1-4</p>
<p>5YouY are gracious and good, merciful God.</p>
<p>6You preserve the simple;</p>
<p>when I was brought low, you saved me.</p>

<p>because you’ve been good to me;</p>
<p>8you’ve saved me from death,</p>
<p>my eyes from tears,</p>
<p>my feet from stumbling.</p>
<p>9I’ll walk with you in the land of the living.</p>
<p>10I kept believing even when I said,</p>
<p>“I’m greatly oppressed.”</p>
<p>11I said in my anxiety,</p>
<p>“Everybody’s lying to me!”	Ps 116:5-11</p>
<p>12How can I repay you, Yahveh,</p>
<p>for all your benefits?</p>
<p>13I’ll lift up the cup of salvation</p>
<p>and call on you.</p>
<p>14I’ll fulfill my vows to you</p>
<p>in the presence of your people.</p>
<p>15You care about your holy people when they die.</p>
<p>16Yahveh, I’m your servant,</p>
<p>the son of your maidservant;</p>
<p>you’ve removed my shackles.</p>
<p>17I’ll offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice</p>
<p>and call on you.</p>

<p>what can mortals do to me?</p>
<p>7He’s beside me to help me;</p>
<p>so I’ll look in triumph at those who hate me.</p>
<p>8It’s better to take refuge in Yahveh than trust in people,</p>
<p>9to take refuge in him than put trust in rulers.	Ps 118:5-9</p>
<p>10All the nations surrounded me;</p>
<p>in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.</p>
<p>11They surrounded me on every side;</p>
<p>in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.</p>
<p>12They swarmed around me like bees;</p>
<p>they stung like burning thorns;</p>
<p>in Yahveh’s name I destroyed them.</p>
<p>13They shoved me back so hard I started to fall,</p>
<p>but Yahveh came to my aid.</p>
<p>14He’s my strength and song;</p>
<p>he’s my salvation.	Ps 118:10-14</p>
<p>15Joyful shouting over deliverance</p>
<p>goes on in the tents of good people;</p>
<p>Yahveh’s right hand has done valiantly.</p>

<p>so I can go in and thank Yahveh.</p>

<p>21Thank you for answering me;</p>
<p>you’ve become my salvation.	Ps 118:19-21</p>
<p>22The stone the builders rejected</p>
<p>has become the cornerstone.</p>
<p>23That’s Yahveh’s doing;</p>
<p>it’s amazing to us.</p>
<p>24Today is a day Yahveh has made;</p>
<p>let’s celebrate and be happy in it.</p>

<p>the wonderful things in your Law.</p>
<p>19I’m a foreigner in the world;</p>
<p>so make your commandments clear to me.</p>
<p>20I feel a burden</p>
<p>to always keep your ordinances.</p>
<p>21You rebuke the insolent, the accursed</p>
<p>that wander off from your commandments.</p>
<p>22Take their insults and contempt away from me</p>
<p>because I observe your decrees.</p>

<p>65You’ve dealt well with me,</p>
<p>Yahveh, like you promised.</p>
<p>66Give me discernment and insight</p>
<p>because I believe in your commandments.</p>
<p>67Before I suffered I went astray,</p>
<p>but now I keep your word.</p>

<p>I don’t lose touch with your regulations.</p>
<p>84How long will I live?</p>
<p>When will you punish my persecutors?</p>
<p>85Godless men have dug pits to capture me,</p>
<p>men that don’t conform to your Law.</p>
<p>86Your commandments are reliable;</p>
<p>protect me from people that harass me with lies!</p>
<p>87They almost ruined me,</p>
<p>but I didn’t give up on your precepts;</p>
<p>88in your enduring love, spare my life</p>
<p>so I can keep obeying them.	Ps 119:81-88</p>

<p>91Your ordinances stand today</p>
<p>because everything serves your purposes.</p>
<p>92If the Law hadn’t delighted me,</p>
<p>I would’ve died in my misery.</p>
<p>93But I’ll never forget your instructions</p>
<p>because you’ve given me life by them.</p>
<p>94I belong to you; save me</p>
<p>because I’ve relied on your precepts.</p>
<p>95Bad people lie in ambush to destroy me,</p>
<p>so I’ll diligently keep thinking about your testimonies.</p>
<p>96I’ve seen a limit to perfection in everything else,</p>
<p>but your commandments don’t have any.	Ps 119:89-96</p>

<p>101I’ve stayed off of every errant path</p>
<p>so I could keep your word.</p>

<p>107I’m hurting so much, Yahveh;</p>
<p>give me life like you promised.</p>
<p>108Accept my praise</p>

<p>109My life is constantly at risk;</p>
<p>yet I’m still faithful to your law.</p>

<p>116Sustain me like you promised;</p>
<p>don’t let me lose hope.</p>
<p>117Uphold me so I’m safe,</p>

<p>126It’s time for you to act</p>
<p>because they’ve broken your Law.</p>
<p>127I love your commandments</p>
<p>more than gold, more than fine gold.</p>
<p>128I care about your precepts about everything;</p>
<p>that’s why I hate every false way.	Ps 119:121-28</p>
<p>Pe פ</p>
<p>129Your testimonies are wonderful;</p>
<p>so I observe them.</p>

<p>because my adversaries have forgotten your words.</p>

<p>157I have lots of adversaries and persecutors;</p>
<p>yet I don’t swerve from your testimonies.</p>
<p>158When I look at the faithless, I loathe them</p>

<p>1In my troubles I appealed to Yahveh,</p>
<p>and he answered me.</p>
<p>2Yahveh, rescue me from lying lips</p>
<p>and treacherous tongues.</p>
<p>3What will God do to you, treacherous tongues?</p>
<p>How will he intensify your punishment?</p>
<p>4He’ll pierce you with a soldier’s sharp arrows</p>
<p>and burn you with coals from a broom tree.</p>
<p>5Misfortune awaits me because I’m a foreigner in Meshech,</p>
<p>because I live among the tents of Kedar!</p>
<p>6For too long I’ve lived where people hate peace.</p>
<p>7I’m for peace; but when I speak up, they’re for war.	Ps 120:1-7</p>
<p>Psalm 121</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1I look up toward the mountains—</p>
<p>will my help come from there?</p>
<p>2It’ll come from Yahveh,</p>
<p>who made earth and sky.</p>
<p>3He won’t let your foot slip.</p>
<p>The One that guards you won’t slumber;</p>
<p>4he who watches over Israel never sleeps.</p>
<p>5Yahveh is your keeper;</p>
<p>he’s your protection nearby.</p>
<p>6The sun won’t harm you during the day</p>
<p>or the moon at night.</p>
<p>7Yahveh will protect you from harm</p>
<p>and keep you alive.</p>
<p>8He’ll guard you in everything you do</p>
<p>from now on forever.	Ps 121:1-8</p>
<p>Psalm 122</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents. by David</p>
<p>1It made me happy when they said,</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Yahveh’s Temple.”</p>
<p>2We’re standing inside your gates, Jerusalem,</p>
<p>3that’s built solid and seamless,</p>
<p>4where the tribes of Yahveh go up as required by the Law</p>
<p>to give him thanks;</p>
<p>5the thrones for judgment stand here,</p>
<p>the thrones of David’s dynasty.</p>
<p>6Pray for peace in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>“May they prosper who love you;</p>
<p>7may there be peace inside your walls</p>
<p>and prosperity in your palaces.”</p>
<p>8For the sake of my brothers and friends,</p>
<p>I say, “Peace be in you.”</p>
<p>9For the sake of the Temple of Yahveh our God,</p>
<p>I’ll seek the best for you.</p>

<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1I look to you enthroned in heaven!</p>
<p>2Like a servant looks to his master</p>
<p>and a maid looks to her mistress,</p>
<p>we look to Yahveh our God,</p>
<p>to show us mercy.</p>
<p>3Be gracious to us, Yahveh,</p>
<p>because we’re had our fill of contempt.</p>
<p>4For too long our lives have been full of</p>
<p>the scorn of people at ease</p>
<p>and the contempt of arrogant others.	Ps 123:1-4</p>
<p>Psalm 124</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents. by David</p>
<p>1Let Israel acknowledge,</p>
<p>“If Yahveh hadn’t taken our side</p>
<p>2when people attacked us,</p>
<p>3they would have swallowed us alive in their fury,</p>
<p>4the water would have overwhelmed us,</p>
<p>the river would have rushed over us</p>
<p>5the raging water would’ve drowned us.”</p>
<p>6Bless Yahveh,</p>
<p>who didn’t let us be torn to pieces in their teeth.</p>
<p>7We escaped like a bird from a trapper’s snare;</p>
<p>the snare broke and we got away.</p>
<p>8Our help comes from Yahveh,</p>
<p>maker of earth and sky.	Ps 124:1-8</p>
<p>Psalm 125</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1Those who trust in Yahveh are like Mount Zion,</p>
<p>that can’t be moved, that lasts forever.</p>
<p>2Like mountains surround Jerusalem,</p>
<p>Yahveh surrounds his people</p>
<p>from now on forever.</p>
<p>3Sinners won’t rule</p>
<p>in the land allotted to good people</p>
<p>because they’d tempt the good to do wrong.</p>
<p>4Yahveh does good to those who do good,</p>
<p>who are godly in heart.</p>
<p>5But those who turn aside to their crooked ways,</p>
<p>he’ll lead away with sinners.</p>
<p>Peace to Israel!	Ps 125:1-5</p>
<p>Psalm 126</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1When Yahveh brought us exiles back to Zion,</p>
<p>we were like people dreaming.</p>
<p>2Our mouths were laughing,</p>
<p>our tongues were shouting with joy;</p>
<p>the other nations were saying of us,</p>
<p>“Yahveh has done great things for them.”</p>
<p>3Yes, Yahveh has done great things for us;</p>
<p>we’re happy.</p>
<p>4Restore our fortunes, Yahveh,</p>
<p>like streams in the Negev.</p>
<p>5Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.</p>
<p>6Those who go back and forth weeping with their bags of seed,</p>
<p>will come again with shouts of joy, bringing bundles of grain.</p>
<p>Ps 126:1-6</p>
<p>Psalm 127</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents, by Solomon</p>
<p>1Unless Yahveh builds the house,</p>
<p>they work for nothing who build it;</p>
<p>unless Yahveh guards the city,</p>
<p>its watchmen stay awake for no reason.</p>
<p>2In vain you rise early and work late</p>
<p>to eat the food you gain by painful labor;</p>
<p>he gives rest to the ones he loves.</p>
<p>3Children are a gift from Yahveh;</p>
<p>what the womb produces is a reward.</p>
<p>4Children born to a young man are</p>
<p>like arrows in a soldier’s hand.</p>
<p>5How blessed he is that has a quiver full of them;</p>
<p>he won’t be disgraced</p>
<p>when he confronts his accusers at the city gate.	Ps 127:1-5</p>
<p>Psalm 128</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1How blessed you are that respect Yahveh</p>
<p>and follow his ways.</p>
<p>2When you eat what you earn,</p>
<p>you’ll be happy, and life will be good.</p>
<p>3Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your house;</p>
<p>your children will be like olive plants around your table.</p>
<p>4That’s how you’re blessed who respect Yahveh.</p>
<p>5Yahveh bless you from Zion;</p>
<p>may you see Jerusalem prosper all your whole life.</p>
<p>6May you live to see your grandchildren.</p>
<p>Peace to Israel!	Ps 128:1-6</p>
<p>Psalm 129</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1Let Israel say,</p>
<p>2“They’ve persecuted me often since I was young,</p>
<p>but they haven’t defeated me.</p>
<p>3My back looks like a farmer plowed it</p>
<p>and made long furrows.”</p>
<p>4Yahveh is good;</p>
<p>he has cut loose from me the cords of the wicked.</p>
<p>5May everyone that hates Zion</p>
<p>be driven away and discredited.</p>
<p>6Let them be like grass on a rooftop</p>
<p>that withers before it’s grown.</p>
<p>7The reaper doesn’t fill his hand with it,</p>
<p>or the bundler fill his arms.</p>
<p>8People that go past don’t say,</p>
<p>“Yahveh bless you;</p>
<p>we bless you in his name.”	Ps 129:1-8</p>
<p>Psalm 130</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1Yahveh, I’ve cried out to you from the depths;</p>
<p>2be attentive to my petitions.</p>
<p>3If you kept track of sins, who could stand?</p>
<p>4But you forgive so people can continue to respect you.</p>
<p>5I wait for Yahveh</p>
<p>and put my hope in what he says.</p>
<p>6I wait for the Lord</p>
<p>more than watchmen hope for morning.</p>
<p>7Israel, put your hope in Yahveh</p>
<p>because there’s enduring love</p>
<p>and abundant redemption in him.</p>
<p>8He’ll redeem Israel from its sins.	Ps 130:1-8</p>
<p>Psalm 131</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents, by David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, my heart’s not proud or my eyes arrogant;</p>
<p>I don’t insert myself into things I can’t handle.</p>
<p>2I’ve calmed and quieted myself;</p>
<p>like a weaned child resting against its mother,</p>
<p>my soul is quiet within me.</p>
<p>3Israel, put your hope in Yahveh</p>
<p>from now on forever.	Ps 131:1-3</p>
<p>Psalm 132</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents</p>
<p>1Yahveh, remember David and what he suffered;</p>
<p>2how he swore to Yahveh</p>
<p>and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</p>
<p>3“I won’t go to my own house</p>
<p>or get on my bed 4and sleep</p>
<p>5till I find a place for Yahveh to live,</p>
<p>a place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”	Ps 132:1-5</p>
<p>6We heard it in Ephrathah</p>
<p>and found it in the fields of Jaar,</p>
<p>7“Let’s go to his Temple</p>
<p>and worship at his footstool.”</p>
<p>8Come to your resting place, Yahveh,</p>
<p>you and the ark that represents your strength.</p>
<p>9May your priests be arrayed in goodness,</p>
<p>and your holy people sing for joy.</p>
<p>10For the sake of David your servant,</p>
<p>don’t turn away from your anointed one.</p>
<p>11You’ve sworn to him</p>
<p>a truth you won’t take back:</p>
<p>“I’ll set a son from your body on your throne.</p>
<p>12If your descendants keep my covenant</p>
<p>and the Testimony I teach them,</p>
<p>their descendants will also sit</p>
<p>on your throne permanently.” 	Ps 132:6-12</p>
<p>13You’ve chosen Zion;</p>
<p>you wanted to live there:</p>
<p>14“This is my permanent resting place;</p>
<p>I’ll live here because I’ve wanted it.</p>
<p>15I’ll abundantly bless what it can provide</p>
<p>and satisfy its needy ones with food.</p>
<p>16I’ll dress its priests in deliverance;</p>
<p>its holy people will sing for joy.</p>
<p>17I’ll make a horn from David spring up there</p>
<p>and light a lamp for my anointed one.</p>
<p>18I’ll dress his enemies in humiliation</p>
<p>but make his crown shine.”	Ps 132:13-18</p>
<p>Psalm 133</p>
<p>A Song of Ascents. by David</p>
<p>1It’s so good and pleasant</p>
<p>for brothers to live together in peace.</p>
<p>2It’s like precious anointing oil</p>
<p>running down like it did on Aaron’s beard</p>
<p>and dripped on his robe.</p>
<p>3It’s like the dew from Mount Hermon</p>
<p>that falls on the hills around Mount Zion;</p>
<p>Yahveh commanded the blessing there—eternal life.	Ps 133:1-3</p>
<p>Psalm 134</p>

<p>that he’s above all gods.</p>
<p>6He does what he wants</p>

<p>7He makes clouds come up from the horizon;</p>
<p>he sends lightning with the rain</p>
<p>and brings the wind out of his storehouses.	Ps 135:5-7</p>
<p>8He struck Egypt’s firstborn,</p>
<p>people and animals.</p>
<p>9He performed signs and wonders</p>
<p>on Pharaoh and his people.</p>

<p>and slew powerful kings:</p>
<p>11Sihon, king of the Amorites;</p>
<p>Og, king of Bashan;</p>
<p>as well as the kingdoms in Canaan.</p>
<p>12He gave their land as an inheritance</p>
<p>to his people Israel.</p>
<p>13His name lasts forever;</p>
<p>his renown endures throughout all generations.</p>
<p>14Yahveh will vindicate his people</p>
<p>and have mercy on his servants. 	Ps 135:8-14</p>
<p>15The hand-crafted idols the nations have are just silver and gold</p>
<p>16with mouths that can’t talk,</p>
<p>with eyes that can’t see,</p>

<p>His love is everlasting;</p>
<p>21and gave their land as an inheritance,</p>
<p>His love is everlasting,</p>
<p>22an inheritance for Israel his servant,</p>
<p>His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:16-22</p>
<p>23who remembered us in our low estate</p>
<p>His love is everlasting;</p>
<p>24and rescued us from our enemies,</p>
<p>His love is everlasting,</p>
<p>25who gives good to every person.</p>
<p>His love is everlasting.</p>
<p>26Thank God in heaven.</p>
<p>His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:23-26</p>
<p>Psalm 137</p>
<p>1We sat by the rivers in Babylon</p>
<p>and cried when we remembered Zion.</p>
<p>2We hung our harps on its willows.</p>
<p>3Our captors required us to sing there;</p>
<p>our tormentors demanded happy songs,</p>
<p>“Sing us a song from Zion.”	Ps 137:1-3</p>
<p>4How can we sing about Yahveh in a foreign land?</p>
<p>5If I forget you, Jerusalem,</p>
<p>may my right hand wither.</p>
<p>6May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth</p>
<p>if I don’t remember you,</p>
<p>if I don’t regard Jerusalem</p>
<p>above my greatest joy.</p>
<p>7Remember, Yahveh, against the Edomites</p>
<p>the day of Jerusalem, when they said to the Babylonians,</p>
<p>“Tear it down, tear it down to its foundation.”</p>
<p>8Young woman of Babylon, you devastated one,</p>
<p>how happy will be the one that repays you</p>
<p>with what you did to us.</p>
<p>9How happy will the one be that grabs your infants</p>
<p>and dashes them against the rocks!	Ps 137:4-9</p>
<p>Psalm 138</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1I thank you with all my heart</p>
<p>and sing your praises in front of the mighty.</p>
<p>2I bow toward your holy Temple</p>
<p>and thank you for your enduring love and faithfulness,</p>
<p>because you’ve guaranteed your promises</p>
<p>with the honor your name has.</p>
<p>3You answered me when I called out to you</p>
<p>and made me bold with strength.	Ps 138:1-3</p>
<p>4Kings will thank you, Yahveh,</p>
<p>when they hear what you say.</p>
<p>5They’ll sing about your ways</p>
<p>because your honor is so great.</p>
<p>6Though you’re high above us,</p>
<p>you care about the lowly;</p>
<p>but you recognize the proud from a long way off.</p>
<p>7Though I’m in trouble, you’ll protect me</p>
<p>and reach out against my enemies to save me.</p>
<p>8You’ll accomplish the purposes you have for me;</p>
<p>your love endures forever, Yahveh.</p>
<p>Don’t abandon the ones you’ve created.	Ps 138:4-8</p>
<p>Psalm 139</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, you’ve known me and examined me.</p>
<p>2You know when I sit down and when I get up;</p>
<p>from a long way off you know what I’m thinking.</p>
<p>3You search out my traveling and my resting;</p>
<p>you’re well acquainted with my ways.</p>
<p>4Before I speak,</p>
<p>you know what I’m going to say.</p>
<p>5You’ve protected me front and back</p>
<p>and laid your hand over me.</p>
<p>6Knowledge like that is too amazing for me;</p>
<p>it’s beyond me; I can’t imagine it.	Ps 139:1-6</p>
<p>7Where can I go from your Spirit?</p>
<p>Where can I go to get away from you?</p>
<p>8If I go up to the sky, you’re there;</p>
<p>if I make my bed in Sheol, you’re there.</p>
<p>9If I take the wings of morning</p>
<p>and live by the most distant part of the ocean,</p>
<p>10even there you’ll lead me and support me.</p>
<p>11If I say, “Let darkness cover me,</p>
<p>and the light around me become night,”</p>
<p>12the dark’s not dark to you;</p>
<p>the night’s as bright as day.	Ps 139:7-12</p>
<p>13You formed my inner parts</p>
<p>and knit me together in my mother’s womb.</p>
<p>14Thank you; the way you’ve made me</p>
<p>is awesome and wonderful.</p>
<p>What you do is marvelous;</p>
<p>I know that for sure.</p>
<p>15My frame wasn’t hidden from you</p>
<p>when I was being made in secret,</p>
<p>intricately put together deep in the earth.</p>
<p>16You saw my unshaped substance;</p>
<p>you wrote in your scroll</p>
<p>the length of life you appointed for me</p>
<p>before there was any of it.	Ps 139:13-16</p>
<p>17How precious your thoughts are to me!</p>
<p>How vast their number is!</p>
<p>18If I could count them, they’d outnumber the grains of sand.</p>
<p>When I wake up, I’m still with you.</p>
<p>19Oh that you’d slay the sinful, God.</p>
<p>(Go away from me, you murderers!)</p>
<p>20Your enemies say awful things about you;</p>
<p>they use your name as a byword.</p>
<p>21Don’t I hate those who hate you?</p>
<p>Don’t I despise the ones that oppose you?</p>
<p>22I have total disdain for them;</p>
<p>they’re my enemies.</p>
<p>23Examine me, God, and know my heart;</p>
<p>test me and see how anxious my thoughts are.</p>
<p>24See if there’s anything offensive in me</p>
<p>and lead me in the everlasting way.	Ps 139:17-24</p>
<p>Psalm 140</p>
<p>For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, rescue me from sinful people</p>
<p>protect me from those who are violent,</p>
<p>2that plot evil things in their minds,</p>
<p>and constantly stir up conflict.</p>
<p>3They have pointed tongues like a snake;</p>
<p>viper’s venom lies behind their lips.</p>
<p>4Yahveh, protect me from sinful people;</p>
<p>Protect me from those who are violent,</p>
<p>that try to trip me.</p>
<p>5The arrogant hide traps for me;</p>
<p>with cords they spread a net beside the road</p>
<p>and set snares for me.	Ps 140:1-5</p>
<p>6I said to Yahveh, “You’re my God;</p>
<p>listen to my petitions.</p>
<p>7Yahveh the Lord, my strong deliverer,</p>
<p>you’ve protected my head in battle.</p>
<p>8Don’t let sinful people do whatever they please;</p>
<p>don’t further their evil intentions.</p>
<p>9“Make the schemes they talk about</p>
<p>come down on their own heads.</p>
<p>10Let burning coals fall on them;</p>
<p>throw them into the fire,</p>
<p>into deep pits they can’t climb out of.</p>
<p>11Don’t let slanderers get a foothold in the earth;</p>
<p>have misfortune hunt down violent people quickly.”</p>
<p>12I know you’ll champion the cause of the suffering</p>
<p>and render justice for the poor.</p>
<p>13The godly will thank you</p>
<p>and live in your presence.	Ps 140:6-13</p>
<p>Psalm 141</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Yahveh, I’m calling on you; come quick;</p>
<p>hear me out.</p>
<p>2Consider my prayer as incense</p>
<p>and the raising of my hands as an evening offering.</p>
<p>3Guard my mouth;</p>
<p>watch over my lips.</p>
<p>4Incline my heart away from anything evil,</p>
<p>from practicing sinful things with sinners.	Ps 141:1-4</p>
<p>5Let a godly person strike me or rebuke me graciously;</p>
<p>that would be ointment for my head;</p>
<p>Don’t let me refuse it.</p>
<p>I still pray constantly against the deeds of sinners.</p>
<p>6When their leaders are thrown over the cliffs;</p>
<p>they’ll learn that Yahveh’s word is true.</p>
<p>7“Like someone plowing up rocks,</p>
<p>our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”</p>
<p>8I look to you, Lord Yahveh,</p>
<p>and take refuge in you; don’t leave me with no defense.</p>
<p>9Keep me from the jaws of the trap they’ve set for me,</p>
<p>from sinners’ snares;</p>
<p>10may they stumble into their own nets</p>
<p>while I go on by safely.	Ps 141:5-10</p>
<p>Psalm 142</p>
<p>A Maskil of David when he was in the cave</p>
<p>A Prayer</p>
<p>1I cry out to Yahveh</p>
<p>and petition him;</p>
<p>2I pour out my complaint to him</p>
<p>and tell him my troubles.</p>
<p>3When I feel overwhelmed,</p>
<p>he knows the route I should take;</p>
<p>they’ve hidden traps for me</p>
<p>on every path I walk.</p>
<p>4I look in every direction,</p>
<p>but nobody notices me.</p>
<p>There’s no escape for me;</p>
<p>nobody cares if I live.	Ps 142:1-4</p>
<p>5I’m calling out to you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>“You’re my refuge,</p>
<p>my portion among the living.</p>
<p>6Listen to my outcry</p>
<p>because I’m in desperate need;</p>
<p>deliver me from my persecutors;</p>
<p>they’re just too strong.</p>
<p>7Bring me out of prison</p>
<p>so I can thank you;</p>
<p>the godly gather around me</p>
<p>because you’ve been so good to me.”	Ps 142:5-7</p>
<p>Psalm 143</p>
<p>A Psalm of David</p>
<p>1Hear my prayer, Yahveh;</p>
<p>listen to my petition;</p>
<p>in your faithfulness and goodness, come to my relief.</p>
<p>2Don’t put me on trial</p>
<p>because, compared to you, nobody’s good.</p>
<p>3My enemy has chased me,</p>
<p>crushed me on the ground,</p>
<p>and made me sit in the dark like people long dead.</p>
<p>4So I feel overwhelmed,</p>
<p>and my heart is empty.</p>
<p>5I remember the old days;</p>
<p>I ponder everything you’ve done</p>
<p>and think about what you’ve made.</p>
<p>6I reach out for you,</p>
<p>thirsty for you like parched ground.	Ps 143:1-6</p>
<p>7Answer me right away, Yahveh;</p>
<p>my spirit is failing; don’t hide from me,</p>
<p>or I’ll get like those destined for the Pit.</p>
<p>8Let me hear about your enduring love every morning</p>
<p>because I put my trust in you;</p>
<p>show me where to walk</p>
<p>because I’m lifting myself up to you.</p>
<p>9Deliver me from my enemies;</p>
<p>you’re my refuge.</p>
<p>10Teach me how to do your will</p>
<p>because you’re my God;</p>
<p>let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</p>
<p>11In defense of your honor, Yahveh, protect me;</p>
<p>in your goodness, take me away from trouble;</p>
<p>12in your enduring love, slay my enemies;</p>
<p>destroy the ones that abuse me,</p>

<p>my stronghold and deliverer,</p>
<p>my shield and refuge,</p>
<p>who subdues nations.</p>
<p>3Yahveh, what are we that you give us any thought</p>
<p>or care about us?</p>
<p>4We’re like a breath;</p>
<p>our lifetime is like a passing shadow.	Ps 144:1-4</p>
<p>5Lower the sky, Yahveh, and come down;</p>
<p>touch the mountains and make them smoke.</p>
<p>6Throw your lightning bolts and scatter my enemies;</p>
<p>shoot your arrows and rout them.</p>
<p>7Reach down from on high</p>
<p>and rescue me from deep water,</p>
<p>from aliens 8that lie,</p>
<p>whose right hand deceives.</p>
<p>9I’ll sing you a new song, God;</p>
<p>I’ll sing praise to you on a ten-string harp.</p>
<p>10You deliver kings</p>
<p>and rescued David from the cruel sword.</p>
<p>11Deliver me from aliens that lie,</p>
<p>whose right hand deceives.	Ps 144:5-11</p>
<p>12Make our sons in their youth like grown-up plants</p>
<p>and our daughters like corner pillars in a palace.</p>
<p>13Fill our granaries with every kind of crop;</p>
<p>have our flocks bear thousands—tens of thousands—in our pastures.</p>
<p>14Have our cattle deliver without miscarriage or failure to bear;</p>
<p>make it so there’s no danger in our streets.</p>
