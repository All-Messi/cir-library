        <p>HABAKKUK</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1The Oracle That Habakkuk the Prophet Saw</p>
<p>Habakkuk’s Complaint</p>
<p>2How long, Yahveh, will I call out for help,</p>
<p>and you won’t listen?</p>
<p>I cry out, “Violence!”</p>
<p>but you don’t protect me.</p>
<p>3Why do you make me watch wickedness?</p>
<p>Destruction and violence go on right in front of me;</p>
<p>fighting and arguing keep getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>4The courts ignore the Law,</p>
<p>so they don’t render justice;</p>
<p>sinners are in the majority,</p>
<p>so they pervert justice. 	Hab 1:1-4</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Answer</p>
<p>5Yahveh’s first answer:</p>
<p>“Look around at the nations</p>
<p>and be astounded.</p>
<p>I’m doing something in your own day</p>
<p>you wouldn’t believe if somebody told you.</p>
<p>6I’m arousing the Babylonians,</p>
<p>that fierce, impetuous people</p>
<p>that marches across the region</p>
<p>to seize places to live that aren’t theirs.</p>
<p>7They’re dreaded and feared;</p>
<p>they’re a law unto themselves</p>
<p>and make their own rules.</p>
<p>8Their horses are faster than cheetahs,</p>
<p>more vicious than wolves at dusk.</p>
<p>Their cavalry comes charging from far away</p>
<p>and swoops down like eagles to devour their prey.</p>
<p>9They come bent on violence;</p>
<p>their hordes surge forward like a desert wind</p>
<p>and sweep captives away like sand.</p>
<p>10They scoff at kings and ridicule rulers;</p>
<p>they laugh at fortresses</p>
<p>and pile up ramparts to besiege them.</p>
<p>11They rush through like the wind and move on;</p>
<p>they’re guilty men whose power is their god.” 	Hab 1:5-11</p>
<p>Habakkuk’s Second Complaint</p>
<p>12Aren’t you from everlasting,</p>
<p>Yahveh, my God, my Holy One?</p>
<p>Surely you won’t let us die.</p>
<p>You, Yahveh, have appointed the Babylonians to judge us;</p>
<p>you, Rock, have sent them to punish us.</p>
<p>13You’re too pure to approve of evil;</p>
<p>you can’t countenance wickedness.</p>
<p>Why do you tolerate treacherous people?</p>
<p>Why are you silent when sinners swallow up</p>
<p>people better than themselves?	Hab 1:12-13</p>
<p>14They treat us like fish in the sea,</p>
<p>like creatures with no rulers.</p>
<p>15Sinful people fish us out with hooks</p>
<p>and scoop us up with nets.</p>
<p>They catch us in their seines;</p>
<p>they’re happy and celebrate.</p>
<p>16So they sacrifice to their seines</p>
<p>and burn incense to their fishing nets,</p>
<p>because they make large catches with them</p>
<p>and have lots to eat.</p>
<p>17Will they empty their nets then</p>
<p>and keep on killing nations without mercy?	Hab 1:14-17</p>
<p>2:1I’ll stand at my post and watch;</p>
<p>I’ll station myself on a watchtower</p>
<p>to see how he’ll answer my complaint.</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Second Answer</p>
<p>2Yahveh’s second answer:</p>
<p>“Write down this vision, etch it on tablets</p>
<p>so the messenger can run with it.</p>
<p>3The vision is still for a future time;</p>
<p>it speeds toward the goal and won’t fail.</p>
<p>Though it seems slow, wait for it;</p>
<p>it will certainly come in due time.	Hab 2:1-3</p>
<p>4“Arrogant people aren’t righteous,</p>
<p>but the righteous will have life by his trust in me.</p>
<p>5Besides, wine betrays the arrogant, so they don’t last.</p>
<p>Their greed increases like the grave;</p>
<p>like death, they’re never satisfied.</p>
<p>They gather the whole world to themselves</p>
<p>and use everybody. 				Hab 2:4-5</p>
<p>6“Won’t people taunt them and say in mockery,</p>
<p>‘Misfortune awaits you that accumulate what’s not yours</p>
<p>and make yourselves rich by extortion</p>
<p>—for how long, though?</p>
<p>7Won’t your creditors suddenly decide</p>
<p>to call in their loans?</p>
<p>You’ll become their plunder.</p>
<p>8Since you’ve looted many nations,</p>
<p>other nations will loot you</p>
<p>for the blood of men and women that you shed,</p>
<p>for your violence to towns and their people.’</p>
<p>Hab 2:6-8</p>
<p>9“Misfortune awaits whoever uses dishonest gain</p>
<p>to build a prominent house up high,</p>
<p>like a nest beyond harm’s reach.</p>
<p>10You’ve plotted shamelessly to build that house</p>
<p>by ruining lots of people’s lives;</p>
<p>you end up sinning against yourself.</p>
<p>11The very stones cry out against you from the wall,</p>
<p>and the beams in the ceiling echo the complaint.	Hab 2:9-11</p>
<p>12“Misfortune awaits whoever builds a city with murder</p>
<p>and establishes a town by violence!</p>
<p>13Isn’t it from Yahveh of hosts</p>
<p>that people labor only to have it burn up</p>
<p>and nations wear themselves out for nothing?</p>
<p>14The knowledge of Yahveh’s glory</p>
<p>will cover the earth like water fills the ocean. Hab 2:12-14</p>
<p>15“Misfortune awaits you that make other people drink</p>
<p>your venom to get them drunk</p>
<p>so you can stare at their disgrace!</p>
<p>16You’ll be disgraced, not honored;</p>
<p>you’ll drink and expose your own disgrace.</p>
<p>The cup in Yahveh’s right hand will come around to you;</p>
<p>complete disgrace will cover up your honor.</p>
<p>17The violence you did to Lebanon will overwhelm you;</p>
<p>the devastation of its animals will terrify you,</p>
<p>because of the murder and violence</p>
<p>you did to the land, its towns, and their people.</p>
<p>Hab 2:15-17</p>
<p>18“What good is an idol after its maker carves it,</p>
<p>or an image, which represents a lie?</p>
<p>Its maker puts his faith in what he’s made</p>
<p>when the idol he’s made can’t talk.</p>
<p>19Misfortune awaits whoever says to a piece of wood, ‘Wake up!’</p>
<p>or to a speechless stone, ‘Get up and help us!’</p>
<p>That’s your teacher!?</p>
<p>It’s overlaid with gold and silver,</p>
<p>but it can’t breathe.</p>
<p>20But Yahveh is in his holy Temple;</p>
<p>let the whole earth be silent in his presence.” 	Hab 2:18-20</p>
<p>3:1A Prayer of Habakkuk</p>
<p>Set to Shigionoth</p>
<p>2Yahveh, I’ve heard about you and stand in awe.</p>
<p>Revive your work in our time</p>
<p>and show what you can do;</p>
<p>in your anger remember mercy.	Hab 3:1-2</p>
<p>3God is coming from Teman,</p>
<p>the Holy One from Mount Paran.</p>
<p>His brilliance covers the sky;</p>
<p>his praise fills the earth.</p>
<p>4His brightness shines like sunshine;</p>
<p>lightning bolts flash from his hand</p>
<p>where his power lies hidden.</p>
<p>5Disease goes ahead of him;</p>
<p>plague follows him.</p>
<p>6He stops and looks the world over;</p>
<p>the nations see him and tremble.</p>
<p>He beats down the everlasting mountains</p>
<p>and levels the ancient hills.</p>
<p>His ways of working have existed from eternity.</p>
<p>7I can see the tents in Nubia in distress;</p>
<p>the tent curtains in Midian are shaking in fear.	Hab 3:3-7</p>
<p>8Did you rage against the rivers?</p>
<p>Was your anger against the streams?</p>
<p>Was it against the sea</p>
<p>that you drove your steeds and victory chariots?</p>
<p>9No. You took the cover off your bow</p>
<p>and put your arrows to the string.</p>
<p>You washed out canyons in the ground.</p>
<p>10The mountains watched you and shook</p>
<p>as the torrent flooded past;</p>
<p>The roaring deep cried out in surrender</p>
<p>and lifted its hands in submission.</p>
<p>11The sun and moon stood still;</p>
<p>they retreated at the flash of your arrows</p>
<p>and the radiance of your spear. 			Hab 3:8-11</p>
<p>12In your fury you marched across the world;</p>
<p>in your anger you trampled nations.</p>
<p>13You headed out to save your people,</p>
<p>to rescue your anointed ones.</p>
<p>You crushed the heads of the wicked</p>
<p>and laid them open from neck to thigh.</p>
<p>14You thrust through the leaders of their troops</p>
<p>with their own spears.</p>
<p>They’d stormed in to scatter us,</p>
<p>celebrating as if running over the poor unchecked.</p>
<p>15But with your horses you tramped down the sea of soldiers,</p>
<p>that surging mighty flood.	Hab 3:12-15</p>
<p>16I heard it and my body trembled;</p>
<p>my lips quivered at the sound.</p>
<p>My knees buckled;</p>
<p>I froze, unable to move;</p>
<p>I’ll wait in silence for distress</p>
<p>to descend on our invaders.</p>
<p>17Though the fir tree hasn’t budded,</p>
<p>and there’re no grapes on the vine,</p>
<p>and the fields aren’t growing any food,</p>
<p>though the flock has scattered from the fold,</p>
<p>and there are no cattle in the stalls,</p>
<p>18I’ll still rejoice in Yahveh</p>
<p>and delight in the salvation he’ll bring me.</p>
<p>19The Lord Yahveh is my strength;</p>
<p>he’s made my feet like deer’s feet</p>
<p>and enables me to walk surefooted on high places.</p>
<p>(For the choir director accompanied by my stringed instruments) 	Hab 3:16-19</p>
