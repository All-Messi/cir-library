        <p>OBADIAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1The Vision of Obadiah</p>
<p>Edom’s Judgment Foretold</p>
<p>The Lord Yahveh says this about Edom;</p>
<p>we’ve heard the report;</p>
<p>an ambassador has gone out to the nations to say,</p>
<p>“To arms, attack Edom.”</p>
<p>2“I’ll make you a minor player among the nations</p>
<p>and utterly despised.</p>
<p>3Your arrogance has deceived you,</p>
<p>you that live high in caves</p>
<p>and tell yourselves that nobody can bring you down.</p>
<p>4Though you’ve built high like an eagle</p>
<p>and put your nest among the stars,</p>
<p>I’ll bring you down. 	Obad 1-4</p>
<p>5“If thieves came to you at night—</p>
<p>what disaster awaits you!—</p>
<p>wouldn’t they steal only till they had enough?</p>
<p>If grape pickers came,</p>
<p>wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?</p>
<p>6But how you’ll be pillaged, Esau,</p>
<p>and your hidden treasures found!</p>
<p>7Your allies will force you out of your borders;</p>
<p>the people at peace with you</p>
<p>will turn on you and overpower you;</p>
<p>the ones you eat with</p>
<p>will set up an ambush for you.</p>
<p>(You won’t suspect it.)</p>
<p>8At that time,” Yahveh says, “won’t I destroy</p>
<p>the wise men out of Edom</p>
<p>and those with understanding from Esau’s mountain?</p>
<p>9Your strong troops will be afraid, Teman;</p>
<p>so everybody from Esau’s mountains</p>
<p>will be cut down in the slaughter.	Obad 5-9</p>
<p>Edom’s Violence Against Israel</p>
<p>10“Because of your violence against Jacob your brother,</p>
<p>you’ll be covered with disgrace and permanently eliminated.</p>
<p>11You stood aloof</p>
<p>while foreigners cast lots for Jerusalem</p>
<p>and strangers entered its gates</p>
<p>to carry off its wealth.</p>
<p>You even joined them.</p>
<p>12You shouldn’t have gloated over your brother’s misfortune;</p>
<p>you shouldn’t have celebrated over Judah’s destruction</p>
<p>or boasted about his distress.</p>
<p>13You shouldn’t have entered my people’s gate</p>
<p>at the time of their disaster</p>
<p>or looted their goods during their catastrophe.</p>
<p>14You shouldn’t have stood at the fork in the road</p>
<p>to cut down their refugees</p>
<p>or have betrayed the survivors in their misfortune. 	Obad 10-14</p>
<p>Edom’s Destruction, Israel’s Restoration</p>
<p>15“Yahveh’s judgment is coming on all the nations.</p>
<p>What you’ve done to Israel will be done to you;</p>
<p>your dealings will come back on your own head.</p>
<p>16You and those nations will drink the same punishment</p>
<p>you swallowed on my holy mountain.</p>
<p>You’ll all drink till you drown.</p>
<p>17But on Mount Zion some will escape,</p>
<p>and it’ll be holy;</p>
<p>Jacob’s house will return to reclaim its possession.</p>
<p>18Then Jacob’s house will become a fire,</p>
<p>Joseph’s house a flame,</p>
<p>Esau’s house the stubble.</p>
<p>They’ll set him on fire and burn him up;</p>
<p>there’ll be no survivors in Edom.”</p>
<p>Yahveh has said it.	Obad 15-18</p>
<p>19Then my people in the Negev will take over Esau’s mountains;</p>
<p>the ones in the western foothills will occupy the Philistine plain.</p>
<p>They’ll take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria;</p>
<p>The people of Benjamin will occupy Gilead.</p>
<p>20Exiles from Israel</p>
<p>will replace the Phoenicians as far north as Zarephath;</p>
<p>the captives from Jerusalem that are in Sepharad [north]</p>
<p>will resettle their towns in the Negev [south].</p>
<p>21All those who were rescuedLXX will go up to Mount Zion</p>
<p>and extend its dominion over Esau’s mountains.</p>
<p>The kingdom will belong to Yahveh.	Obad 19-21</p>
