        <p>EXODUS</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1Israel’s descendants and their households that went to Egypt with Jacob: 2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 3Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 4Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher: 570 people (though Joseph was already there)</p>
<p>6That whole generation died, 7but Israel’s descendants multiplied and became so numerous they filled the country.	Ex 1:1-7</p>
<p>The Israelites Oppressed</p>
<p>8In time, a new king came to power in Egypt who didn’t know Joseph. 9He told his people, “There are too many Israelites, and they’re too strong. 10Let’s deal with them wisely so, if there’s war, they won’t join our enemies and leave.” 11They appointed taskmasters and subjected the Israelites to hard labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians were afraid of them [13] 14and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields. 	Ex 1:8-14</p>
<p>15The king told the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah, 16“When you’re helping the Hebrew women on the birth stool, kill the boys.” 17But the midwives respected God and let them live. 18The king called them in and asked, “Why have you let the boys live?”</p>
<p>19“Hebrew women aren’t like Egyptian women. They deliver quickly before midwives can get there.” 20God was good to the midwives, and the people kept multiplying. 21Because the midwives respected God, he gave them families of their own. 22Pharaoh kept telling his people to throw the boys in the Nile but keep the girls.	Ex 1:15-22</p>
<p>The Birth of Moses</p>
<p>2:1A descendant from Levi married a woman from Levi, 2and she had a son. When she saw he was such a handsome baby, she hid him for three months. 3When she couldn’t hide him anymore, she got a papyrus reed basket and covered it with tar. She put him in it and set it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 4His sister stood a distance away to see what would happen to him. 5Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the Nile with her attendants. As she walked along the river, she saw the basket in the reeds and had her maid bring it to her.</p>
<p>6When she opened it, she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him, “This is one of the Hebrews’ babies.”</p>
<p>7Then his sister asked her, “Do you want me to call a Hebrew nurse for you?”</p>
<p>8“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>She went and called his mother.</p>
<p>9Pharaoh’s daughter said, “Nurse him for me, and I’ll pay you.” 10He grew and she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses because she ‘pulled him out’ of the water.									          Ex 2:1-10</p>
<p>Moses Flees from Egypt</p>
<p>11When Moses grew up, he went out to his relatives and looked at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. 12He looked around and saw nobody was there; he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13He went out the next day, and two Hebrews were fighting. He asked the one that started it, “Why are you hitting your friend?”</p>
<p>14“Who made you a ruler or judge over us? Are you going to kill me like you did that Egyptian?”</p>
<p>Moses was afraid, “Clearly, people know what I did.”</p>
<p>15When Pharaoh heard about it, he tried to execute Moses, but he fled to Midian.</p>
<p>Ex 2:11-15</p>
<p>He sat down by a well. 16The priest in Midian had seven daughters that came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father’s flock. 17Some other shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and helped them and watered their flock. 18When they went to their father Reuel/Jethro, he asked,</p>
<p>“How did you get back so soon today?”</p>
<p>19“An Egyptian protected us from the shepherds. He even drew water for the flock.”</p>
<p>20“Where is he? Why did you leave him behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”</p>
<p>21Moses was willing to live with the man, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah. 22She had a son he named Gershom, “Because I’ve been a ‘foreigner’ in a foreign country.”	 Ex 2:16-22</p>
<p>23After a long time, that king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under the slavery. They cried out and their call for help went up to God. 24He heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 25He took notice of them; he knew who they were.</p>
<p>Ex 2:23-25</p>
<p>Moses and the Burning Bush</p>
<p>3:1Moses was pasturing Jethro’s/Reuel’s flock and led it to the west side of the open country around Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God. 2The angel of Yahveh appeared to him in a blazing bush. Moses looked up and saw the bush on fire, but it didn’t burn up. 3He said, “I have to go over and see this curious thing. Why isn’t it burning up?” 4When Yahveh saw him coming to look, he called from the bush,</p>
<p>“Moses!”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>5“Don’t come any closer. Take your sandals off. You’re standing on sacred ground. 6I’m the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</p>
<p>Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.</p>
<p>7“I’ve seen my people’s suffering in Egypt and paid attention to their outcry because of the taskmasters. 8I’ve come down to deliver them and take them out to a good land with lots of room, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. 9I’ve seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10Go; I’ll send you to Pharaoh so you can bring my people out of Egypt.”</p>
<p>11“Why me?”</p>
<p>12“I’ll be with you. This will be the sign that I’ve sent you: when you’ve brought them out, you’ll worship me at this mountain.” 	Ex 3:1-12</p>
<p>13Moses said, “So I’m going to the Israelites to say their ancestors’ God has sent me. What if they ask me what your name is? What will I tell them?”</p>
<p>14“I AM BECAUSE I AM. Tell them, ‘I AM sent me, 15Yahveh God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ That’s my name forever, the name all generations will remember me by. 16Get the elders in Israel together and tell them that Yahveh, your ancestors’ God, appeared to you and said, ‘I’m concerned about youpl and what they’re doing to you in Egypt. 17I’ll take you away from the sufferings to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 18They’ll listen.</p>
<p>“Go to the king of Egypt with the elders and say, ‘Yahveh God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day journey into the open country and sacrifice to him.’ 19He won’t let you go unless he’s forced to. 20I’ll strike Egypt with my miracles. Then he’ll let you go. 21I’ll make the Egyptians favorable to you so when you leave, you won’t leave empty-handed. 22Every woman needs to ask her neighbor and the woman that lives in her house, to give her silver and gold items, and articles of clothing. Put them on your sons and daughters. That’s how you’ll ‘plunder’ the Egyptians.” 	Ex 3:13-22</p>
<p>Signs for Moses</p>
<p>4:1Moses answered, “What if they don’t believe me, ‘Yahveh hasn’t really appeared to you!’?”</p>
<p>2“What’s in your hand?”</p>
<p>“A staff.”</p>
<p>3“Throw it on the ground.”</p>
<p>He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses jumped back.</p>
<p>4But Yahveh said, “Grab its tail.” He caught it, and it turned back into a staff in his hand. 5“They’ll believe that Yahveh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has appeared to you. 6Put your hand into your chest.” He did; when he took it out, it was leprous like snow. 7“Put it in again.” He did, and it became like the rest of him.</p>
<p>8“If the first sign doesn’t convince them, the second may. 9If neither one does, dip some water out of the Nile and pour it on dry ground. It’ll become blood.”	Ex 4:1-9</p>
<p>10Moses said, “Lord, I’ve never been good with words before, or lately since you’ve spoken to me. I stammer and stutter.”</p>
<p>11“Who made people’s tongues? Who makes people mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Isn’t it me, Yahveh? 12Go on; I’ll be with your mouth and tell you what to say.”</p>
<p>13“Lord, send the message by whoever else you want to.”</p>
<p>14Yahveh’s anger flared at Moses,</p>
<p>“Don’t you have a brother, Aaron the Levite? He speaks fluently. Besides, he’s coming out to meet you; he’ll be glad to see you. 15Give him my message. I’ll be with you and him and tell you what to do. 16He’ll speak to the people for you. He’ll be your mouth, and you’ll be like God to him. 17Take this staff and perform the signs with it.”							        Ex 4:10-17</p>
<p>Moses Returns to Egypt</p>
<p>18Moses went back to Jethro/Reuel and said, “Let me go so I can go to my relatives in Egypt and see if they’re still alive.”</p>
<p>“Have a safe trip.”</p>
<p>19Yahveh told Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt. The men that were trying to kill you are dead.”</p>
<p>20Moses put his wife and sons on a donkey and left with God’s staff.</p>
<p>21Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“When you get to Egypt, perform the wonders for Pharaoh that I’ve made you able to do, but I’ll harden his heart so he won’t let the people go. 22Then tell him that Yahveh says, ‘Israel is my son, my firstborn. 23I’ve told you to let him go so he can serve me,’ but you’ve refused. So I’ll kill your son, your firstborn.’”</p>
<p>24At a place where they stayed on the way, Yahveh met him and threatened to put him to death. 25Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet. She said, ‘You’re a bloody groom 26(because of the circumcision)!” So God let him alone.  	Ex 4:18-26</p>
<p>27Yahveh told Aaron, “Go meet Moses in the open country.” He met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. 28Moses told him what Yahveh had sent him to do. 29They gathered Israel’s elders, 30and Aaron told them everything Yahveh had told Moses. Moses performed the signs for the people, 31and they believed. When they heard Yahveh cared about them and had seen their adversity, they bowed low in worship.	            Ex 4:27-31</p>
<p>Moses and Aaron Speak to Pharaoh</p>
<p>5:1After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, “Yahveh, Israel’s God, says to let his people go so they can celebrate a festival to him in the open country.”</p>
<p>2Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahveh that I should obey him? I don’t know him. I’m not going to let them go.”</p>
<p>3They said,</p>
<p>“The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day’s journey into open country to sacrifice to Yahveh our God so he won’t fall on us with disease or sword.”</p>
<p>4The king said,</p>
<p>“Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to pull the people away from their work? Get back to work! 5Look at how many there are, and you want them to stop working!”</p>
<p>Making Bricks Without Straw</p>
<p>6That same day Pharaoh told the taskmasters and their foremen,</p>
<p>7“Don’t give them straw anymore to make bricks. They can gather their own straw! 8But don’t reduce their quota. They’re lazy, so they’re crying out, ‘Let us go sacrifice to our God.’ 9Give them more work so they won’t get false ideas in their heads.” 	Ex 5:1-9</p>
<p>10The taskmasters and their foremen went out to the people, “Pharaoh says he’s not going to give you straw anymore. 11Get your own wherever you can find it, but your quota will stay the same. 12The people scattered out across Egypt to gather stubble. 13The taskmasters pressed them, “Make your daily quota like when you had straw.” 14What’s more, Pharaoh’s taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen that they’d set over them, “Why haven’t you completed your required amount yesterday or today?”	         Ex 5:10-14</p>
<p>15The Israelite foremen came and appealed to Pharaoh, “Why are you treating us like this? 16We don’t have any straw, but they keep telling us to make bricks! They’re beating us, but it’s your own people’s fault.”</p>
<p>17“You’re lazy, very lazy. That’s why you want me to let you go sacrifice to Yahveh. 18Get to work. You won’t be given any straw, but you still have to make your quotas.”</p>
<p>19The foremen saw they were in trouble. 20When they left him, they met Moses and Aaron, waiting for them. 21They said, “Yahveh condemn you! You’ve made us offensive to Pharaoh and his officers! You’ve put a sword in their hand to kill us!”  	Ex 5:15-21</p>
<p>22Moses went back to Yahveh and said,</p>
<p>“Why hurt the people? Why send me? 23Since I spoke to Pharaoh in your name, he’s been hurting them more. You haven’t delivered them at all.”</p>
<p>Promise of Deliverance</p>
<p>6:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Now you’ll see what I’ll do to Pharaoh. He’ll have to let them go. I’ll make him send them out of his country. 2I’m Yahveh. 3I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as ‘God Almighty’ [El-Shaddai]. I didn’t make myself known to them by my name ‘Yahveh.’ 4I made a covenant with them to give them Canaan, where they were living as nomads. 5I’ve heard the Israelites’ groaning because the Egyptians are holding them in slavery, and I’ve remembered my covenant. 6Tell the Israelites, ‘I’ll take you out from under Egyptian bondage and redeem you with power and great acts of judgment. 7I’ll take you to be my people and be your God. You’ll know I’m Yahveh your God who brought you out from under the burdens the Egyptians put on you. 8I’ll take you to the land I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’”</p>
<p>9Moses told the people, but they wouldn’t listen. They were beat down by the cruel slavery.	Ex 5:22-6:9</p>
<p>10Yahveh said to Moses, 11“Go tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave his country.”</p>
<p>12But Moses said, “They haven’t listened to me. Why would Pharaoh listen to me? I’m not a good speaker.”</p>
<p>13Yahveh gave Moses and Aaron a charge for Pharaoh and the people of Israel about getting the Israelites out of Egypt. 	Ex 6:10-13</p>
<p>14The Heads of Families</p>
<p>The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi</p>
<p>15The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohab, Jachin, Zohar—and Shaul, the son</p>
<p>of a Canaanite woman</p>
<p>16The sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, Merari. Levi lived</p>
<p>137 years.</p>
<p>17The sons of Gershon: Libni, Shimei</p>
<p>18The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</p>
<p>19The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi</p>
<p>20Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed. She had Aaron and</p>
<p>Moses. Amram lived 137 years.</p>
<p>21The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri</p>
<p>22The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri</p>
<p>23Aaron married Elisheba Bat-Amminadab, sister</p>
<p>of Nahshon. She had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p>24The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph</p>
<p>25Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of</p>
<p>Putiel. She had Phinehas.</p>
<p>26It was the same Aaron and Moses that Yahveh told, “Take the</p>
<p>Israelites out of Egypt according to their armies.” 27They were the ones that spoke to Pharaoh about taking them out. 	Ex 6:14-27</p>
<p>28That day Yahveh told Moses, 29“I’m Yahveh. Tell Pharaoh everything I tell you.”</p>
<p>30But Moses said, “I’m not a good speaker. How will he listen to me?”</p>
<p>Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Snake</p>
<p>7:1Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“I’m making you like God to him, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 2Say what I tell you, and Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let Israel leave his country. 3But I’ll harden his heart so I can multiply my signs and wonders. 4When he won’t listen to you, I’ll lay my hand on Egypt and take out my people with tremendous acts of judgment. 5The Egyptians will know I’m Yahveh.”</p>
<p>6Moses and Aaron did what he said. 7Moses was 80 and Aaron was 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.	Ex 6:28-7:7</p>
<p>8Yahveh told Moses and Aaron, 9“When Pharaoh says to work a miracle, throw down your staff, and it’ll become a snake.” 10They went to Pharaoh. Aaron threw down his staff for him and his officers to see, and it became a snake. 11Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with magic. 12Each one threw down his staff, and it also turned into a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up theirs. 13Pharaoh’s heart was still hardened, and he wouldn’t listen.	     Ex 7:8-13</p>
<p>The Plague of Blood</p>
<p>14Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Pharaoh is stubborn and refuses to let the people go. 15In the morning, go meet him on the bank of the Nile. Take the staff that turned into a snake 16and say, ‘Yahveh God of the Hebrews sent me, “Let my people go to serve me in the open country,” but you’ve ignored me. 17This is how you’ll know I’m Yahveh: I’ll strike the water in the Nile with my staff, and it’ll turn to blood. 18The fish will die, and it’ll stink. The Egyptians won’t be able to drink it.”’”</p>
<p>19Then Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>“Have Aaron hold his staff out over the water in Egypt’s rivers, canals, pools, and reservoirs so it will turn to blood. There will be blood everywhere in Egypt, even in wood and stone containers.” 	Ex 7:14-19</p>
<p>20Moses and Aaron did that. He struck the water in the Nile with his staff for Pharaoh and his officers to see, and the water turned to blood. 21The fish in the Nile died, and it stunk. The Egyptians couldn’t drink it. There was blood everywhere in Egypt. 22But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p>23Pharaoh returned to his palace without concerning himself with that either. 24The Egyptians dug along the Nile for water because they couldn’t drink the water in it. 25A week went by.	Ex 7:20-25</p>
<p>The Plague of Frogs</p>
<p>8:1Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>“Go tell Pharaoh Yahveh says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you don’t, he’ll strike the whole country with frogs. 3The Nile will teem with them. They’ll come up into your house, your bedroom, your bed, your officials’ houses and on your people, in your ovens and kneading bowls. [4]’”</p>
<p>5Then Yahveh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to hold his staff out over the rivers, canals, and pools, and make frogs come up all over the ground.”  6Aaron held his hand out over the water, and frogs came up and covered the whole country. 7The magicians did the same thing with their magic, and made frogs come up on the ground everywhere in Egypt. 	 Ex 8:1-7</p>
<p>8Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, “Ask Yahveh to take the frogs away; I’ll let the people go sacrifice to him.”</p>
<p>9Moses asked, “When should I ask for the frogs to leave you and your houses, and be only in the Nile?”</p>
<p>10“Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“All right; so you can know there’s nobody like Yahveh our God, 11the frogs will leave everywhere except in the Nile.”</p>
<p>12Moses left Pharaoh and called out to Yahveh about the frogs. 13Yahveh did what he asked; the frogs died in the houses, courts, and fields. 14They piled them up and the country reeked. 15When Pharaoh saw relief, he hardened his heart and wouldn’t listen.   	Ex 8:8-15</p>
<p>The Plague of Gnats</p>
<p>16Yahveh told Moses, “Tell Aaron to strike the dust on the ground with his staff so it becomes gnats everywhere in Egypt.” 17He struck it, and it became gnats everywhere in Egypt. 18The magicians tried with their magic to bring gnats, but they couldn’t. There were gnats on people and animals. 19The magicians told Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh hardened his heart and wouldn’t listen.	        Ex 8:16-19</p>
<p>The Plague of Flies</p>
<p>20Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Get up early and present yourself to Pharaoh when he comes out to the water. Tell him Yahveh says to let his people go so they can serve him. 21If you don’t, he’ll send swarms of flies on you, your officers, your people, and in your houses. They’ll infest the Egyptians’ houses and cover the ground. 22But he won’t send them on Goshen, where his people live. You’ll know he’s in the land. 23He’ll distinguish his people from yours tomorrow.’”</p>
<p>24Yahveh did that. Huge swarms of insects were in Pharaoh’s palace and his officers’ houses. They covered the ground everywhere in Egypt. 25Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, “Go sacrifice to your God inside the country.” 	Ex 8:20-25</p>
<p>26But Moses said,</p>
<p>“That won’t work. We’d be sacrificing to Yahveh our God what’s detestable to Egyptians. Wouldn’t they stone us? 27We have to go a three-day’s journey into the open country and sacrifice to Yahveh like he said.”</p>
<p>28Pharaoh said, “I’ll let you go so you can sacrifice to Yahveh your God in the countryside. But you can’t go very far. Pray for me.”</p>
<p>29Moses said, “I’m leaving; I’ll pray to Yahveh that the swarms of insects will leave tomorrow. But you must not lie again and not let the people go sacrifice to himY.”</p>
<p>30Moses left and prayed to Yahveh, 31and he took the swarms away completely. 32But Pharaoh hardened his heart that time too and wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 8:26-32</p>
<p>The Plague on Livestock</p>
<p>9:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Go tell Pharaoh, ‘Yahveh God of the Hebrews says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you keep holding them, 3he’ll bring a severe plague on your livestock in the pasture—horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks. 4But he’ll distinguish Israel’s livestock from Egypt’s. Nothing will die that belongs to the Israelites.’”</p>
<p>5Yahveh set a time, “I’ll do that in the country tomorrow.” 6The next day he did it. Livestock in Egypt died, but none of the Israelites’ livestock died. 7Pharaoh sent to find out that not a one of the Israelites’ livestock died, but he hardened his heart and wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 9:1-7</p>
<p>The Plague of Boils</p>
<p>8Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>“Take handfuls of ashes out of a kiln and throw them up in the air in front of Pharaoh. 9They’ll become fine dust all over Egypt, and make boils break out with sores on people and animals everywhere in the country.”</p>
<p>10They took ashes out of a kiln and stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses threw them up in the air, and they made boils break out in sores on people and animals. 11The magicians couldn’t withstand Moses because of the boils. They came on the magicians as well as all the Egyptians. 12Yahveh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t listen.	Ex 9:8-12</p>
<p>13Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Get up early, present yourselves to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Yahveh God of the Hebrews says, “Let my people go so they can serve me. 14This time I’ll send my plagues on you, your officers, and your people so you can know there’s nobody on earth like me. 15If I’d struck you and your people with a deadly plague, you wouldn’t be here 16 to see my power and to make myself known all over the world. 17You still rise up against my people and won’t let them go. 18About this time tomorrow, I’ll send heavy hail beyond anything Egypt has ever had. 19Bring inside whatever livestock you have in the pasture. People and animals will die that are not inside.”’”</p>
<p>20Pharaoh’s officers that respected Yahveh made their servants and livestock get under shelter. 21Those who didn’t pay attention left them out in the open. 	Ex 9:13-21</p>
<p>22Yahveh told Moses, “Hold your hand toward the sky so hail will fall on the people, animals, and plants out in the open everywhere in Egypt.” 23He pointed his staff at the sky, and Yahveh sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the ground. 24There was really severe hail and lightning flashing continually in the hail, like nothing that had ever happened in Egypt since it became a nation. 25The hail struck everything that was out in the open everywhere in Egypt—people, animals, plants in the field, and shattered the trees. 26Only in Goshen, where the Israelites lived, there wasn’t any hail.       	Ex 9:22-26</p>
<p>27Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, “I’ve sinned this time. Yahveh is right; my people and I are wrong. 28Pray to him. We’ve had enough of his thunder and hail. I’ll let you go for good.”</p>
<p>29Moses told him,</p>
<p>“As soon as I leave the city, I’ll spread out my hands to Yahveh. The thunder and hail will stop, and you’ll know the world belongs to Yahveh. 30But I’m sure you and your officers still won’t respect him.”</p>
<p>31(The hail ruined the flax and barley crops because the barley had headed out and the flax had budded. 32It didn’t ruin the wheat and spelt, which ripen later.) 33Moses left Pharaoh and the city and spread out his hands to Yahveh. The thunder, hail, and rain quit pouring down. 34When Pharaoh saw it stop, he and his officers sinned again and hardened their hearts. 35He wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 9:27-35</p>
<p>The Plague of Locusts</p>
<p>10:1Then Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Go to Pharaoh; I’ve hardened his and his officers’ hearts so I can perform these signs among them 2and you can tell your sons and grandsons how I mocked the Egyptians with my signs, and so you can know I’m Yahveh.”</p>
<p>3Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of the Hebrews says, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself toward me? Let my people go so they can serve me. 4If you don’t, I’ll bring locusts to your realm tomorrow. 5They’ll cover the ground so thick you can’t see it. They’ll eat what the hail didn’t ruin, every tree that sprouts in your field. 6Your houses, your officers’ houses, every Egyptian’s house will be full of them—something your fathers and grandfathers have never seen.’”</p>
<p>He turned and left. 7Pharaoh’s officials said, “How long will that man hold us hostage? Let the men go so they can serve Yahveh their God. Can’t you see that Egypt’s destroyed?”</p>
<p>8Pharaoh brought Moses and Aaron back, “Go serve Yahveh your God! Who are going?”</p>
<p>9Moses said, “We’ll all go with our flocks and herds to hold a festival to Yahveh.”</p>
<p>10-11Pharaoh said, “Oh, no! Yahveh help you if I ever let you and your little ones go! Don’t tempt me; you have ulterior motives. The men among you can go serve Yahveh. That’s what you’ve been asking for.”</p>
<p>Pharaoh drove them out. 	Ex 10:1-11</p>
<p>12Then Yahveh told Moses, “Hold your hand out over Egypt; locusts will come up on the land and eat the plants the hail left.” 13He held his staff out over Egypt, and Yahveh made an east wind blow all that day and night. In the morning, it brought the locusts, 14and they landed everywhere. There had never been so many, and there never would be again. 15They covered the ground till it was black. They ate every plant and fruit tree the hail had left. There wasn’t anything green on the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt.</p>
<p>16Pharaoh hurried and called for Moses and Aaron, “I’ve sinned against you and Yahveh your God. 17Forgive me just this once and pray to him to remove this death from me.”</p>
<p>18Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Yahveh. 19He shifted the wind to a strong west wind that blew the locusts into the Red Sea. Not a one was left in Egypt. 20But Yahveh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let the people go. 	Ex 10:12-20</p>
<p>The Plague of Darkness</p>
<p>21Then he told Moses, “Lift your hand toward the sky; it’ll be so dark you can feel it.” 22Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and a dense darkness covered Egypt for three days. 23People couldn’t see each other, it was so dark. Nobody got up from where they were for three days, but the Israelites had light in their houses.</p>
<p>24Pharaoh called to Moses, “Go serve Yahveh. Just leave your flocks and herds here. Even your little ones can go with you.”</p>
<p>25But Moses said,</p>
<p>“You need to let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to Yahveh our God.  26Our livestock has to go with us. Not a hoof will stay here. We’ll take some of them to serve Yahveh. We don’t know what we’ll serve him with till we get there.”</p>
<p>27But Yahveh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go. 28He told Moses, “Get out of here! I’m warning you, don’t ever see me again. The day you do you’ll die!”</p>
<p>29“You’re right. I’ll never see you again.”	Ex 10:21-29</p>
<p>Plague on the Firstborn</p>
<p>11:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“I’m going to bring one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he’ll let you go. When he does, he’ll drive you out completely. 2Tell each man and woman to ask their neighbors for silver and gold articles.”</p>
<p>3Yahveh gave the Egyptians a favorable attitude toward the people. Furthermore, Pharaoh’s officers and the people in general respected Moses a lot.  	Ex 11:1-3</p>
<p>4Moses said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh says, ‘About midnight I’ll go out into Egypt, 5and all firstborn will die—the firstborn of Pharaoh on his throne, the firstborn of the slave girl behind the millstones, the firstborn among the livestock. 6There’ll be such an outcry everywhere in Egypt as has never been heard or will be. 7But among the Israelites, not even a dog will bark at people or animals. You’llsg see how Yahveh distinguishes Israel from Egypt.</p>
<p>8‘Yoursg officials will come and bow to me and say, “Leave, you and your people.” Then I’ll leave.’”</p>
<p>He left Pharaoh really mad.</p>
<p>9Yahveh told Moses, “Pharaoh won’t listen; so I’ll multiply my wonders in Egypt.” 10Moses and Aaron performed those wonders for him, but Yahveh hardened his heart, and he wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 11:4-10</p>
<p>The Passover Instituted</p>
<p>12:1Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>2“This month will be the first month of your year. 3Tell the assembly of Israel that on the tenth of this month, each family is to take a lamb according to their families. 4If a family is too small for a lamb, that family and a nearby neighbor can take a lamb the size the number of people can eat. 5It needs to be an unblemished male a year old. Take it from the sheep or goats. 6Keep it till the fourteenth of the month.</p>
<p>“The whole community is to kill it in the evening. 7Put some of its blood on the doorposts and lintel of the house where you eat it. 8Eat the meat that same night, roasted with fire. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 9Don’t eat any of it raw or boiled. Roast the head, legs, and entrails. 10In the morning, burn what’s left over. 11Eat I in a hurry, dressed, with sandals on your feet and staff in hand. It’s Yahveh’s Passover. 12I’ll go all over Egypt that night and strike down the firstborn people and animals. I’ll execute judgment on Egypt’s gods. I’m Yahveh. 13The blood on your houses will be a sign. When I see it, I’ll ‘pass over’ you. No plague will fall on you when I strike Egypt.  	Ex 12:1-13</p>
<p>14“Today will serve as a memorial day for you. Celebrate it as a festival to Yahveh, a permanent ordinance. 15Eat bread without yeast for a week. On the first day, take the yeast out of your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day till the seventh will be excluded from Israel. 16On the first day, hold a holy assembly. On the seventh day, hold another one. Don’t work on those days except what has to be eaten by each person that only you can fix. 17Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread throughout your generations; that’s the day I brought your hosts out of Egypt. 18In the first month, eat bread without yeast from the fourteenth in the evening till the twenty-first in the evening. 19For a week, no yeast can be in your houses. Whoever eats what has yeast in it will be excluded from the community of Israel, foreign or native. 20Eat bread without yeast in all your houses.”         	Ex 12:14-20</p>
<p>21Moses called Israel’s elders,</p>
<p>“Butcher a Passover lamb for each family. 22Dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that’s in the basin and apply it to the lintel and doorposts. Don’t anyone go outside till morning. 23Yahveh will pass through to strike down the Egyptians. When he sees the blood on the lintel and doorposts, he’ll pass over and not let the destroyer come in to strike you. [24] 25When you go into the land Yahveh gives you, observe this rite. 26When your children ask you what it means, 27tell them it’s a Passover sacrifice to Yahveh, who “passed over” the Israelites’ houses when he struck the Egyptians.”</p>
<p>The people bowed low in worship 28and did what Yahveh commanded Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>Ex 12:21-28</p>
<p>29At midnight Yahveh struck the firstborn in Egypt—the firstborn of Pharaoh on the throne, the firstborn of captives in the dungeon, the firstborn livestock. 30Pharaoh, his officers, and all the Egyptians got up during the night. There was a great outcry in Egypt; every home had someone die.</p>
<p>The Exodus</p>
<p>31He called for Moses and Aaron during the night,</p>
<p>“Get up! Get away from my people, you and the Israelites! Go worship Yahveh like you’ve said. 32Take your flocks and herds. Go and bless me too.”</p>
<p>33The Egyptians urged the people to leave right away, “We’ll all be dead!”</p>
<p>34The people took their dough before it had yeast put in it, together with their kneading bowls tied up in the cloaks on their shoulders. 35The Israelites had done what Moses said and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold articles, and for clothes. 36Yahveh had given the Egyptians a favorable attitude toward them, so they let them have what they asked for. That’s how they “plundered” the Egyptians.	Ex 12:29-36</p>
<p>37The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot plus women and children. 38A mixed crowd of non-Israelites went with them along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. 39The dough they brought out of Egypt they baked into flat cakes of bread without yeast. It had no yeast in it because they were driven out and couldn’t delay. They hadn’t prepared supplies.</p>
<p>40The Israelites lived in Egypt 430 years. 41At the end of 430 years to the day, the hosts of Yahveh left Egypt. 42It’s a night Israelites observe to him throughout their generations for bringing them out of Egypt.	Ex 12:37-42</p>
<p>Instructions for Passover</p>
<p>43Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>“This is the ordinance about the Passover: no foreigner can eat it, 44but every man’s slave purchased with money can eat it after you’ve circumcised him. 45No hired hand can eat it. 46Eat it in a single house. Don’t take any of the meat out of the house or break any of its bones. 47The whole community of Israel is to celebrate it. 48If a foreigner that lives with you wants to celebrate it, all the males that belong to him need to be circumcised. Then he can come to celebrate it. He’ll become a citizen of the country, but no uncircumcised person can eat it. 49The same law applies to a native and foreigner among you.”</p>
<p>50The Israelites did what Yahveh commanded Moses and Aaron. 51That same day, he brought them out of Egypt.	 Ex 12:43-51</p>
<p>Dedication of the Firstborn</p>
<p>13:1Yahveh told Moses, 2“Set aside to me every firstborn human and animal.”</p>
<p>3Moses told the people,</p>
<p>“Think back to today when you came out of slavery in Egypt. With a strong hand Yahveh took you out of here. Don’t eat anything with yeast in it. 4Today in the month Abib, you’re about to leave. 5When Yahveh takes you to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Hivite, and Jebusite—the land he swore to your ancestors he’d give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—observe this rite in this month. 6Eat bread without yeast for a week. The seventh day, observe a feast to Yahveh. 7Don’t have anything containing yeast among you or in your territory. 8Tell your son that day, ‘It’s because of what Yahveh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9It will serve as a sign to you on your hand, a reminder on your forehead, that the Law of Yahveh may be in your mouth, because he brought you out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 10Keep this ordinance every year at its scheduled time.   	Ex 13:1-10</p>
<p>11“When Yahveh takes you to the territory of the Canaanites, 12devote to him every woman’s male firstborn and the first male firstborn of every animal you own. They belong to himY. 13But use a lamb to redeem every firstborn donkey. If you don’t redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn son.</p>
<p>14“When your son asks what this means, tell him, ‘With a great demonstration of power, Yahveh brought us out of slavery in Egypt. 15When Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, Yahveh killed every firstborn male of people and animals in Egypt; so I sacrifice the firstborn males to Yahveh, but I redeem every firstborn son.’ 16It will serve as a reminder on your hand and bands on your forehead that Yahveh brought you out of Egypt with a tremendous demonstration of power.”	      Ex 13:11-16</p>
<p>Crossing the Sea</p>
<p>17When Pharaoh did let the people go, God didn’t lead them on the road toward the Philistines, even though it was closer. He said, “They may change their minds when they see war, and head back to Egypt.” 18He led them through open country to the Red Sea, and they went up in martial array from Egypt. 19Moses took Joseph’s bones with him because he’d made the Israelites solemnly swear, “It’s certain that God will take care of you, so carry my bones with you when you leave.” 20They set out from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of open country. 21Yahveh went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud during the day, and in a pillar of fire at night to give them light. So they could travel day or night. 22He never took away the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire.	Ex 13:17-22</p>
<p>14:1Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>2“Tell the Israelites to turn around and camp at Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the sea across from Baal-zephon. 3Pharaoh will say you’re wandering aimlessly; the open country has boxed you in. 4That’s how I’ll harden his heart, and he’ll chase you. He and his army will honor me, and the Egyptians will know I’m Yahveh.”</p>
<p>That’s what they did.</p>
<p>5When the king found out they’d left, he and his officials changed their minds, “What have we done, letting them leave from serving us?” 6He got his chariot ready and took his troops: 7600 select chariots as well as all the rest of Egypt’s chariots and their officers. 8As the Israelites were leaving boldly, 9the Egyptians chased them with Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, cavalry, and troops. They caught up with them camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth across from Baal-zephon.   	Ex 14:1-9</p>
<p>10As Pharaoh got close, the Israelites saw the Egyptians marching after them. They panicked and cried out to Yahveh. 11They asked Moses,</p>
<p>“Was it because there weren’t any graves in Egypt that you’ve brought us out to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt? 12Didn’t we tell you to just let us serve the Egyptians? It would’ve been better to serve them than die in the desert.”</p>
<p>13But Moses told them,</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid! Stand by and watch Yahveh deliver you. The Egyptians you see today you’ll never see again. 14He’ll fight for you while you just watch.”</p>
<p>Ex 14:10-14</p>
<p>15Then Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Why call out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. 16Lift up your staff and hold your hand out over the sea to separate it. The Israelites will go through it on dry seabed. 17I’ll harden the Egyptians’ hearts so they’ll go in after you; Pharaoh, his army, chariots, and cavalry. 18The Egyptians will know I’m Yahveh when Pharaoh, his chariots, and cavalry honor me.”</p>
<p>19God’s angel that had been going ahead of Israel, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front to in back. 20The cloud and the darkness stood between the camps of Egypt and Israel; yet it gave light at night so they wouldn’t come close to each other all night.</p>
<p>Ex 14:15-20</p>
<p>21Then Moses held his hand out over the sea, and Yahveh pushed it back with a strong east wind all night. He separated the water and dried up the seabed. 22The Israelites went through the sea on dry seabed with the water like a wall on their left and right. 23Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went in after them. 24Just before dawn, Yahveh looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud and threw them into confusion. 25He made their chariot wheels wobble so they were hard to drive. The Egyptians shouted, “Retreat! Yahveh’s fighting for Israel!”           	      		       			       	       Ex 14:21-25</p>
<p>26Yahveh told Moses, “Hold your hand out over the sea so the water will wash back over the Egyptians, their chariots, and cavalry.” 27The sea washed back to its normal position at daybreak while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it. He overthrew them in the sea. 28The water washed back over the chariots and cavalry. Not a one in Pharaoh’s entire army remained who followed the Israelites into the sea. [29] 30Israel saw them dead on the shore. 31When they saw the great power Yahveh had used against the Egyptians, they feared him and trusted him and Moses.   	Ex 14:26-31</p>
<p>Moses’ Song of Triumph</p>
<p>15:1Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Yahveh:</p>
<p>“I’ll sing to Yahveh because he’s triumphed gloriously;</p>
<p>he’s thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.</p>
<p>2Yahveh is my strength and song;</p>
<p>he is my salvation.</p>
<p>He’s my God, and I’ll praise him,</p>
<p>my ancestors’ God, and I’ll honor him.</p>
<p>3He’s a soldier;</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh.</p>
<p>4He has thrown Pharaoh’s chariots and army into the Red Sea;</p>
<p>his elite officers have drowned.</p>
<p>5The depths covered them;</p>
<p>they sank like rocks.</p>
<p>6Your right hand, Yahveh, was majestic in its power;</p>
<p>it shattered the enemy.</p>
<p>7In your extreme excellence, you overthrew your opponents.</p>
<p>You sent out your burning anger</p>
<p>that consumed them like chaff.</p>
<p>8At the blast of your nostrils, the water piled up;</p>
<p>liquid water stood in a heap;</p>
<p>the depths of the sea congealed.</p>
<p>9The enemy said, ‘I’ll pursue,</p>
<p>I’ll overtake, I’ll divide up spoil;</p>
<p>I’ll satisfy my desire against them;</p>
<p>I’ll draw out my sword and destroy them.’</p>
<p>10You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;</p>
<p>they sank like lead in deep water.</p>
<p>11Who is like you, majestic in holiness,</p>
<p>awesome in praises, working wonders?</p>
<p>12You reached out your hand,</p>
<p>and the earth swallowed them.</p>
<p>13In your kindness you led the people you redeemed;</p>
<p>in your strength you guided them to your sacred abode.</p>
<p>14The nations have heard and tremble;</p>
<p>anguish has gripped the people in Philistia.</p>
<p>15The chiefs in Edom are scared;</p>
<p>the leaders in Moab tremble;</p>
<p>the people in Canaan melt away.</p>
<p>16Panic and dread have fallen on them;</p>
<p>by your great power they’re as still as stone,</p>
<p>until your people pass over,</p>
<p>until the people pass over that you’ve bought.</p>
<p>17You’ll take them and plant them in the mountain</p>
<p>in your permanent possession,</p>
<p>where you’ve made yourself a place to live.</p>
<p>18Yahveh will reign forever.”	  		                    Ex 15:1-18</p>
<p>19Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, and Yahveh washed the water back over them; but the Israelites walked through on dry seabed. 20Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine and went out with the women with tambourines and dancing.</p>
<p>21She lined out a song to them,</p>
<p>“Sing to Yahveh because he has triumphed gloriously;</p>
<p>he threw the horse and its rider into the sea.”	Ex 15:19-21</p>
<p>22Moses led the Israelites from the Red Sea to the Wilderness of Shur. They traveled three days without finding water. 23When they got to Marah, the water was too “brackish” to drink. That’s why it was called Marah. 24The people complained to Moses, “What are we going to drink?” 25He called out to Yahveh, and he showed him a tree. Moses threw it in the water and made it drinkable. Yahveh made a statute and regulation to test them.</p>
<p>26“If you sincerely pay attention to me, do what I consider right, listen to my commandments, and keep my statutes, I won’t put any disease on you that I put on the Egyptians, because I’m your healer.”</p>
<p>27They came to Elim with its 12 springs and 70 date palms, and camped there beside the water.											       Ex 15:22-27</p>
<p>Manna and Quail</p>
<p>16:1The fifteenth day, second month after they left Egypt, they went from Elim to the Wilderness of Sin, between Elim and Sinai, 2They criticized Moses and Aaron in the desert, 3“If only Yahveh had killed us in Egypt when we sat by pots of meat and ate bread till we were full. You’ve brought us out to this empty place to starve to death.” 	Ex 16:1-3</p>
<p>4Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“I’ll rain bread from the sky, and they can go out each day and pick up a day’s supply. That will test whether they’ll follow my law: 5On the sixth day, they’ll prepare twice as much as on other days.”</p>
<p>6Moses and Aaron told them,</p>
<p>“In the evening you’ll know Yahveh brought you out of Egypt. 7In the morning you’ll see his glory. He hears you complaining about him. Why are you complaining to us? 8Yahveh will give you bread in the morning and meat in the evening. You’re complaining to him more than to us.”</p>
<p>9Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community to come into Yahveh’s presence; he’s heard their complaining.” 10As Aaron spoke to them, they looked toward the open country, and the glory of Yahveh appeared in the cloud. 11He told Moses, 12“I’ve heard them complaining. Tell them they’ll eat their fill of bread in the morning and meat in the evening. They’ll know I’m Yahveh their God.” 	Ex 16:4-12</p>
<p>13That evening quail came and covered the camp. In the morning, there was a coating of dew around the camp. 14When it evaporated, a fine flakey residue like frost lay all over the countryside. 15When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another what it was.</p>
<p>Moses told them,</p>
<p>“It’s the bread Yahveh has given you to eat. 16He has commanded each person to gather as much as he’ll eat, .11 bushel 1 omer for each one in his tent.”</p>
<p>17Some gathered a lot, some a little. 18When they measured it with .11 bushel 1 omer, the ones that had gathered a lot didn’t have any left over. The ones that had gathered little had enough. Everybody gathered enough to eat. 19Moses told them not to leave any of it till morning. 20But some did, and it bred maggots and spoiled. Moses was mad at them. 21They gathered it each morning. When the sun got hot, it evaporated. 	Ex 16:13-21</p>
<p>22On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much, .22 bushel 2 omers apiece. When the leaders of the community came and told Moses, 23he said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh said, ‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath observance, a holy Sabbath to meY. Bake what you’ll bake and boil what you’ll boil. What’s left over set aside till morning.’”</p>
<p>24They did that, and it didn’t spoil or breed maggots.</p>
<p>25Moses said, “Eat it today; it’s a Sabbath to Yahveh. 26Gather it six days. There won’t be any the seventh day.”</p>
<p>27Some people did go out anyway, but they didn’t find any.</p>
<p>28“How long will you refuse to follow my instructions? 29Yahveh gave you the Sabbath; he’ll provide bread for two days on the sixth day. Stay home the seventh day.”</p>
<p>30The people rested that day. 		Ex 16:22-30</p>
<p>31Israel called it manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like honey-flavored wafers. 32-33Moses told Aaron,</p>
<p>“Yahveh has said to keep .11 bushel 1 omer of it in a jar for later generations to see what I fed you in the desert.  Set it in front of Yahveh.”</p>
<p>34Aaron put it in front of the Testimony. 35The Israelites ate it for 40 years, till they came to the border of Canaan, where people lived. (36An omer is .11 bushels .1 ephah.)       	   Ex 16:31-36</p>
<p>Water from the Rock</p>
<p>17:1Then Yahveh told the community to travel from the Wilderness of Sin and camp at Rephidim. They didn’t have any water and 2complained to Moses, “Give us some water.”</p>
<p>“Why are you complaining to me and testing Yahveh?”</p>
<p>3But they were thirsty, “Why bring us up from Egypt to let us, our little ones, and our livestock die from thirst?”</p>
<p>4Moses called out to Yahveh, “What am I going to do with them? They’re about ready to stone me.”</p>
<p>5“Go stand in front of them. Take some of the elders and the staff you used to strike the Nile. 6I’ll stand in front of you on the rock at Horeb/Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for them to drink.”</p>
<p>Moses did that. 7He named the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites “quarreled” with him and put Yahveh on trial, “Is Yahveh among us or not?”	 Ex 17:1-7</p>
<p>Defeating the Amalekites</p>
<p>8Amalek came to attack Israel at Rephidim, 9so Moses told Joshua, “Choose men and go fight Amalek. Tomorrow, I’ll station myself on the hill with God’s staff in my hand.” 10Joshua did that; Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; when he let it come down, Amalek prevailed. 12But his hands got heavy; so they put a boulder under him to sit on; Aaron and Hur supported his hands. His hands were steady till sundown. 13Joshua outfought Amalek and his people with the sword.</p>
<p>14Then Yahveh told Moses, “Write this in a scroll to remember. Tell Joshua I’ll completely wipe out the memory of Amalek.” 15Moses built an altar and named it Yahveh Is My Banner [Yahveh -nissi]. 16He said, “Yahveh has sworn he’ll be at war with Amalek endlessly.”</p>
<p>Ex 17:8-16</p>
<p>Jethro Visits Moses</p>
<p>18:1Jethro/Reuel, priest in Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard what all God had done for Moses and his people in bringing them out of Egypt. 2He’d taken Moses’ wife Zipporah after Moses sent her away 3with her two sons Gershom (because he said, “I’ve been a ‘foreigner’ in a foreign land”) 4and Eliezer (because he said, “My father’s ‘God helped’ me, and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword”). 5-6Jethro/Reuel came to Moses with his wife and two sons, where Moses camped at the mountain of God. 6He sent word that he was bringing them. 7Moses went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. 8Moses told him what all Yahveh had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, the hardships they’d had on the journey, and how Yahveh had delivered them. 9Jethro/Reuel was overjoyed at Yahveh’s goodness to Israel. 10He said,</p>
<p>“Bless Yahveh that delivered you from Pharaoh and the Egyptians’ control. 11Now I know heY is greater than all other gods. He proved it when they dealt arrogantly against the people.”</p>
<p>12Jethro/Reuel brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with the elders to eat a meal with him in God’s presence.	 Ex 18:1-12</p>
<p>13The next day Moses sat judging the people. They stood around him from morning till evening. 14When Jethro/Reuel saw what he was doing, he asked,</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why sit to judge so many people by yourself from morning to evening?”</p>
<p>15“They come to me to ask God. 16When they have a dispute, I decide between them, and teach them God’s laws and statues.”</p>
<p>17“That’s not good. 18You and the people will both wear out. Your job’s too big. 19Here’ssome advice, and God be with you. Be the people’s representative to God and bring the disputes to him. 20Then teach them the laws and statutes, how they’re supposed to act and what they’re supposed to do. 21Select capable men that respect God, truthful men that hate dishonest gain. Make them leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 22Let them judge lesser matters. They can bring major disputes to you. It’ll be easier on you; they’ll help you bear the burden. 23If you do that—and God agrees—you’ll hold up under the work, and the people will go home satisfied.”</p>
<p>24Moses took his advice 25and chose capable men to lead thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 26They judged on a regular basis and dealt with smaller issues. More difficult disputes they took to Moses. 27Moses said goodbye to Jethro/Reuel, and he went back home.	Ex 18:13-27</p>
<p>At Mount Sinai</p>
<p>19:1The same day of the third month after Israel left Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. 2They’d set out from Rephidim and came to camp at the mountain. 3Moses went up to God, and Yahveh called to him from the mountain,</p>
<p>“Tell Jacob’s house, 4‘You’vepl seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me. 5If you’ll obey me and keep my covenant, you’ll be my special possession among the nations. The whole world belongs to, 6but you’ll be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.’”	          Ex 19:1-6</p>
<p>7Moses called the elders and told them. 8They answered together, “We’ll do everything Yahveh said.” Moses went back to tell him.</p>
<p>9He told Moses, “I’ll come to you in a dark cloud so the people can hear when I speak to you and believe in you permanently.</p>
<p>10“Go consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 11and be ready on the third day. That day I’ll come down on Mount Sinai where they can see. 12Set upf boundaries and say, ‘Don’t go up on the mountain or touch it. Executef whoever touches it. 13Don’t touchf them; stonef them or shootf them. Human or animal won’t live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, the people are to come to the mountain.”</p>
<p>14Moses came down from the mountain, consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 15He told them to be ready the third day and not to have relations with women. 	Ex 19:7-15</p>
<p>16The third morning, thunder and lightning came. A dark cloud came over the mountain, accompanied by a loud bugle blast. The people in the camp trembled. 17Moses brought them out of the camp to meet God at the foot of the mountain. 18Smoke covered Mount Sinai because Yahveh came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. 19When the bugle blast got louder and louder, Moses spoke to God, and he answered him with thunder. 20He came down on Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the top of it.</p>
<p>21“Go down and warn the people not to break through to stare and many of them perish. 22Have the priests that come near to meY consecrate themselves so I don’t flare out against them.”</p>
<p>23Moses told Yahveh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, because you warned us to set boundaries around it and consecrate it.”</p>
<p>24Yahveh said, “Go down and bring Aaron up. Don’t let the priests or the people break through to come up to meY, or I’ll flare out against them.”</p>
<p>25Moses went down and told them.	       Ex 19:16-25</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments</p>
<p>20:1Then God spoke,</p>
<p>2I am Yahveh your God who brought you out of slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>3Do not havef any god but me.</p>
<p>4Do not makef any carved image, any likeness of what is in the sky, on the ground, or in the water 5to worship or serve. IY am an exclusive God. I visit the consequences of parents’ sins on their descendants for three or four generations that hate me. 6I am kind to thousands who love me and obey me.	 Ex 20:1-6</p>
<p>7Do not usef my name Yahveh as a byword. I will punish whoever does that.</p>
<p>8Remember to set the Sabbath day aside. 9Workf six days, 10but on the seventh day rest to me, Yahveh your God. Do not workf that day—you, your son or daughter, male or female servant, livestock, or foreigner living among you. 11In six days IY made earth and sky, the ocean and everything in them, and rested the seventh day. I have blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.</p>
<p>12Honor your parents so you will live a long time in the land I give you.</p>
<p>13Do not commit commit murderf.</p>
<p>14Do not commit adulteryf.</p>
<p>15Do not stealf.</p>
<p>16Do not lief about other people.</p>
<p>17Do not covetf someone else’s house, his wife, male or female servant, ox</p>
<p>or donkey—anything that is his.”	 Ex 20:7-17</p>
<p>18When people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the bugle sound and smoking mountain, they trembled and stood back a long way. 19They told Moses, “You speak to us, and we’ll listen. Don’t have God speak to us—so we won’t die.” 20Moses told them, “Don’t be afraid. God has come to test you, to make you respect him and not sin.” 21They stood a long way off while Moses approached the dark cloud where God was.	 Ex 20:18-21</p>
<p>The Proper Use of Altars</p>
<p>22Yahveh told him to tell Israel,</p>
<p>“You’ve seen that I’ve spoken to you from the sky. 23Don’t makef other gods, silver or gold. 24Makef an altar out of dirt for me for sacrificing your burnt offerings, peace offerings, sheep and cattle. Everywhere I make my name remembered, I’ll come to you and bless you. 25If you build a stone altar for me, don’t buildf it with cut stones. You’ll desecrate it if you use a tool on it. 26Don’t climbf steps to my altar so you won’t show your nakedness on it. 	Ex 20:22-26</p>
<p>Laws About Slaves</p>
<p>21:1“Present these ordinances to the people.</p>
<p>2“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he’ll serve six years and go free on the seventh without pay. 3If he came alone, he’ll go out alone. If he has a wife, they’ll go out together. 4If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and the slave will go out alone. 5But if the slave says he loves his master, his wife and children, and won’t leave them to be a free man, 6his master is to take him to the judges—to the door or doorpost—and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he’ll serve him permanently. 	          Ex 21:1-6</p>
<p>7“If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she’s not to go free as the male slaves do. 8If she’s not pleasing to her master who designated her for himself, he is to let her be bought back. He can’t sell her to a foreigner; he’d be treating her unfairly. 10If he marries another woman, he can’t reduce her food, clothing, or conjugal rights. 11If he won’t do these things for her, she’ll go out without being paid for. 9If he designates her for his son, he is to treat her like a daughter. 	Ex 21:7-11</p>
<p>Cases About Personal Injury</p>
<p>12“Execute anyone that assaults and kills someone. 13If it was an accident, I’ll designate a safe place the slayer can flee to. 14But take even from the horns of my altar anyone that does premeditated murder.</p>
<p>15“Executef anybody that hits his father or mother.</p>
<p>16“Executef kidnappers whether they hold in possession or sell the one they kidnapped.</p>
<p>17“Executef anybody that cusses at father or mother.	 Ex 21:12-17</p>
<p>18“If men are fighting and one strikes the other with a stone or his fist and he doesn’t die, but is laid up, 19if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then don’t punishf the one that hit him. He’ll pay for the man’s loss of time and take care of him till he fully recovers.</p>
<p>20“If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies, punish him. 21If the slave survives a day or so, there’s no punishment; he’s his property.</p>
<p>22“If men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she miscarries without further injury, fine him as her husband requires and the judges determine. 23But if there’s further harm, punishf life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.	Ex 21:18-25</p>
<p>26“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he’ll free the slave for the eye. 27If he knocks out his male or female slave’s tooth, he’ll free the slave for the tooth.</p>
<p>28“If an ox gores a man or woman to death, stone it, don’t eat it, and don’t punish the owner. 29But if it has gored before and its owner knew it and didn’t pen it up, if it kills somebody, stone the ox and execute the owner. 30If a ransom is demanded from him, he’ll give whatever the relatives demand for loss of life. 31If it gores a son or daughter, the same rule applies. 32If it gores a male or female slave, the owner has to give the slave’s master 12 oz 30 shekels of silver. Stone the ox. Ex 21:26-32</p>
<p>33“If someone digs a pit without covering it up and an ox or donkey falls in it, 34the pit’s owner has to pay the animal’s owner for the loss, and the dead animal becomes his.</p>
<p>35“If one man’s ox kills another man’s ox, sell the live ox, divide the sale price, and divide the dead ox between them. 36If it was previously known to gore and its owner didn’t pen it up, he’ll pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.</p>
<p>Ex 21:33-36</p>
<p>Protection of Property</p>
<p>22:1“If someone steals a cow or sheep, slaughters it or sells it, he has to pay five cows for one cow and four sheep for one sheep. 3bIf he doesn’t have anything, sell the thief for the theft. 4If what was stolen is found alive in the thief’s possession—cow, donkey, or sheep—the thief will pay double.</p>
<p>2If a thief gets caught breaking in at night and is struck and dies, the slayer won’t be held guilty of murder.  3aIf the theft happens during the day, the slayer will be guilty of murder.</p>
<p>5“If you overgraze a field or vineyard and let an animal loose that grazes in someone else’s field, you’ll pay compensation from the best of your own field and vineyard.</p>
<p>6“If your fire gets away from you and spreads to someone else’s thorn bushes, stacked grain, standing grain, or field, you’ll pay for damages.	      Ex 22:1-6</p>
<p>7“If you give someone money or goods for safekeeping, and it’s stolen from that person’s house, if caught, the thief will pay double. 8If no thief is caught, the judges will investigate to see if the other person took it.</p>
<p>9“For any breach of trust—for ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or anything else a person owns—both parties will go to the judges. The one the judges find guilty will pay double to the other.</p>
<p>10“If you give someone a donkey, cow, sheep, or other animal for safekeeping and it dies, gets hurt, or wanders off unnoticed, 11the two of you will swear in Yahveh’s presence that neither has taken it. You’ll accept the judges’ verdict, no compensation required. 12But if it was stolen, the thief will pay its owner for it. 13If wild animals got it, the remains are evidence, no compensation required.								          Ex 22:7-13</p>
<p>14“If you borrow something that gets injured or dies while its owner’s absent, you’ll make full restitution. 15If its owner’s present, you won’t make compensation. If you rented it, it came for the rent.</p>
<p>Laws About Social Justice</p>
<p>16“If a man seduces a virgin that’s not engaged and lies with her, he has to pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 17If her father refuses to give her to him, he’ll still pay money equal to the dowry for virgins.</p>
<p>18“Don’t let a sorceress live.</p>
<p>19“Execute whoever has sexual relations with an animal.</p>
<p>20“Execute whoever sacrifices to any god but Yahveh.</p>
<p>21“Don’t wrong or mistreat a foreigner; you were foreigners in Egypt.</p>
<p>Ex 22:14-21</p>
<p>22“Don’t abuse a widow or orphan in any way. 23If you do and the person cries out to me, 24my anger will flare. I’ll kill you with the sword and make yoursg wives widows and your children orphans.</p>
<p>25“If you lend money to the poor among my people, don’t charge interest. 26If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, give it back before sundown. 27That may be the only covering your neighbor has to sleep in. When your neighbor cries out to me, I’ll listen, because I’m gracious.</p>
<p>28“Don’t curse God or a ruler of your people.		      		29“Don’t put off giving your offerings from your crops or vintage.</p>
<p>“Give me your firstborn sons. 30Do the same thing with your cattle and sheep. After it’s with its mother for a week, give it to me on the eighth day.</p>
<p>31“You’ll be holy people to me. So don’t eat any animal that’s torn to pieces in the pasture by wild animals. Feed it to the dogs.	 Ex 22:22-31</p>
<p>23:1“Don’t pass on false rumors, join sinners in giving malicious testimony, 2or follow the crowd in doing something bad. In a dispute, don’t join other people to pervert justice. 3Don’t be partial toward a poor person in a dispute.</p>
<p>4“If you run onto your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering around, return it. 5If you see a donkey that belongs to someone that hates you lying helpless under its load, free it.	   Ex 23:1-5</p>
<p>6“Don’t pervert justice for your needy neighbor in a dispute.</p>
<p>7“Avoid making false charges. Don’t execute an innocent or good person. I won’t acquit you.</p>
<p>8“Don’t take a bribe; it blinds the clear-sighted and undercuts what good people are trying to do.</p>
<p>9“Don’t oppress a foreigner; you know what it’s like to be one; you were foreigners in Egypt.</p>
<p>Laws About Sabbaths and Festivals</p>
<p>10“Plant and harvest your ground for six years. 11Let it lie fallow the seventh year so the needy among your people can eat what grows volunteer. Whatever they leave, the wild animals can have. Do the same thing with your vineyard and olive trees.</p>
<p>12“Work six days. On the seventh, stop working so your ox and donkey can rest, so the son of your female slave and the foreigner that’s with you can refresh themselves. 13Pay attention to everything I’ve told you.</p>
<p>“Don’t even say the names of other gods.	 Ex 23:6-13</p>
<p>14“Celebrate three festivals to me each year. 15Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. Eat bread without yeast for a week at the scheduled time in the month Abib, the month you came out of Egypt. Nobody is to come to me empty-handed. 16Observe the Festival of the Harvest, the first part of the harvest from what you sow. Observe the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year at harvest time. 17Three times a year all males are to appear in front of the Lord Yahveh.</p>
<p>18“Don’t offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast. The fat from my feast is not to remain till morning. 19Bring the best of the first harvest from your ground to the house of Yahveh your God.</p>
<p>“Don’t boil a kid in its mother’s milk.	 Ex 23:14-19</p>
<p>Conquest of Canaan Promised</p>
<p>20“I’ll send an angel to take you safely to the place I’ve designated. 21Be sure to obey him. He won’t pardon your sins because he wears my name. 22If you sincerely obey him in everything I say, I’ll be an enemy to your enemies, an adversary to your adversaries. 23My angel will take you to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Canaanite, Hivite, and Jebusite; and I’ll destroy them.	 Ex 23:20-23</p>
<p>24“Don’t worship and serve other gods or do what they do. Overthrow them completely and break their sacred pillars to pieces. 25Serve Yahveh your God, and he’ll bless your bread and water, and keep you from getting sick. 26There won’t be any miscarriages or barrenness in your country, you’ll have long lives. 27I’ll spread fear in front of you, and throw into confusion the people you invade, and make your enemies flee. 28I’ll send hornets ahead of you to drive out the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites. 29I won’t drive them out in a single year; the land would grow wild and wild animals would take over. 30I’ll drive them out little by little till you gain possession of it and make it productive.</p>
<p>31“I’ll set your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea beside the Philistines, from the desert to the River Euphrates. I’ll deliver the people to you to drive out. 32Don’t make any treaty with them or their gods. 33Don’t let them live in your country and end up making you sin against me. If you serve their gods, they’ll be a snare to you.”	 Ex 23:24-33</p>
<p>The Covenant Confirmed</p>
<p>24:1Then Yahveh told Moses, “Come up to meY and worship at a distance—you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders. 2You alone will approach me; the others and the community can’t approach me.”</p>
<p>3Moses recounted to the people Yahveh’s ordinances, and they answered together, “We’ll do what he’s said.”</p>
<p>4Moses wrote them down. Then he got up early and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with 12 pillars for the 12 tribes. 5He sent young men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as peace offerings. 6Moses put half of the blood in basins and sprinkled the other half on the altar. 7He read the covenant to the people. They said, “We’ll do what Yahveh has said.” 8Moses sprinkled the blood on them, “This is the blood of the covenant Yahveh has made with you.”                                                                         Ex 24:1-8</p>
<p>9Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders; 10and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what looked like an expanse of sapphire as clear as the sky. 11Yet he didn’t reach out against the nobles of Israel; they looked at him and ate and drank.</p>
<p>12Yahveh told Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here. I’ll give you the stone tablets with the Law I’ve commanded and written to instruct them.” 13Moses and Joshua his assistant went up on the mountain of God. 14But he told the elders, “Wait here till we get back. Aaron and Hur are with you. If anybody has a legal problem, go to them.” 15Then he went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered it. 16Yahveh’s brightness rested on Mount Sinai for six days. On the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the cloud. 17To the people of Israel Yahveh’s brightness looked like a flagrant fire on the mountain. 18Moses went into the cloud as he climbed the mountain and was there for 40 days.	Ex 24:9-18</p>
<p>Contributions for the Tabernacle</p>
<p>25:1Yahveh said to him,</p>
<p>2“Tell the Israelites to take up an offering for me as their hearts move them: 3gold, silver, and bronze; 4blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen, goat hair, 5rams’ skins dyed red, dolphin skins, acacia wood, 6olive oil for lighting, spices for anointing oil and fragrant incense, 7onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and pouch.  8Have them build a sanctuary so I can live among them. 9Build the Tabernacle and its furniture like I show you.	 Ex 25:1-9</p>
<p>The Ark of the Covenant</p>
<p>10“Have them build an Ark out of acacia wood 45 x 27 x 27ins high. 11Overlay it with pure gold inside and out and make a gold molding around it. 12Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four bottom corners.</p>
<p>13“Make poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 14Put them into the rings on each side of the Ark for carrying it, 15and leave them in the rings.</p>
<p>16“The Testimony I’m going to give you, put in the ark</p>
<p>17“Make a mercy seat out of pure gold 45 x 27 x 27ins.</p>
<p>18“Make two cherubs out of hammered gold for the two ends of the mercy seat. 19Make each of them one piece 20with wings spread upward and facing each other. 21Put the mercy seat on top of the Ark. 22I’ll meet you above the mercy seat. From between the two cherubs, I’ll tell you the commandments to give Israel.</p>
<p>Ex 25:10-22</p>
<p>The Table for the Bread of Presence</p>
<p>23“Make a table out of acacia wood 36 x 18 x 27ins high. 24Overlay it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 25Make a rim around it a hand’s width and a gold border for the rim. 26Make four gold rings and put them on the four bottom corners. 27Put the rings close to the rim to hold the poles that carry the table. 28Make the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</p>
<p>29“Make for it pure-gold dishes, jars, and bowls for pouring liquid offerings.</p>
<p>30“Keep the Bread of the Presence in front of me on the table at all times. 								     		       Ex 25:23-30</p>
<p>The Golden Lampstand</p>
<p>31“Make a lampstand out of pure gold with a base and shaft. Its cups, bulbs, and flowers will be one piece. 32It’ll have 6 branches, 3 on a side. 333 cups shaped like almond blossoms will be on one branch—a bulb and flower, and 3 cups shaped like almond blossoms on the other branch—a bulb and flower, 34and on the lampstand 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms—its bulbs and flowers. 35Put a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches—coming out of it. That makes 6 branches coming out of the lampstand. 36The whole thing will be one piece of hammered pure gold. 37Make its lamps so they shine forward. 38Its snuffers and their trays will be pure gold. 39Make it from 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold, with all its utensils. 40Be sure to make them in the design I showed you on the mountain. 	Ex 25:31-40</p>
<p>The Tabernacle</p>
<p>26:1“Make the Tabernacle with 10 curtains of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet material. Make them with cherubs, a skilled weaver’s work. 2All the curtains will be 42 x 6ft. 3Make 2 sets of 5 joined curtains. 4Make blue loops on the edge of the outer curtain in the first set; do the same with the second set. 5Make 50 loops in the one curtain, and 50 loops on the edge of the second set. Put the loops across from each other. 6Make 50 gold clasps and join the curtains together with them so the Tabernacle makes a unit.	 Ex 26:1-6</p>
<p>7-8“Make 11 curtains out of goats’ hair for a covering over the Tabernacle. Make them 45 x 6ft. 9Join 5 curtains in one set, and 6 curtains in another set. Double the sixth curtain at the front of the tent. 10Make 50 loops on the edge of the outside curtain in the two sets. 11Make 50 bronze clasps, put them into the loops, and join the tent together to make one unit. 12The overlapping part that’s left over in the curtains of the tent—the half curtain—will lap over the back of the Tabernacle. 13The 18ins on each side of what’s left over in the length of the curtain, will lap over the back of the sides of the Tabernacle to cover each side. 14Make a covering for the tent out of rams’ and dolphin skins dyed red.	 Ex 26:7-14</p>
<p>15“Make vertical boards out of acacia wood for the Tabernacle. 16Make them 15ft x 27in. 17With all the boards, make a mortise and tenon on each board, so they fit together. 18Make 20 boards for the south side of the Tabernacle. 19Make 40 silver bases under the 20 boards, 2 bases under each board for its mortise and tenon. 20-21Do the north side of the Tabernacle the same as the south side. 22For the back of the Tabernacle, the west end, make 6 boards. 23For the two back corners make 2 boards. 24They’ll double on top of each other; together they’ll be complete to the top to the first ring. Make both corners alike. 25There will be 8 boards with their 16 silver bases, 2 bases under each board.	 Ex 26:15-25</p>
<p>26“Make 5 braces out of acacia wood for the boards on one side of the Tabernacle, 275 braces for the boards on the other side, and 5 braces for the rear, west end. 28The middle brace in the center of the boards will go from one end to the other. 29Overlay the boards with gold and make their gold rings into holders for the braces. Overlay the braces with gold too. 30Build the Tabernacle by the plan I showed you on the mountain.”	Ex 26:26-30</p>
<p>31“Make a curtain out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen. Put cherubs on it, a skilled weaver’s work. 32Hang it on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold, having gold hooks, and set on four silver sockets. 33Hang the curtain under the clasps and bring the Ark of Testimony inside the curtain that separates the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. 34Mount the mercy seat on the Ark. 35Outside the curtain, set the table on the north side of the Tabernacle and the lampstand on the south side. 36For the doorway of the tent, make a screen out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine linen, a weaver’s work. 37For the screen, make five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold, having gold hooks, and set on 5 bronze sockets.	 Ex 26:31-37</p>
<p>The Bronze Altar</p>
<p>27:1“Make an altar out of acacia wood, 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high 2with a horn on each corner. Make them one piece with the altar and overlaid with bronze.</p>
<p>3“Make bronze pails for removing the ashes, bronze shovels, basins, forks, and fire pans.</p>
<p>4“Make a network of bronze grating for it, and on the network put four bronze rings at the corners. 5Put the grating under the ledge of the altar so it reaches halfway up the altar.</p>
<p>6“For the altar make acacia poles overlaid with bronze. 7Insert the poles into the rings on the two sides of the altar for carrying it. 8Make it hollow with planks like you saw on the mountain.	Ex 27:1-8</p>
<p>The Court of the Tabernacle</p>
<p>9“Make a court for the Tabernacle. Its south side will have curtains made out of finely twined linen 150ft long for one side. 10It’ll have 20 posts with 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts will be silver. 11Make the north side of the court the same way. 12The west end of the court will have 75ft of curtains with 10 posts with their 10 bases. 13The east end of the court will be 75ft wide. 14The curtains for one side of the entrance will be 22½ft long with 3 posts and their 3 bases. 15Make the other side of the entrance the same way. 16The entrance to the court will be a screen 30ft wide woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material with finely twined linen; with 4 posts and their 4 bases. 17The posts around the court will have silver bands with silver hooks and bronze bases. 18The court will be 150 x 75ft with curtains 7½ft high and bronze bases under its posts. 19Make out of bronze the Tabernacle’s utensils of service, its pegs, and the pegs in the court.  	Ex 27:9-19</p>
<p>Oil for the Lamp</p>
<p>20“Charge the people to bring pure oil from mashed olives for a continually burning light in the lamp. 21In the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will keep the light burning from evening to morning in front of Yahveh—a permanent statute for Israel’s descendants.				Ex 27:20-21</p>
<p>The Priestly Garments</p>
<p>28:1“From the Israelites, have your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar come to you to serve as priests. 2Make holy vestments for Aaron, glorious and beautiful. 3Talk to skilled artisans that I’ve given wisdom for making them and consecrate them for performing service to me. 4Make these vestments for Aaron and his sons: a pouch, ephod, robe, tunic made out of checkered work, a turban, and a sash. 5The artisans are to use gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and fine linen.	Ex 28:1-5</p>
<p>6“They’re to make the ephod out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 7It will have 2 shoulder pieces joined to its 2 ends. 8The skillfully woven band on it will have the same design and material. 9Take 2 onyx stones and engrave the names of Israel’s sons on them, 106 per stone in their birth order. 11Like a jeweler engraves a signet, engrave the 2 stones with their names, and set them in delicate gold settings. 12Put the 2 stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod. Aaron will carry them on his two shoulders as a memorial of the people of Israel. 13Make delicate gold settings 14and 2 pure gold chains. Make them out of twined cordage and put the corded chains on the delicate settings.	 Ex 28:6-14</p>
<p>15“Make a Pouch of Judgment, an artisan’s work. Make its design match the ephod—with blue, purple, scarlet material, and finely twined linen. 16It will be 9ins 1 span square and folded double. 17Mount four rows of gemstones on it: a ruby, topaz, and emerald on the first row; 18a turquoise, sapphire, and diamond on the second; 19a jacinth, agate, and amethyst on the third; 20and a beryl, onyx, and jasper on the fourth—all set in delicate gold decorations. 21Set the precious stones in the birth order of Israel’s 12 sons. Engrave their names as on a seal. 22On the pouch put pure gold chains of twined cordage. 23Put 2 gold rings on the 2 ends of the pouch, 24and put the 2 gold cords on the rings. 25Put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 decorative settings and attach them to the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 26Make 2 gold rings and put them on the 2 ends of the pouch, on the edge of the inner side of the ephod. 27Make 2 gold rings and put them at the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front close to where it joins together, above the skillfully woven band. 28Use a blue cord to tie the rings of the pouch to the ephod rings, so it will be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch won’t come loose from the ephod. 29Aaron will carry the names of Israel’s sons in the Pouch of Judgment over his heart when he goes into the Holy Place, for a memorial in front of Yahveh continually. 30Put the Urim and Thummim in the pouch.	 Ex 28:15-30</p>
<p>31“Make the whole ephod robe blue 32with an opening for the head in the middle. Around the opening put an edging made of woven work—as with a coat of mail—so it won’t tear. 33-34All around the hem, put pomegranates made out of blue, purple, and scarlet material, and alternate gold bells with them. 35Aaron will wear it when he performs service, and other people can hear it tinkling when he enters and leaves the Holy Place in case he dies while he’s in front of Yahveh.</p>
<p>Ex 28:31-35</p>
<p>36“Make a pure gold plate and engrave it ‘Holy to Yahveh’—as on a seal. 37Use a blue cord to fasten it to the front of the turban. 38Aaron will always wear it on his forehead to take away the sin from all holy gifts the Israelites consecrate, to make them acceptable to Yahveh. 39Weave the tunic out of checkered work of fine linen and make a turban and sash out of fine linen.	 Ex 28:36-39</p>
<p>40“For Aaron’s sons make tunics, sashes, and caps, bright and beautiful. 41Put them on him and his sons; anoint, ordain, and consecrate them to serve me as priests. 42Make linen pants to cover their bare skin, pants that reach from their waist to their thighs. 43They’ll wear them in the Tent of Meeting and when they go to the altar to perform service in the Holy Place so they won’t incur guilt and die—a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants.	 Ex 28:40-43</p>
<p>Dedication of the Priests</p>
<p>29:1“This is how you’re to consecrate them as priests to me: take a young bull, two rams without blemish, 2bread without yeast, and cakes mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with oil and made out of fine wheat flour. 3Put them in a basket and bring them with the bull and two rams. 4Take Aaron and his sons to the door and give them a bath. 5Put on Aaron the tunic, ephod robe, ephod, chest pouch, and skillfully woven band of the ephod. 6Put the turban on his head and the holy crown on the turban. 7Then pour the anointing oil on his head. 8Put tunics on his sons. 9Put sashes around him and his sons and tie the caps on them. They’ll exercise the priesthood by permanent statute. 	Ex 29:1-9</p>
<p>10“Then take the bull to Yahveh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 11and slaughter it. 12Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger. Pour out the rest at the base of the altar. 13Take the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that’s on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar. 14Burn the meat, hide, and manure outside the camp as a sin offering.	 Ex 29:10-14</p>
<p>15“Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on one ram’s head. 16Slaughter it and sprinkle its blood around the altar. 17Then butcher it, wash its entrails and legs, and put them on the altar with the pieces and head. 18Offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar—a burnt offering to Yahveh, a pleasing aroma.</p>
<p>19“Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on the other ram’s head. 20Slaughter it, put some of its blood on Aaron and his sons’ right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. Sprinkle the rest around on the altar. 21Take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, his sons, and their vestments. That will consecrate them and their vestments. 22Take the fat from the ram—fat from its tail, fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh (it’s a ram for ordination)—23one cake of bread, one cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that sits in front of Yahveh. 24Put them in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave offering in front of Yahveh. 25Take them and offer them up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering for an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 	Ex 29:15-25</p>
<p>26“Then take the breast of Aaron’s ram for the ordination, and wave it as a wave offering; it will be your portion. 27Consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering that was waved and offered from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and the one that was for his sons. 28It will be for Aaron and his sons their permanent portion from the Israelites. It’s a heave offering from the Israelites’ peace offerings, that is, their heave offering to Yahveh.</p>
<p>29“Aaron’s holy vestments will go to his descendants so they can be anointed and ordained in them. 30For one week his descendant that succeeds him as priest will wear them when he enters the Tent of Meeting to perform service in the Holy Place.	 Ex 29:26-30</p>
<p>31“Take the ram for the ordination and boil its meat in a holy place. 32At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons will eat the ram’s meat and the bread in the basket. 33They’ll eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration. A layman can’t eat them because they’re holy. 34Burn any meat or bread that’s left over till morning.	 Ex 29:31-34</p>
<p>35“This is how you’ll ordain Aaron and his sons over the course of a week. 36Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, to purify the altar when you atone for it. Anoint it to consecrate it. 37For 7 days atone for the altar to consecrate it. Then it will be most holy; whoever touches it will be holy.</p>
<p>Ex 29:35-37</p>
<p>38“Offer on the altar two one-year-old lambs each day, 39one in the morning and another in the evening. 40Mix 4½ pecks .1 ephah of fine flour with 3pts ¼ hin of pressed oil and 3pts ¼ hin of wine for a liquid offering for the lamb. 41Offer the other lamb in the evening, like the grain offering in the morning, with its liquid offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to Yahveh. 42It will be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in front of meY. I’ll meet you there and speak to you. 43I’ll meet there with the descendants of Israel, and it will be consecrated by my glory. 44I’ll consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, as well as Aaron and his sons to minster as priests to me. 45I’ll live among the descendants of Israel and be their God. 46They’ll know I’m Yahveh their God who brought them out of Egypt to live among them.  	Ex 29:38-46</p>
<p>The Altar of Incense</p>
<p>30:1“Make an altar out of acacia wood as a place to burn incense: 218 x 18 x 36in with horns in one piece with it. 3Overlay it with pure gold on its sides, top, and horns; make a molding around it. 4On two sides put two gold rings under its molding on opposite ends for carrying it. 5Make the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 6Put the altar in front of the curtain that’s near the Ark of Testimony—in front of the mercy seat that’s on top of the Ark—where I’ll meet you. 7-8Aaron will burn fragrant incense on it every morning and evening and trim the lamps. Burn incense to me continuously throughout your generations. 9Don’t offer foreign incense, burnt offering, or meal offering on this altar. Don’t pour any liquid offering on it. 10Throughout your generations, Aaron will make atonement on its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering. It’s most holy to me.	 Ex 30:1-10</p>
<p>Atonement Money</p>
<p>[11] 12“When you take a census of the Israelites, each one will give a ransom for himself to Yahveh so there won’t be any plague among them. 13-14Each person that’s counted from 20 years up will give .2 oz a half-shekel of the sanctuary as a contribution to Yahveh (20 gerahs to a shekel). 15Rich and poor will contribute the same .2 oz a half-shekel of to make atonement. 16Give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to Yahveh.	 Ex 30:11-16</p>
<p>Bronze Basin for Washing</p>
<p>[17] 18“Make a bronze laver with a bronze base, put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 19Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet from it 20when they go into the Tent of Meeting so they won’t die when they approach the altar to offer up in smoke a sacrifice by fire to meY.  21That will be an ongoing statute for Aaron and his descendants. 	Ex 30:17-21</p>
<p>Anointing Oil</p>
<p>[22] 23“Take the finest spices: 12½ lbs 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 2412½ lbs 500 shekels of cassia, and 1½ gallons hin of olive oil. 25From them, make a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, a perfumer’s work. 26With it, anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, 27the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28the altar of burnt offering and its instruments, and the laver and its stand. 29Consecrate them so they’ll be holy. Whatever touches them will be holy. 30Anoint Aaron and his sons to consecrate them for performing service to me as priests. 31Tell the Israelites, ‘This will be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations. 32Don’t make any oil like it in the same proportions or pour it on anybody else. It’s holy, reserved for you. 33Whoever mixes any oil like it or puts any of it on a layman, will be excluded from the community.’”	    Ex 30:22-33</p>
<p>Incense</p>
<p>34“Take the spices stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense in equal amounts 35to make incense, a perfumer’s work—salted, pure, and holy. 36Beat some of it very fine and put part of it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I’ll meet you. It will be most holy to you. 37Any incense you make for yourselves can’t have the same proportions. My incense will be exclusively for Yahveh. 38Whoever makes any perfume like it will be excluded from his people. 	  Ex 30:34-38</p>
<p>Bezalel and Oholiab</p>
<p>31[:1] 2“I’ve specifically called Bezalel Ben-Uri Ben-Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 3I’ve filled him with my spirit in wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship</p>
<p>4to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze,</p>
<p>5in cutting stones for settings and</p>
<p>carving in wood.</p>
<p>6I’ve appointed with him Oholiab Ben-Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan. In the hearts of everybody that’s skilled, I’ve put the skill to make everything:</p>
<p>7the Tent of Meeting,</p>
<p>the Ark of Testimony,</p>
<p>the mercy seat on top of it,</p>
<p>the furniture in the tent,</p>
<p>8the table and its utensils,</p>
<p>the pure gold lampstand with its utensils,</p>
<p>the altar of incense,</p>
<p>9the altar of burnt offering with its utensils,</p>
<p>the laver with its stand,</p>
<p>10the holy woven vestments for Aaron and his sons for carrying out</p>
<p>their priesthood,</p>
<p>11the anointing oil,</p>
<p>and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place.</p>
<p>They’re to make them the way I told you.	 Ex 31:1-11</p>
<p>The Sabbath</p>
<p>[12] 13“Tell the Israelites to observe my Sabbaths. They’re a sign between you and me throughout your generations so you can know I’m Yahveh who sanctifies you. 14The Sabbath is set aside for you. Execute anybody that profanes it. Exclude from the community whoever works on it. 15Work for six days, but the seventh day will be a complete rest set aside to meY. 16Israelites will observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a continuing covenant. 17It’s a permanent sign between them and me, because IY made earth and sky in six days, but stopped working on the seventh day and was refreshed.”</p>
<p>18When God finished speaking to him on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the Testimony that God wrote with his own finger. 	   Ex 31:12-18</p>
<p>The Golden Calf</p>
<p>32:1When Moses hadn’t come down from the mountain for a long time, the people gathered around Aaron and said, “Make us a god to go ahead of us. We don’t know what’s happened to this Moses that brought us out of Egypt.”</p>
<p>2Aaron said, “Take the gold earrings off of your wives, sons, and daughters, and bring them to me.” [3] 4He took them, and with a graving tool shaped a molten calf.</p>
<p>They said, “This is your god, Israel, that brought you out of Egypt!”</p>
<p>5When Aaron saw it, he built an altar in front of it, and made a proclamation, “Tomorrow will be a feast to Yahveh.” 6They got up early, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. The people sat down to gluttony and got up to revelry. 	Ex 32:1-6</p>
<p>7Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Go down right now. The people have corrupted themselves. 8They’ve turned aside so soon from what I commanded them. They’ve made a molten calf and worshiped it, sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, Israel, that brought you out of Egypt!’ 9These are stubborn people. 10Let me alone so my anger can burn against them and destroy them. I’ll make a great nation out of you.”</p>
<p>11Moses asked Yahveh his God,</p>
<p>“Why does your anger burn against the people you brought out of Egypt with such power? 12Why should the Egyptians be able to say you brought them out to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the earth? Turn from your furious anger and change your mind about harming them. 13Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, the servants you swore to by yourself, ‘I’ll multiply your descendants like stars in the sky, and this land I’ve talked about I’ll give your descendants as a permanent inheritance.’”</p>
<p>14So Yahveh changed his mind about harming them.	 Ex 32:7-14</p>
<p>15Moses went down the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the Testimony, engraved on both sides 16with God’s writing. 17When Joshua heard the people shouting, he told Moses it sounded like war in the camp.</p>
<p>18But Moses said, “That’s not the shout of triumph or defeat.  I hear singing.”</p>
<p>19As soon as he got close to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing, and his anger flared. He threw the tablets down and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. 20He took the calf they’d made, burned it, and ground it to powder. He scattered it on the water and made the people drink it.	Ex 32:15-20</p>
<p>21Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to get you to bring such a great sin on them?”</p>
<p>22“Don’t be furious with me. You know they’re prone to evil. 23They told me, ‘Make us a god to go in front of us. We don’t know what’s happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.’ 24I told them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off.’ They gave it to me; I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.” 	Ex 32:21-24</p>
<p>25Moses saw that the people were out of control (Aaron had let them get out of control to be ridiculed by their enemies). 26So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for Yahveh, come to me!” Levi’s descendants went to him,</p>
<p>27He said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of Israel, says, ‘Every one of you, put your sword on your thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp. Each man, slay your brother, friend, or neighbor.’”</p>
<p>28The Levites did that and slew about 3,000 men that day. 29Then Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves to Yahveh (because every man has been against his son and brother) so he can bless you today.”	 Ex 32:25-29</p>
<p>30The next day, Moses told the people, “You’ve committed a serious sin. I’m going up to Yahveh. Maybe I can atone for you.” 31He went back to Yahveh and said,</p>
<p>“The people have committed a serious sin by making a god out of gold. 32But if you will, forgive them. If not, erase me out of your scroll!”</p>
<p>33Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“The ones that have sinned against me are the ones I’ll erase out of my scroll. 34Go lead them where I said. My angel will go ahead of you. When I punish, I’ll punish them for their sin.”</p>
<p>35Yahveh struck the people because of what they’d done with the calf Aaron had made.</p>
<p>Ex 32:30-35</p>
<p>33:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Leave here and go to the land I swore I’d give the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 2I’ll send an angel ahead of you to drive out the Canaanite, Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. 3Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. I won’t go up with you, because you’re stubborn, so I won’t destroy you on the way.”</p>
<p>4When the people heard that discouraging word, they went into mourning; nobody put on jewelry. 5Yahveh had told Moses, “Tell them, ‘You’re being stubborn. If I’d go up among you for a moment, I’d destroy you. So take off your jewelry so I’ll know what I’m to do with you.’” 6They didn’t wear jewelry from Mount Horeb/Sinai on.	 Ex 33:1-6</p>
<p>The Tent of Meeting</p>
<p>7Moses would pitch a tent a good distance outside the camp—what he called The Tent of Meeting. Anybody that wanted to consult Yahveh would go out to it. 8Whenever Moses went out, everybody would stand at the entrance of his tent and watch him till he went into the tent. 9Then the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance, and Yahveh would talk to him. 10When people saw the pillar, they would worship at their own tents. 11Yahveh would speak to Moses directly, the way you talk to a friend. When Moses would come back to the camp, his assistant Joshua Ben-Nun, a young man, would stay behind at the tent. 	Ex 33:7-11</p>
<p>Moses Sees the Glory of the LORD</p>
<p>12Then Moses told Yahveh,</p>
<p>“You tell me to bring the people up, but you haven’t let me know who you’ll send with me. You’ve said you knew me by name, and you’ve been gracious to me. 13Let me know your ways so I can know you and please you.  Consider this nation your people.</p>
<p>14“My presence will go with yousg, and I’ll give you rest.”</p>
<p>15“If you don’t go with us, don’t take us away from here. 16How can your people and I know we’re being pleasing to you? Isn’t it by having you with us so we can tell the difference between ourselves and other people?” 	Ex 33:12-16</p>
<p>17“I’ll do what you’ve asked, because you’re pleasing to me, and I know you by name.”</p>
<p>18“Show me your glory.”</p>
<p>19“I’ll make my goodness pass by in front of you, and show you who I am. I’ll decide who to give grace to and who to show mercy to. 20But you can’t see my face. Nobody can see me and live! 21Here’s a place beside me; stand on that rock. 22While my glory is passing by, I’ll put you in a crevice in the rock and cover you with my hand till I’m past. 23Then I’ll take my hand away, and you can see my back; but you won’t see my face.”	 Ex 33:17-23</p>
<p>The New Stone Tablets</p>
<p>34:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Carve out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I’ll write on them what was on the tablets you shattered. 2Be ready by morning. Come up to the top of Mount Sinai and present yourself 3alone. Nobody can be on the mountain. Flocks and herds can’t graze by it.”</p>
<p>4He carved two stone tablets like the first ones, got up early, and took them up to Mount Sinai. 5Yahveh came down in a cloud and stood there with him as he called on Yahveh. 6He passed by Moses and proclaimed,</p>
<p>“Yahveh, Yahveh God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness; 7who shows kindness to thousands; forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin; yet doesn’t leave guilty people unpunished and visits the consequences of parents’ sins on their descendants for three or four generations!”</p>
<p>8Moses immediately bowed to the ground in worship.</p>
<p>9“If I’m pleasing to you, Yahveh, go along with us, even though we’ve been so stubborn. Pardon our sin and take us as your own.”	 Ex 34:1-9</p>
<p>10God said,</p>
<p>“I’ll make a covenant. I’ll perform miracles for the people that haven’t been done in any nation. The people you live with will see myY working; it’ll be terrifying. 11Be sure to observe what I’m commanding you today; and I’ll drive out the Amorite, Canaanite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite in front of you.</p>
<p>12“Don’t make any treaty with the people where you’re going. That would be a snare among you. 13Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles. 14(Don’t worship any other god, because IY am an “exclusive” God. Exclusive is my name.) 15Destroy those things so you won’t be making treaties with them, carrying on prostitution with their gods, sacrificing to them, eating their sacrifices with them—16so you won’t be taking their daughters for your sons, and their daughters carry on prostitution with their gods and get your sons to do it.</p>
<p>17“Don’t make molten gods.”	Ex 34:10-17</p>
<p>18“Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For a week at the specified time in the month Abib, eat bread without yeast like I told you. That’s the month you came out of Egypt.</p>
<p>19“The first male offspring belongs to me, including the first male offspring of your cattle and sheep. 20With a lamb, redeem the first offspring of a donkey. If you don’t redeem it, break its neck. Redeem firstborn sons. None of them are to appear in front me empty-handed.”  	Ex 34:18-20</p>
<p>21“Work six days, but rest on the seventh, even during plowing time and harvest.</p>
<p>22“At year’s end celebrate the Festival of Weeks, that is, the first part of the wheat harvest, the Festival of Ingathering.</p>
<p>23“Three times a year, males are to appear in myY presence. 24I’ll drive out nations in front of you and enlarge your territory. Nobody is to covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear in myY presence.</p>
<p>25“Don’t offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast or leave the Passover sacrifice over till morning.</p>
<p>26“Bring the first of your ground’s produce to my house.</p>
<p>“Don’t boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</p>
<p>27“Write those things down; with them I’m making a covenant with you and Israel.”</p>
<p>28Moses was there with Yahveh for 40 days and didn’t eat bread or drink water. Yahveh wrote the terms of the covenant on the tablets: The Ten Commandments. 	Ex 34:21-28</p>
<p>The Glowing Face of Moses</p>
<p>29When Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (with the tablets in hand), he didn’t realize his face was glowing because he’d been speaking with Yahveh. 30When Aaron and the Israelites saw his face glowing, they were afraid to get close to him. 31He called out to them, and Aaron and the rulers in the community came back to him. 32He told them to do everything Yahveh had told him on Mount Sinai. 33When he finished talking, he put on a veil. 34Whenever he went to speak to Yahveh, he’d take it off till he came out to report what Yahveh had said. 35The people would see his face glowing, and he’d put the veil back on till he went in to speak to Yahveh again.	Ex 34:29-35</p>
<p>Sabbath Regulations</p>
<p>35:1Moses gathered the community and said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh has commanded these things: 2‘You can work for six days, but set the seventh day aside to himY as a complete rest. Whoever works on it will be executed. 3Don’t start a fire in your houses on the Sabbath.’”	 Ex 35:1-3</p>
<p>Materials for the Tabernacle</p>
<p>4Moses told them,</p>
<p>“Yahveh has commanded 5to take an offering for himY from everybody that’s willing to contribute:</p>
<p>gold, silver, and bronze;</p>
<p>6blue, purple, and scarlet material;</p>
<p>fine linen;</p>
<p>goats’ hair, 7rams’ skins dyed red, dolphin skins;</p>
<p>acacia wood;</p>
<p>8olive oil for lighting,</p>
<p>spices for anointing oil and fragrant incense;</p>
<p>9onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and chest pouch.</p>
<p>Ex 35:4-9</p>
<p>10‘The artisans need to make everything I’veY commanded:</p>
<p>11the Tabernacle,</p>
<p>its tent and covering,</p>
<p>its hooks and boards,</p>
<p>its bar, posts, and bases;</p>
<p>12the Ark and its poles;</p>
<p>the mercy seat,</p>
<p>the dividing curtain;</p>
<p>13the table, its poles, utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;</p>
<p>14the lampstand for the light and its utensils, lamps, and olive oil;</p>
<p>15the altar of incense, its poles, anointing oil, and fragrant incense;</p>
<p>the curtain across the Tabernacle entrance;</p>
<p>16the altar for burnt offerings with its bronze grating, poles,</p>
<p>utensils, basin, and stand;</p>
<p>17the curtains for the court,</p>
<p>its posts and bases,</p>
<p>the screen for the entrance to the court;</p>
<p>18the pegs for the Tabernacle and the court and their cords;</p>
<p>19the woven vestments for performing service in the Holy Place, the holy</p>
<p>vestments for Aaron the priest and his sons.’”	Ex 35:10-19</p>
<p>20The community left. 21Everyone whose heart and spirit stirred him brought a contribution for the work on the Tent of Meeting, its service, and holy vestments.</p>
<p>22Men and women brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, bracelets, and gold articles; and offered them to Yahveh.</p>
<p>23People that had blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen; goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, and dolphin skins brought them.</p>
<p>24People that could contribute silver or bronze brought it.</p>
<p>Men that had acacia wood brought it for any work of the service.</p>
<p>25-26Skilled women brought blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen, and goats’ hair they’d spun.</p>
<p>27Rulers brought onyx stones and stones for setting the ephod and chest pouch.</p>
<p>28They brought spices and olive oil for the light, anointing oil, and fragrant incense.</p>
<p>29Israelite men and women that were moved to bring material for the work Yahveh commanded, brought it to him as a free-will offering.	 Ex 35:20-29</p>
<p>Bezalel and Oholiab</p>
<p>30Moses told the people,</p>
<p>“Yahveh has appointed Bezalel Ben-Uri Ben-Hur from the tribe of Judah. 31He has filled him with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and craftsmanship 32to make designs for working in gold, silver, and bronze; 33for cutting stones for settings, carving wood, and doing all the creative work. 34He and Oholiab Ben-Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, are willing to teach these skills. 35God has given them the skill to engrave, design, embroider, and weave blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine linen. 36:1Bezalel, Oholiah, and every person skilled by Yahveh are to perform their work as commanded.”	 Ex 35:30-36:1</p>
<p>2Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and their artisans to begin the work. 3They received from him the contributions for building the sanctuary. [4] 5They told him, “The people are bringing more than we need.” 6He circulated a message throughout the camp that they didn’t need to contribute anything more. [7]	Ex 36:2-7</p>
<p>8Bezalel and his artisans made the Tabernacle with 10 curtains from finely twined linen and from blue, purple, and scarlet material with cherubs, 9each one 42 x 6ft. 10He joined the 2 sets of 5 curtains, 11and made blue loops along the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 12He made 50 loops in each curtain and set the curtains across from each other. 13He made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains with them so the Tabernacle formed a unit.</p>
<p>14Then he made curtains out of goats’ hair for a tent over the Tabernacle—11 in all. 15Each one was 45 x 6ft. 16He connected 5 curtains to make one set and connected the other 6 curtains to make a second set. 17He made 50 loops each on the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 18He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together. 19He made the covering of the tent out of rams’ skins dyed red with a covering of goatskins over it.	 Ex 36:8-19</p>
<p>20He made the upright boards out of acacia wood, 21each one 15ft x 27in. .22Each board had a mortise and tenon so they’d fit together. 23He made 20 boards for the south side 24with 40 silver bases under the 20 boards. 25-26He did the same for the north side. 27He made 6 boards for the back, the west end of the Tabernacle. 28He made 2 boards for the corners of the Tabernacle in the back; 29they were double underneath. Together they were complete to the top—to the first ring. He did the same for the other corner. 30There were 8 boards with their 16 bases—2 under each board. 	Ex 36:20-30</p>
<p>31He formed bars out of acacia wood, 5 for each side of the Tabernacle 32and 5 for the back of it. 33The middle bar passed through the center of the boards from one end of the Tabernacle to the other. 34He overlaid the boards with gold, shaped their rings out of gold to hold the bars, and made the bars out of gold—an artisan’s work.</p>
<p>35He made the curtain out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen decorated with cherubs. 36He shaped 4 posts out of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and cast 4 silver bases for them. 37For the door to the tent, he fashioned a screen woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 38He formed its 5 posts with their hooks and overlaid their tops and bands with gold; their bases were bronze.   	Ex 36:31-38</p>
<p>The Ark</p>
<p>37:1Bezalel made the Ark out of acacia wood: 45 x 27 x 27ins high. 2He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, made a gold border around it, 3and cast 4 gold rings for it, 2 on each side. 4He shaped poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold 5and put them in the rings for carrying it.</p>
<p>6He formed a mercy seat out of pure gold: 45 x 27in. 7It had 2 hammered gold cherubs for the ends of the mercy seat, 8and were one piece with it. 9Their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat and facing each other.  	Ex 37:1-9</p>
<p>The Table</p>
<p>10Then he made the table out of acacia wood, 36 x 18 x 27in high. 11He overlaid it with pure gold, put a molding around it, 12formed a rim for it a hand’s width, and a gold molding for the rim. 13He cast 4 gold rings for the bottom 4 corners 14close to the rim for holding the poles that carried the table. 15He shaped the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 16Out of pure gold he fashioned the utensils for the table: dishes, pans, bowls, and jars for pouring liquid offerings.	 Ex 37:10-16</p>
<p>The Lampstand</p>
<p>17He formed the lampstand out of pure hammered gold with its base, shaft, cups, bulbs, and flowers as one piece. 18There were 6 branches, 3 coming out of each side. 19It had cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb, and a flower on each branch. 20On the lampstand there were 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs, and its flowers. 21There was a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches coming out of the lampstand. 22Their bulbs and branches were one piece with the lampstand; the whole thing was a single hammered work of pure gold. 23Out of pure gold he formed its 7 lamps with its snuffers and trays. 24He fashioned it and its utensils out of 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold.  	Ex 37:17-24</p>
<p>The Altar of Incense</p>
<p>25He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood: 18 x 18 x 36in high. Its horns were one piece with it. 26He overlaid its top, sides, and horns with pure gold; and made a gold molding around it. 27For each side under its molding he made two gold rings to hold the poles for carrying it. 28He fashioned the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 29He made the holy anointing oil and pure fragrant incense out of spices—an incense maker’s work. 	Ex 37:25-29</p>
<p>The Altar of Burnt Offering</p>
<p>38:1Then he built the altar for burnt offering out of acacia wood: 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high. 2He formed horns on its four corners one piece with it and overlaid it with bronze. 3He made bronze utensils for the altar: pails, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and fire pans. 4He fashioned a bronze grating under the edge of the altar that reached halfway up, 5and cast 4 rings for the 4 ends of the grating to hold the poles. 6He formed the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, 7and inserted them into the rings for carrying it. He made it hollow with planks.</p>
<p>Basin for Washing</p>
<p>8He created the laver out of bronze with a bronze base, from the mirrors of the women that served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.	Ex 38:1-8</p>
<p>The Courtyard</p>
<p>9Then he built the court. For the south side he made curtains out of finely twined linen 150ft long. 10There were 20 posts with 20 bronze bases with hooks on the posts and silver bands. 11The north side was 150ft long with 20 posts, 20 bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts. 12The west side was 75ft long with 10 posts, 10 bases, and silver hooks and bands for the posts. 13The east side was 75ft long. 14The curtains on one side of the entrance were 22½ft long with 3 posts and 3 bases. 15The other side was the same. 16He made the curtains out of finely twined linen. 17The bases for the posts were bronze; their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.</p>
<p>18The screen for the court entrance was woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 19The 4 posts and their bases were bronze, their hooks were silver, with silver overlay on the tops and bands on the posts. 20The pegs for the Tabernacle and the court were bronze.	Ex 38:9-20</p>
<p>Inventory of Materials</p>
<p>21Those are the items for the Tabernacle of Testimony that Moses commanded for the Levites’ service, as recorded by Ithamar Ben-Aaron the priest. 22Bezalel Ben-Uri Ben-Hur, from the tribe of Judah, made everything Yahveh told Moses. 23Working with him was Oholiab Ben-Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, an engraver, artisan, and weaver in blue, purple, and scarlet material; and fine linen. 	Ex 38:21-23</p>
<p>24All the gold for the work on the sanctuary, including the wave offering, was 2,208 lbs 29 talents and 730 shekels of the sanctuary. 25The silver from the community was 7595 lbs 100 talents and 1,775 shekels of the sanctuary, 26a beka per head, for each one that passed by that was 20 years old and up: 603,550 men. 27The 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver went for casting the bases of the sanctuary and the curtain: 100 bases for the 7550 lbs 100 talents, 75½ lbs one talent per base. 28The 18 lbs 1,775 shekels of silver, Bezalel went for the hooks and rings for the posts and to overlay the tops of them. 29The bronze for the wave offering was 5345 lbs 70 talents and 2400 shekels. 30With the bronze he made bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its grating, the utensils for the altar, 31the bases and pegs for around the court, for the entrance to the court, and the pegs of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>Ex 38:24-31</p>
<p>The Priestly Garments</p>
<p>39:1From the blue, purple, and scarlet material, they made finely woven vestments for Aaron to perform service in the Holy Place—like Yahveh commanded Moses.</p>
<p>2He made the ephod out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 3They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads that were woven in with the blue, purple, and scarlet material; and the fine linen—an artisan’s work. 4They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod—attached at the two upper ends. 5The skillfully woven band on it had the same workmanship: gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen.  6They made the onyx stones, set in delicate gold ornamentation. They engraved the onyx stones like the engravings on a signet, showing the names of Israel’s sons. 7He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for them.	Ex 39:1-7</p>
<p>8He made the pouch to match the ephod, an artisan’s work. It too was made of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 9The pouch was square—9ins on a side when folded double. 10They mounted 4 rows of stones on it:</p>
<p>row 1 had ruby, topaz, and emerald;</p>
<p>11row 2 had turquoise, sapphire, and diamond;</p>
<p>12row 3 had jacinth, agate, amethyst;</p>
<p>13row 4 had beryl, onyx, and jasper—</p>
<p>mounted in delicate gold settings. 14The stones corresponded to the names of Israel’s sons. The 12 names corresponded to the engravings of a signet, each the name of one tribe. 15They made chains like cords on the pouch, twined cordage in pure gold. 16They made 2 delicate gold settings and 2 gold rings and put the 2 rings on the ends of the pouch. 17They put the 2 gold cords in the 2 rings. 18They put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 delicate settings and put them on the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 19They made 2 gold rings and placed them on the inner edge of the pouch ends next to the ephod.</p>
<p>20They made 2 gold rings for the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. 21They bound the pouch to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so it could be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch wouldn’t come loose from the ephod.   	Ex 39:8-21</p>
<p>22Then he made the robe of the ephod out of blue woven work. 23The opening of the robe was in the center at the top, like the opening of a coat of mail with a binding around its opening so it wouldn’t tear. 24They made pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and twined linen, [25] 26and alternated them with pure gold bells and pomegranates around the hem.</p>
<p>Ex 39:22-26</p>
<p>27They prepared tunics out of finely twined linen for Aaron and his sons. 28They made the turban, decorated caps, and the pants out of finely twined linen. 29They wove the sash out of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet material.</p>
<p>30They shaped the plate for the holy crown out of pure gold and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet: Holy to Yahveh. 31They fastened a blue cord to it and attached it to the top of the turban.</p>
<p>32That completed the work on the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites did everything Yahveh told Moses.  	Ex 39:27-32</p>
<p>Moses Inspects the Work</p>
<p>33They brought the Tabernacle to Moses:</p>
<p>the tent and its furnishings, its clasps, boards, bars, posts, and bases;</p>
<p>34the covering made of rams’ skins dyed red and goatskin leather;</p>
<p>the screening curtain;</p>
<p>35the Ark of Testimony, its poles, and the mercy seat;</p>
<p>36the table, its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;</p>
<p>37the pure gold lampstand, its arrangement of lamps, utensils, and olive oil for its lights;</p>
<p>38the gold altar, anointing oil, and fragrant incense;</p>
<p>the curtain for the door to the tent;</p>
<p>39the bronze altar, its bronze grating, poles, and utensils;</p>
<p>the laver and its stand;</p>
<p>40the curtains for the court, its posts and sockets,</p>
<p>the screen for the entrance to the court, its cords, and pegs;</p>
<p>the equipment for the service of the Tabernacle for the Tent of Meeting;</p>
<p>41the woven holy vestments for Aaron and his sons to serve as priests in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>42The Israelites did everything like Yahveh told Moses. 43Moses examined their work and blessed them.	   Ex 39:33-43</p>
<p>Setting Up the Tabernacle</p>
<p>40:1Then Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>2“The first day, first month, set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>3Put the Ark of Testimony in it and screen it off with the curtain.</p>
<p>4Take the table in and arrange what goes on it;</p>
<p>take the lampstand in and mount the lamps.</p>
<p>5Place the gold altar for incense in front of the Ark of Testimony, and</p>
<p>set up the curtain across the door to the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>6Put the altar of burnt offering in front of the door to the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>7Set the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.</p>
<p>8Set up the court around it and hang the curtain across the entrance.</p>
<p>9Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate it and its furnishings to be holy.</p>
<p>10Anoint the altar for burnt offering and the utensils to consecrate the altar. The altar will be the most holy item.</p>
<p>11Anoint the laver and its stand to consecrate it.</p>
<p>12Then take Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and bathe them. 13Dress Aaron in the holy vestments and anoint him to consecrate him so he can serve as a priest to me. 14Bring his sons and put tunics on them. 15Anoint them like you anointed him. Their anointing will appoint them as an ongoing permanent priesthood.”</p>
<p>16Moses did everything Yahveh told him. 	Ex 40:1-16</p>
<p>17The first day, first month, second year, he set up the Tabernacle:</p>
<p>18laid its bases, set up its boards, inserted its bars, and set up its posts; 19he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering on it;</p>
<p>20put the Testimony in the Ark, attached the poles to it, put the mercy seat on top of it, 21took it into the Tabernacle, and screened it off;</p>
<p>22put the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the Tabernacle outside the curtain, 23and arranged the bread on it in front of Yahveh;</p>
<p>24placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, across from the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, 25and lit the lamps in front of Yahveh;</p>
<p>26put the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain, 27and burned fragrant incense on it; 	    Ex 40:17-27</p>
<p>28set up the curtain for the door to the Tabernacle, 29set the altar for burnt offering in front of the door, and offered the burnt offering and meal offering on it;</p>
<p>30put the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar with water in it for washing; 31out of it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet 32when they went into the Tent of Meeting to approach the altar;</p>
<p>33set up the court around the Tabernacle and the altar and hung a curtain across the court entrance.</p>
<p>So Moses finished the work.</p>
<p>The Glory of the LORD</p>
<p>34Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahveh’s glory filled the Tabernacle. 35Moses couldn’t go into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and Yahveh’s glory of Yahveh filled it. 36During their travels, whenever the cloud rose up from the Tabernacle, the Israelites would move out. 37If it didn’t rise up, they’d stay till it did. 38The cloud was on the Tabernacle during the day; fire was in it at night where Israel could see it.  	Ex 40:28-38</p>
