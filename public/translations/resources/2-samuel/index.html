        <p>2 SAMUEL</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>David Learns of Saul’s Death</p>
<p>1:1After Saul died, David came back from massacring the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag. 2The third day, a man came from Saul’s camp with torn clothes and dust on his head, and prostrated himself to David.</p>
<p>3David said, “Where have you come from?”</p>
<p>“I’ve escaped from Israel’s camp.”</p>
<p>4“How did things go?”</p>
<p>“They’ve fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his sons Jonathan are dead.”</p>
<p>5“How do you know?”</p>
<p>6“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coping up on him. 7When he looked back, he called out to me, 8“Who are you?”</p>
<p>‘I’m an Amalekite.’</p>
<p>9He begged me, ‘Please finish me off. I’m in agony; my life lingers on.’</p>
<p>10“So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn’t live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you.”</p>
<p>2 Sam 1:1-10</p>
<p>11David and his men tore their clothes. 12They mourned and cried and fasted till evening for Saul, Jonathan, Yahveh’s people, and for Israel, because they’d fallen by the sword.</p>
<p>13David asked the young man, “Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“I’m the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”</p>
<p>14David said, “How is it you weren’t afraid to destroy Yahveh’s anointed?”</p>
<p>He called one of the young men, “Cut him own.”</p>
<p>So he struck him down.</p>
<p>16David told him, “Your blood is on your own head. You testified against yourself that you killed Yahveh’s anointed.” 17David chanted this dirge over Saul and Jonathan. 18He told them to teach Judah The Song of the Bow; The Book of Jashar records it. 	2 Sam 1:11-18</p>
<p>David’s Lament for Saul and Jonathan</p>
<p>19“Your beauty, Israel, is slain on your high places!</p>
<p>How the strong have fallen!</p>
<p>20Don’t tell it in Gath</p>
<p>or announce it in the streets of Ashkelon;</p>
<p>the Philistines would celebrate;</p>
<p>the uncircumcised would be elated.</p>
<p>21Mountains of Gilboa,</p>
<p>may there be no dew on you</p>
<p>or fields to produce offerings,</p>
<p>because the shield of strong men was was defiled there,</p>
<p>Saul’s shield, not anointed with oil.</p>
<p>22From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong,</p>
<p>Jonathan’s bow didn’t retreat;</p>
<p>Saul’s sword didn’t come back empty.	2 Sam 1:19-22</p>
<p>23Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in life,</p>
<p>died together.</p>
<p>They were faster than eagles,</p>
<p>stronger than lions.</p>
<p>24Young women of Israel, mourn for Saul</p>
<p>who dressed you luxuriously in scarlet,</p>
<p>who put gold sequins on your clothes.</p>
<p>25How the strong have fallen in battle!</p>
<p>Jonathan, slain on your high places.</p>
<p>26I’m distressed over you, Jonathan my brother;</p>
<p>you were so pleasant to me.</p>
<p>Your love for me was more wonderful</p>
<p>than the love of women.</p>
<p>27How the powerful have fallen,</p>
<p>and the weapons of war have perished!	2 Sam 1:23-27</p>
<p>David Anointed King of Judah</p>
<p>2:1Afterward David asked Yahveh, “Should I go up to one of the towns in Judah?”</p>
<p>“Go on up.”</p>
<p>Where?”</p>
<p>“To Hebron.”</p>
<p>2David and his two wives went there. 3He brought his men up with their families, and they lived in towns around Hebron. 4Then the people in Judah came and anointed him king over Judah.</p>
<p>They told him, “The men in Jabesh-gilead have buried Saul.”</p>
<p>5David sent them messengers,</p>
<p>“Yahveh bless you; you’ve been kind to Saul your lord and buried him. 6May Yahveh show you enduring love and truth. I’ll also show you goodness for doing that. 7Be strong and brave. Your lord is dead, and Judah has anointed me king.”			2 Sam 2:1-7</p>
<p>War Between Israel and Judah</p>
<p>8But Abner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, to Mahanaim 9and made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin—all Israel. 10Ish-bosheth was 40 and ruled for 2 years, but Judah followed David. 11For 7½ years he ruled Judah from Hebron.</p>
<p>12Abner went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the troops of Ish-bosheth. 13Joab Ben Zeruiah and David’s troops went to meet them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat on opposite sides of the pool. 14Abner told Joab, “Let’s have the young men have a contest.”</p>
<p>Joab said, “Let them get up.”</p>
<p>15They got up and went over by count, 12 for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and 12 for David’s troops. 16Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword in the other’s side, so they fell down together. So the place was called Helkath-hazzurim, in Gibeon. 17That day the battle became intense. David’s forces beat Abner and the men of Israel.	2 Sam 2:8-17</p>
<p>18Zeruiah’s three sons were: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in the field. 19He kept chasing Abner and wouldn’t turn aside.</p>
<p>20Abner glanced back, “Is that you, Asahel?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>21“Turn aside and grab one of the young men and take his spoil.”</p>
<p>But Asahel wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p>22Abner repeated, “Turn aside. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face your brother Joab?”</p>
<p>23But he wouldn’t do it. So Abner jabbed him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and it came out of his back. He fell there and died. Everybody that came to where he died stood still.			2 Sam 1:18-23</p>
<p>24But Joab and Abishai kept chasing Abner. As the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah by Gath by way of the Wilderness of Gibeon. 25The Benjamites gathered behind Abner, became one band, and stood on a hilltop.</p>
<p>26He called to Joab,</p>
<p>“Will the sword devour forever? Don’t you know it will be bitter in the end? How long will you hold back from telling the people to quit chasing their brothers?</p>
<p>27Joab said,</p>
<p>“As God lives, if you hadn’t said something, the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.”</p>
<p>28Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the people quit chasing Israel and fighting. 29Abner and his men went through the Arabah all night, crossed the Jordan, and walked all morning to Mahanaim.”</p>
<p>30Joab came back from chasing Abner. When he’d gathered the people, 19 of David’s troops besides Asahel were missing. 31But David’s troops had struck down 360 of Benjamin and Abner’s men. 32They picked up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night till dawn in Hebron.	2 Sam 2:24-32</p>
<p>3:1A long war had gone on between Saul and David. David had grown stronger; Saul had grown weaker.</p>
<p>2David had six sons in Hebron: Amnon his oldest by Ahinoam of Jezreel, 3Chileab second by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel; Absalom third by Maacah Bat-Tahmai, king of Geshur; 4 Adonijah fourth by Haggith, Shephatiah fifth by Abital, 5and Ithream sixth by Eglah.</p>
<p>Abner Joins David</p>
<p>6During the war between Saul and David, Abner was making himself stronger in Saul’s house. 7Saul had a concubine named Rizpah Bat-Aiah. Ish-bosheth said, “Why have you had relations with my father’s concubine?” 8That made Abner mad,</p>
<p>“Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? I’ve been kind to your father’s family, to his brothers and friends, and haven’t delivered you to David. Yet you charge me with guilt over this woman. 9God do so to me and more if, since Yahveh has sworn to David, I don’t 10transfer the kingdom from Saul to David to rule Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.”</p>
<p>11He couldn’t talk to Abner anymore; he was afraid of him. 	2 Sam 3:1-11</p>
<p>12Abner sent messengers to David, “Who does the land belong to? Make a treaty with me, and I’ll bring Israel over to you.”</p>
<p>13He said, “Okay! I’ll make a treaty with you, but I demand one thing: you won’t see me unless you bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.” 14David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, “Give me my wife Michal that I was engaged to for 100 Philistine foreskins.” 15Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel Ben-Laish. 16But her husband went crying as he followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said, “Go back”; so he did.</p>
<p>17Abner contacted the elders in Israel,</p>
<p>“Before, you were looking for David to be your king. 18Now do it! Yahveh has said, ‘By my servant David I’ll save my people from the Philistines and their other enemies.’”</p>
<p>19Abner talked to the Benjamites and went to tell David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and the House of Benjamin.	2 Sam 3:12-19</p>
<p>20He and 20 men came to David in Hebron, and David held a feast for them. 21Abner said, “Let me gather Israel to you so you’ll rule everything you desire.” David sent him away on good terms.</p>
<p>Joab Murders Abner</p>
<p>22Some of David’s troops and Joab came from a raid and brought lots of spoil, but Abner wasn’t with David in Hebron, because he’d sent him away on good terms. 23When Joab and the part of the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner came to the king, and he sent him away on good terms.”</p>
<p>24Joab came to the king and said,</p>
<p>“What have you done? Abner came to you. Why send him away already? 25You ought to know he came to deceive you and to find out about your routine and what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>26When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah without David knowing it. 27When Abner came back to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to talk privately. He struck Abner in the stomach, and he died because he’d killed Joab’s brother Asahel. 28When David heard it, he said,</p>
<p>“In Yahveh’s presence, my kingdom and I are not guilty of Abner’s blood. 29May that fall on Joab and his father’s family. May every one of them have running sores or leprosy, use crutches, die by the sword, or go hungry.”</p>
<p>30Joab and Abishai killed Abner because he’d killed their brother Asahel in the skirmish at Gibeon.	2 Sam 3:20-30</p>
<p>31David told Joab and everybody there, “Tear your clothes and put on burlap; lament over Abner.” King David walked behind the bier. 32They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wailed at his grave and the people cried. 33He chanted a lament for Abner,</p>
<p>“Should Abner die like a fool?</p>
<p>34Your hands were not bound or your feet in stocks;</p>
<p>you’ve been murdered by wicked men.”</p>
<p>The people cried for him again. 35They came to persuade David to eat while it was still daylight, but David vowed, “God do so to me and more if I taste anything before sunset.” 36The people noticed, and it pleased them like everything he did. 37They and all Israel understood that it hadn’t been the king’s idea to kill Abner. 38He told his officials,</p>
<p>“Don’t you know that a prince, a great man, has fallen in Israel today? 39Even though I’m anointed as king, these sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. Yahveh repay the evildoer according to his evil deed!”	 2 Sam 3:31-39</p>
<p>Ish-Bosheth Murdered</p>
<p>4:1When Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and Israel lost courage too. 2Saul’s son had two men that were commanding raiding bands: Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon, a Benjamite from Beeroth (considered part of Benjamin). 3The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and still live there as foreigners.</p>
<p>4Jonathan had a son Mephibosheth that was lame in both feet. He was five when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried, he fell and became lame.	 2 Sam 4:1-4</p>
<p>5Baanah and Rechab left and arrived at Ish-bosheth’s house about noon while he was resting. 6LXX┌The doorkeeper had been cleaning wheat, but she got drowsy and nodded off. Rechab and Baanah slipped in,┐ 7struck him and killed him in bed, and cut off his head. They took his head and went by way of the Arabah all night. 8They brought it to David in Hebron, “Here’s the head of Ish-bosheth, who was trying to kill you. Yahveh has avenged you on Saul and his offspring today.” 9But David answered them,</p>
<p>“As sure as Yahveh lives who has redeemed me from every adversity, 10when a man told me Saul was dead and thought he was bringing me good news, I seized him and executed him at Ziklag. That’s the reward I gave him for his news! 11How much more when bad men kill a good man in his own house in bed! Won’t I require his blood from you now and destroy you from the earth?”</p>
<p>12David commanded his young men to kill them. They cut off their hands and feet, and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they buried Ish-bosheth’s head in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.</p>
<p>2 Sam 4:5-12</p>
<p>David Becomes King of Israel</p>
<p>5:1All the tribes came to David in Hebron and said,</p>
<p>“We’re your flesh and bones. 2When Saul was king, you were the one that led Israel out and back. Yahveh told you you’d shepherd his people.”</p>
<p>3Israel’s elders came, and King David made a treaty with them in Yahveh’s presence. They anointed him king over Israel. 4David was 30 and ruled for 40 years. 5He ruled Judah for 7½ years in Hebron and ruled Judah and Israel for 33 years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>David Conquers Jerusalem</p>
<p>6The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites. They told David. “You won’t get in here. The blind and lame will stop you.” They thought he couldn’t do it, 7but he captured the Zion fortress, The City of David. 8He said that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, reach ‘the lame and blind’ [that David hated] through the water tunnel.” That’s why people say,“‘The blind and lame’ won’t get into the house.” 9David lived in the fortress and named it The City of David [Ir-David]. He built all around from the Millo inward. 10He kept getting greater because Yahveh God of Hosts was with him. 	2 Sam 5:1-10</p>
<p>11Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons to build him a palace. 12He realized that Yahveh had established him as king and that he’d honored his kingdom for Israel’s sake.</p>
<p>13Meantime, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and had more sons and daughters. 14The ones born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 15Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 16Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p>2 Sam 5:11-16</p>
<p>David Defeats the Philistines</p>
<p>17When the Philistines heard they’d anointed David king over Israel, they went up to look for him.  He heard about it and went down to the fortress. 18The Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19David asked Yahveh, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>20He went to Baal-perazim and defeated them, “‘Yahveh has broken through’ my enemies like a flash flood”; so he named the place Baal-perazim. 21The Philistines abandoned their idols; David and his men carried them away.</p>
<p>22The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23When David asked Yahveh, he said,</p>
<p>“Don’t go up directly. Circle around behind them and come at them by the balsam trees. 24When you hear marching in the balsam treetops, act immediately. I will have gone out ahead of you to strike them.”</p>
<p>25David did that and struck them down from Geba to Gezer.	 2 Sam 5:17-25</p>
<p>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</p>
<p>6:1David gathered elite troops from Israel again, 30,000. 2He and the troops went to Baale-judah to bring up God’s Ark called The Name: Yahveh of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. 3They placed the Ark on a new cart to bring it from Abinadab’s house that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, 4were bringing the Ark on the cart; Ahio was walking ahead of it. 5Meanwhile, David and the House of Israel were celebrating enthusiastically in Yahveh’s presence with all kinds of instruments made out of fir: lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.</p>
<p>6But when they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah grabbed the Ark because the oxen nearly upset it. 7Yahveh lashed out and struck him down for his disrespect. He died there by the Ark. 8David was mad because Yahveh had “lashed out against Uzzah.” The place is still called Perez-uzzah. 9David was afraid of Yahveh that day, “How can the Ark come to me?” 10He wasn’t willing to take it to The City of David. He took it aside to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. 11It stayed there three months, and Yahveh blessed him and his family.  	   2 Sam 6:1-11</p>
<p>12King David heard that Yahveh had blessed Obed-edom’s house and everything he had because of the Ark, so he brought it to The City of David with celebration. 13When the ones carrying the Ark had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a grain-fed calf. 14He was dancing in Yahveh’s presence with all his energy, wearing a linen ephod. 15He and the House of Israel were bringing up the Ark with shouting and the sound of rams’ horns. 16As it came into the city, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window and saw him leaping and dancing, and she despised him. 17They brought the Ark and set it in its place inside the tent David pitched for it, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 18When he’d finished offering them, he blessed the people in the name of Yahveh of hosts. 19He passed a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to every man and woman in the crowd. Then everybody went home.</p>
<p>2 Sam 6:12-19</p>
<p>20When David went back to bless his household, Michal came out,</p>
<p>“How Israel’s king distinguished himself today, exposing himself in front of his servant girls like a shameless fool!”</p>
<p>21He told her,</p>
<p>“I celebrated in front of Yahveh, who chose me over your father and his family, and appointed me to rule his people. 22I’ll be even less dignified than this and humble in my own eyes, but I’ll be respected by the servant girls you’ve mentioned.”</p>
<p>23Michal didn’t have any children the rest of her life.	 2 Sam 6:20-23</p>
<p>God’s Promise to David</p>
<p>7:1The king was living in his palace, and Yahveh had given him rest from his enemies. 2He told Nathan the prophet, “I live in a cedar palace, but God’s Ark sits in tent curtains.”</p>
<p>3Nathan said, “Do everything you’re thinking; Yahveh’s with you.”</p>
<p>4But that night a message from Yahveh came to him,</p>
<p>5“Go tell my servant David, ‘Yahveh says, “Are you the one that should build me a temple? 6I haven’t lived in a temple since I brought Israel out of Egypt. I’ve moved around in a tent, a Tabernacle.  7Wherever I’ve gone with Israel, did I ever say to any judge that I commanded to shepherd my people, ‘Why haven’t you built me a cedar temple?’”’</p>
<p>8“Tell David, ‘I took you out of the pasture from following sheep, to make you ruler over Israel. 9I’ve been with you wherever you’ve gone and got rid of your enemies. I’ll make you as famous as anyone that’s ever lived in the world. 10I’ll appoint a place to plant my people so they can live there undisturbed, and sinful people won’t oppress them anymore. 11Like when I appointed judges over them, I’ll give you rest from your enemies.’</p>
<p>“Yahveh also says he’ll make a dynasty from you. 12-13‘When you die, I’ll raise up your descendant and establish his kingdom permanently.  13He’ll build me a temple. 14I’ll be his father, and he’ll be my son. When he sins, I’ll correct him with rods like people do. 15But my enduring love won’t leave him like it did Saul, that I removed before you. 16Your family and kingdom will endure. I’ll establish your dynasty permanently.’”	 2 Sam 7:1-16</p>
<p>17Nathan told David those things about the vision.</p>
<p>David’s Prayer</p>
<p>18David went in and sat in Yahveh’s presence,</p>
<p>“Who am I, Lord Yahveh, and what’s my family that you’ve brought me this far? 19Yet it wasn’t a great thing to you, because you’ve also talked about my family far into the future according to human custom. 20What more can I tell you? You know me, Lord Yahveh! 21For your word and according to your heart, you’ve shown how great you are in letting me know. 22That’s why you’re great. There’s nobody like you, no God besides you that we’ve heard of. 23What nation is like Israel that you went to redeem for yourself, to make a name for yourself, to do a great thing for yourself and awesome things for your land, in front of the people you’ve redeemed from Egypt, from nations and their gods? 24You’ve established your people forever and become their God. 25So confirm forever what you’ve said about me and my family. Do it 26so you can be honored forever by saying, ‘Yahveh of Hosts is Israel’s God.’ 27You’ve revealed to me that you’ll build me into a dynasty; so I’ve found the courage to offer this prayer.  28You’re God, your words are true, your promise is good. 29Bless my family so it can continue permanently like you’ve said.” 		    2 Sam 7:17-29</p>
<p>David’s Victories</p>
<p>8:1After that, David defeated the Philistines and took Methegammah.</p>
<p>2He defeated Moab and counted them off in lines and made them lie down on the ground. Two lines he counted off to be put to death, and one line he let live. The Moabites served him and brought tribute.</p>
<p>3David also defeated Hadadezer Ben-Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the Euphrates River. 4He took 1,700 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. He hamstrung the chariot horses but left enough for 100 chariots.</p>
<p>5When the Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them 6and put garrisons around Damascus, the Aramean capital. The Arameans served him and paid tribute money. 7The gold shields that Hadadezer’s officers carried, he took to Jerusalem. 8He took a large store of bronze from Betah and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer.</p>
<p>2 Sam 8:1-8</p>
<p>9Toi/Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s whole army. 10He sent his son Joram to greet him and congratulate him. Hadadezer had fought several wars with Toi/Tou. Joram brought articles made out of silver, gold, and bronze. 11David dedicated them to Yahveh together with the silver and gold from the nations he subdued: 12Aram, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, along with the spoils from Hadadezer.</p>
<p>13David’s reputation kept growing. When he came back, he killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 14He put garrisons all over Edom, and the Edomites served him. Yahveh gave him victory wherever he went.</p>
<p>David’s Officials</p>
<p>15David ruled Israel and administered justice fairly to his people.</p>
<p>16Joab Ben-Zeruiah was general over the army;</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat Ben-Ahilud was recorder;</p>
<p>17Zadok Ben-Ahitub and Ahimelech Ben-Abiathar were priests;</p>
<p>Seraiah was secretary;</p>
<p>18Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada was captain of David’s bodyguard;</p>
<p>David’s sons were chief administrators. 	2 Sam 8:9-18</p>
<p>David’s Kindness to Mephibosheth</p>
<p>9:1Then David asked if anybody was left from Saul’s house that he could show kindness out of regard for Jonathan. 2There was a servant named Ziba. They called him to David, and the king said, “You are Ziba?”</p>
<p>“I’m your servant.”</p>
<p>3“Is anybody left in Saul’s family I can show God’s kindness?”</p>
<p>“There’s still a son of Jonathan that’s crippled in both feet.”</p>
<p>4“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“In the house of Machir Ben-Ammiel in Lo-debar.”</p>
<p>5David had him brought in. 6He came and prostrated himself.</p>
<p>David said, “Mephibosheth, 7you don’t have to be afraid. I’ll treat you well out of regard for your father Jonathan, and give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul; you’ll eat at my table regularly.”       	2 Sam 9:1-7</p>
<p>8Again he prostrated himself and said, “What am I that you should care about a dead dog like me?”</p>
<p>9The king called Ziba,</p>
<p>“I’ve given your master’s grandson what belonged to Saul and his family. 10You, your sons, and servants can cultivate his land for him and bring in the crops and produce so he has food, but he’ll eat regularly at my table.”</p>
<p>Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants. 11-13He told the king he’d do it. Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at David’s table like one of his sons. (Mephibosheth had a young son Mica.) Everybody in Ziba’s family was Mephibosheth’s servant. 		2 Sam 9:8-13</p>
<p>David Defeats the Ammonites</p>
<p>10:1The king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king. 2David said, “I’ll be kind to Hanun Ben-Nahash like his father was kind to me.” David sent some ambassadors to console him about his father. But when they got there, 3the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent consolers? Hasn’t he sent them to look over the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?” 4Hanun took David’s ambassadors and shaved off half their beards, cut off their cloaks as high as their hips, and sent them away. 5When David found out, he sent to meet them because they were really humiliated. He told them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew, and then come back.</p>
<p>6When the Ammonites saw they’d become repugnant to David, they hired the Arameans from Beth-rehob and Zobah with 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men. 7David heard about it, and sent Joab and the whole army, the powerful men. 8The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.	 2 Sam 10:1-8</p>
<p>9When Joab saw he’d have to fight in front and in back, he selected elite men from Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. 10The rest he put under the command of his brother Abishai against the Ammonites,</p>
<p>11“If the Arameans are too strong for me, come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll come help you. 12Let’s be strong and courageous for our people and the towns of our God. May Yahveh do what seems good to him.”</p>
<p>13Joab and his people advanced against the Arameans, and they ran. 14When the Ammonites saw them flee, they retreated into the city. Then Joab came back from fighting Ammon’s descendants and went to Jerusalem. 	2 Sam 10:9-14</p>
<p>15When the Arameans saw that Israel had defeated them, they gathered together. 16Hadadezer brought out the Arameans beyond the River and came to Helam. Shobach, commander of Hadadezer’s army, led them. 17David found out and gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan to Helam. The Arameans put themselves in battle formation, 18but they fled from Israel. David killed 700 charioteers, 40,000 cavalry, and struck down Shobach; he died there. 19When the kings, Hadadezer’s allies, saw Israel had defeated them, they surrendered and served Israel. The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.  	2 Sam 10:15-19</p>
<p>David and Bathsheba</p>
<p>11:1In the spring when kings normally go to war, David sent Joab and Israel’s army to fight the Ammonites and lay siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2When evening came, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman taking a bath; she was beautiful. 3David sent and asked about her. Someone said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba Bat-Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 4David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he slept with her. When she’d purified herself, she went home. 5She got pregnant and sent and told David.   	   2 Sam 11:1-5</p>
<p>6He sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” 7When he came, David asked how Joab and the people were doing and how the war was going. 8Then he told him, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” He left the king’s palace, and a present was sent after him. 9But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s palace with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home. 10When they told David, “Uriah didn’t go home,” he asked Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go home?”</p>
<p>11He said,</p>
<p>“The Ark, Israel, and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my commander Joab and his troops are camping in the open field. Would I go eat and drink and be with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>12David told him, “Stay here today; I’ll let you go tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13David called him; he ate and drank with him and got him drunk. In the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home.	 2 Sam 11:6-13</p>
<p>14In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah, 15“Put Uriah in the front of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him so he can be struck down.” 16As Joab kept watch on the city, he put Uriah where he knew there were trained soldiers. 17Men came out of the city to fight, and some of David’s soldiers fell, including Uriah. 18Joab sent a report to David about the war 19and charged the messenger,</p>
<p>“When you’ve told the king everything, 20if he’s angry and says, ‘Why get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they’d shoot from the wall? 21Who struck down Abimelech Ben-Jerubbesheth? Wasn’t it a woman that threw an upper millstone on him from the wall and he died at Thebez? Why get so close to the wall?’—then say, ‘Uriah the Hittite is dead too.’”</p>
<p>22The messenger reported,</p>
<p>23“The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them up to the entrance of the gate. 24The archers shot from the wall and killed some of your soldiers, including Uriah.”</p>
<p>25David said,</p>
<p>“Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this get you down. The sword takes one as well as another. Intensify your battle against the city and overthrow it.’ Encourage him that way.”</p>
<p>26When Uriah’s wife heard he was dead, she mourned for him. 27When the time for mourning ended, David had her brought to his house; she became his wife and had a son. But what David had done Yahveh considered evil.	  2 Sam 11:14-27</p>
<p>Nathan Rebukes David</p>
<p>12:1Then Yahveh sent Nathan to David to say,</p>
<p>“Two men were in a town, one rich, the other poor. 2The rich man had lots of flocks and herds, 3but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb that he’d bought and raised. It grew up with him and his children; it used to eat his bread and drink from his cup and lie in his lap; it was like a daughter to him. 4A traveler came to the rich man, and he wasn’t willing to take one of his own flock or herd to fix a meal for him. He took the poor man’s lamb and fixed it.”</p>
<p>David was mad and swore to Nathan, “As sure as Yahveh lives, that man deserves to die. 6He’ll restore the lamb fourfold because he did that without mercy.”	 2 Sam 12:1-6</p>
<p>7Nathan told David,</p>
<p>“You’re that man.</p>
<p>“This is what Yahveh God of Israel, says, ‘I anointed you king, and delivered you from Saul. 8I gave you your master’s family, his wives, and Israel and Judah. If that wasn’t enough, I would have doubled it. 9Why have you despised my message and done what I consider evil? You’ve killed Uriah with the Ammonites’ sword and took his wife to be your wife. 10The sword will never leave your family because you’ve despised me by taking her. 11I’ll raise up evil against you in your own family. I’ll take your wives in your presence and give them to your neighbor. He’ll lie with them in broad daylight. 12You did it secretly, but I’ll do it in front of all Israel right out in the sun.’”</p>
<p>13David said, “I’ve sinned against Yahveh.”</p>
<p>Nathan said, “Yahveh has set your sin aside; you won’t die. 14But by doing this, you’ve completely scorned him. The child will die.”</p>
<p>15Nathan left.	 2 Sam 12:7-15a</p>
<p>Yahveh struck the child, and it got sick. 16David asked God for the child and fasted. He went in and lay all night on the floor. 17The elders in his palace stood beside him, trying to get him up off the floor. But he wouldn’t get up and didn’t eat with them. 18The seventh day, the baby died. David’s advisors were afraid to tell him. They said, “While the child was still alive, we talked to him, and he didn’t listen. How can we tell him the child has died? He may harm himself.” 19But when he saw them whispering, he sensed that the child had died, “Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>20Then David got up off the floor, took a bath, anointed himself, and changed clothes. He went to Yahveh’s Tabernacle and worshiped and went home. When he asked, they gave him some food and he ate. 21His advisors said, “What have you done? You fasted and cried about the child while he was alive; but when he died, you got up and ate.”</p>
<p>22He said,</p>
<p>“While he was still alive, I fasted and cried because I didn’t know if Yahveh would be gracious to me and let it live. 23But now that he’s dead, why fast? Can I bring him back? He won’t come back to me, but I’ll go to him.”</p>
<p>24Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and had relations with her. She had a son he named Solomon. Yahveh loved him 25and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah [Beloved of Yah] for Yahveh’s sake.         	2 Sam 12:15b-25</p>
<p>26Joab fought the Ammonites in Rabbah and captured the royal city. 27He sent messengers to David,</p>
<p>“I’ve attacked Rabbah and seized the city’s water supply. 28Gather the rest of the army and capture the city so I won’t, and people name it after me.”</p>
<p>29David gathered the rest of the army, went to Rabbah, and captured it. 30He took their king’s crown off his head. It weighed 75½ lbs one talent of gold and was set with precious stones. They put it on David’s head. He brought large amounts of spoil out of the city. 31He also brought out its people, and put them under saws, iron picks and axes; and made them pass through the brick kilns. That’s what he did to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the whole army went back to Jerusalem.	 									  2 Sam 12:26-31</p>
<p>Amnon and Tamar</p>
<p>13:1David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David’s son Ammon was in love with her. 2Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister that he made himself ill, because she was a virgin and it seemed hard to do anything to her. 3But Amnon had a friend Jonadab Ben-Shimeah, David’s brother, and Jonadab was a shrewd fellow.</p>
<p>4He said to him, “Son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?</p>
<p>Amnon said, “I’m in love with Tamar, the sister of my half-brother Absalom.”</p>
<p>5Jonadab said, “Lie down on your bed and act like you’re sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister come and give me something to eat, and let her fix the food so I can see it and she can hand it to me.’</p>
<p>6Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king went to see him, Amnon said, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple cakes.”	 2 Sam 13:1-6</p>
<p>7David sent for Tamar, and said, “Go to your brother Amnon’s house and fix him some food.” 8So Tamar went to his house, and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes while he watched, and baked the cakes. 9She took the pan and dished them out for him, but he refused to eat. He said, “Have everybody leave me.” So everybody left.</p>
<p>10Amnon said, “Bring the food into the bedroom so you can give it to me to eat.”</p>
<p>Tamar took the cakes and brought them into his bedroom.</p>
<p>11When she brought them to him, he took hold of her and said, “Come, lie with me.”</p>
<p>12She answered him,</p>
<p>“No, don’t violate me! Such a thing is not done in Israel. Don’t do this awful thing! 13Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And you’ll be like one of the fools in Israel. Please speak to the king. He won’t withhold me from you.”</p>
<p>14But he wouldn’t listen to her. Since he was stronger than she was, he violated her and lay with her.	 2 Sam 13:7-14</p>
<p>15Then Amnon hated her more than he’d loved her. He told her, “Get up, go away!”</p>
<p>16She told him, “No! Sending me away is worse than the other sin you’ve done to me!”</p>
<p>But he wouldn’t listen to her. 17He called the young man that attended him and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door behind her.” 18She was wearing a long-sleeved robe, because that’s the way the king’s virgin daughters dressed in robes. His attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. 19Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment. She put her hand on her head and went away, wailing as she went.</p>
<p>20Then Absalom asked her, “Has Amnon been with you? Keep quiet for now, my sister, he’s your brother. Don’t take this matter to heart.” Tamar stayed as a desolate woman in her brother’s house. 21When King David heard about this, he was angry. 22Absalom wouldn’t speak to Amnon because of what he’d done to his sister.	  2 Sam 13:15-22</p>
<p>Absalom Kills Amnon</p>
<p>23Two years later Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor near Ephraim and invited all the royal sons. 24He went to the king and said, “I have sheep-shearers. You and your officials go with me.”</p>
<p>25“No, son, we shouldn’t all go. We’d be a burden to you.”</p>
<p>26“If not, let my half-brother Amnon go with us.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>27But when Absalom kept urging him, he let Amnon and the king’s sons go with him.</p>
<p>28Absalom told his men,</p>
<p>“When Amnon is half drunk with wine and I say, ‘Strike him down,’ put him to death. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous and brave.”</p>
<p>29 Absalom’s men did what he said, and the king’s sons got on their mules and fled.</p>
<p>2 Sam 13:23-29</p>
<p>30While they were on their way, the report came to David, “Absalom struck down your sons; there’s not a one left.” 31The king got up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. His servants stood by him with torn clothes. 32Jonadab, son of David’s brother Shimeah, answered,</p>
<p>“Don’t suppose they’ve killed all your sons—just Amnon. Absalom has intended to do that ever since Ammon violated his sister Tamar.” [33]</p>
<p>34Absalom had fled. The young man that was the watchman looked up and saw many people coming from the road behind him beside the mountain. 35Jonadab told the king, “Your sons are here. It’s what I said would happen.” 36As soon as he’d finished talking, the king’s sons came and cried out loud. The king and his servants also cried bitterly.</p>
<p>37-38Absalom fled to Talmai Ben-Ammihud, king of Geshur, for 3 years. David mourned for him every day. 39He really wanted to go out to Absalom, because he was at peace over Amnon, since he was dead. 	2 Sam 13:30-39</p>
<p>Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</p>
<p>14:1Joab sensed that the king yearned for Absalom. 2So he sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman, and told her,</p>
<p>“Act like you’re in mourning. Put on mourning clothes, don’t anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman that’s been mourning for the dead for many days. 3Then go to the king and say such and such.”</p>
<p>4When she spoke to the king, she fell on her face and said, “Help me, my king.”</p>
<p>5“What’s your trouble?”</p>
<p>“I’m a widow; my husband’s dead. 6I had two sons, but they quarreled in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. 7Now the whole family has risen up and told me to hand over the one that struck his brother so they can put him to death for the life of his brother, and destroy the heir too. They’ll put out my ember that’s left and won’t leave my husband a name or a remnant.”</p>
<p>8“Go on home. I’ll give orders about you.” 	2 Sam 14:1-8</p>
<p>9The woman said, “My lord, the sin is on me and my father’s family. You and your throne are innocent.”</p>
<p>10He said, “Bring me whoever says anything. He won’t bother you again.”</p>
<p>11She said, “Invoke Yahveh your God so the avenger won’t destroy my son.”</p>
<p>“As sure as Yahveh lives, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground.” 	2 Sam 14:9-11</p>
<p>12Then she said, “Let me say something.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>13“Why plan such a thing then against God’s people? In saying this, you’ve convicted yourself for not bringing back the one you’ve banished. 14We’ll die like water spilled on the ground that can’t be retrieved. Yet God doesn’t take away life but plans ways to bring back the one he banishes. 15I’ve come to you because the people have made me afraid. I thought, ‘I’ll speak to the king. Maybe he’ll do what I ask. 16He’ll deliver me from the man that would destroy me and my son from God’s inheritance.’ 17Then I thought, ‘My lord’s word will comfort me, because he’s like an angel of God in discerning good and bad.’ Yahveh your God be with you.”</p>
<p>18He answered, “Don’t hide anything I’m about to ask you. 19Is Joab involved in this with you?”</p>
<p>“As sure as you’re alive, nobody can stray away from anything you’ve said. Joab told me to say that. 20He did it to change how things are going. But you are wise, like an angel of God. You know what’s going on in the world.”</p>
<p>21The king told Joab, “I’ll do it. Bring him back.”</p>
<p>22Joab fell on his face and blessed him. “I know you’re pleased with me today. You’ve done what I asked.”</p>
<p>23Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24But the king said, “Have him come back to his own house without seeing me.” He came back without seeing David.</p>
<p>2 Sam 14:12-24</p>
<p>25In all Israel there wasn’t anybody as handsome as Absalom—so highly praised. There wasn’t a flaw in him from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot. 26When he cut his hair (at the end of every year because it was so thick), he weighed it at 5 lbs 200 shekels, royal standard. 27He had three sons and one daughter, Tamar, a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>28Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king. 29Then he sent for Joab so he could send him to the king, but Joab wouldn’t come. He sent again and he wouldn’t come. 30Absalom told his servants, “Joab’s barley field is next to mine. Set it on fire.”</p>
<p>31Joab went to Absalom’s house and asked, “Why did your servants burn my field?”</p>
<p>32“I sent for you so I could send you to ask the king why I’ve come back from Geshur. It’d be better for me to still be there. Let me see him. If I’ve sinned, he can put me to death.”</p>
<p>33When Joab went to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. He came and prostrated himself, and the king kissed him.	 2 Sam 14:25-33</p>
<p>Absalom’s Conspiracy</p>
<p>15:1After that, Absalom provided himself a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run ahead of him. 2He’d get up early and stand by the road to the gate. When anybody had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say,</p>
<p>“What city are you from?”</p>
<p>He’d say, “I’m from a tribe in Israel.”</p>
<p>3Then Absalom would say,</p>
<p>“Your claims are right, but everybody with the king is ignoring you. 4If only somebody would appoint me judge in the land, everyone that has a suit could come to me for justice.”</p>
<p>5When somebody came near to prostrate himself before him, he’d put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 6That’s how he dealt with everyone in Israel that came to the king for judgment. He stole away the hearts of Israel. 	2 Sam 15:1-6</p>
<p>7At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king,</p>
<p>“Let me go pay the vow I made to Yahveh in Hebron. 8I took a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram that if Yahveh brought me back to Jerusalem, I’d serve him.”</p>
<p>9“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>He went to Hebron. 10But he sent spies throughout the tribes and said, “As soon as you hear the ram’s horn, say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’” 11Then 200 men went with him from Jerusalem. They went innocently, not knowing what was going on. 12Absalom sent for Ahithophel, David’s advisor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. The conspiracy was growing strong; the people continually increased with Absalom.</p>
<p>David Flees</p>
<p>13Then a messenger came to David, “The hearts of Israel are with Absalom.”</p>
<p>14David told his aides in Jerusalem, “Let’s flee. Otherwise, none of us will escape from him. Hurry so he won’t overtake us right away, bring down catastrophe on us, and strike the city with the sword.”</p>
<p>15The king’s aides told him, “We’re ready to do whatever you decide.”  	2 Sam 15:7-15</p>
<p>16So he and his whole house left except for 10 concubines to take care of the palace. 17He and the people with him went out and stopped at the last house. 18His aides passed on beside him, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and the men of Gath. The 600 men that had come with him from Gath passed on ahead of him.</p>
<p>19The king said to Ittai of Gath,</p>
<p>“Why go with us? Go back to King Absalom. You’re a foreigner and an exile; go back to your own place. 20You just came yesterday; will I make you wander with us today while I don’t know where I’m going? Go back and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”</p>
<p>21But Ittai answered, “As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, I’ll be wherever you are, for life or death.”</p>
<p>22David said, “Go on across.”</p>
<p>So Ittai crossed with his people and little ones. 23While the whole country cried out loud, the people passed over. The king and the people crossed the Kidron toward the countryside.</p>
<p>2 Sam 15:16-23</p>
<p>24Zadok and the Levites with him came carrying the Ark of the covenant. They set it down, and Abiathar came up till the people had finished leaving the city. 25The king told Zadok,</p>
<p>“Take the Ark back to the city. If I’m pleasing to Yahveh, he’ll bring me back, and show me it and his dwelling place. 26But if he doesn’t delight in me, here I am. Let him do to me what seems good to him.”</p>
<p>27He also said to Zadok,</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, you and your two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan Ben-Abiathar. 28I’ll wait at the fords in the open country till you send me word.”</p>
<p>29Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark back to Jerusalem and stayed there. 	2 Sam 15:24-29</p>
<p>30David went up the Mount of Olives and cried as he went. He covered his head and walked barefoot. Then the people that were with him covered their heads and went up crying as they went. 31Someone told David, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”</p>
<p>David said, “Yahveh, turn Ahithophel’s advice into foolishness.” 32As David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head. 33David told him,</p>
<p>“If you pass over with me, you’ll be a burden to me. 34But if you go back to the city and tell Absalom, ‘I’ll serve you, king, like I served your father,’ you can thwart Ahithophel’s advice for me. 35Whatever you hear from the king’s palace, report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36Their two sons are with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Use them to send me everything you hear.”</p>
<p>37Hushai, David’s personal advisor, went into the city as Absalom got to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2 Sam 15:30-37</p>
<p>David and Ziba</p>
<p>16:1When David had gone a little past the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth’s steward, met him with a couple saddled donkeys. They were carrying 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 summer fruits, and a skin of wine.</p>
<p>2The king asked, “Why do you have these?”</p>
<p>“The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride. The bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for anybody to drink that’s become exhausted in the country.”</p>
<p>3“Where’s Mephibosheth?”</p>
<p>“In Jerusalem; he said Israel would restore his father’s kingdom to him today.”</p>
<p>4He told Ziba, “You can have everything Mephibosheth owns.”</p>
<p>“My lord the king, I prostrate myself. Thanks for being gracious to me.”	 2 Sam 16:1-4</p>
<p>Shimei Curses David</p>
<p>5When David got to Bahurim, Shimei Ben-Gera, a man from Saul’s family, came out cursing 6and throwing stones at David and his aides.  The troops and bodyguard were all around him. 7He cursed,</p>
<p>“Get out of here, you bloody, worthless fellow! 8Yahveh has brought back on you the bloodshed of Saul’s family in whose place you’ve ruled. He’s given the kingdom to Absalom. You’re caught in your own evil; you’re a murderer.”</p>
<p>9Abishai asked the king, “Why should this dead dog curse you? Let me go over and cut off his head.”</p>
<p>10“What do I have to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? If Yahveh has told him to curse me, why interfere?’”</p>
<p>11Then David told Abishai and his aides,</p>
<p>“My own son wants to kill me. How much more this Benjamite! Let him curse; Yahveh has told him to. Maybe Yahveh will regard my suffering and return me good for his cursing.”</p>
<p>13David and his men followed the road. Shimei went along on the hillside parallel to him, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at him. 14The king and the people with him arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.	 2 Sam 16:5-14</p>
<p>The Advice of Hushai and Ahithophel</p>
<p>15Then Absalom, Ahithophel, and the men of Israel went to Jerusalem. 16Hushai the Archite, David’s personal advisor, went to Absalom and said, “Long live the king!”</p>
<p>17“Is this loyalty to your friend? Why didn’t you go with him?”</p>
<p>18“I’m for the one Yahveh and his people have chosen. 19Besides, shouldn’t I serve in your presence as I’ve served in your father’s presence?</p>
<p>20Absalom asked Ahithophel, “What’s your advice?”</p>
<p>21Ahithophel said,</p>
<p>“Have relations with your father’s concubines that he left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you’ve made yourself repugnant to your father beyond reconciliation. That will encourage everybody that’s with you to strengthen their support for you.”</p>
<p>22They pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he had relations with his father’s concubines right out in the open for all Israel to see. 23By both David and Absalom, Ahithophel’s advice in those days was considered the same as inquiring from God’s oracle.	 2 Sam 16:15-23</p>
<p>17:1In addition, Ahithophel told Absalom,</p>
<p>“Let me choose 12,000 men to pursue David tonight. 2I’ll attack him while he’s exhausted and terrify him. The people with him will run. I’ll only strike down the king 3and bring the people back to you. Everybody’s return depends on the man you’re looking for. Then the people will be at peace.”</p>
<p>4The plan pleased Absalom and Israel’s elders.</p>
<p>5Then Absalom said, “Call Hushai. Let’s hear what he has to say.” 6When Hushai came, Absalom said, “</p>
<p>That’s what Ahithophel said. Should we do it? If not, tell us what you think.”</p>
<p>7Hushai said,</p>
<p>“That’s not a good idea. 8Your father and his men are strong warriors, as fierce as a bear robbed of her cubs out in the open. He’s an expert in warfare. He won’t spend the night with the people. 9He’s probably already hid in a cave or someplace. When he falls on your men in the first attack, whoever hears about it will say he’s slaughtered your followers. 10Even a man with a lion’s heart will completely lose heart. All Israel knows your father is a strong warrior, and everybody with him is brave. 11I advise you to gather Israel from Dan to Beersheba, like sand by the sea, and go personally into battle. 12We’ll come to him in a place where he can be found. We’ll descend on him like dew on the ground and not leave a man with him. 13If he withdraws into a city, Israel will bring ropes and drag it into the valley till there’s not a small stone left there.”</p>
<p>2 Sam 17:1-13</p>
<p>14Absalom and the men of Israel said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” That happened because Yahveh had ordained to thwart Ahithophel’s good advice so Yahveh could bring catastrophe on Absalom.</p>
<p>15Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar the priests,</p>
<p>“This is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and Israel’s elders to do, and this is what I’ve advised. 16Quick, send and tell David not to spend the night at the fords in the open country; he needs to cross over so he and his people won’t get destroyed.” 	2 Sam 17:14- 16</p>
<p>17Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel. A servant girl would go tell them, and they’d tell David, because it was dangerous for them to be seen going into the city. 18But a lad did see them and told Absalom. Jonathan and Ahimaaz left in a hurry and came to the house of a man in Bahurim that had a well in his courtyard, and they got down into it. 19The man’s wife had covered the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it so you couldn’t tell it was there. 20Absalom’s men came to her at the house, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” She said, “They’ve crossed the river.” When they searched and couldn’t find them, they went back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2 Sam 17:17-20</p>
<p>21After they left, the men came up out of the well and went to tell David. “Quick, get up and cross the water because Ahithophel has advised against you.” 22David and every person with him crossed the Jordan by sunup. 23When Ahithophel saw that Absalom hadn’t followed his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his town. He set his house in order and hanged himself. They buried him in his father’s grave.</p>
<p>24David went to Mahanaim. Absalom and his men crossed the Jordan. 25Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was Joab’s cousin and son of Jithra the Israelite, who’d married Abigail Bat-Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 26Israel and Absalom camped in Gilead.</p>
<p>27When David got to Mahanaim, Shobi Ben-Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir Ben-Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim, 28brought David and the ones with him sleeping mats, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, 29honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd. They said, “The people are surely hungry, exhausted, and thirsty here in the countryside.”     	  2 Sam 17:21-29</p>
<p>The Death of Absalom</p>
<p>18:1Then David counted his people and set over them commanders of thousands and hundreds. 2He sent out the troops, a third each under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He told them, “I’ll go out with you too.”</p>
<p>3They said,</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t go out. If we flee, they won’t care even if half of us die. You’re worth 10,000 of us. It’s better for you to be ready to help us from town.”</p>
<p>4He said, “I’ll do what you think’s best.” He stood beside the gate, and the troops went out by hundreds and thousands. 5He charged Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.” The troops heard it.</p>
<p>6The troops went out, and the battle took place in the Forest of Ephraim. 7David’s men defeated the people of Israel with a great slaughter—20,000 men. 8The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and more people died because of the forest than died from the sword.</p>
<p>2 Sam 18:1-8</p>
<p>9Absalom happened to meet some of David’s men. He was trying to escape on his mule, and it went under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree. His hair got tangled up in them and left him hanging as the mule kept going. 10One fellow told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging from a terebinth tree.”</p>
<p>11Joab said, “You saw him! Why didn’t you strike him to the ground? I would’ve given you 10 pieces of silver and a belt.”</p>
<p>12The man said,</p>
<p>“Even if you’d given me 1,000, I wouldn’t have attacked the king’s son. He charged you, Abishai, and Ittai for his sake to protect young Absalom! 13Otherwise, if I’d have dealt deviously with him (and there’s nothing hidden from the king), you wouldn’t have gotten involved.”</p>
<p>14Joab said, “I’m not wasting time here with you.” He took three spears and thrust them through Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the tree. 15Ten young men that carried Joab’s armor gathered around Absalom and killed him.	 2 Sam 18:9-15</p>
<p>16Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his troops came back from chasing Israel. 17They threw Absalom in a deep pit in the forest and piled a big mound of rocks over him. Israel fled home. 18Absalom had set up a marker in the King’s Valley. He said, “I don’t have a son to carry on my name.” So he named the marker after himself; it’s still called Absalom’s Monument.</p>
<p>David Mourns Absalom’s Death</p>
<p>19Then Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the news that Yahveh has freed him from his enemies.”</p>
<p>20Joab told him, “You’re not the one to carry news today. You’ll carry it another day. The king’s son is dead.”</p>
<p>21Joab told the Nubian, “Go tell him what you’ve seen.” He bowed to Joab and ran.</p>
<p>22Ahimaaz said again, “Whatever happens, let me run too.”</p>
<p>Joab said, “Why would you run, son, since you won’t get anything for it?”</p>
<p>23“Whatever happens, I’ll run.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”	 2 Sam 18:16-23a</p>
<p>Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Nubian. 24David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town. The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and saw a man running by himself. 25He called it out to the king.</p>
<p>He said, “If he’s by himself, he has good news.”</p>
<p>He came closer and closer. 26Then the watchman saw another man running. He called to the gatekeeper, “There’s another man running by himself.”</p>
<p>The king said, “That one is bringing good news too.”</p>
<p>27The watchman said, “The first runner looks like Ahimaaz.”</p>
<p>The king said, “He’s a good man, bringing good news.”</p>
<p>28Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All’s well.” He prostrated himself to the king. “Blessed is Yahveh your God, who has delivered up the rebels.”</p>
<p>29“Is Absalom all right?”</p>
<p>Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and me, I saw a big great disturbance, but I didn’t know what was going on.”	 2 Sam 18:23b-29</p>
<p>30The king said, “Come over and stand here.”</p>
<p>31The Nubian arrived and said, “Receive good news. Yahveh has freed you today from your attackers.”</p>
<p>32“Is Absalom all right?”</p>
<p>The Nubian answered, “Let everyone who opposes you be like that young man!”</p>
<p>33The king was deeply moved and went up to the room above the gate and cried. He said as he walked, “Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! Oh that I’d have died instead of you, Absalom! My son! My son!” 	2 Sam 18:30-33</p>
<p>19:1Then Joab heard, “The king is crying and mourning for Absalom.” 2The victory that day turned into mourning because those who heard about it said, “The king is grieving for his son.” 3So the people slipped into the city like humiliated people sneak away from battle. 4The king covered his face and cried out, “Absalom! My son! My son!”</p>
<p>5Then Joab went into the house and told the king,</p>
<p>“You’ve shamed your men today. They’ve saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives and concubines. 6By loving the ones that hate you and hating the ones that love you, you’ve shown that officers and troops don’t mean anything to you. If Absalom was alive and all of us dead, you’d be pleased. 7Get up; go speak graciously to them. I swear by Yahveh, if you don’t, not a man will spend the night with you. This will be worse than all the bad things that have come on you since you were young.” 	2 Sam 19:1-7</p>
<p>8The king got up and sat in the gate. When they told the people, “The king is sitting in the gate,” they went to him.</p>
<p>The Israelites that followed Absalom had fled home, 9and the people were quarreling throughout the tribes,</p>
<p>“The king delivered us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 10But Absalom that we anointed has died in battle. Why be silent about bringing David back as our king?”</p>
<p>11Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests,</p>
<p>“Say to the elders in Judah, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the word of all Israel has come to the king and to his house? 12You’re my kin, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to welcome him back?’ 13Tell Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and bone? God do so to me and more if you won’t command my army continually in place of Joab.’”</p>
<p>14He convinced the people in Judah to agree; they sent word for the king and the ones with him to come back.	 2 Sam 19:8-14</p>
<p>David Returns to Jerusalem</p>
<p>15The king started back and got as far as the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across.</p>
<p>16Then Shimei Ben-Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet David. 171,000 Benjamites came with him, with Ziba the steward of Saul’s household, and Ziba’s own 15 sons and 20 servants. They rushed to the Jordan ahead of the king. 18They kept going back and forth across the ford to escort the king’s household over and do what pleased him. Shimei fell down to him as he was about to cross the Jordan,</p>
<p>19“Forgive me. Don’t take to heart what I did when you were leaving Jerusalem. 20I know I’ve sinned; I’ve come down, the first from the House of Joseph, to meet you.”</p>
<p>21But Abishai Ben-Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t we put him to death for cursing Yahveh’s anointed?”</p>
<p>22David said, “What do I have I to do with you that you should disagree with me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know I’m king?”</p>
<p>23He swore to Shimei, “You won’t die.” 	2 Sam 19:15-23</p>
<p>24Then Saul’s son Mephibosheth came down to meet the king. He hadn’t taken care of his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes since David left. 25When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”</p>
<p>26He answered,</p>
<p>“My lord the king, my servant deceived me. I said, ‘I’ll saddle a donkey so I can go with the king,’ because I’m lame. 27He slandered me to you, but you’re like an angel of God. Do what you think’s right. 28All my father’s family was nothing but dead men; yet you set me among the ones that ate at your own table. What right do I have to complain?”</p>
<p>29The king said, “Why are you still talking about your affairs? I’ve decided that you and Ziba will divide the land.”</p>
<p>30Mephibosheth said, “Let him have it all since you’ve come home safely.”	 2 Sam 19:24-30</p>
<p>31Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim and went on with the king to escort him across the Jordan. 32He was old and had sustained the king while he was staying at Mahanaim because he was a really wealthy man. 33The king told Barzillai,</p>
<p>“Cross over with me, and I’ll take care of you in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>34But he said,</p>
<p>“How long do I have left to live that I should go up with you to Jerusalem? 35I’m 80 years old. Can I distinguish good from bad, or taste what I eat, or still hear men and women singing? Why should I be an added burden to you? 36I’d simply be crossing over the Jordan with you. Why should you compensate me with this reward? 37Let me go back so I can die in my own town near my parents’ grave. But here is my son Kimham. Let him cross over with you, and you can do for him what seems good.”	  2 Sam 19:31-37</p>
<p>38The king answered, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I’ll do for him what seems good to you and whatever you need me to do for you.”</p>
<p>39The king and the people crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he went back home.</p>
<p>40The king and Chimham went on over to Gilgal. Judah and half of Israel crossed with the king. 41The men from Israel came to the king and said, “Why did our fellow Jews in Judah steal you away and bring you, your family, and your men across the Jordan?”</p>
<p>42The men from Judah answered, “Because the king is a close relative of ours. Why are you mad about that? Have we eaten at all at the kings’ expense, or has anything been taken for us?”</p>
<p>43But the men of Israel said, “We have ten parts in the king, so we have more claim on David than you do. Why then did you dishonor us? Wasn’t it our advice first to bring him back?”</p>
<p>Yet the men from Judah were more adamant than the men from Israel.	2 Sam 19:38-43</p>
<p>Sheba Rebels Against David</p>
<p>20:1A troublemaker happened to be there—Sheba Ben-Bicri, a Benjamite. He blew the ram’s horn and said,</p>
<p>“We don’t have any part with David</p>
<p>or any inheritance in Jesse’s son.</p>
<p>Everybody, back to your homes, Israel!”</p>
<p>2The men from Israel deserted David and followed Sheba. But Judah stayed firmly committed to their king and escorted him from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The ten concubines he’d left behind to keep the house, he put under guard and took care of them; but didn’t have relations with them. They lived like widows till they died.	 2 Sam 20:1-3</p>
<p>4Then the king told Amasa, “Call out Judah’s army within three days and be present here with them.” 5Amasa went to call them out, but it took him longer than the appointed time. 6David told Abishai, “Sheba will do us more damage than Absalom. Take my troops and chase him he gets into fortified towns and escape from me.” 7So Joab’s men, along with the king’s bodyguard and the strong warriors, left to pursue Sheba. 8When they were at the large boulder at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a dagger in its sheath fastened at his waist. As he stepped forward, it came out. 9Joab said to Amasa, “Are you doing well, brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 10Amasa wasn’t on guard against the dagger in Joab’s left hand. He struck him in the stomach just once and poured out his entrails on the ground, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba. 11One of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever is for Joab and David, follow Joab.” 12But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood on the road. When the young man saw that everybody was standing still, he took Amasa off the road into the field and threw a cloak over him. 13Then the men went on behind Joab to pursue Sheba. 	2 Sam 20:4-13</p>
<p>14Sheba went through the tribes of Israel to Abel, as far as Beth-maacah and the Berites. They gathered and went with him too. 15Joab’s forces laid siege to Sheba in Abel Beth-maacah and threw a siege ramp up against the city’s fortifications. The people that were with Joab were starting to knock down the wall.</p>
<p>16But a wise woman called out from the town, “Tell Joab to come here so I can talk to him.”</p>
<p>17He approached and she said, “Are you Joab?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Listen to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>18“People have always said, ‘They’ll certainly ask advice at Abel.’ That’s how they settled disputes. 19I’m among the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You’re trying to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why swallow up Yahveh’s inheritance?”			  2 Sam 20:14-19</p>
<p>20Joab answered, “I’d never swallow up or destroy you! 21Sheba Ben-Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has risen up against King David. Hand him over and I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>The woman said, “We’ll throw his head to you over the wall.”</p>
<p>22The woman wisely went to the people. They cut off Sheba’s head and threw it to Joab. He blew the ram’s horn, and they pulled back from the city and went home. Joab went back to the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>23Joab commanded Israel’s whole army,</p>
<p>Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard,</p>
<p>24Adoram managed forced labor,</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat Ben-Ahilud was royal historian,</p>
<p>25Sheva was secretary,</p>
<p>Zadok and Abiathar were priests, and</p>
<p>26Ira, descendant of Jair, was David’s personal priest.	 2 Sam 20:20-26</p>
<p>David Avenges the Gibeonites</p>
<p>21:1In David’s time, a famine came that lasted three years. He sought Yahveh, and Yahveh said, “It’s because Saul and his bloody family murdered the people in Gibeon.” 2(The inhabitants of Gibeon weren’t part of Israel but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a treaty with them, but Saul had intended to kill them off in his zeal for Israel and Judah.) The king called them,</p>
<p>3“How can I make amends to you so you can bless Yahveh’s inheritance again?”</p>
<p>4“It’s not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his family. It’s not for us to put anybody to death in Israel.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do whatever you say.”</p>
<p>5They told him,</p>
<p>“Give us seven descendants of the man that tried to destroy us and eliminate us from staying inside Israel’s border. 6We’ll hang them in Yahveh’s presence in Gibeah of Saul, Yahveh’s chosen one.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give them to you.”	 2 Sam 21:1-6</p>
<p>7But the king spared Mephibosheth because of Yahveh’s oath between David and Saul’s son Jonathan. 8The king took Armoni and Mephibosheth [Merib-baal], the two sons of Rizpah Bat-Aiah; and the five sons of Merab Bat-Saul that she had for Adriel Ben-Barzillai of Meholah. 9He gave them to the Gibeonites, who hanged them on the mountain in Yahveh’s presence. All seven died together at the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
<p>10Rizpah spread burlap on the rock, from the beginning of harvest till it rained on them. She wouldn’t let birds get to them during the day or wild animals at night. 11When David found out what Saul’s concubine had done, 12he took Saul and Jonathan’s bones away from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them from the open square in Beth-shan. That’s where the Philistines had hung them the day they struck Saul down in Gilboa. 13He brought their bones and the bones of the ones they hanged. 14He buried Saul and Jonathan’s bones in the country of Benjamin in Zela in the grave of Kish, Saul’s father. They did everything the king commanded. After that God was moved by petition for the land. 	2 Sam 21:7-14</p>
<p>Wars with the Philistine Giants</p>
<p>15The Philistines were at war again with Israel. When David and his men went down and fought them, David got tired. 16Ishbi-benob, a descendant of the giants in Gath—whose spearhead weighed 7½ lbs 300 shekels—was armed with a new sword and tried to kill David. 17But Abishai Ben-Jeruiah helped him, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, “You’re not going out with us again to battle so you don’t snuff out the lamp in Israel.”</p>
<p>18There was war again with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, a descendant of the giants in Gath. 19Another war with the Philistines took place at Gob. Elhanan Ben-Jaare-oregim from Bethlehem killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 20In another war at Gath, there was a very big man with six digits on each hand and foot. He, too, was a descendant of the giants in Gath. 21When he defied Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimei, struck him down. 22Those four sons of the giants in Gath fell by David and his troops.	 2 Sam 21:15-22</p>
<p>David’s Song of Praise (Psalm 18)</p>
<p>22:1David sang this song to Yahveh when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul:</p>
<p>2“Yahveh is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer,</p>
<p>3my God, my refuge, my shield,</p>
<p>the horn of my salvation, my fortress,</p>
<p>my savior who saves me from violence.</p>
<p>4I called on him who deserves praise,</p>
<p>and he saved me from my enemies.</p>
<p>5The waves of death entangled me;</p>
<p>the torrents of destruction flooded over me;</p>
<p>6the cords of Sheol tied me down;</p>
<p>the snares of death trapped me.</p>
<p>7In my desperation I cried out to Yahveh,</p>
<p>and he heard me in his temple.	2 Sam 22:1-7</p>
<p>8Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook</p>
<p>because he was angry.</p>
<p>9Smoke poured out of his nostrils;</p>
<p>consuming fire flared from his mouth;</p>
<p>glowing coals erupted from him.</p>
<p>10He lowered the sky too</p>
<p>and came down with dense darkness under his feet.</p>
<p>11He rode on a cherub</p>
<p>and came flying on the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>12He made blackness a canopy around him,</p>
<p>a mass of moisture, dark clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>13Coals of fire flamed out</p>
<p>from the brightness in front of him.</p>
<p>14Yahveh thundered from the sky;</p>
<p>the Most High raised his voice.	2 Sam 22:8-14</p>
<p>15He shot arrows and scattered my enemies;</p>
<p>lightning flashes routed them.</p>
<p>16Then the water in the sea receded;</p>
<p>the seabed was exposed at his rebuke,</p>
<p>at the blast from his nostrils.</p>
<p>17He reached down from on high and grabbed me,</p>
<p>and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.</p>
<p>18He delivered me from powerful enemies</p>
<p>that hated me,</p>
<p>that were too strong for me.</p>
<p>19They attacked me in a time of catastrophe,</p>
<p>but Yahveh supported me.</p>
<p>20He brought me out into a safe place</p>
<p>and rescued me because he delighted in me.	2 Sam 22:15-20</p>
<p>21“Yahveh has rewarded me according to my goodness,</p>
<p>according to my innocence—</p>
<p>22because I’d kept his ways</p>
<p>and hadn’t sinned by leaving him,</p>
<p>23because his ordinances all stayed with me;</p>
<p>I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.</p>
<p>24I stood blameless in front of him</p>
<p>and kept away from sin.</p>
<p>25So Yahveh has rewarded me according to my goodness—</p>
<p>according to my godliness toward him.</p>
<p>26“With the kind you’re kind;</p>
<p>with the blameless you’re blameless;</p>
<p>27with the pure you’re pure;</p>
<p>the devious you torture.</p>
<p>28You rescue the humble,</p>
<p>but bring down the haughty.</p>
<p>29You’re my lamp, Yahveh,</p>
<p>and shine light into my darkness.</p>
<p>30With your help I can crush a battalion;</p>
<p>I can scale a wall.</p>
<p>31God’s way is perfect;</p>
<p>Yahveh’s promise proves true;</p>
<p>he’s a shield for everyone that depends on him for protection.</p>
<p>2 Sam 22:21-31</p>
<p>32“Who is God except Yahveh?</p>
<p>Who is a rock except our God,</p>
<p>33who wraps me in strength</p>
<p>and makes my way safe,</p>
<p>34who makes my feet like red deer’s hooves</p>
<p>and sets me securely on high ground,</p>
<p>35who trains my hands for battle</p>
<p>and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow,</p>
<p>2 Sam 22:32-35</p>
<p>36who gives me his deliverance as a shield</p>
<p>and helps make me great,</p>
<p>37who widens the path for my feet</p>
<p>so they don’t slip.</p>
<p>38I chased my enemies and overtook them;</p>
<p>I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.</p>
<p>39I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again.</p>
<p>They fell under my feet</p>
<p>40because you’ve wrapped me in strength for battle;</p>
<p>and subdued my assailants under me.</p>
<p>41You’ve made my enemies retreat;</p>
<p>I destroyed the ones that hated me.</p>
<p>42They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;</p>
<p>they even cried out to Yahveh, but he didn’t answer them.</p>
<p>43I pulverized them like dust,</p>
<p>crushed and stomped on them like dirt in the street.</p>
<p>2 Sam 22:36-43</p>
<p>44“You delivered me from conflict with my own people</p>
<p>and placed me at the head of nations;</p>
<p>people I didn’t know serve me now.</p>
<p>45Foreigners pretend to submit as soon as they hear me;</p>
<p>46they retreat and come cringing out of their fortresses.</p>
<p>2 Sam 22:44-46</p>
<p>47“Yahveh lives; blessed be my Rock;</p>
<p>exalted be God, the rock that saves me,</p>
<p>48the God that carries out vengeance for me</p>
<p>and subdues nations under me,</p>
<p>49who brought me out from my enemies</p>
<p>and lifted me above my attackers,</p>
<p>who rescued me from violent people.</p>
<p>50So I’ll thank you among the Gentiles, Yahveh,</p>
<p>and sing praises to you.</p>
<p>51You’re a tower of victory for your king</p>
<p>and show enduring love to your anointed one—</p>
<p>David and his descendants forever.”	2 Sam 22:2-51 [= Ps 18:2-50]</p>
<p>23:1David’s last words</p>
<p>“The oracle of David Ben-Jesse,</p>
<p>the oracle of the man God honored,</p>
<p>the one anointed by Jacob’s God,</p>
<p>the sweet psalmist of Israel.</p>
<p>2“The Spirit of Yahveh speaks by me;</p>
<p>his message is on my tongue.</p>
<p>3The God of Israel said,</p>
<p>the Rock of Israel told me,</p>
<p>‘He that rules justly,</p>
<p>that rules in respect for God,</p>
<p>4is like the morning light from the rising sun</p>
<p>on a cloudless morn,</p>
<p>when tender grass sprouts from the soil</p>
<p>in the sunshine after rain.’	2 Sam 23:1-4</p>
<p>5Is not my family that way with God?</p>
<p>He has made an everlasting covenant with me,</p>
<p>ordered in every respect and secure.</p>
<p>Won’t he make grow</p>
<p>my salvation and my desire?</p>
<p>6But godless people every one will be thrown aside like briers,</p>
<p>because you can’t handle them.</p>
<p>7If you touch them,</p>
<p>you have to arm yourself with iron and the shaft of a spear.</p>
<p>They’ll be completely burned up where they are.”	2 Sam 23:5-7</p>
<p>David’s Greatest Warriors</p>
<p>8These are David’s most elite soldiers: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite [a Hachmonite in 1 Chronicles 11:11], chief of The Three. He was called Adino the Eznite because he killed 800 men in one battle.</p>
<p>9After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, a descendant of Ahoah, another of The Three elite soldiers. He and David defied the Philistines that gathered for battle and Israel’s army retreated. 10He arose and struck the Philistines till his hand was worn out and cramped onto the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The rest of the army only returned to strip the slain.</p>
<p>11After him was Shammah Ben-Agee, from Harar. The Philistines had gathered into a troop on a plot of ground full of lentils, and the rest of Israel’s army had fled. 12But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck the Philistines. Yahveh brought about a great victory.</p>
<p>13Then The Three among The Thirty chief men went down to David at harvest time to the cave near Adullam, while a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 14David was in the stronghold while the garrison of Philistines was in Bethlehem. 15David had a yearning, “If only somebody would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!” 16So The Three broke through the Philistines’ camp and drew water from the well and brought it to him. But he wouldn’t drink it. He poured it out to Yahveh, 17“I couldn’t do that, Yahveh. Am I going to drink the blood of men who jeopardized their lives?” Those are some things The Three most elite soldiers did.	 2 Sam 23:8-17</p>
<p>18Abishai, brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of The Thirty. He handled his spear against 300 and killed them and had a name alongside The Three. 19He was the most honored of The Thirty, so he became their commander, but he didn’t measure up to The Three.</p>
<p>20Then Benaiah Ben-Jehoiada—son of a great warrior from Kabzeel, who had done amazing things—killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day. 21He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and took the spear away from him and killed him with it. 22He had a name as well as The Three. 23He was honored among The Thirty, but he didn’t measure up to The Three. David appointed him over his guard. 	2 Sam 23:18-23</p>
<p>24Asahel, Joab’s brother, was among the 30 as well as</p>
<p>Elhanan Ben-Dodo from Bethlehem;</p>
<p>25Shammah and Elika from Harod,</p>
<p>26Helez from Pelon,</p>
<p>Ira Ben-Ikkesh from Tekoa,</p>
<p>27Abiezer from Anathoth,</p>
<p>Mebunnai from Hushah,</p>
<p>28Zalmon from Ahoah,</p>
<p>Maharai and 29Heleb Ben-Baanah from Netophah,</p>
<p>Ittai Ben-Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,</p>
<p>30Benaiah from Pirathon,</p>
<p>Hiddai from Nahale-gaash,</p>
<p>31Abialbon/Abiel?LXX from Arabah,</p>
<p>Azmaveth from Bahurim,</p>
<p>32Eliahba from Shaalbon,</p>
<p>the sons of Jashen,</p>
<p>Jonathan 33Ben-Shagee and Ahiam Ben-Sharar from Harar [1 Ch 11:34],</p>
<p>34Eliphelet Ben-Ahasbai from Maacah,</p>
<p>Eliam Ben-Ahithophel from Giloh,</p>
<p>35Hezro from Carmel,</p>
<p>Paarai from Arba,</p>
<p>36Igal Ben-Nathan from Zobah,</p>
<p>Bani from Gad,</p>
<p>37Zelek from Ammon,</p>
<p>Naharai from Beeroth, armor bearer for Joab Ben-Zeruiah;</p>
<p>38Ira and Gareb the Jattir,</p>
<p>39Uriah the Hittite—37 in all.	  2 Sam 23:24-39</p>
<p>David’s Ill-Advised Census</p>
<p>24:1Again Yahveh’s anger burned against Israel, and he aroused David to count the people in Israel and Judah.</p>
<p>2The king told Joab the commander of the army, “Go through the tribes from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people so I can know how many there are.”</p>
<p>3But Joab said, “May Yahveh your God multiply the people 100 times while you can still see it, but why delight in this?”</p>
<p>4But the king’s word prevailed over Joab and his commanders; so they spread out to register the people. 5They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer in the middle of the Valley of Gad and then went on toward Jazer. 6They went to Gilead and the area around Tahtim-hodshi, to Dan-jaan and on around to Sidon, 7to the fortress of Tyre and the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites; and to the south of Judah to Beersheba. 8When they’d cycled through the country, they came to Jerusalem after 9 months and 20 days, 9and Joab reported the number of the census. 	2 Sam 24:1-9</p>
<p>God’s Judgment on David’s Sin</p>
<p>10David’s conscience got to bothering him after he’d counted the people. He told Yahveh, “I’ve committed a serious sin, but please take away my guilt. I’ve acted foolishly.” 11When he got up in the morning, a message from Yahveh came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, 12“Tell David I’m offering him three choices.”</p>
<p>13Gad went and asked David,</p>
<p>“Will three [1 Chronicles 21:12] years of famine come on you and your land? Will you flee from your enemies for three months? Or will there be a three-day plague in your land? Which answer will I take back to the One who sent me?”</p>
<p>14David told Gad,</p>
<p>“I’m really distressed. Let’s fall into Yahveh’s hand. He has great mercy; don’t let me fall into human hands.”				              2 Sam 24:10-14</p>
<p>15So Yahveh sent a plague on Israel from morning till the appointed time; 70,000 people died from Dan to Beersheba. 16When the angel held out his hand out toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahveh relented, “That’s enough. Relax your hand.” The angel of Yahveh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17When David saw the angel, he said to Yahveh, “I’m the one that sinned. I did wrong. What have these sheep done? Put yourself against me and my father’s family.”	 2 Sam 24:15-17</p>
<p>David Builds an Altar</p>
<p>18Gad went to David that day and said, “Go build an altar to Yahveh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” 19David went up like he said. 20Araunah looked down and saw him and his men crossing over toward him. He went out and bowed to the ground. 21He said, “Why have you come to me?”</p>
<p>“To buy your threshing floor and build an altar to Yahveh so he’ll hold back the plague from the people.”</p>
<p>22Araunah told him,</p>
<p>“Take and offer what you want to: the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes for wood. 23You can have it all. May Yahveh your God accept you.”</p>
<p>24“No, I’ll buy it from you. I won’t offer burnt offerings that don’t cost me anything.”</p>
<p>He bought the threshing floor and oxen for 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. 25He built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Yahveh was moved by David’s petition for the country and held back the plague.	  2 Sam 24:18-25</p>
