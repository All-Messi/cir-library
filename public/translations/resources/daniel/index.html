        <p>DANIEL</p>
<p>Conversational Covenant</p>
<p>Daniel Taken to Babylon</p>
<p>1:1In the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, laid siege to Jerusalem. 2Yahveh delivered Jehoiakim to him, along with articles from God’s Temple. He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/Babylonia and put them in the treasury. 3He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, 4young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had him teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, 5and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. 6Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. 7The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel was Belteshazzar, Hananiah was Shadrach, Mishael was Meshach, and Azariah was Abed-nego.	Dan 1:1-7</p>
<p>8But Daniel made up his mind not to defile himself with the king’s wine and royal food, and asked the chief eunuch to let him not defile himself. 9God had given the chief eunuch respect and affection for Daniel, 10but he told him,</p>
<p>“The king specified what you should eat and drink. I’m afraid my lord would see that you weren’t as healthy as the other youths your age. You’d put my life in danger from him.”</p>
<p>11Daniel told the steward that the chief eunuch had appointed to oversee them,</p>
<p>12“Test us for ten days. Let us have vegetables and water. 13Then look at us and the youths that eat the king’s food, and deal with us by what you see.”</p>
<p>14He agreed and tested them for ten days. 15After ten days he could see that they looked better and were healthier than the ones who ate the king’s food. 16So the steward took away their wine and royal food and fed them vegetables. 	Dan 1:8-16</p>
<p>17God gave these four youths an aptitude for learning and skill in every branch of literature and wisdom. Daniel understood visions and dreams. 18At the end of the time the king had specified, the chief eunuch brought them in. 19The king talked to them, and none of them impressed him like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. 20In every matter of wisdom and understanding he asked them about, he found them ten times more capable than the magicians and enchanters in his whole empire. 21Daniel continued till the first year of King Cyrus.      	Dan 1:17-21</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</p>
<p>2:1In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, haunting dreams kept him awake. 2He gave orders to call in the magicians, conjurers, sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he’d dreamed. When they came in, 3he told them, “I had a dream, and I’m disturbed about what it means.”</p>
<p>4The astrologers said in Aramaic, “Long live the King! Tell us the dream, and we’ll tell you what it means.”</p>
<p>5“I’m giving an unalterable command. If you don’t tell me what I dreamed and its meaning, I’ll have you torn limb from limb, and make your houses trash piles. 6But if you tell me, I’ll reward you with gifts and high honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.”</p>
<p>7“Tell us the dream, and we’ll tell you what it means.”</p>
<p>8“You’re stalling because you can see I’ve given an unalterable command. 9If you don’t tell me the dream, there’s only one decree for you. You’ve conspired to lie and say bogus things till I change my mind. Tell me what I dreamed so I know you can tell me what it means.”</p>
<p>10“Nobody can do that. No great king or ruler has ever asked such a thing from any magician, conjurer, or astrologer. 11What you’re demanding is not possible. Nobody but the gods can tell you that, and they don’t live in mortal flesh.”</p>
<p>12At this, the king was furious and gave orders to destroy the wise men in Babylon. 13The decree went out to execute them, and they started looking for Daniel and his friends to kill them.</p>
<p>Dan 2:1-13</p>
<p>God Gives Daniel the Dream’s Interpretation</p>
<p>14With prudence and discretion Daniel answered Arioch, captain of the king’s bodyguard, who’d gone out to execute the wise men, 15“Why is the king’s decree so urgent?” Arioch told him what had happened. 16So Daniel went in and asked the king for some time so he could tell him the interpretation. 17He went home and informed his three friends about the matter 18so they could ask for mercy from the God of heaven about that mystery, so Daniel and his friends wouldn’t die with the rest of the wise men in Babylon. 19The mystery came to Daniel in a vision during the night, and he blessed the God of heaven:</p>
<p>20“God be blessed forever</p>
<p>because of his wisdom and power.</p>
<p>21He’s the One that changes times and seasons,</p>
<p>removes kings and appoints them.</p>
<p>He gives the wise their wisdom</p>
<p>and the knowledgeable their insight.</p>
<p>22He reveals profound, hidden things;</p>
<p>he knows what’s in the dark,</p>
<p>and light lives in him.</p>
<p>23I thank and praise you, my ancestors’ God,</p>
<p>because you’ve given me wisdom and authority.</p>
<p>Just now you’ve told me what we’ve asked for,</p>
<p>the answer to the king’s demand.”	Dan 2:14-23</p>
<p>24So Daniel went in to Arioch and said, “Don’t execute the wise men! Take me to the king. I’ll give him the interpretation.”</p>
<p>25Arioch hurried him to the king, “I’ve found a man among the Jewish exiles from Judah that can tell you the interpretation!”</p>
<p>26The king answered Daniel (Belteshazzar), “Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”			Dan 2:24-26</p>
<p>27Daniel said,</p>
<p>“Wise men, conjurers, magicians, and fortunetellers can’t tell you that. 28But there’s a God in heaven that reveals secret things, and he’s revealed to you what’s going to happen. That’s what you dreamed in your bed. 29You were thinking about what will happen in the future, and he that reveals secret things was showing you that. 30The mystery hasn’t come to me because of my wisdom any more than anybody else’s, except for telling you so you can understand what’s going through your mind.	Dan 2:27-30</p>
<p>31“You saw a large, frightening statue that had exceptional splendor. 32Its head was fine gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, 33its legs were iron, and its feet were iron and clay mixed. 34As you watched, a stone was hewn out without hands and struck the statue’s iron and clay feet and crushed them. 35It crushed the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold all at one time. They became like chaff on the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away without a trace. But the stone that struck the statue became a huge mountain that covered the whole world.</p>
<p>Dan 2:31-35</p>
<p>36“That’s what you dreamed. Now we’ll tell you what it means. 37You’re the king of kings that God has given the kingdom, power, strength, and honor. 38Wherever people, animals, or birds live, he’s put them under your control. You’re the gold head. 39After you, a lesser kingdom will rise up. Then a third, bronze kingdom will rule the world. 40There’ll be a fourth kingdom that’s as strong as iron. As iron crushes and shatters everything, it will shatter and crush the other three. 41As the feet and toes were partly potter’s clay and partly iron, the fourth kingdom will be a divided one, some parts with the toughness of iron and other parts with the weakness of clay. 42As some toes were iron and some were clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 43The iron mixed with clay means they’ll be allied peoples that won’t stick to one another, like iron and clay won’t stick together.</p>
<p>44During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will be setting up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or left for another people. It’ll crush those other kingdoms and put an end to them, but it will last forever. 45You saw a stone hewn out of the mountain without hands that crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God has shown you what will happen in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation sure.”     	                                                             	      Dan 2:36-45</p>
<p>Daniel Rewarded</p>
<p>46King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face in homage to Daniel and gave orders to present him with an offering and fragrant incense. 47He said, “Truly your God is the greatest of gods and the Lord over kings, who reveals secrets! You’ve explained that mystery!” 48He promoted Daniel, gave him many high honors, and made him ruler over the province of Babylon and chief prefect over the wise men in Babylon. 49Daniel asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to administer the province while Daniel was at the king’s court.	 Dan 2:46-49</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue</p>
<p>3:1Nebucharnezzar made a gold image 90ft tall and 18ft wide, and set it up on the Plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 2Then he sent word to gather the satraps, prefects, governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image. 3They came and stood in front of it. 4The herald declared loudly,</p>
<p>“Every people, nation, and language group, 5when you hear the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, pipes, and other instruments, fall down and worship the gold image the king has set up. 6Whoever doesn’t will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace.”</p>
<p>7So when the people heard the instruments, they all fell down to the image in worship. 	Dan 3:1-7</p>
<p>The Blazing Furnace</p>
<p>8Some astrologers came and accused the Jews.</p>
<p>9“Long live the King! 10You decreed that when everybody hears the music, they’re to fall down and worship the gold image. 11Whoever doesn’t, will be thrown in the blazing furnace. 12Some Jews you appointed to administer the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—have disregarded you. They don’t serve your gods or worship your gold image.”</p>
<p>13In a rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring them in. 	Dan 3:8-13</p>
<p>14“Is it true you won’t serve my gods or worship the gold image I set up? 15If you’re ready, when you hear the instruments, fall down in worship to the image I’ve made. If you don’t, you’ll be thrown directly into the blazing furnace. What god can deliver you from me?”</p>
<p>16Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered him,</p>
<p>“We don’t need to answer you about that. 17If that happens, the God we serve can deliver us from the blazing furnace and from you. 18Even if he doesn’t, we’re not going to serve your gods or worship the image you set up.  	Dan 3:14-18</p>
<p>19He was irate and changed his attitude toward them. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than normal, 20and commanded some brave soldiers from his army to tie them up and throw them in. 21They tied them up in their cloaks, tunics, turbans, and other clothes to throw them in. 22Since the king’s command was strict and the furnace was extremely hot, the fire killed the soldiers that carried them. 23They fell into the blazing furnace still tied up.</p>
<p>24Nebuchadnezzar was astounded. He jumped up and exclaimed to his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men in the fire?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>25He answered, “Look! I see four men not tied up, walking around in the fire unharmed. The fourth looks like a god!”	Dan 3:19-25</p>
<p>26He went up to the door of the blazing furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, come out of there, you servants of the Most High God. Come here!” They came out of the fire. 27The satraps, prefects, governors, and king’s high officials gathered around and saw that the fire hadn’t burned their bodies, singed their hair, or scorched their clothes; and there wasn’t any burnt smell on them.</p>
<p>28Nebuchaznezzar said,</p>
<p>“Bless Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego’s God. He sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him. They set aside my command and yielded up their bodies not to serve or worship any god but their own. 29So I decree that any people, nation, or language group that says anything offensive about their God will be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to trash piles. No other god that can deliver like that.”</p>
<p>30The king advanced them even more in the province of Babylon.	Dan 3:26-30</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar Praises God</p>
<p>4:1King Nebuchadnezzar to the peoples, nations, and language groups that live all over the empire:</p>
<p>“Peace and prosperity!</p>
<p>2It has seemed good to me to tell about the signs and wonders the Most High God has done for me.</p>
<p>3How great his signs,</p>
<p>how amazing his wonders!</p>
<p>His kingdom’s eternal,</p>
<p>his dominion’s forever!</p>
<p>4I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house,</p>
<p>living in prosperity in my palace. 	Dan 4:1-4</p>
<p>5A dream terrified me;</p>
<p>fantasies and visions alarmed me.</p>
<p>6So I ordered the wise men in Babylon</p>
<p>to come and explain what the dream meant.</p>
<p>7The magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers came.</p>
<p>I told them the dream,</p>
<p>but they couldn’t interpret it.</p>
<p>8But finally Daniel (named Belteshazzar after my god),</p>
<p>who has the spirit of the holy gods, came in,</p>
<p>and I told him the dream,</p>
<p>9‘Belteshazzar, chief magician,</p>
<p>since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you</p>
<p>and no mystery baffles you,</p>
<p>tell me what I was looking at</p>
<p>and what it means. 					Dan 4:5-9</p>
<p>10I was in bed</p>
<p>when I saw a really tall tree in the middle of the country.</p>
<p>11It had grown tall and strong,</p>
<p>as high as the sky,</p>
<p>and visible all over the world.</p>
<p>12Its leaves were beautiful,</p>
<p>its fruit abundant,</p>
<p>enough for everyone.</p>
<p>Animals in the pasture lived in its shade;</p>
<p>birds in the sky roosted in it;</p>
<p>everyone fed themselves from it.	Dan 4:10-12</p>
<p>13As I kept watching, an angel watcher, a holy one,</p>
<p>came down from the sky 14and shouted,</p>
<p>“Chop it down and cut off its limbs;</p>
<p>strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.</p>
<p>Let the animals run from under it</p>
<p>and the birds fly from its branches.</p>
<p>15But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,</p>
<p>with an iron-bronze band around it</p>
<p>in the new grass of the pasture.</p>
<p>Let him be wet with the dew from the sky</p>
<p>and share the grass with the animals.</p>
<p>16Let his mind change from a man’s to an animal’s mind</p>
<p>for seven periods of time.</p>
<p>17This sentence is by the angel watchers’ decree</p>
<p>a command from the holy ones</p>
<p>so the living can know</p>
<p>that it’s the Most High who rules the human realm,</p>
<p>gives it to the one his chooses,</p>
<p>and sets over it the lowliest of men.”	Dan 4:13-17</p>
<p>18That’s the dream I had. Tell me what it means, Belteshazzar. None of the wise men in my kingdom can do it. You can; you have the spirit of the holy gods in you.’</p>
<p>Daniel Interprets the Second Dream</p>
<p>19Daniel was distressed for a while as his thoughts about the meaning of the dream alarmed him.</p>
<p>The king said, ‘Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its meaning alarm you.’</p>
<p>Belteshazzar answered,</p>
<p>‘If only the dream applied to those who hate you,</p>
<p>and its meaning applied to your enemies, my lord!</p>
<p>20The tree you saw that grew tall and strong,</p>
<p>as high as the sky</p>
<p>and visible all over the world,</p>
<p>21whose leaves were beautiful</p>
<p>and its fruit abundant,</p>
<p>enough for everybody,</p>
<p>that animals in the pasture lived under,</p>
<p>whose branches birds roosted in—</p>
<p>22that’s you, O King.</p>
<p>You’ve grown tall and strong;</p>
<p>your majesty has become great</p>
<p>and reached the sky;</p>
<p>you exercise dominion everywhere. 			Dan 4:18-22</p>
<p>23The angel watcher you saw,</p>
<p>a holy one, came down from the sky and shouted,</p>
<p>“Chop down the tree and destroy it;</p>
<p>but leave the stump with its roots in the ground</p>
<p>with an iron-bronze band around it</p>
<p>in the new grass in the pasture.</p>
<p>Let him be wet with the dew from the sky</p>
<p>and share grass with wild animals</p>
<p>till seven periods of time pass.”</p>
<p>24That means it’s a decree by the Most High</p>
<p>that will happen to you:</p>
<p>25you’ll be driven from society</p>
<p>and live with the animals in the pasture.</p>
<p>You’ll eat grass like a cow</p>
<p>and be wet with the dew from the sky.</p>
<p>Seven periods of time will pass</p>
<p>till you recognize</p>
<p>that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm</p>
<p>and gives it to the one he chooses.			Dan 4:23-25</p>
<p>26The stump with its roots means</p>
<p>you’ll receive your empire back</p>
<p>after you recognize that heaven rules.</p>
<p>27So, O King, may my advice please you:</p>
<p>break away now from your sins by doing good,</p>
<p>from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor,</p>
<p>in case your prosperity can continue.”		Dan 4:26-27</p>
<p>The Dream’s Fulfillment</p>
<p>28“That all happened to Nebuchadnezzar. 29A year later, he was walking on his palace roof in Babylon 30an saying, ‘Isn’t this Babylon the Great that I’ve built as a royal residence by my power and splendor?’ 31While he was still saying it, a voice from heaven said, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, you’ve lost your sovereignty.</p>
<p>32You’ll be driven from society</p>
<p>and live with the animals in the pasture.</p>
<p>You’ll eat grass like a cow,</p>
<p>for seven periods of time</p>
<p>till you recognize</p>
<p>that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm</p>
<p>and gives it to the one he chooses.’</p>
<p>33At once it happened.</p>
<p>He was driven from society</p>
<p>and began to eat grass like a cow.</p>
<p>His body was wet from dew</p>
<p>till his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers</p>
<p>and his nails like birds’ claws.	Dan 4:28-33</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar Restored</p>
<p>34“But when that was past, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to the sky, my sanity came back, and I praised and honored the Most High who lives forever.</p>
<p>His rule is everlasting;</p>
<p>his kingdom continues to all generations.</p>
<p>35All people on earth amount to nothing,</p>
<p>but he does what he decides in the host of heaven</p>
<p>and among people on earth.</p>
<p>Nobody can shove his hand away</p>
<p>or say, ‘What are you doing?’</p>
<p>36“At the same time as my sanity returned</p>
<p>my majesty and splendor came back to me</p>
<p>for the glory of my empire;</p>
<p>my advisors and nobles began to trust me,</p>
<p>so I was secure again in my sovereignty</p>
<p>and became greater than before.</p>
<p>37Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,</p>
<p>praise, lift up, and honor the King of heaven;</p>
<p>because everything he does is true,</p>
<p>his ways are just,</p>
<p>and he can humble the arrogant.” 	Dan 4:34-37</p>
<p>The Handwriting on the Wall</p>
<p>5:1King Belshazzar held a huge feast for 1,000 of his nobles and drank wine with them. 2While he was tasting the wine, he sent for the gold and silver items his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem. 3The king, his nobles, wives, and concubines drank out of them, 4and praised their idols made out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.</p>
<p>5All of a sudden, the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and started writing on the plaster wall across from the lampstand. The king could see the back of the hand as it wrote. 6His face grew pale with terror, his hip joints went slack, his knees knocked. 7He shouted for his conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. He told the wise men in Babylon, “Anybody that can read this inscription and tell me what it means will dress in purple, wear a gold chain around his neck, and be third in the empire.” 8His wise men came in, but they couldn’t read it or explain what it meant. 9He was scared, his face grew more pale, and his nobles were baffled.	 Dan 5:1-9</p>
<p>10When the queen heard about what the king and his nobles said, she came in the banquet hall,</p>
<p>“Long live the King! Don’t let your imagination run away with you or your face go pale. 11There’s a man in your kingdom that has the spirit of the holy gods. In your predecessor’s time, he showed enlightenment, insight, and wisdom like the gods have. King Nebuchadnezzar appointed him chief of magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. 12That was because this Daniel—that the king named Belteshazzar—had a special spirit, knowledge, insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas, and solving of difficult problems. Call him; he’ll tell you what the inscription means.”	 Dan 5:10-12</p>
<p>Daniel Interprets the Handwriting</p>
<p>13They brought Daniel in, and he asked him,</p>
<p>“Are you the Daniel that’s among the exiles from Judah my predecessor brought back? 14I’ve heard you have the spirit of the gods in you and you have insight, understanding, and extraordinary wisdom. 15I’ve just now brought in the wise men and conjurers to read this inscription and interpret it, but they can’t do it. 16I’ve heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read the inscription and tell me what it means, you’ll dress in purple, wear a gold chain around your neck, and be third in the empire.”   	Dan 5:13-16</p>
<p>17Daniel said,</p>
<p>“Keep your gifts or give your rewards to someone else, but I’ll read the inscription and tell you what it means. 18O King, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, honor, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar. 19Because of his grandeur, the peoples, nations, and language groups trembled in front of him. He executed or spared, elevated or demoted anybody he wanted to. 20But his heart and spirit became so proud that he acted out his arrogance. He was deposed, and his honor was taken away. 21He was driven away from society, and his mind became like an animal’s mind. He lived with wild donkeys and ate grass like a cow. His body was wet from dew till he recognized that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm and appoints over it whoever he chooses. 22Yet you, a successor of his, Belshazzar, haven’t humbled yourself, even though you knew that. 23You’ve raised yourself against the Lord of heaven by bringing in the vessels from his Temple. You, your nobles, wives, and concubines have been drinking wine out of them and praising gods made out of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that can’t see, hear, or understand. But you haven’t honored the God that holds your life-breath and destiny in his hand. 24-25He has sent the hand that wrote this inscription: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’</p>
<p>Dan 5:17-25</p>
<p>26It means:</p>
<p>‘MENE’: God has ‘numbered’ the time for your reign and ended it.</p>
<p>27‘TEKEL’: you’ve been ‘weighed’ on the scales and found wanting.</p>
<p>28‘PEREZ’: your empire has been ‘divided’ and given to the Medes and Persians.”</p>
<p>29Belshazzar gave orders to dress Daniel in a purple robe, put a gold chain around his neck, and proclaim him third in the empire. 30That night Belshazzar the Babylonian king was killed, 31and Darius the Mede took over the empire at about age 62.	Dan 5:26-30</p>
<p>Daniel in the Lions’ Den</p>
<p>6:1King Darius thought it good to appoint 120 satraps to oversee the empire. 2He put three commissioners over them. (Daniel was one of them.) The satraps would report to them, and they would protect the king’s interests. 3Daniel soon distinguished himself among the satraps and other commissioners because he had exceptional ability. The king planned to appoint him over the whole empire. 4Then the commissioners and satraps tried to find some grounds for accusing him of mismanaging government affairs, but they couldn’t find any evidence of corruption. He was dependable, and they couldn’t find him negligent. 5They said, “We won’t find any grounds for accusing him unless it’s in connection with the Law of his god.”     	Dan 6:1-5</p>
<p>6They went to the king together and said,</p>
<p>“Long live King Darius! 7The commissioners, prefects and satraps, high officials and governors have agreed that you should enforce a statute that anybody who asks for anything from any mortal or god but you for 30 days will be thrown in the lions’ den. 8Now, establish the injunction and sign the document so it can’t be revoked—like the law of the Medes and Persians.”</p>
<p>9So Darius signed the injunction.</p>
<p>10When Daniel found out he’d signed it, he went home. In his roof room with windows open toward Jerusalem, he continued to kneel three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God. 11Those men came to his house together and found him making petition to his God; 12so they went to the king, “Didn’t you sign an injunction that anybody who asks anything from any mortal or god besides you for 30 days would be thrown into the lions’ den?”</p>
<p>He said, “It’s true; the law of the Medes and Persians can’t be revoked.”</p>
<p>13They answered, “Daniel, an exile from Judah, is not honoring your injunction. He keeps praying to his God three times a day.”	Dan 6:6-13</p>
<p>14When the king heard it, he was deeply distressed and tried all day to figure out some way to rescue Daniel. 15Then those men came back and said, “You know, O King, it’s the law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute the king makes can be revoked.”</p>
<p>16So he gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. He told Daniel, “The God you constantly serve will deliver you himself.” 17They brought a stone and laid it over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his signet ring and his nobles’ signet rings so nothing could be changed. 18He spent the night in his palace fasting. No entertainment was brought to him, and he couldn’t sleep.	 Dan 6:14-18</p>
<p>19He got up at dawn and hurried to the lions’ den. 20Worried, he called out, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has the God you constantly serve, delivered you from the lions?”</p>
<p>21Daniel said,</p>
<p>“Long live the King! 22My God sent his angel and shut their mouths. They haven’t hurt me because he considered me innocent. I haven’t committed any crime against you either.”</p>
<p>23The king was really relieved and had him brought up out of the den. They didn’t find any injury on him because he’d trusted in his God. 24The king ordered the men to be brought who had maliciously accused Daniel, and threw them, their children, and wives into the den. They hadn’t hit the den floor before the lions pounced on them and crushed their bones.</p>
<p>Dan 6:19-24</p>
<p>25Then Darius wrote to the peoples, nations, and language groups in the empire:</p>
<p>“Peace and prosperity!</p>
<p>26I decree that in all my kingdom, people tremble in fear before Daniel’s God.</p>
<p>He’s the living God that endures forever;</p>
<p>his kingdom will never be destroyed;</p>
<p>his rule will never end.</p>
<p>27He delivers and rescues, and performs signs and wonders</p>
<p>on earth and in the sky—</p>
<p>and delivered Daniel from the lions.”</p>
<p>28So Daniel enjoyed success during the regency of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>
<p>Dan 6:25-28</p>
<p>Daniel’s Vision of the Four Beasts</p>
<p>7:1Previously, in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream while he was in bed. He wrote down this summary of it:</p>
<p>2“During the night I had a vision. Four winds were churning up the Mediterranean Sea, 3and four different beasts emerged from it.</p>
<p>4The first was like a lion with wings like an eagle. As I watched, its wings were pulled off, and it was made to stand on its two hind legs like a human being and receive a human mind.</p>
<p>5A second beast resembling a bear came up. It was rearing up on one side and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. They told it, ‘Go ahead and gorge on many people!’</p>
<p>6As I continued to watch, another beast came up, like a leopard with four heads and with four wings on its back; it received authority.</p>
<p>7Then a fourth beast came up, dreadful, terrifying, very strong with big iron teeth. It devoured, crushed, and tramped down its victims’ remains. It wasn’t like the other beasts and had ten horns.   	Dan 7:1-7</p>
<p>The Ancient of Days Reigns</p>
<p>8“While I was thinking about its horns, a little horn grew up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots in its presence. This horn had eyes like a human and a mouth that bragged.</p>
<p>9I kept watching and thrones were set,</p>
<p>and the Ancient of Days took his seat.</p>
<p>His clothes were white like snow;</p>
<p>his hair was like clean wool.</p>
<p>He sat on a fiery throne</p>
<p>with wheels of blazing fire.</p>
<p>10A molten river was flowing out from him.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands attended him;</p>
<p>millions upon millions stood in front of him.</p>
<p>Court began to hold session,</p>
<p>and the books were opened.	 Dan 7:8-10</p>
<p>The Son of Man Receives Dominion</p>
<p>11“I kept watching because the horn kept bragging. The beast was killed, and its body thrown into the blazing fire and destroyed. 12The other beasts had their authority revoked, but they were allowed to live for a season and a time longer.</p>
<p>13“I kept watching the vision.</p>
<p>One like a son of man was coming</p>
<p>with the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>He approached the Ancient of Days,</p>
<p>led into his presence.</p>
<p>14He received dominion, honor, and a kingdom</p>
<p>so all peoples, nations, and language groups would serve him.</p>
<p>His dominion was eternal;</p>
<p>his kingdom would never be destroyed.	  Dan 7:11-14</p>
<p>The Vision Interpreted</p>
<p>15“The vision troubled me. 16I went to one of those standing nearby and asked what it meant. He told me, 17‘Those four huge beasts are kings that will arise in the world. 18But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and have it for all ages to come.’ 19I wanted to know what the fourth beast meant. It was different from the others and very dreadful with its iron teeth and bronze talons; it ate up, crushed, and tramped the others down. 20I wanted to know what the ten horns meant and the other horn that grew up, that the three horns fell in front of—the horn that had eyes, a bragging mouth, and bigger size than the others. 21As I watched, that horn fought the holy people and overpowered them. 22Then the Ancient of Days came and rendered judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came for them to take over the kingdom.		Dan 7:15-22</p>
<p>23“He said, ‘The fourth beast will be a kingdom that’s different from the others. It will devastate the whole world, tramp it down, and crush it. 24The ten horns in that kingdom are ten kings. Another, different kind of king will rise up after them and overthrow them. 25He’ll defy the Most High and oppress his holy people. He’ll try to change their festival cycle and their laws, and they’ll be delivered to him for a time, times, and half a time. 26But the court will sit in judgment and take away, annihilate, and destroy his power permanently. 27Then the holy people of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve him.’</p>
<p>28“The revelation ended. My thoughts scared me, and my face grew pale. I kept the matter to myself.”	      Dan 7:23-28</p>
<p>Daniel’s Vision of the Ram and the Goat</p>
<p>8:1In the third year of Belshazzar’s regency, I, Daniel, had another vision. 2I was in Susa the capital, in the province Elam beside the Ulai Canal. 3I looked up and saw a ram with two horns standing by the canal. The horns were long, one longer than the other even though the longer one had grown up last. 4The ram was butting west, north, and south. No other animals could stand up to it, and nobody could rescue anyone from it. It did what it pleased and became great. 			Dan 8:1-4</p>
<p>5A male goat was coming from the west across the earth without touching the ground. It had a conspicuous horn between its eyes. 6It came toward the ram that was by the canal and rushed at him in powerful fury. 7It butted the ram and broke off its two horns. The ram wasn’t strong enough to resist it; so it slammed the ram to the ground and tramped on it. 8The male goat promoted itself highly. But as soon as it got powerful, its big horn broke, and in its place four conspicuous horns sprouted up in four directions. 	Dan 8:5-8</p>
<p>9A little horn came up out of one of them and grew very big toward the south, east, and the Glorious Land. 10It grew up to the stars, knocked some of them to earth, and tramped on them. 11It even promoted itself against the Commander of the host, canceled the daily sacrifice to him, and tore down his sanctuary. 12Because of sin, the army will be given over to the horn along with the daily sacrifice. The horn will dash truth to the ground and do whatever it wants to. 13Then I heard a holy one speaking and another one answering,</p>
<p>“How long will the vision last about the regular sacrifice while sin causes horror, so that the holy place and the army both get overrun?”</p>
<p>14He told me, “For 2,300 mornings and evenings. Then the holy place will be restored to its rightful position.”	Dan 8:9-14</p>
<p>Gabriel Interprets the Vision</p>
<p>15When I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was trying to understand it, one that looked like a man was standing in front of me. 16I heard a man between the banks of Ulai call out, “Gabriel, tell him what the vision means.” 17So he came closer, and I fell on my face in fear. But he said, “Son of man, the vision deals with the end of time.” 18While he was talking to me, I fainted facedown on the ground, but he took hold of me and stood me up. 19He said,</p>
<p>“I’m letting you know what will happen at the end of indignation; it deals with the appointed end of time. 20The ram you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia. 21The shaggy goat represents Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is its first king. 22The broken horn and the four horns that came up in place of it represent four kingdoms that will grow out of his nation, though not with his power. 23Toward the end of their rule, when sinners have become extreme, a king will rise up insolent, adept at intrigue, 24and very powerful. He’ll cause extraordinary destruction and do whatever he wants to. He’ll destroy powerful men and the holy people. 25Through his shrewdness, he’ll make deceit succeed by his influence. He’ll honor himself in his own mind and destroy many by surprise. He’ll even oppose the Prince of princes and be broken without human agency. 26The vision about the mornings and evenings is real; but keep it to yourself because it deals with the distant future.”</p>
<p>27I lay sick and drained for several days. Then I got up to carry on the king’s business, but the vision kept troubling me, and nobody came to explain it to me.	Dan 8:15-27</p>
<p>9:1The First Year of Darius Ben-Ahasuerus,</p>
<p>a Mede by Birth, King of the Babylonians</p>
<p>Daniel’s Prayer for His People</p>
<p>2I, Daniel, read in the scroll that Yahveh had set 70 years for Jerusalem to lie in ruins, as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet. 3So I turned my attention to the Lord God and looked to him in prayer with fasting, burlap, and ashes. 4I confessed,            	Dan 9:1-4a</p>
<p>“Yahveh, great awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love for those who love you and keep your commandments, 5we’ve sinned, we’ve committed iniquity, we’ve acted sinfully and rebelled, we’ve turned away from your commandments and ordinances. 6We’ve ignored your prophets who spoke in your name to our kings, our officials, our ancestors, and the common people. 7You’re good, but we’re openly shameful—people of Judah, Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far in all the countries where you’ve driven us for our unfaithfulness. [8] 9You have mercy and forgiveness although we’ve rebelled, 10haven’t obeyed, haven’t followed the laws your prophets set before us. 11Because Israel has sinned against your Law and turned aside from obeying you, you’ve poured out on us and our rulers the curse you swore in the Law of Moses. 12You’ve confirmed what you said by bringing this catastrophe on us. Nothing under heaven has ever been done like what you’ve done to Jerusalem. 13This catastrophe has come on us, but we still haven’t sought your blessing by paying attention to your truth. 14So you’ve brought on us the catastrophe you held in store. You’re good in everything you do, but we still haven’t obeyed you. 15Lord our God who brought a people out of Egypt with a powerful hand and made a permanent name for yourself, we’ve sinned; we’ve been wicked. 16In keeping with all your righteous acts, turn your anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Our ancestors’ iniquities and our own sins have made Jerusalem and your people a byword to everybody around us. 17So listen to my prayer and supplication. For your honor, smile on your desolate sanctuary. 18Turn your ear and listen; open your eyes and look at the city and our desolation. We’re not presenting our supplication because we have any merits, but because you have great mercy. 19Lord, listen! forgive! do something! don’t delay! It’s your name the city and your people are wearing!   	Dan 9:4b-19</p>
<p>The Seventy-Week Prophecy</p>
<p>20While I was praying—confessing my sin and my people’s sin before Yahveh my God on behalf of his holy mountain—21the man Gabriel that I’d seen at the beginning, came to me in my exhaustion about the time of the evening offering. 22He instructed me,</p>
<p>“Daniel, I’ve come to inform you. 23When you began your supplications, a decree went out. I’m here to tell you about it because you’re highly valued. Listen so you can understand the vision.</p>
<p>24“Seventy sets of seven [hebdomads] have been decreed for your people and your holy city. That’s to end sin, to atone for iniquity, to bring everlasting goodness, to fulfill prophetic vision, to anoint a most holy place. 25Understand that from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem till Messiah the Prince will be 7 sevens plus 62 sevens [hebdomads]. It will be rebuilt with streets and a moat in a stressful time. 26Then after 62 sevens, Messiah will be killed and have nothing, and the army of the ruler that will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will come with a flood. To the end there’ll be war with desolations decreed. 27He’ll make a firm treaty with many for one set of seven [hebdomad]. In the middle of that set of seven, he’ll stop sacrifice and grain offering. As a result of his abominations, he will pour out total desolation—with destruction in turn decreed on the one that caused the desolation.”	Dan 9:20-27</p>
<p>Daniel’s Vision of a Messenger</p>
<p>10:1The third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a message came to Daniel (Belteshazzar) about great warfare. He understood the vision about future events.</p>
<p>2At that time, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three weeks. 3I didn’t eat any tasty food or meat, drink any wine, or use any lotions that whole time. 4The twenty-fourth of the first month, I was on the bank of the Tigris River. 5I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of pure gold from Uphaz around his waist. 6His body was like beryl, his face flashed like lightning, his eyes flamed like torches, his arms and feet shined like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like an enormous crowd. 7I was the only one that saw the vision, but such an overwhelming sense of dread came over the men that were with me that they ran and hid. 8So I was alone. My strength was gone, and my healthy appearance grew deathly pale. 9When I heard him start to speak, I passed out facedown on the ground.	Dan 10:1-9</p>
<p>10A hand took hold of me and helped me up shaking onto my hands and knees. 11He said, “Daniel, man highly esteemed, understand what I’m about to tell you. Stand up; I’ve been sent to you.”</p>
<p>I stood up shaking.</p>
<p>12“Don’t be afraid. You’ve been heard from the first day you determined to understand this and humble yourself before your God. I’ve come in answer to what you’ve said. 13The prince of Persia resisted me for two days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I’d been left there with the kings of Persia. 14Now I’ve come to let you understand what will happen to your people later. The vision deals with the future.”	   Dan 10:10-14</p>
<p>15When he said that, I looked down at the ground speechless. 16Someone resembling a man touched my lips, and I said to the one standing in front of me,</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m in anguish over the vision. 17How can a servant like me talk to someone like you? I feel drained. I can hardly breathe.”</p>
<p>18He touched me to encourage me, 19“Man highly esteemed, you needn’t be afraid. Be at peace, take courage!” 	Dan 10:15-18</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, my strength came back, and I said, “Go ahead and speak; you’ve strengthened me.”</p>
<p>20He said, “Do you understand why I’ve come? I’m going back now to fight the prince of Persia. The prince of Greece is coming, 21but I’ll tell you what’s inscribed in the Book of Truth. There’s nobody standing firmly with me against those forces except Michael your prince. 11:1In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to encourage and protect him. 	Dan 10:19-11:1</p>
<p>Kings of the North and South</p>
<p>2“Three more kings will come to power in Persia. A fourth will gain far more wealth than the others. As soon as he gains power by his wealth, he’ll stir up the empire against Greece. 3A strong king will come to power there and rule as he pleases. 4But not long after he ascends to power, his kingdom will break up into the four points of the compass. It won’t pass on to heirs or continue with the authority he exercised. His sovereignty will cease and pass on to others than descendants.</p>
<p>5“Then the king of the South will grow strong along with one of his commanders. But his commander will gain more power than he has and obtain a large kingdom of his own.</p>
<p>6After some years they’ll form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will be given to the king of the North to make a marriage alliance. But she won’t retain her influence there. She and her father won’t last, and they’ll be given up along with her attendants and supporters.	Dan 11:2-6</p>
<p>7“In those times, one of her relatives in the South will come to power in her place, attack the king of the North, enter his fortress, and defeat him. 8He’ll carry off their idols to Egypt, their molten images, their precious gold and silver items. For some years he’ll refrain from attacking the king of the North. 9Then the latter will invade the realm of the king of the South, but he’ll soon go back to his own land.</p>
<p>10“But the sons of the king of the North will gather a group of large forces and wage war. They’ll keep on coming, overrun, pass through, and carry the war as far as his fortress. 11Then the king of the South will be angry and go to fight the king of the North. The latter will raise a large army, but he’ll fall to the other. 12When the enemy army is defeated, the king of the South will get proud and execute thousands, but he won’t prevail for long. 13The king of the North will raise a bigger army than before; and after some years, he’ll press on with that large army and lots of equipment.       	 Dan 11:7-13</p>
<p>14“In those times, there’ll be an uprising against the king of the South. Violent men among your people will also lift themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they’ll fall. 15Then the king of the North will come, throw up a siege mound, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South won’t have the strength to stand their ground, not even their best troops. 16The one that comes against him will do as he pleases, and nobody will be able to withstand him. He’ll stay for a time in the Glorious Land and control it. 17He’ll be determined to come with the power of his whole kingdom and to bring a proposal for peace that he’ll put into effect. He’ll give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow the kingdom from within, but she won’t take a stand for him. 18Then he’ll turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many cities. But a commander will put a stop to his insolence and repay him for it. 19So he’ll take refuge in the fortresses in his own land, but he’ll stumble and fall and fall out of the picture.  	Dan 11:14-19</p>
<p>20“Then in his place one will rise up and send a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. Yet within a short time he’ll die, though not in anger or in battle. 21In his place a despicable man will come to power who isn’t in line for royal succession. He’ll come in peace time and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 22He’ll sweep away armies, including the prince of the covenant. 23After he makes various alliances, he’ll act deceitfully and seize power with a small force. 24Without warning he’ll enter the richest parts of the realm and accomplish what his predecessors had never done. He’ll distribute plunder, booty, and possessions among them. He’ll plot against fortresses, but only for a while. 25He’ll stir up his courage against the king of the South with a large army. So the king of the South will mobilize a very big army, but he won’t stand because there’ll be plots against him. 26The members of his own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be slain. 27Both kings will be intent on evil and lie to each other at the conference table; but to no avail because the end will come at the appointed time.</p>
<p>28The king of the South will head for home with considerable substance. On the way, he’ll set himself against the people of the holy covenant, and do a lot of damage before going on back to his own land.	 Dan 11:20-28</p>
<p>29“At the appointed time, he’ll invade the South again, but this time it won’t turn out like before. 30Ships from Kittim will attack him. He’ll retreat and take his out anger on the people of the holy covenant. So he’ll come and listen to the ones that forsake the holy covenant. 31His army will defile the Temple fortress, forbid the daily burnt offerings, and set up the abomination that makes desolate. 32By flattery he’ll turn to godlessness those who’ve violated the covenant, but the people that know their God will stay strong and resist him. 33Wise leaders among the people will instruct many, though they’ll fall by flame and sword, be captured and robbed. 34They’ll receive little help, and many who do join them won’t be sincere. 35Some of the wise will fall victim to persecution as a means of refining and cleansing them, making them pure till the time of the end, because the appointed time is still to come. 	Dan 11:29-35</p>
<p>36“The king will do as he pleases, put himself above every god, and blaspheme the God of gods. He’ll succeed till the time of wrath is over because what’s been decreed will happen. 37He won’t show any regard for the gods of his ancestors, for any god women favor, or for any other god. He’ll exalt himself above them all. 38Instead, he’ll honor the god of fortresses, a god his ancestors never knew. He’ll honor him with gold, silver, costly gems, and costly gifts. 39He’ll attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god, and greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He’ll make them rulers over many people and parcel out land among them as their reward.	     Dan 11:36-39</p>
<p>40“Toward the end of Israel’s time, the king of the South will attack him, and the king of the North will storm out against him like a tornado with chariots, cavalry, and a large navy. He’ll invade various lands and overrun them. 41He’ll enter the Glorious Land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and most of Ammon will escape. 42Then he’ll attack still other countries, including Egypt. 43He’ll gain control of Egypt’s precious treasures, its gold and silver. Libyans and Nubians will become his subjects. 44But alarming news will come from the east and north, and he’ll go out with great fury to exterminate many. 45He’ll pitch his royal pavilion between the sea and the beautiful Holy Mountain. Yet he’ll come to his end, and nobody will help him.	          Dan 11:40-45</p>
<p>The Time of the End</p>
<p>12:1“At that time, Michael, the great prince that guards your people, will rise up. There’ll be a distressful time like nothing since nations began. Everyone among your people who are written in the scroll will be rescued. 2Many asleep in their graves will wake up, some to eternal life, some to disgrace and eternal contempt. 3The wise will shine as bright as the sky, including those who lead many to goodness—like the stars forever. 4Close up this message, Daniel, and seal the scroll till the time of the end. People will travel everywhere and spread knowledge.”	Dan 12:1-4</p>
<p>5Then I saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river. 6One asked the man dressed in linen, who was above the river, “How long will it be till those distressful events end?” 7The man raised his hands toward the sky and swore by the One that lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. And as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, those things will come to an end. 8I heard it, but I couldn’t understand it. So I asked, “How will those things end up?”         	        Dan 12:5-8</p>
<p>9He said,</p>
<p>“Go on with your life, Daniel. Those things are secret, sealed up till the time of the end. 10Many will purify themselves, make themselves white, and be refined. The wicked won’t understand, but the wise will. 11There will be 1,290 days between the time the daily sacrifice stops and the abomination that makes desolate is set up. 12How fortunate they are who persevere to the end of the 1,335 days! 13Live out the rest of your life. You’ll enter into rest and rise again for your reward at the end of the age.”	Dan 12:9-13</p>
