<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Census of Israel’s Troops</p>
<p>1:1On the first day, second month, second year after they left Egypt, Yahveh told Moses at Sinai in the Tent of Meeting,</p>
<p>2“Take a census by families. Count the men 320 years old and up that can go to war. You and Aaron count them by armies. 4To help you, appoint one man from each tribe as head of his ancestor’s house. 5They’ll stand with you:</p>
<p>from Reuben, Elizur Ben-Shedeur;</p>
<p>6from Simeon, Shelumiel Ben-Zurishaddai;</p>
<p>7from Judah, Nahshon Ben-Amminadab;</p>
<p>8from Issachar, Nethanel Ben-Zuar;</p>
<p>9from Zebulun, Eliab Ben-Helon;</p>
<p>10from Joseph’s son Ephraim, Elishama Ben-Ammihud;</p>
<p>from Joseph’s son Manasseh, Gamaliel Ben-Pedahzur;</p>
<p>11from Benjamin, Abidan Ben-Gideoni;</p>
<p>12from Dan, Ahiezer Ben-Ammishaddai;</p>
<p>13from Asher, Pagiel Ben-Ochran;</p>
<p>14from Gad, Eliasaph Ben-Deuel;</p>
<p>15from Naphtali, Ahira Ben-Enan.</p>
<p>16Those are the appointed leaders by tribes, the heads of clans in Israel.”	 Num 1:1-16</p>
<p>17Moses and Aaron took the men God had designated 18and gathered the community on the first day, second month. [19]</p>
<p>20The count came out as follows:</p>
<p>2146,500 from Reuben, Israel’s firstborn;</p>
<p>22-2359,300 from Simeon,</p>
<p>24-2545,650 from Gad,</p>
<p>26-2774,600 from Judah,</p>
<p>28-2954,400 from Issachar,</p>
<p>30-3157,400 from Zebulun,</p>
<p>32-3340,500 from Ephraim,</p>
<p>34-3532,300 from Manasseh,</p>
<p>36-3735,400 from Benjamin,</p>
<p>38-3962,700 from Dan</p>
<p>40-4141,500 from Asher,</p>
<p>42-4353,400 from Naphtali,</p>
<p>44-46The total was 603,550. 	Num 1:17-46</p>
<p>47They didn’t count the Levites in the military census. 48Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>49“Don’t count the Levites. 50Put them in charge of the Tabernacle and everything associated with it. They’ll transport it and its furnishings, take care of it, and camp around it. 51When it sets out, they’ll dismantle it. When it camps, they’ll assemble it. Execute any layman that comes near. 52The Israelites will camp in groups by their standard in their armies. 53But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle so there won’t be any wrath on the Israelites. [54a]</p>
<p>Israel did everything Yahveh commanded Moses.	Num 1:47-54</p>
<p>The Layout of Israel’s Camp</p>
<p>2:[1] 2“The Israelites will camp with the banners of their families facing the Tent of Meeting. 3-4On the east side of the Tabernacle, Judah will camp by its standard—the army of Nahshon (74,600). 5-6Issachar will camp next to him—the army of Nethanel (54,400). 7-8Zebulun will camp with its leader Eliab (57,400). 9The Judah camp totals 186,400. It will move out first. 	Num 2:1-9</p>
<p>10-11“On the south side of the Tabernacle, Reuben will camp by its standard—the army of Elizur (46,500). 12-13Simeon will camp next to him—the army of Shelumiel (59,300). 14-15Gad will camp with its leader Eliasaph (45,650). 16The Reuben camp totals 151,450. It will move out second.</p>
<p>17“Then the Tent of Meeting will move out with the Levites in the middle of the camps.</p>
<p>18-19“On the west side of the Tabernacle, Ephraim will camp by its standard—the army of Elishama (40,500). 20-21Manasseh will camp next to him—with its leader Gamaliel (32,200). 22-23Benjamin camps next—the army of Abidan (35,400). 24The Ephraim camp totals 108,100. It will move out third. 	Num 2:10-24</p>
<p>25-26“On the north side of the Tabernacle, Dan will camp by its standard—the army of Ahiezer (62,700). 27-28Asher will camp next to him—with its leader Pagiel (41,500). 29-30Naphtali camps next—with its leader Ahira (53,400).  31The Dan camp totals 157,600. It will move out last.”</p>
<p>32The total men numbered 603,550, 33not including the Levites. 34The Israelites did everything Yahveh told Moses. They camped by their standards and went out in that order, each by family and ancestral house.	 Num 2:25-34</p>
<p>3:1The Generations of Aaron and Moses</p>
<p>When Yahveh Spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai</p>
<p>Duties of Levites</p>
<p>2The sons of Aaron were Nadab, the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar—3anointed and ordained as priests. 4In the Wilderness of Sinai, Nadab and Abihu died from offering before Yahveh fire different from what he’d commanded. They didn’t have any children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron’s lifetime.	 Num 3:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>6“Set the tribe of Levi aside to serve Aaron. 7They’ll perform duties for him and the whole community at the Tent of Meeting. They’ll service the Tabernacle 8and keep the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting in assisting with the duties of the people. 9Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. 10Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; execute any layman that tries to come near.”</p>
<p>11Again Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>12“I’ve taken the Levites from the people in place of the firstborn. 13The firstborn belong to me. When I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart to myself the firstborn people and animals in Israel. The Levites belong to me; I’m Yahveh.”	 Num 3:5-13</p>
<p>14Yahveh told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 15“Count the descendants of Levi by families—every male a month old and up.” 16Moses counted them:</p>
<p>17the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p>18 the clans descended from Gershon: Libni and Shimei.</p>
<p>19the clans descended from Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.</p>
<p>20the clans descended from Merari: Mahli and Mushi.	  	      Num 3:14-20</p>
<p>21The Libnites and Shimeites descended from Gershon. 22Their males a month old and up numbered 7,500. 23They camped west of the Tabernacle, behind it. 24Eliasaph Ben- Lael was family leader among the Gershonites. 25The sons of Gershon serviced the Tent of Meeting, including the Tabernacle and tent, its covering, the screen for the door to the Tent of Meeting, 26the hangings around the court, and the screen for the door to the court around the Tabernacle, the altar, and its cords.	     				     		     Num 3:21-26</p>
<p>27The Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites descended from Kohath. 28Their males a month old and up numbered 8,600; they serviced the sanctuary. 29They camped south of the Tabernacle. 30Elizaphan Ben-Uzziel was family leader among the Kohathites. 31The sons of Kohath serviced the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary they perform service with, and the screen.</p>
<p>32Eleazar Ben-Aaron, the chief leader from Levi, oversaw the ones that performed duties in the sanctuary.							     Num 3:27-32</p>
<p>33The Mahlites and Mushites descended from Merari. 34Their males a month old and up numbered 6,200. 35Zuriel Ben-Abihail was family leader of Merari. They camped north of the Tabernacle. 36The sons of Merari serviced the frames of the Tabernacle, its bars, posts, bases, equipment, 37together with the posts around the court with their bases, pegs, and cords.</p>
<p>38 Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped east of the Tabernacle and performed duties in the sanctuary for the obligation of Israel. Any layman that would come near was to be executed. 39The Levites that Moses and Aaron counted a month old and up numbered 22,000. 	Num 3:33-39</p>
<p>Redemption of the Firstborn</p>
<p>40Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Count by name every firstborn male in Israel a month old and up. 41Take the Levites for me in place of Israel’s firstborn sons, and take the Levites’ livestock in place of Israel’s firstborn livestock.”</p>
<p>42Moses counted Israel’s firstborn: 4322,273 males a month old and up.</p>
<p>44Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>45“The Levites belong to me; I’m Yahveh. 46For the ransom of the 273 firstborn of Israel above the number of Levites, 47take 2 oz 5 shekels per head, shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs to a shekel). 48Give the ransom money to Aaron and his sons.”</p>
<p>49Moses took the ransom money from the ones above the number ransomed by the Levites. 50From the firstborn he took the money in shekels of the sanctuary (1,365 shekels 34 lbs), 51and gave it to Aaron and his sons. 	Num 3:40-51</p>
<p>Duties of the Kohathites</p>
<p>4:1Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>2“Count the descendants of Kohath by families 330-50 years old who serve in the Tent of Meeting. 4This is the work of Kohath’s descendants with the most holy objects. 5When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons will go in and take down the screen and cover the Ark of Testimony with it. 6They’ll lay a dolphin-skin covering over it, spread a pure blue cloth over it, and insert its poles. 7Over the table for the Bread of the Presence, they’ll spread a pure blue cloth and put on it the dishes, spoons, sacrificial bowls, liquid offering jars, and the continual bread that’s on it. 8They’ll spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover it with a dolphin-skin covering, and insert its poles. 9Then they’ll take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand, its lamps, snuffers, trays, and oil jars. 10They’ll put it and its utensils in a dolphin-skin covering and put it on the carrying bars. 11They’ll spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, and cover it with a dolphin-skin covering, and insert its bars. 12They’ll take the utensils for service in the sanctuary, put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a dolphin-skin covering, and put them on the carrying bars. 13Then they’ll take away the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it. 14They’ll put its utensils on it: the firepans, forks, shovels, and basins. They’ll spread a dolphin-skin covering over it and insert its poles.</p>
<p>Num 4:1-14</p>
<p>15“After Aaron and his sons cover the holy objects and furnishings, the Kohathites will come to carry them so they won’t touch the holy objects and die.</p>
<p>16“Eleazar is responsible for the olive oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and anointing oil—the Tabernacle and everything in it, the sanctuary and its furnishings.”</p>
<p>17Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>18“Don’t let the clans of Kohath get eliminated from the Levites. 19Do this so they won’t die when they approach the most holy objects.  Have Aaron and his sons go in and assign each of them his work and his load, 20but they won’t go in to see the holy objects even for a moment; they’ll die.”  	Num 4:15-20</p>
<p>21Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>22“Count the clans of Gershon by families 2330-50 years old who serve in the Tent of Meeting. 24The Gershonites 25will carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with its covering and the dolphin-skin covering that’s on top of it, the screen for the door to the Tent of Meeting, 26the hangings for the court, the screen for the door to the court that’s around the Tabernacle and the altar, their cords, and the equipment for their service and everything that’s to be done. 27The Gershonites will serve under Aaron and his sons. You’ll assign them their loads. 28Ithamar Ben-Aaron will direct the Gershonites’ service.</p>
<p>Num 4:21-28</p>
<p>29“Count the descendants of Merari by families 3030-50 years old who serve with the Tent of Meeting. 31They’ll carry the boards of the Tabernacle, its bars, posts, and bases; 32the posts around the court, their bases, pegs, and cords, with their equipment and service. 33Assign each man by name what he’s supposed to carry. Ithamar will direct their service.”  	Num 4:29-33</p>
<p>34Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites 3530-50 years old who served with the Tent of Meeting: 362,750. [37]</p>
<p>38-41The Gershonites 30-50 years old by family, numbered 2,630. 42The men counted from the families of Merari 4330-50 years old who served in the Tent of Meeting, numbered 443,200. [45]</p>
<p>46The Levites that Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted 4730-50 years old who carried the Tent of Meeting, numbered 488,580. 49Moses counted them.  	Num 4:34-49</p>
<p>Purity in Israel’s Camp</p>
<p>5:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>2“Tell Israel to send outside the camp any leper, anybody with a discharge, anyone ceremonially unclean because of a dead person. 3Send out male or female so they won’t defile their camp where I live.”</p>
<p>4They did that.	 Num 5:1-4</p>
<p>5-6Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel,</p>
<p>“When a man or woman sins against Yahveh by sinning against another person, 7the offender will confess and pay restitution plus a fifth to the one that was wronged. 8If there’s no relative to receive the restitution, it goes to Yahveh for the priest in addition to the ram offered for the atonement. 9The priest will also receive every contribution associated with the holy gifts people offer. 10Everybody’s holy gifts belong to the priest.    	Num 5:5-10</p>
<p>The Test for Adultery</p>
<p>[11] 12-13“If a husband suspects his wife has been unfaithful, 14-15he can take her to the priest. He’s to take .11 bushel .1 ephah of barley meal as an offering for her. He won’t pour oil on it or put frankincense on it because it’s a grain offering of jealousy, a reminder of sin.</p>
<p>16“The priest will have her stand in Yahveh’s presence. 17He’ll take holy water in a clay jar, take some dust from the floor of the Tabernacle, and put it in the water. 18He’ll let her hair down loose and place the memorial grain offering in her hands. The priest will have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse. 19He’ll have her take an oath, ‘If no man has had intercourse with you while under your husband’s authority, be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse. 20But if you’ve defiled yourself with another man,’ [21then he’ll have her swear the oath] ‘may Yahveh make you a curse among your people. 22This water will make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away.’ She’ll say, ‘True. True.’	Num 5:11-22</p>
<p>23“The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the water. 24Then he’ll have her drink the water. 25The priest will take the grain offering of jealousy from her, wave it in front of Yahveh, and take it to the altar. 26He’ll take a handful of the memorial grain offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar. Afterward he’ll have her drink the water. 27If she’s been unfaithful, the water will cause bitterness. Her abdomen will swell, her thigh will waste away, and she’ll become a curse among her people. 28If she hasn’t defiled herself, she’ll be free and can conceive children.</p>
<p>29“That’s the law of jealousy 30when a husband suspects his wife has gone astray. 31The husband won’t be responsible, but she’ll be held guilty.”</p>
<p>Num 5:23-31</p>
<p>The Nazirite Vow</p>
<p>6:1-2Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel,</p>
<p>“When men or women take a Nazarite vow to dedicate themselves to Yahveh, 3they must abstain from wine and strong drink and from vinegar made from them. They can’t drink grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins. 4They’re not to eat anything a grapevine produces from seeds to skin.</p>
<p>5During that time, they have to let their hair grow. 6-7They can’t make themselves ceremonially unclean by going near a dead body even for a parent or sibling that dies. [8]    	Num 6:1-8</p>
<p>9“If someone dies suddenly beside them and defiles their dedicated head, they’ll shave it the same day and on the seventh day. 10The eighth day, they’ll take two turtledoves or young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 11The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; that will purify them from their defilement. That same day they’ll reconsecrate their head, 12dedicate to Yahveh their days as a Nazirite, and take a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. Their previous days of separation are void.  	Num 6:9-12</p>
<p>13“When Nazirites finish their time of separation, they’ll take an offering to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 14and present it to Yahveh:</p>
<p>one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering,</p>
<p>one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering,</p>
<p>one ram without defect for a peace offering, 15and</p>
<p>a basket of cakes of fine flour without yeast mixed with oil and</p>
<p>wafers without yeast spread with olive oil, along with</p>
<p>their grain offering and liquid offerings.</p>
<p>16The priest will present them all to Yahveh. [17] 18Then the Nazirite will shave their head and put the dedicated hair on the fire that’s under the peace offering. 19The priest will take the ram’s boiled shoulder, one cake and wafer without yeast out of the basket, and put them in the Nazirites’ hands. 20The priest will wave them in front of Yahveh. They’re set apart for the priest, together with the chest offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up. Afterward Nazirites can drink wine again.</p>
<p>21“That’s the law for Nazirites that vow their offering to Yahveh for their separation in addition to what else they can afford.” 	Num 6:13-21</p>
<p>Aaron’s Blessing</p>
<p>22Yahveh told Moses to have Aaron and his sons 23pronounce this blessing on Israel:</p>
<p>24“Yahveh bless you and keep you.</p>
<p>25Yahveh smile on you</p>
<p>and be gracious to you.</p>
<p>26Yahveh lift up his countenance on you</p>
<p>and give you peace.”</p>
<p>27“In that way they’ll invoke my name on the people, and I’ll bless them.”  	Num 6:22-27</p>
<p>Offerings of Dedication</p>
<p>7:1The day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated its furnishings, the altar, and its utensils. 2The leaders in Israel (besides the numbered men) made an offering 3and brought it to the Tabernacle: 6 covered carts and 12 cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. 4Yahveh told Moses, 5“Accept these things for use in the Tent of Meeting. Give them to each Levite according to his service.” 6Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: 72 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon’s descendants to match their service, 8and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari’s descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar Ben-Aaron. 9He didn’t give any to Kohath’s descendants because their service was with the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders. 10The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar. 	Num 7:1-10</p>
<p>11Then Yahveh told Moses, “Have them present their offering, one leader a day, for the dedication of the altar.” [Each leader presented the same offering as follows:]</p>
<p>13one silver platter that weighed 3¼ lbs 130 shekels,</p>
<p>one silver bowl that weighed 28 oz 70 shekels of the sanctuary—</p>
<p>both full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;</p>
<p>14one gold pan weighing 4 oz 10 shekels, full of incense;</p>
<p>15one bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;</p>
<p>16one male goat for a sin offering;</p>
<p>17two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs a year old for peace</p>
<p>offerings.</p>
<p>12The first day, Nahshon Ben-Amminadab, from Judah, presented his offering.</p>
<p>18The second day, Nethanel Ben-Zuar, leader of Issachar, presented his offering.</p>
<p>24The third day, Eliab Ben-Helon, leader of Zebulun, presented.</p>
<p>30The fourth day, Elizur Ben-Shedeur, leader of Reuben, presented.</p>
<p>36The fifth day, Shelumiel Ben-Zurishaddai, leader of Simeon, presented.</p>
<p>42The sixth day, Eliasaph Ben-Deuel, leader of Gad, presented.</p>
<p>48The seventh day, Elishama Ben-Ammihud, leader of Ephraim, presented.</p>
<p>54The eighth day, Gamaliel Ben-Pedahzur, leader of Manasseh, presented.</p>
<p>60The ninth day, Abidan Ben-Gideoni, leader of Benjamin, presented.</p>
<p>66The tenth day, Ahiezer Ben-Ammishaddai, leader of Benjamin, presented.</p>
<p>72The eleventh day, Pagiel Ben-Ochran, leader of Asher, presented.</p>
<p>78The twelfth day, Ahira Ben-Enan, leader of Naphtali, presented.</p>
<p>[19-23] = [25-29] = [31-35] = [37-41] = [43-47] = [49-53] = [55-59] = [61-65] = [67-71] =</p>
<p>[73-77] = [79-83] repeats of 13-17. 	Num 7:11-83</p>
<p>84That was the dedication offering for the altar from the leaders of Israel when it was anointed: 12 silver platters, 12 silver bowls, 12 gold saucers, 85each silver platter weighing 3¼ lbs 130 shekels and each bowl weighing 28 oz 70 shekels. The silver of the utensils weighed 60 lbs 2,400 shekels of the sanctuary. 86The 12 gold saucers full of incense weighed 4 oz 10 shekels apiece—3 lbs 120 shekels altogether. 87For the burnt offerings there were 12 bulls, 12 rams, 12 male lambs a year old with their grain offerings, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. 88For the peace offerings there were 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, 60 male lambs a year old. That was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed.</p>
<p>89Whenever Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak to Yahveh, he’d hear a voice speaking to him from between the two cherubs above the mercy seat on the Ark of Testimony.</p>
<p>Num 7:84-89</p>
<p>The Seven Lamps</p>
<p>8:1Yahveh told Moses 2to have Aaron put up the 7 lamps to shine in front of the lampstand. 3Aaron did that. 4The lampstand was hammered gold from its base to its flowers in the pattern Yahveh showed Moses.	 Num 8:1-4</p>
<p>The Levites Dedicated</p>
<p>5Again Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>6“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them. 7For their cleansing, sprinkle purifying water on them, have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. 8Then have them take a bull with its grain offering—fine flour mixed with olive oil. Take a second bull for a sin offering. 9Present the Levites at the Tent of Meeting and gather the community. 10Have them put their hands on the Levites. 11Then Aaron will present the Levites to Yahveh as a wave offering from the people to qualify them to perform service to Yahveh. 12The Levites will put their hands on the bulls’ heads. They’ll offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to atone for the Levites. 13Have the Levites stand in the presence of Aaron and his sons to present them as a wave offering to Yahveh.  								       Num 8:5-13</p>
<p>14“In that way, set the Levites apart from among the Israelites. The Levites will belong to me. 15Then they can serve in the Tent of Meeting. But you’ll cleanse them and present them as a wave offering, 16because I’ve dedicated them to myself in place of every firstborn in Israel. 17Every firstborn belongs to me among people and animals. The day I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. [18] 19I’ve given the Levites to Aaron and his sons to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting, and to atone for them so there won’t be a plague on Israel from coming near the sanctuary.”</p>
<p>20That’s what Moses, Aaron, and the community did with the Levites. 21The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron presented them as a wave offering and atoned for them. 22Afterwards they went into the Tent of Meeting to perform their service with Aaron and his sons.	 Num 8:14-22</p>
<p>23Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>24“The Levites will serve in the Tent of Meeting from age 25 to 50 25and then retire. 26They can, however, help their relatives in the Tent of Meeting in keeping an obligation, but they themselves can’t work.”  	Num 8:23-26</p>
<p>The Second Passover</p>
<p>9:1In the first month, second year after the Israelites left Egypt, Yahveh told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 2-3“Have Israel observe Passover as directed at its scheduled time: the fourteenth day of this month in the evening.” 4Moses told the Israelites to observe it. 5They did so in the Wilderness of Sinai the way Yahveh commanded Moses. 	Num 9:1-5</p>
<p>6Some men were ceremonially unclean because of a corpse, so they couldn’t observe it that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day, 7“Although we’re unclean, why can’t we present the offering to Yahveh at the scheduled time with the rest of Israel?”</p>
<p>8Moses said, “I’ll listen to what Yahveh says.”</p>
<p>9-10Yahveh told him to tell Israel,</p>
<p>“If any of you becomes ceremonially unclean because of a dead person or being on a long trip, go ahead and observe the Passover to Yahveh. 11Observe it on the fourteenth day, second month in the evening. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 12Don’t leave any of it till morning or break a bone of it. 13But any of you that’s clean and not on a trip and doesn’t observe it, will be excluded from Israel. You didn’t present the offering to Yahveh as scheduled. You’ll be held guilty. 14Any foreigner living among you may observe Passover as directed. You’ll have one statute for foreigners and citizens.” 	 Num 9:6-14</p>
<p>The Cloud over the Tabernacle</p>
<p>15The day they set up the Tabernacle (the Tent of Testimony), the cloud covered it. In the evening, what looked like fire appeared over it till morning. 16That became the pattern: the cloud covered it during the day and what looked like fire covered it at night. 17Whenever the cloud lifted, the Israelites would set out. Where it settled, they’d camp. 18As Yahveh directed Moses, they’d set out or camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle, they stayed at that camp 19even if it was for a long time. [20] 21If the cloud stayed all night and lifted in the morning, they’d move out in the morning. If it stayed all day and lifted at night, they’d move out in the evening. 22Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, they wouldn’t move till the cloud lifted. [23]	 Num 9:15-23</p>
<p>The Silver Trumpets</p>
<p>10:1Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>2“Make two bugles out of hammered silver. Use them to gather the community or move the camp out. 3Blow both bugles to gather the community at the Tent of Meeting. 4Blow one bugle to gather just the leaders of thousands there.</p>
<p>5“When you blow the signal, the camps pitched on the east side will set out. 6When you blow the signal again, the camps pitched on the south side will set out. 7When assembling the community, however, blow without sounding an alarm. 8By permanent statute the priestly descendants of Aaron will blow the bugles. 9When you go to war in your country against an attacker, blow the signal with the bugle, so Yahveh will remember you and save you from your enemies. 10At celebrations, at scheduled festivals, and on the first day of the month, blow the bugles over your burnt offerings and peace offerings to remind your God about you. I’m Yahveh your God.” 	Num 10:1-10</p>
<p>Israel Leaves Sinai</p>
<p>11On the twentieth day, second month, second year, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle. 12The Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai and came to rest in the Wilderness of Paran. 13That was the first time they moved at Yahveh’s directive through Moses. 14The standard of Judah’s camp set out first, with Nahshon over its army, 15Nethanel over Issachar’s tribal army, 16and Eliab over Zebulun’s tribal army. 	Num 10:11-16</p>
<p>17The Levites dismantled the Tabernacle; the descendants of Gershon and Merari set out carrying it. 18Next, Reuben’s standard set out with Elizur over its army, 19Shelumiel over Simeon’s tribal army, 20and Eliasaph over Gad’s tribal army.</p>
<p>21Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects, and the Tabernacle would already be set up before they arrived. 22Next, Ephraim’s standard set out with Elishama over its army, 23Gamaliel over Manasseh’s army, 24and Abidan over Benjamin’s army.</p>
<p>25Then Dan’s standard, the rear guard for the camps, set out with Ahiezer over its army, 26Pagiel over Asher’s army, 27and Ahira over Naphtali’s army. 28That was the order of the Israelite’s tribal armies.	 Num 10:17-28</p>
<p>29Moses told Hobab Ben-Reuel/Jethro from Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, “We’re setting out to the place Yahveh said he’d give us. Go with us and we’ll do you good because heY has promised good for Israel.”</p>
<p>30But he said, “No; I’ll go to my own territory and relatives.”</p>
<p>31Moses said,</p>
<p>“Don’t leave. You know where to camp in the open country. You can be our eyes. 32If you go with us, whatever good Yahveh does for us we’ll do for you.”</p>
<p>Num 10:29-32</p>
<p>33They set out from the mountain of Yahveh on a three-day journey, with the Ark of the Covenant in front, to find a resting place. 34The cloud of Yahveh was over them during the day when they set out from the camp.</p>
<p>35When the Ark set out, Moses would say,</p>
<p>“Rise up, Yahveh!</p>
<p>Scatter your enemies;</p>
<p>make the ones that hate you flee.”</p>
<p>36When the Ark came to rest, he’d say,</p>
<p>“Come back, Yahveh,</p>
<p>to the countless thousands in Israel.” 	Num 10:33-36</p>
<p>The People Complain</p>
<p>11:1The people started complaining about their hardships. Yahveh’s anger flared. It burned among them and burned up the outskirts of the camp. 2The people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to Yahveh, and the fire died down. 3The name of that place became Taberah, because Yahveh’s fire “burned” among them.</p>
<p>4Some riffraff among them had selfish interests and cried out again,</p>
<p>“Who’s going to feed us? 5We remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. 6Now our appetite’s gone. There’s nothing to look at except this manna.”</p>
<p>7The manna was like coriander seed and looked like bdellium. 8The people would go around and gather it up, grind it between millstones, mash it in mortars, or boil it in pots and make cakes. The cakes tasted like they were baked with olive oil. 9The manna would fall with the dew at night.	  Num 11:1-9</p>
<p>10Moses heard the families whining at the entrance to their tents. Yahveh’s anger kindled greatly, and Moses wasn’t pleased. 11He asked Yahveh,</p>
<p>“Why be so hard on me? How have I displeased you that you’ve laid the responsibility for all these people on me? 12Was I the one that conceived them and had them, that you should tell me to carry them in my arms like a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land you swore to their ancestors? 13Where can I get meat for all these people? They’re crying to me for something to eat!’ 14I can’t carry them; they’re too heavy. 15If you’re going to deal with me this way, take my life now if I’m pleasing to you. Spare me the misery.”	Num 11:10-15</p>
<p>Elders Appointed to Help Moses</p>
<p>16Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Gather the 70 elders and their officers at the Tent of Meeting. Have them stand there with you. 17I’ll come down and speak to you and take the Spirit that’s on you and put on them. They’ll bear responsibility for the people, too, so you won’t be bearing it by yourself. 18Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you’ll eat meat because you’ve cried, “Oh that someone would feed us! We were well-off in Egypt.” Yahveh will give you meat and you’ll eat it—19not 1 day, 2 days, 5, 10, or 20 days, 20but for a whole month, till it comes out your nostrils and you get sick of it. That’s because you’ve rejected Yahveh that’s among you and whined to his face, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”</p>
<p>21But Moses said,</p>
<p>“There are 600,000 people around me; yet you’ve said you’d give them meat for a month. 22Should they butcher flocks and herds to get enough or try to catch all the fish in the sea?”</p>
<p>23Yahveh said, “Am I limited? You’ll see if what I said comes true.” 	Num 11:16-23</p>
<p>24Moses told the people what Yahveh said. He gathered the 70 elders and stationed them around the tent. 25Yahveh came down in the cloud and spoke to him. The Spirit that was on Moses he put on them. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they never did it again.</p>
<p>26Two men had remained in the camp, Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested on them, and they kept on prophesying. (They were among the ones that had been registered but hadn’t gone out to the Tent.) 27A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” 	  						  					   Num 11:24-27</p>
<p>28Joshua Ben-Nun, Moses’ assistant from his youth, said, “Moses, my lord, stop them.”</p>
<p>29“Are you jealous for me? Oh that all Yahveh’s people were prophets, and he would put his Spirit on them.”</p>
<p>30Moses and the elders went back to the camp.</p>
<p>The LORD Sends Quail</p>
<p>31Yahveh made a wind blow from the sea to bring quail. They fell about a day’s walk away all around the camp—about 3ft deep all over the ground. 32The people spent all day, all night, and the next day picking them up and spreading them out all around the camp. The least anybody gathered was 62.5 bushels. 33While they chewed the meat, Yahveh’s anger flared at them; he struck them with a severe plague. 34So they called the place Kibroth-hattaavah, because they put in “graves” the people that had been “greedy.” 35From Kibroth-hattaavah they set out for Hazaroth and stayed there.	   	  	   			   Num 11:28-35</p>
<p>Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses</p>
<p>12:1Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses for the Nubian woman he’d married. 2“Has Yahveh indeed only spoken through you? Hasn’t he spoken through us too?” Yahveh heard it. (3Moses was the humblest man in the world.) 4At once, Yahveh told Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out to the Tent of Meeting.” 5He came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent to call Aaron and Miriam. When they’d come forward, 6he said,</p>
<p>“Listen to what I’m saying:</p>
<p>if there’s a prophet among you,</p>
<p>I’ll show myself to him in a vision</p>
<p>or speak to him in a dream.</p>
<p>7Not so with Moses;</p>
<p>he’s faithful in my house.</p>
<p>8I speak to him directly, clearly,</p>
<p>not in dark sayings;</p>
<p>he sees my form.</p>
<p>Why then weren’t you afraid</p>
<p>to criticize him?”		Num 12:1-8</p>
<p>9Yahveh’s anger burned against them, and he left. 10When the cloud withdrew from over the Tent, Miriam had leprosy as white as snow. When Aaron turned and saw it, 11he told Moses, “Don’t hold that foolish sin against us. 12Don’t leave her like somebody dead, with flesh half eaten away at birth.”</p>
<p>13Moses cried out to Yahveh, “God, heal her!”</p>
<p>14Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“If her father had only spit in her face, wouldn’t she have borne her disgrace for a week? Quarantine her outside the camp for a week. Then she can come back.”</p>
<p>15So they did; the people didn’t move on till she returned. 16Then they moved out from Hazeroth to the Wilderness of Paran.	Num 12:9-16</p>
<p>Spies Sent into Canaan</p>
<p>13:1Yahveh told Moses, 2“Send one leader from each tribe to spy out Canaan that I’m giving to Israel.”</p>
<p>3Moses sent out these leaders from Paran:</p>
<p>4from Reuben, Shammua Ben-Zaccur;</p>
<p>5from Simeon, Shaphat Ben-Hori;</p>
<p>6from Judah, Caleb Ben-Jephunneh;</p>
<p>7from Issachar, Igal Ben-Joseph;</p>
<p>8from Ephraim, Hoshea Ben-Nun, (16bthat Moses called Joshua);</p>
<p>9from Benjamin, Palti Ben-Raphu;</p>
<p>10from Zebulun, Gaddiel Ben-Sodi;</p>
<p>11from Joseph, tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi Ben-Susi;</p>
<p>12from Dan, Ammiel Ben-Gemalli;</p>
<p>13from Asher, Sethur Ben-Michael;</p>
<p>14from Naphtali, Nahbi Ben-Vophsi;</p>
<p>15from Gad, Geuel Ben-Machi.					     Num 13:1-15</p>
<p>16aMoses sent them to spy out the land.</p>
<p>17He told them,</p>
<p>“Go up into the Negev, then to the hill country. 18See what the land is like, how strong the people are, how many there are. 19See if the land is good or bad. See if the towns are like open camps or if they’re fortified. 20Is the ground lush or with little vegetation? Do they have trees? Bring back some fruit.”</p>
<p>It was the season for the first-ripe grapes.</p>
<p>21They spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob to Lebo-hamath. 22After they’d gone up to the Negev, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron was built 7 years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23They went to the Valley of Eshcol and cut off a branch with a single cluster of grapes. They carried it on a pole between two men along with some pomegranates and figs. 24They called that place The Valley of Eshcol because of the “cluster” of grapes they cut off there. 	Num 13:16-24</p>
<p>The Report of the Spies</p>
<p>25When they came back after 40 days, 26they went to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back their report and showed them the fruit from the land:</p>
<p>27“We went into the land, and it does flow with milk and honey. Here’s some of its fruit. 28But the people are strong, and the towns are fortified and big. Besides, we saw descendants of Anak there. 29Amalek lives in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.”</p>
<p>30Caleb quieted the people in front of Moses, “We should certainly go up and take possession of it. We can conquer it.”</p>
<p>31But the men that had gone up with him said, “We can’t go up against the people. They’re too strong for us.”</p>
<p>32They gave the people a discouraging report,</p>
<p>“The land overruns its people. They’re big people. 33We saw the Nephilim [Descendants of Anak are one part of the Nephilim.]; we felt like grasshoppers, and that’s what we looked like to them.”	Num 13:25-33</p>
<p>The People Rebel</p>
<p>14:1The community cried out loud that night 2and complained to Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>“We should’ve died in Egypt! We should’ve died in the desert! 3Why is Yahveh taking us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and little ones will become spoils of war. Wouldn’t we be better off to go back to Egypt?”</p>
<p>4They said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and go back.”</p>
<p>5Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in front of the assembly. 6Joshua Ben-Nun and Caleb Ben-Jephunneh tore their clothes 7and told them,</p>
<p>“The land we passed through is really good land. 8If Yahveh is pleased with us, he’ll take us in and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 9Don’t rebel against him or be afraid of them; they’ll be our prey. Their protection has been removed, and Yahveh is with us.”</p>
<p>10But the community said to stone them. Then the glory of Yahveh appeared in the Tent of Meeting to the Israelites, 11and he told Moses,</p>
<p>“How long will these people spurn me? How long will they not trust me despite all the signs I’ve performed among them? 12I’ll hit them with a plague and disinherit them; I’ll make you into a nation bigger and stronger than them.”</p>
<p>Num 14:1-12</p>
<p>Moses Intercedes for the People</p>
<p>13But Moses told him,</p>
<p>“The Egyptians will hear about it, because by your strength you brought these people up from among them, 14and they’ll tell the people in this land. They’ve heard you’re among the people. You’re seen eye to eye while your cloud stands over them, and you lead them with a pillar of cloud in the daytime and a pillar of fire at night. 15If you kill this whole nation, the nations that have heard of your fame will say 16youY couldn’t take them to the land you promised them with an oath; so you killed them in the desert. 17Let yours power be great, like you’ve said, 18‘You’reY slow to get angry, you abound in kindness, and forgive sin. But you won’t by any means acquit the guilty. You visit the consequences of parents’ sin on their descendants for three or four generations.’ 19Pardon these people in keeping with your great kindness—like you’ve done from Egypt till now.”</p>
<p>God Measures Out Judgment</p>
<p>20Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“I’ll pardon them; 21but as I live, I’ll fill the whole world with my glory. 22The people saw my glory and signs in Egypt and in the desert, but they’ve tested me ten times and ignored me. 23None of them that spurned me will see the land I swore to their ancestors. 24I’ll take my servant Caleb in. He’s had a different spirit and followed me faithfully. His descendants will take possession of it. 25The Amalekites and Canaanites live in the valleys. Turn around tomorrow and set out to the open country by the Red Sea.” 	Num 14:13-25</p>
<p>26Yahveh said to Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>27“How long will I bear with this evil community and their complaints against me. 26-28Tell them, ‘As I live,’ Yahveh says, ‘as you’ve said what I can hear, I’ll say what you can hear. 29Your corpses will fall in this desert—everyone 20 years old and up that’s criticized me. 30You won’t come into the land I swore to settle you in—except Caleb and Joshua. 31I’ll take in the little ones you said would be prey. They’ll experience the land you rejected. [32] 33Your offspring will be shepherds in the desert for 40 years. Because of your unfaithfulness, they’ll suffer till your corpses lie in the desert. 34So you’ll realize how displeased I am, you’ll suffer for your guilt one year for every day you spied out the land. 35I’ve spoken, and I’ll do it to this community that has united against me: you’ll die in this desert.”</p>
<p>36-37The men that got the community to criticize Moses because of their bad report, died by a plague in Yahveh’s presence. 38But Joshua and Caleb remained alive.  	Num 14:26-38</p>
<p>Israel Defeated in Battle</p>
<p>39When Moses told that to the people, they mourned greatly. 40But in the morning, they got up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, “Here we are. We’ve indeed sinned, but we’ll go up to the place Yahveh promised.”</p>
<p>41But Moses said,</p>
<p>“Why sin against hisY command? It won’t work. 42Don’t go; your enemies will strike you down. Yahveh’s not with you. 43The Amalekites and Canaanites will confront you, and you’ll fall by the sword because you rejected him.”</p>
<p>44But they went up anyway to the ridge of the hill country. Moses and the Ark stayed in camp. 45The Amalekites and Canaanites attacked them and beat them back to Hormah. 	Num 14:39-45</p>
<p>Laws About Sacrifices</p>
<p>15:1-2Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel,</p>
<p>“When you go into the land I’m giving you, 3make a burnt offering to meY—a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, a free-will offering, at your scheduled times. Make a pleasing aroma from the herd or flock.</p>
<p>4“When you present your offering, present a grain offering made from .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 pints ¼ hin of olive oil.  5Prepare wine for the liquid offering, 3 pints ¼ hin, with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for each lamb.</p>
<p>6“For a ram, prepare as a grain offering .22 bushel .2 ephah of fine flour mixed with ⅓⅓ him of olive oil. 7For a liquid offering, offer ⅓ gallon ⅓ hin of wine as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 	Num 15:1-7</p>
<p>8“When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice—to fulfill a special vow or for peace offerings to Yahveh—9offer it with a grain offering made from .33 bushel .3 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 quarts ½ hin of olive oil. 10Offer as the liquid offering 3 quarts ½ hin of wine as an offering by fire, as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 11That’s the way it’s to be done for each ox, ram, male lamb, or goat, 12the same for each sacrifice.</p>
<p>13“Every citizen of you will do those things when you present an offering by fire, as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 14If foreigners staying with you—temporarily or permanently—want to make an offering by fire, they’ll do it the same way you do. 15-16There’ll be one statute, one law, one ordinance for you and for foreigners among you throughout your generations.” 	Num 15:8-16</p>
<p>17-18Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel,</p>
<p>“When you go into the land where I’m taking you 19and you eat the food that’s there, lift up an offering to Yahveh.   20-21From the first of your dough, lift up a cake as an offering from the threshing floor.	 Num 15:17-21</p>
<p>Unintentional Sins</p>
<p>22-23“When the whole community unintentionally fails to observe any commandment, 24they’ll offer 1 bull for a burnt offering (as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh, with its grain offering and liquid offering) and 1 male goat for a sin offering. 25The priest will atone for the whole community because they brought the offering to Yahveh for their error. 26He’ll forgive the community, including any foreigner among them, since it wasn’t intentional.	 Num 15:22-26</p>
<p>27“If one of you sins unintentionally, offer a year-old female goat for a sin offering. 28The priest will atone for you in front of Yahveh. 29For doing something unintentionally, there’ll be one law for a native and a foreigner.</p>
<p>30“But if you do something intentionally, native or foreign, you’re blaspheming Yahveh. You’ll be excluded from the community. 31Your guilt will remain because you’ve disregarded Yahveh’s message and broken his commandment.”</p>
<p>Execution of a Sabbath Breaker</p>
<p>32When Israel was in the desert, they found a fellow gathering wood on the Sabbath. 33They brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the community. 34They put him in custody because it hadn’t been specified what should happen to him. 35Yahveh told Moses, “Execute him. Have the community stone him outside the camp.” 36The community took him outside the camp and stoned him.				  		   	   	   	   	   Num 15:27-36</p>
<p>Tassels on Clothing</p>
<p>37Yahveh also said to Moses,</p>
<p>38“Tell Israel to make tassels for the hems of their cloaks throughout their generations. Put a blue cord on the tassel for each corner. 39When you see it, remember to do everything Yahveh commands instead of doing what’s in your own mind and thereby becoming a prostitute. 40Set yourselves apart to your God. 41I’m Yahveh who brought you out of Egypt to be your God.” 	Num 15:37-41</p>
<p>Korah’s Rebellion</p>
<p>16:1Korah Ben-Izhar Ben-Kohath Ben-Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab and On Ben-Peleth (descendants of Reuben)—2together with 250 prominent chosen leaders of the community, well-known men chosen by the assembly—rebelled against Moses and some of the people. 3They gathered against Moses and Aaron, and said,</p>
<p>“You’ve gone far enough. The whole community is holy, every one of them, and Yahveh’s among them. Why place yourselves above Yahveh’s assembly?”	 Num 16:1-3</p>
<p>4When Moses heard it, he fell on his face. 5Then he told Korah and his company,</p>
<p>“Tomorrow morning Yahveh will show who’s his and who’s holy. He’ll bring near the one he chooses. 6You and your company, take censers 7tomorrow and put fire in them and incense on them in Yahveh’s presence. The man heY designates will be the one that’s holy. You’ve gone far enough, you descendants of Levi. [8] 9Aren’t you satisfied that God has set you apart from the community, and brought you near to service the Tabernacle and perform service to the community? 10Isn’t it enough that he’s brought you near? Are you trying to usurp the priesthood too? 11You and your company have gathered against Yahveh. Why criticize Aaron?”  	Num 16:4-11</p>
<p>12Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said,</p>
<p>“We’re not coming. 13Isn’t it enough that you’ve brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in a desert? You also want to lord it over us. 14You haven’t brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey. You haven’t given us fields and vineyards to inherit. Do you want to put out these men’s eyes? We’re not coming!”</p>
<p>15Moses was really mad and said to Yahveh, “Don’t regard their offering! I haven’t taken a single donkey of theirs or harmed any of them.” 16Moses told Korah,</p>
<p>“You and your company, along with Aaron, present yourselves to Yahveh tomorrow. 17Each of you 250 and Aaron, take your firepans, put incense on them, and bring them to Yahveh.”</p>
<p>18They took their censers and put fire and incense on them. They stood at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. 19Korah gathered the community against them there. The glory of Yahveh appeared to the whole community.	 Num 16:12-19</p>
<p>20He told Moses and Aaron, 21“Get away from the community so I can consume them instantly.”</p>
<p>22But they fell on their faces and said, “God, God of everyone’s spirit, when one person sins, will you direct your anger at the whole community?”</p>
<p>23He said to Moses and Aaron, 24“Tell them to get away from where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram live.”	   Num 16:20-24</p>
<p>25Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders followed him. 26He told the community, “Get away from these men’s tents. Don’t touch anything that’s theirs or you’ll get swept away in their sin.” 27They got away from where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram lived. Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents with their wives, sons, and little ones. 28Moses said,</p>
<p>“This is how you’ll know Yahveh has sent me to do this; it’s not my idea. 29If these men die naturally or suffer a typical fate, Yahveh hasn’t sent me. 30But if he causes something entirely new and the ground opens up and swallows them and what’s theirs, you’ll understand that they’ve rejected Yahveh.” 	Num 16:25-30</p>
<p>31Just as he finished speaking, the ground under them gaped open. 32It swallowed them, their families, the people that belonged to Korah, and their possessions. 33They all went down to Sheol alive, and the ground closed back over them. 34Everybody around them fled at their outcry, “The ground may swallow us!” 35Fire from Yahveh also consumed the 250 men that were offering incense.</p>
<p>36Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>37“Tell Eleazar to pick up the censers from the blaze and scatter the embers. 38Hammer the censors into sheets for plating the altar, since they did present them to Yahveh and they’re holy. They’ll serve as a sign for Israel.”</p>
<p>39Eleazar took the bronze censers and hammered them out as plating for the altar. 40That was to remind Israel that no layman—someone not descended from Aaron—should come to burn incense to Yahveh; he’d end up like Korah and his company. 	Num 16:31-40</p>
<p>41But the next day the community criticized Moses and Aaron, “You made Yahveh’s people die.” 42However, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahveh appeared. 43They went to the front of the Tent, 44and Yahveh told Moses, 45“Get away from the community so I can consume them all at once.” They fell on their faces. 46Moses told Aaron,</p>
<p>“Take your censer, put fire in it from the altar, and add incense to it. Hurry and take it to the community and atone for them. Yahveh’s anger has gone out and started a plague!”</p>
<p>47Aaron did that and ran into the assembly and put on the incense and atoned for them. 48He stood between the dead and living, and the plague stopped. 49But 14,700 died from it besides the ones that died because of Korah. 50Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting because the plague had stopped. 	Num 16:41-50</p>
<p>Aaron’s Rod That Budded</p>
<p>17:1Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>2“Tell the Israelites to get a rod from each family leader. Write each man’s name on his rod 3and write Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod. 4Then put them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony where I meet you.  5The rod of the man I choose will sprout. I’ll stifle the criticism of your critics.</p>
<p>6Moses told the Israelites to give him a rod for each family leader (12 rods) with Aaron’s rod among them. 7Moses put the rods in front of Yahveh in the Tent of Testimony. 	Num 17:1-7</p>
<p>8The next day Moses went into the Tent, and Aaron’s rod had sprouted, put out buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 9Moses brought out the rods as the Israelites watched and each man took his rod. 10But Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Put Aaron’s rod back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign against the rebels so you can stop their complaining against me and they don’t die.”</p>
<p>11Moses did that.</p>
<p>12The Israelites said to Moses, “We’re perishing! We’re all dying! 13Everybody that goes near the Tabernacle dies. Are we all going to perish?”  	 Num 17:8-13</p>
<p>Duties of Priests and Levites</p>
<p>18:1So Yahveh told Aaron,</p>
<p>“You, your sons, and your father’s family will be responsible for the sanctuary. You and your sons will be responsible for the priesthood. 2But take your relatives from the tribe of Levi to help you while you and your sons serve in the Tent of Testimony. 3They’ll make preparations throughout the Tent, but they can’t approach the sanctuary furnishings or the altar, or they and you will die. 4An outsider can’t come near you. 5They’ll tend to preparations for the sanctuary and the altar so there won’t be any more anger on Israel. 6I’ll give your fellow Levites to you, dedicated to Yahveh, to service the Tent of Meeting. 7But you and your sons will tend to everything around the altar and inside the curtain. I’m giving you the priesthood as a service; execute any outsider that comes near.”</p>
<p>Num 18:1-7</p>
<p>8Then Yahveh told Aaron,</p>
<p>“I’ve put you in charge of my heave offerings. 9As a permanent allotment, I’ve given you and your sons the holy gifts the Israelites bring. That will be yours from the most holy things, reserved from the fire. Every grain offering, sin offering, and gift offering will be most holy for you and your sons. 10Every male of yours will eat them.</p>
<p>11Their wave offerings are yours too. I’ve given them to you and your sons and daughters as an ongoing allotment. Anybody in your family that’s ceremonially clean can eat them.</p>
<p>12I’ve given you the best of the fresh olive oil, fresh wine, and grain— the first part of the harvest that the people bring to me. 13They belong to you. Anybody in your family that’s ceremonially clean can eat them.</p>
<p>14Devoted things in Israel are yours. 15You’ll have the first issue of the womb of people and animals that’s offered to me. Nevertheless, you’ll redeem firstborn people and ceremonially unclean animals. 16The redemption price from a month old will be 2 oz of silver 5 shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs a shekel). 17But you can’t redeem a firstborn ox, sheep, or goat; they’re holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and offer up their fat in smoke as a burnt offering, for an aroma pleasing to me. 18All their meat will be yours like the breast of a wave offering and the right thigh. 19The holy gifts are a permanent allotment to you, your sons, and daughters—a permanent covenant of salt with me for you and your descendants.”</p>
<p>Num 18:8-19</p>
<p>20Yahveh told Aaron,</p>
<p>“You won’t own or inherit land. I’m your portion, service in the Tent of Meeting. 21I’ve given the Levites a tithe from Israel as payment for their service. 22Israelites can’t approach the Tent of Meeting anymore, or they’ll be held guilty and die. 23Only Levites will perform service there. They’ll bear that responsibility as an ongoing statute throughout your generations. [24]” 	Num 18:20-24</p>
<p>25Yahveh told Moses to tell the Levites,</p>
<p>26“When you receive the tithe from Israel, present a tenth of it to Yahveh. 27It will be considered equivalent to the grain from the threshing floor or the wine from the wine vat. 28You, too, will present an offering to Yahveh—from the tithes you receive. Present it to Aaron the priest 29from the best of the tithes, their sacred portion.  30Tell them, ‘When you’ve offered the best of it, the rest will be considered equivalent to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor or the wine vat. 31You and your families can eat it anywhere; it’s your compensation for service in the Tent of Meeting. 32You won’t be held guilty when you’ve offered the best of it. Don’t profane the Israelites’ sacred gifts, or you’ll die.’” 	Num 18:25-32</p>
<p>Water of Purification</p>
<p>19:1Yahveh told Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>2“This is a statute of Yahveh, ‘Tell the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red heifer that’s never worn a yoke. 3Give it to Eleazar to take outside the camp and slaughter in his presence. 4He’ll take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. 5Then the heifer will be burned in front of him—hide, meat, blood, and refuse. 6The priest will take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet material, and throw it onto the burning heifer. 7Then he’ll wash his clothes, take a bath, and afterward come into the camp, but he’ll be ceremonially unclean till evening. 8The one that burns it will also wash his clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 9A man that’s clean will gather the heifer’s ashes and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the community will keep it as water for removing impurity from sin. 10The one that gathers the ashes will wash his clothes and be unclean till evening. A permanent statute for Israelites and foreigners living among them.</p>
<p>Num 19:1-10</p>
<p>11‘Anyone of you that touches a human corpse will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 12Purify yourself with the water on the third and seventh days, and you’ll be clean. If you don’t, you’re still unclean; 13you’re defiling Yahveh’s Tabernacle, and you’re excluded from Israel.</p>
<p>14‘If someone dies in your tent, all of you in it will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 15Every open container will be unclean. 	Num 19:11-15</p>
<p>16‘Anybody that touches a body out in the open, slain with a sword or dead from natural causes, will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 17Then for the unclean person they’ll take some ashes from the burnt purification from sin and add flowing water in a basin. 18A clean person will dip hyssop in the water and sprinkle it on the tent, its furnishings, the people that were there, and the one that touched the bone, the one slain, the one dead of natural causes, or the grave. 19Then the clean person will sprinkle the unclean persons on the third and seventh days. On the seventh day the clean purify the unclean. Then they’ll wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean by evening.   	Num 19:16-19</p>
<p>20‘But those who don’t purify themselves will be excluded from the community. They’ve defiled Yahveh’s sanctuary. The water for removing impurity wasn’t sprinkled on them. 21Those who sprinkle the water will wash their clothes, and those who touch the water will be ceremonially unclean until evening. 22Anything an unclean person touches is unclean; anyone that touches it is unclean till evening.’”   	Num 19:20-22</p>
<p>The Death of Miriam</p>
<p>20:1The whole community came to the Wilderness of Zin in the first month and stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and they buried her there.</p>
<p>Moses Strikes the Rock</p>
<p>2The community didn’t have water and gathered against Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>3“If only we’d perished when our relatives perished in Yahveh’s presence! 4Why bring hisY assembly into this desert for us and our animals to die? 5Why make us come up from Egypt to this wretched place? It’s not a place with grain, figs, grapes, or pomegranates; and there’s no water.” 	Num 20:1-5</p>
<p>6Moses and Aaron came from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. The glory of Yahveh appeared to them. 7He told Moses, 8“Take the staff. You and your brother gather the community. Speak to the rock in front of them so it will yield water, and the community and their animals can drink.” 9Moses took the staff, 10and he and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, “Listen, you rebels. Should we bring water out of this rock for you?” 11Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, water came out abundantly, and the community and their animals could drink. 12But Yahveh told him and Aaron, “Since youpl haven’t treated me as holy in front of them, you won’t bring this assembly to the land I’ve given them.” 13That was the water at Meribah, because the Israelites “quarreled” with Yahveh, and he proved himself holy among them.   	 Num 20:6-13</p>
<p>Edom Refuses Passage</p>
<p>14Moses sent ambassadors from Kadesh to the king of Edom.</p>
<p>“Your relative Israel says, ‘You know the hardship that has fallen to us. 15You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt and stayed there a long time, and that the Egyptians mistreated them and us. 16But when we cried out to Yahveh, he sent an angel to bring us out. We’re at Kadesh on the edge of your territory. 17Let us go through your land. We won’t go through fields or vineyards, or even drink water from a well. We’ll stay on the King’s Highway till we get past your territory.’”</p>
<p>18But Edom said, “No. I’ll come out with swords.”</p>
<p>19Again the Israelites said, “We’ll go up the highway. If any of our livestock do drink your water, we’ll pay for it. Just let us walk through; it’s not a big thing.”</p>
<p>20But he said, “No.” He came out against them with a heavy force 21and refused to let them go through; so Israel turned away. 	Num 20:14-21</p>
<p>The Death of Aaron</p>
<p>22When they left Kadesh, the whole community came to Mount Hor. 23Yahveh told Moses and Aaron there at the border of Edom,</p>
<p>24“Aaron will pass on to his people. He won’t enter the land I’ve given Israel because youpl rebelled against my command at Meribah. 25Bring him and his son Eleazar up to Mount Hor. 26Take off his vestments and put them on Eleazar.”</p>
<p>27The three of them went up on Mount Hor as the community watched. 28After Moses stripped Aaron and put his vestments on Eleazar, Aaron died. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 29When the community saw Aaron had died, they mourned for him 30 days.</p>
<p>Num 20:22-29</p>
<p>Arad Destroyed</p>
<p>21:1When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by way of Atharim, he fought Israel and took some captives. 2Israel vowed to Yahveh, “If you’ll deliver them to me, we’ll destroy their towns.” 3He delivered them, and they “destroyed” them and their towns; the name of the place became Hormah.	Num 21:1-3</p>
<p>The Bronze Snake</p>
<p>4Then they set out from Mount Hor by taking the road to the Red Sea, to go around Edom, and the people got impatient because of the journey. 5They criticized God and Moses, “Why bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? There’s no food or water. We hate this miserable food!” 6Yahveh sent poisonous snakes among them. They bit the people and a lot of them died. 7They came to Moses, “We’ve sinned; we’ve criticized you and Yahveh. Intercede with him so he’ll take the snakes away.” Moses did that, 8and Yahveh told him, “Fashion a poisonous snake on a standard so everybody that looks at it will survive.” 9Moses did that.  If a snake bit anyone and they looked at the bronze serpent, they’d survive. 	Num 21:4-9</p>
<p>Israel’s Journey to Moab</p>
<p>10The Israelites moved out and camped in Oboth, 11 from there to Iyeabarim in the desert east of Moab, 12from there to Wadi Zered, 13and then to the other side of the Arnon in the desert that comes out of the border of the Amorite. The Arnon forms the border between Moab and the Amorites. 14 The Book of the Wars of Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Waheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon,</p>
<p>15and the slope of the wadis</p>
<p>that extends to Ar</p>
<p>and leads to the border of Moab.”	 Num 21:10-15</p>
<p>16From there they continued to Beer. That’s the “well” where Yahveh told Moses, “Gather the people so I can give them water.”</p>
<p>17Then Israel sang this song:</p>
<p>“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!</p>
<p>18The well that the leaders sank,</p>
<p>that the nobles dug</p>
<p>with their scepters and staffs.”</p>
<p>From the desert they continued to Mattanah, 19to Nahaliel, to Bamoth, 20to the valley in Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks Jeshimon. 	Num 21:16-20</p>
<p>King Sihon Defeated</p>
<p>21Israel sent ambassadors to Sihon, king of the Amorites,</p>
<p>22“Let me go through your land. We won’t turn off into fields or vineyards, or drink water from your wells. We’ll go by the King’s Highway till we’ve passed through.”</p>
<p>23But Sihon wouldn’t let them. He gathered his army and attacked Israel in the Wilderness at Jahaz. 24Israel struck him with the sword and took his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites. Jazer was the border of Ammon. 25Israel took those towns and lived in them, in Heshbon and its surrounding villages. 26Heshbon was Sihon’s city, who had fought the former king of Moab and took his land as far as the Arnon. 27The ones that recite proverbs say,</p>
<p>“Come to Heshbon and build it!</p>
<p>Set up Sihon’s city.</p>
<p>28A fire went out from Heshbon,</p>
<p>a flame from Sihon’s city.</p>
<p>It consumed Ar in Moab,</p>
<p>the dominating Bamoth of the Arnon.</p>
<p>29Misfortune awaits you, Moab!</p>
<p>You’re ruined, people of Chemosh!</p>
<p>He made his sons refugees</p>
<p>and turned his daughters over to captivity,</p>
<p>to an Amorite king, Sihon.</p>
<p>30But we’ve thrown them down</p>
<p>from Heshbon to Dibon;</p>
<p>we wiped them out</p>
<p>from Nophah to Medeba.”</p>
<p>King Og Defeated</p>
<p>31So Israel lived in the territory of the Amorites. 32Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and expelled the Amorites there.</p>
<p>33Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og, king of Bashan, went out with his people to fight at Edrei. 34But Yahveh told Moses, “Don’t be afraid of him. I’ll give him, his people, and his land to you. Do to him what you did to Sihon.” 35So they killed him, his sons, and his people till there wasn’t a remnant left. They took over his land. 	Num 21:21-35</p>
<p>Balak Summons Balaam</p>
<p>22:1Israel traveled and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. 2Balak Ben-Zippor saw what Israel did to the Amorites. 3The people of Moab were afraid of them because there were so many of them. 4The king of Moab told the elders in Midian, “This horde will eat up everything around us like an ox eats up grass in a pasture.” Balak, king of Moab at the time, 5sent messengers to Balaam Ben-Beor at Pethor, near the River Euphrates in the land of his people. He called him and said,</p>
<p>“A people has come out of Egypt. They cover the ground; they’re living across from me. 6Come and put a curse on them; there are too many of them for me to fight. Maybe I can defeat them and drive them out. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.” 	Num 22:1-6</p>
<p>7The elders in Moab and Midian left with a fee for fortunetelling in hand and went to Balaam with Balak’s message.</p>
<p>8He said, “Spend the night here, and I’ll bring word back to you as Yahveh tells me.” So they stayed with him.</p>
<p>9God came to Balaam, “Who are these men?”</p>
<p>10“Balak Ben-Zippor sent me a message, 11‘A people has come out of Egypt and covered the land. Come put a curse on them for me. Maybe I can fight them and drive them out.’”</p>
<p>12“Don’t go with them. Don’t curse the people because they’re blessed.”</p>
<p>13Balaam got up in the morning and told Balak’s leaders, “Go back. Yahveh has refused to let me go with you.” 	Num 22:7-13</p>
<p>14They went back to Balak, “Balaam wouldn’t come with us.”</p>
<p>15Balak sent a bigger group of more distinguished officials,</p>
<p>16“Balak says, ‘Please don’t let anything keep you from coming to me. 17I’ll honor you richly and do whatever you tell me. Come put a curse on this nation for me.’”</p>
<p>18Balaam said,</p>
<p>“Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, I couldn’t do anything great or small that’s contrary to what Yahveh my God may say. 19Stay here tonight, and I’ll find out what else Yahveh may say.”</p>
<p>20God came to him at night, “If the men have come to call you, go ahead with them; but only do what I tell you.” 	Num 22:14-20</p>
<p>Balaam and His Donkey</p>
<p>21Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with them. 22But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of Yahveh stood in the road to hinder him. He was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 23When the donkey saw the angel standing there with his sword drawn, she went off the road into a field, but Balaam hit her to get her back on the road. 24Then the angel stood in a narrow path between vineyards with a wall on both sides. 25When the donkey saw the angel, she pressed herself to the wall and mashed Balaam’s foot; so he hit her again. 26The angel went on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either way. 27When the donkey saw the angel, she lay down under Balaam. He was mad and hit her with his stick. 	Num 22:21-27</p>
<p>28Yahveh opened her mouth, and she asked, “What have I done to you to hit me three times?”</p>
<p>29Balaam said, “You’ve mocked me! If I’d had a sword, I would’ve killed you!”</p>
<p>30The donkey said, “Am I not the donkey you’ve ridden all your life? Have I ever acted like this before?”</p>
<p>31Then Yahveh opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel standing on the road with his sword drawn, and he bowed to the ground.</p>
<p>32The angel said,</p>
<p>“Why did you hit your donkey three times? I’ve come to restrain you, because you’re opposing me. 33But the donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If she hadn’t, I would’ve killed you and let her live.”</p>
<p>34Balaam said, “I’ve sinned. I didn’t know you were standing on the road. If you want me to, I’ll turn around.”</p>
<p>35But the angel said, “Go on with the men, but only say what I tell you.”</p>
<p>So Balaam went along with them.	 Num 22:28-35</p>
<p>36When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the Arnon border. 37He said, “Didn’t I urgently call you? Why didn’t you come? Am I really not able to honor you?” 38Balaam said, “I’m here! Can I say just anything? I’ll say what God tells me.” 39He went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 40Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders that were with him. 41In the morning he took Balaam to the high places of Baal to see part of the people from there. 	Num 22:36-41</p>
<p>Balaam’s First Oracle</p>
<p>23:1Then Balaam told Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and rams.” 2They offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 3Balaam told him, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I’ll go. Maybe Yahveh will come to me, and I’ll tell you what he shows me.” He went to a bare hill. 4God met him, and he said, “I’ve set up seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each one.” 5Yahveh gave Balaam a message, “Go tell Balak such and such.” 6He went back to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering with the leaders of Moab. 	Num 23:1-6</p>
<p>7Balaam took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“Balak brought me from Aram,</p>
<p>Moab’s king from the eastern mountains.</p>
<p>‘Come curse Jacob for me;</p>
<p>come denounce Israel.’</p>
<p>8How can I curse someone God hasn’t cursed?</p>
<p>How can I denounce the one God hasn’t denounced?</p>
<p>9I see him from the top of the cliffs</p>
<p>and look at him from the hills;</p>
<p>a people that lives off by itself</p>
<p>won’t be counted among the nations.</p>
<p>10Who can count the dust of Jacob</p>
<p>or number even a fourth of Israel?</p>
<p>Let me die like the godly;</p>
<p>let my demise be like theirs!” 	Num 23:7-10</p>
<p>11Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I told you to curse my enemies; you’ve blessed them!”</p>
<p>12“Don’t I have to say what Yahveh tells me?”</p>
<p>Balaam’s Second Oracle</p>
<p>13Balak said, “Come to a different place, where you can see them—even though it’ll just be the tail-end of them. Curse them for me from there.” 14He took him to the Field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and ram on each one.</p>
<p>15Balaam told him, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet Yahveh over there.” 16Yahveh met Balaam and gave him a message, “Go back to Balak, and say such and such.” 17Balaam went to him, who was standing by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked, “What has Yahveh said?”	 Num 23:11-17</p>
<p>18Balaam took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“Balak, listen;</p>
<p>pay attention, son of Zippor.</p>
<p>19God does not lie like people do</p>
<p>or change his mind like their offspring.</p>
<p>Has he said and won’t do?</p>
<p>Has he spoken and not made it good?</p>
<p>20I’ve received a command to bless;</p>
<p>when he has blessed, I can’t revoke it.</p>
<p>21He hasn’t observed misfortune in Jacob</p>
<p>or seen trouble in Israel.</p>
<p>Yahveh their God is with them,</p>
<p>and has been proclaimed their king.</p>
<p>22God is bringing them out of Egypt;</p>
<p>he’s like the horns of a wild ox for them.</p>
<p>23There’s no omen against Jacob,</p>
<p>no fortunetelling against Israel.</p>
<p>At the right time what God has done</p>
<p>will be said to Jacob;</p>
<p>it will be told to Israel.</p>
<p>24These people rise like a lioness;</p>
<p>they get up like a lion.</p>
<p>They won’t lie down till they eat their prey</p>
<p>and drink the blood of the slain.”	Num 23:18-24</p>
<p>25Balak told him, “Don’t curse them at all or bless them at all!”</p>
<p>26But Balaam answered, “Didn’t I tell you I have to do what Yahveh says?”</p>
<p>27Balak said to him, “Come on; I’ll take you to another place. Maybe God will agree to put a curse on them there.” 28Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks Jeshimon. 29Balaam told him, “Build seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and rams.” 30Balak did that and offered a bull and ram on each altar. 	Num 23:25-30</p>
<p>Balaam’s Third Oracle</p>
<p>24;1When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahveh to bless Israel, he didn’t go like before to look for omens, but faced the open country. 2He saw Israel camping by tribes, and God’s Spirit came on him. 3He took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“The oracle of Balaam Ben-Beor,</p>
<p>the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,</p>
<p>4the oracle of one that hears God’s message,</p>
<p>that sees a vision from the Almighty,</p>
<p>that falls down with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>5“How fair your tents, Jacob,</p>
<p>the places where you live, Israel!</p>
<p>6like valleys that stretch out,</p>
<p>like orchards beside a river,</p>
<p>like aloes Yahveh planted,</p>
<p>like cedars beside the water.</p>
<p>7Water will flow from Jacob’s buckets;</p>
<p>his seed will live by abundant water;</p>
<p>his king will be greater than Agag;</p>
<p>his kingdom will be exalted.</p>
<p>8God is bringing him out of Egypt;</p>
<p>he’s like the horns of a wild ox for him.</p>
<p>He’ll devastate the nations that oppose him;</p>
<p>he’ll crush their bones to pieces</p>
<p>and shatter them with his arrows.</p>
<p>9Israel lies down like a lion;</p>
<p>who dares to rouse him?</p>
<p>Blessed is everyone that blesses him;</p>
<p>cursed are all who curse him.”	 Num 24:1-9</p>
<p>10Balak was mad at Balaam. He clapped his hands and said, “I called you to curse my enemies, and you’ve persisted in blessing them three times! 11Go back home. I said I’d greatly honor you, but Yahveh has prevented you from receiving your honor.”</p>
<p>12Balaam said,</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell your messengers, 13‘Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, on my own I can’t do anything contrary to Yahveh’s command, good or bad. I’ll say what he says.’? 14I’m going to my people, but I’ll advise you what this nation will do to your people later.” 	Num 24:10-14</p>
<p>Balaam’s Last Oracle</p>
<p>15He took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“The oracle of Balaam Ben-Beor,</p>
<p>the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,</p>
<p>16the oracle of one that hears God’s message,</p>
<p>that knows Elyon,</p>
<p>that sees a vision from the Almighty,</p>
<p>and falls down with eyes wide open.</p>
<p>17“I see him, but not now;</p>
<p>I look at him, but not near.</p>
<p>A star will rise out of Jacob;</p>
<p>a scepter will arise from Israel.</p>
<p>He’ll crush the forehead of Moab</p>
<p>and tear down the sons of Sheth.</p>
<p>18Edom will be a possession;</p>
<p>Seir, his enemy, will be overtaken,</p>
<p>while Israel grows strong.</p>
<p>19A ruler will arise from Jacob</p>
<p>and destroy the remnant of Ir.	 Num 24:15-19</p>
<p>20He looked at Amalek and took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“Amalek was first among the nations,</p>
<p>but he’ll end in destruction.”</p>
<p>21He looked at the Kenites and took up this oracle:</p>
<p>“Where you live endures;</p>
<p>your nest sits on a cliff.</p>
<p>22Nevertheless, Kain will be consumed;</p>
<p>how long will Asshur hold you captive?</p>
<p>23He took up his oracle:</p>
<p>“Who can live except God ordains it?</p>
<p>24But ships will come from the coast of Kittim</p>
<p>and attack Asshur and Eber;</p>
<p>so they’ll end up in destruction too.”</p>
<p>25Balaam went home and Balak left.	Num 24:20-25</p>
<p>Moab Seduces Israel</p>
<p>25:1While Israel was camping in Shittim, the people started carrying on prostitution with the women of Moab. 2They invited the people to the sacrifices to their gods, and the people ate and bowed to their gods. 3In this way, Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and Yahveh was angry. 4He told Moses, “Seize the ringleaders and execute them in broad daylight in myY presence so my fierce anger will turn away from Israel.” 5Moses told the judges, “Each of you put to death his men that have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.” 	 Num 25:1-5</p>
<p>6One Israelite even brought a Midianite woman among his fellow Jews right in front of Moses and the assembly while they were crying at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 7When Phinehas Ben-Eleazar Ben-Aaron the priest saw it, he got up from the assembly. He took a spear, 8followed the man into the tent, and ran both of them through, and so checked the plague on Israel. 924,000 had died from it.      	 Num 25:6-9</p>
<p>10Then Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>11“Phinehas has turned away my anger because he was as zealous as I am for my honor, so I didn’t destroy Israel. 12So say, ‘I’m giving him and his descendants my covenant of peace, 13a permanent priesthood, because he was zealous for me and atoned for Israel.’”</p>
<p>14The slain man was Zimri Ben-Salu, a family leader in Simeon. 15The Midianite woman was Cozbi Bat-Zur, a family leader in Midian.</p>
<p>16Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>17“Attack the Midianites and strike them down. 18They’ve been hostile to you by deceiving you at Peor with Cozbi their sister, who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor.”	 Num 25:10-18</p>
<p>The Second Registration of Israel’s Troops</p>
<p>26:1After the plague Yahveh told Moses and Eleazar, 2“Count by families the men 20 years old and up that can go to war.” 3Moses and Eleazar told them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, 4“Count the men 20 years old and up.” The Israelites that came out of Egypt were as follows:</p>
<p>5Reuben by families was Hanoch, Pallu, 6-7Hezron, and Carmi: 	43,730</p>
<p>8The son of Pallu was Eliab, 9father of Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram the community called on to oppose Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah when they contended against Yahveh. 10The ground opened up and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, and the fire consumed 250 men. That served as a warning. 11The sons of Korah, however, didn’t die.</p>
<p>12-14Simeon by families was Nemuel, Jamin, Jachin, Zerah, and Shaul.  	   22,200</p>
<p>15-18Gad by families was Zephon, Haggai, Shuni, Ozni, Eri, Arod, and Areli.	 40,500</p>
<p>19-22Judah by families was Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. 	76,500</p>
<p>The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. Judah’s other sons Er</p>
<p>and Onan died in Canaan.</p>
<p>23-25Issachar by families was Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron. 	64,300</p>
<p>26-27Zebulun by families was Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.	 60,500</p>
<p>28-37Joseph by families was Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
<p>The sons of Manasseh were Machir Avi-Gilead Avi-Jezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, and Hepher. Hepher was father of Zelophehad, whose daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 	52,700</p>
<p>The sons of Ephraim were Shuthelah, Becher, and Tahan. The son of Shuthelah was Eran. 			32,500</p>
<p>38-41Benjamin by families was Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham.</p>
<p>The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman. 	45,600</p>
<p>42-43Dan’s family was Shuham. 64,400</p>
<p>44-47Asher by families was Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah. 	53,400</p>
<p>The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel. Asher’s daughter was Serah.</p>
<p>48-50Naphtali by families was Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 	45,400</p>
<p>51601,730</p>
<p>Num 26:1-51</p>
<p>52Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>53“Parcel out the land among these for an inheritance in proportion to their numbers, 54a larger inheritance for larger groups, a smaller one for smaller groups. 55Divide it up by lot by tribes. [56]”	Num 26:52-56</p>
<p>57These are the Levites numbered by families: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 58These are the families of Levi: the Libnites, Hebronites, Mahlites, Mushites, and the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram. 59Amram’s wife was Jochebed, daughter of Levi, born in Egypt. She bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam. 60Aaron became the father of Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  61Nadab and Abihu died from offering before Yahveh fire different from what he’d commanded. 62The number of male Levites a month old and up was 23,000. They weren’t counted with the Israelites because they didn’t inherit with them.</p>
<p>63Those were the ones Moses and Eleazar counted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.  64But Moses and Aaron didn’t count anyone they’d counted in the Wilderness at Sinai.  65That was because Yahveh had said they’d die in the desert. Only Caleb and Joshua would survive. 	Num 26:57-65</p>
<p>The Daughters of Zelophehad</p>
<p>27:1The daughters of Zelophehad Ben-Hepher (Ben-Gilead Ben-Machir Ben-Manasseh) Ben-Joseph came near: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 2They stood in front of Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and said,</p>
<p>3“Our father died in the wilderness, but not among those who opposed Yahveh with Korah. He died in his own sin and didn’t have any sons. 4Why should he disappear from his clan just because he didn’t have any sons? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.” 	Num 27:1-4</p>
<p>5Moses brought the case to Yahveh.</p>
<p>6Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>7“Zelophehad’s daughters are right. Give them a possession among their father’s brothers and transfer their father’s inheritance to them. 8If a man dies without a son, transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 9If he doesn’t have a daughter, give it to his brothers. 10If he doesn’t have any brothers, give it to his father’s brothers. 11If his father doesn’t have any brothers, give it to the nearest other relative in his family. It will be an ordinance in Israel.”</p>
<p>Joahua to Succeed Moses</p>
<p>12Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>“Climb one of the mountains in the Abarim range and look at the land I’ll give Israel. 13When you’ve seen it, you’ll pass on to your people like Aaron did. 14In the Wilderness of Zin, during the conflict with the community, you rebelled against my command to honor me as holy in front of them at the water” (of Meribah at Kadesh). 	Num 27:5-14</p>
<p>15Moses said,</p>
<p>16“May Yahveh, the God that gives breath to all flesh, appoint a man 17to lead the community so they won’t be like sheep without a shepherd.”</p>
<p>18Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“Take Joshua Ben-Nun, a man that has the Spirit in him, and put your hand on him. 19Have him stand in the presence of Eleazar and the community and commission him. 20Put some of your authority on him so the community can obey him. 21He’ll present himself to Eleazar, who will ask Yahveh for him by the Urim. At his command, he and this whole community will determine what to do.”</p>
<p>22So Moses stood Joshua in front of Eleazar and the community, 23put his hand on him, and commissioned him. 	Num 27:15-23</p>
<p>Daily Offerings</p>
<p>28:1-2Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel,</p>
<p>“Present my offerings by fire at their scheduled times, an aroma pleasing to me, my ‘food.’ 3Make this offering by fire to Yahveh every day: 2 male lambs a year old without defect. 4Offer one in the morning, the other in the evening. 5For a grain offering, offer .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 pints ¼ hin of pressed olive oil. 6It’s a daily burnt offering that was ordained at Mount Sinai. 7The liquid offering that goes with it will be 3 pints ¼ hin of alcohol for each lamb, poured out in the Holy Place. 8Offer the other lamb that evening the same way with its grain offering and liquid offering. 	Num 28:1-8</p>
<p>Sabbath Offerings</p>
<p>9“On the Sabbath, offer two male lambs a year old without defect, and a fifth of a measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with its liquid offering. 10The burnt offering on each Sabbath is in addition to the daily burnt offering and its liquid offering.</p>
<p>Monthly Offerings</p>
<p>11“At the beginning of each month, present a burnt offering to Yahveh: 2 bulls and 1 ram, 12as well as .3 measure of fine flour for a grain offering mixed with olive oil for each bull, 13and .1 of a measure of fine flour mixed with olive oil for each lamb, an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 14Their liquid offerings will be 3 quarts ½ hin of wine for a bull, 2 quarts ⅓ hin for a ram, and 3 pints ¼ hin for a lamb. 15Offer one male goat for a sin offering with its liquid offering in addition to the daily burnt offering.  		   Num 28:9-15</p>
<p>Passover Offerings</p>
<p>16“The fourteenth day, first month is Yahveh’s Passover. 17On the fifteenth the festival will begin. For a week, eat bread with no yeast. 18On the first day is a holy convocation; don’t work. 19Present a burnt offering to Yahveh: 2 bulls, 1 ram, and 7 male lambs a year old without defect. 20For their grain offering, present fine flour mixed with olive oil—.3 of a measure for a bull, .2 for the ram, 21and .1 for each lamb. 22Offer 1 male goat for a sin offering, to atone for yourselves. 23Present them besides the morning’s daily burnt offering. 24Daily for 7 days, present the food of the offering by fire, an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. Present it with its liquid offering in addition to the daily burnt offering. 25The seventh day, hold a holy convocation; don’t work.	Num 28:16-25</p>
<p>Feast of Weeks Offerings</p>
<p>26“At the time of the first of the harvest, when you present a new grain offering in your Festival of Weeks, hold a holy convocation; don’t work. 27Offer a burnt offering for an aroma pleasing to Yahveh: 2 young bulls, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old, 28and their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil—.3 of a measure for each bull, .2 for the ram, 29and .1 for each lamb. 30Offer 1 male goat to atone for yourselves. 31Besides the daily burnt offering and its grain offering, present them with their liquid offerings. They’ll be without defect.</p>
<p>Num 28:26-31</p>
<p>Feast of Trumpets Offerings</p>
<p>29:1“The first day, seventh month, hold a holy convocation; don’t work. Celebrate the Festival of Trumpets. 2Offer a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh: 1 bull, 1 ram, and 7 male lambs a year old without defect. 3Offer with them their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with olive oil—.3 of a measure for the bull, .2 for the ram, 4and .1 for each lamb. 5Offer 1 male goat for a sin offering to atone for yourselves. 6Offer them in addition to the burnt offering at the new moon and its grain offering, and the daily burnt offering and its grain offering. Offer their liquid offerings.	  Num 29:1-6</p>
<p>Day of Atonement Offerings</p>
<p>7“The tenth day, seventh month, hold a holy convocation; fast and don’t work. 8Present a burnt offering to Yahveh as a pleasing aroma: 1 bull, 1 ram, and 7 male lambs a year old without defect. 9Offer them together with the grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil—.3 of a measure for the bull, .2 for the ram, 10and .1 for each lamb. 11Offer one male goat for a sin offering in addition to the sin offering of atonement and the daily burnt offering, grain offering, and liquid offering.

Observe a festival to Yahveh for a week. 13Present a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh: 13 bulls, 2 rams, and 14 male lambs a year old without defect. 14Offer them together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with olive oil—.3 of a measure for each bull, .2 for each ram, 15and .1 for each lamb. 16Offer one male goat as a sin offering in addition to the daily burnt offering, grain offering, and liquid offering. 	Num 29:12-16</p>

<p>39“Present those to Yahveh at your scheduled times in addition to your offerings for fulling a vow, free will offerings, burnt offerings, and the liquid offerings for your peace offerings.”</p>
<p>40Moses told Israel everything Yahveh commanded him.   	    Num 29:17-40</p>
<p>Men’s Vows</p>
<p>30:1Then Moses told the tribal leaders,</p>
<p>“This is what Yahveh has commanded. 2If a man makes a vow to Yahveh or takes an oath that obligates him to do something, he must keep his word.</p>
<p>Women’s Vows</p>
<p>3If a woman takes a vow to Yahveh and obligates herself to do something while in her father’s family in her youth, 4and her father hears it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 5But if her father forbids her, her vow and pledge don’t stand. Yahveh will release her from them because her father forbade her.</p>
<p>6“But, if she marries while under her vow or rash statement 7and her husband hears about it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 8But, if he forbids her, he annuls her vow or rash statement, and Yahveh will release her from it.</p>
<p>9“The vow of a widow or divorced woman stands. 	Num 30:1-9</p>
<p>10“However, if she vows in her husband’s house or binds herself to an obligation with an oath 11and her husband hears it, but doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 12But if her husband annuls it, it won’t stand, and Yahveh will release her from them.</p>
<p>13“A husband can annul any vow or binding oath a wife submits herself to. 14If he doesn’t say anything to her the day he hears it, then he confirms it. 15But if he tries to annul it later, he’ll bear her guilt.”</p>
<p>16Those statutes Yahveh commanded Moses about a husband and wife and a father and daughter in her youth in his home.		  Num 30:10-16</p>
<p>Conquest of the Midianites</p>
<p>31:1Yahveh told Moses, 2“Take revenge for Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you’ll pass on to your people.”</p>
<p>3Moses told the people, “Arm men to attack Midian and carry out Yahveh’s revenge on it. 4Send 1,000 men from each tribe.”</p>
<p>5They provided 12,000 men. 6Moses sent them to war with Phinehas Ben-Eleazar the priest along with the holy items from the sanctuary and bugles for signaling. 7They fought Midian and killed every male, 8including its five kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, Reba. They also killed Balaam Ben-Beor with a sword. 9They took the women and children, their cattle, flocks, and possessions. 10They burned their towns, houses, and camps; 11and took the spoil—people and animals. 12They brought the captives, prey, and spoil to Moses, Eleazar, and the community on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.	 Num 31:1-12</p>
<p>13Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community met them outside the camp. 14Moses was mad at the officers of the army and the commanders of thousands and hundreds.</p>
<p>15“You’ve saved the women alive? 16They’re what got Israel to sin against Yahveh at Peor, and a plague came into the community by Balaam’s advice. 17So kill every male child and every woman that has had intercourse with a man. 18Keep alive for yourselves the young girls that are virgins. 19Camp outside the camp for a week. Whoever has killed anybody or touched a slain body, purify yourself on the third day and seventh day, you and your captives. 20Purify every piece of clothing, anything made out of skin, goat hair, or wood.”</p>
<p>21Eleazar told the men that fought,</p>
<p>“Yahveh commanded Moses this statute. 22‘The gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, and lead—23anything that doesn’t burn—put through fire to cleanse it; then purify it with water. Anything that will burn, purify with water. 24Wash your clothes the seventh day. You’ll be ceremonially clean then, and you can come into the camp.”	Num 31:13-24</p>
<p>25Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>26“You, Eleazar, and heads of families, count the spoil—people and animals—27and divide it between soldiers and community. 28Levy a tax for Yahveh from the soldiers’ spoil: 1 per 500 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep. 29Give this share to Eleazar as a heave offering to Yahveh. 30From Israel’s half, take 1 from every 50 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep, and give them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle.”</p>
<p>31Moses and Eleazar did that.</p>
<p>32The prey that was left from the soldiers’ spoil was 675,000 sheep, 3372,000 cattle, 3461,000 donkeys, 3532,000 virgins.</p>
<p>36The soldiers’ half was 337,500 sheep; 37Yahveh’s levy, 675.</p>
<p>38There were 36,000 cattle; Yahveh’s levy, 72.</p>
<p>39There were 30,500 donkeys; Yahveh’s levy, 61.</p>
<p>40There were 16,000 persons; Yahveh’s levy, 32.</p>
<p>41Moses gave Yahveh’s levy to Eleazar the priest. 	Num 31:25-41</p>
<p>42Israel’s half was 43337,500 sheep, 4436,000 cattle, 4530,500 donkeys, 46and 16,000 persons. 47From Israel’s half Moses took out one from every 50 people and animals, and gave them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>48The commanders of thousands and hundreds came to Moses,</p>
<p>49“We’ve counted the men who fought and not a one is missing. 50So, from what each man found, we’ve brought an offering to Yahveh: articles of gold, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and neck chains to atone for ourselves.”</p>
<p>51Moses and Eleazar took the gold and crafted articles, 52418¾ lbs 16,750 shekels worth. 53Each soldier had taken spoil. 54Moses and Eleazar brought the commanders’ gold to the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to Israel before Yahveh.	   Num 31:42-54</p>
<p>Reuben and Gad Settle in Gilead</p>
<p>32:1Reuben and Gad had lots of livestock. When they saw that Jazer and Gilead had good grazing land, 2they spoke to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community,</p>
<p>3“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—4land Yahveh overthrew for Israel—is suitable for our livestock. 5If we’re pleasing to you, give us this land instead of having us cross the Jordan.”</p>
<p>6Moses said,</p>
<p>“Will your relatives go to war, and you sit here? 7Why discourage Israel from going to the land Yahveh has given them? 8That’s what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. 9When they went to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged Israel from going in. 10Yahveh was angry that day and swore, 11‘No men that came up from Egypt 20 years and older will see the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they wouldn’t follow me. 12Only Caleb the Kenizzite and Joshua Ben- Nun faithfully followed me.’ 13Yahveh made Israel wander in the desert for 40 years till that generation died off. 14You’re replacing your parents as sinful people to anger Yahveh toward Israel. 15If you turn aside from him, he’ll leave you in the desert. You’ll be responsible for destroying this nation.”	 Num 32:1-15</p>
<p>16They came to him and said,</p>
<p>“We’ll build corrals here for our livestock and towns for our children, 17but we’ll take up arms and go with Israel till we’ve brought them to their place. Our children will live in fortified towns because of the people still in the land. 18We won’t go home till everyone has received their inheritance. 19We won’t inherit with them on that side of the Jordan; our inheritance will lie here.”</p>
<p>Num 32:16-19</p>
<p>20Moses said,</p>
<p>“If you take up arms 21and cross the Jordan till Yahveh 22has conquered the land, you’ll meet your obligations. 23If you don’t, be sure your sin will find you out. 24Build your towns, put up corrals, and do what you’ve promised.”</p>
<p>25“We will. 26Our little ones, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay in towns in Gilead. 27But we’ll cross over armed to fight like you’ve said.”</p>
<p>28Moses charged Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel,</p>
<p>29“If Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan and help you conquer the land, give them Gilead. 30If they don’t, they’ll have possessions among you in Canaan.”       [31-32]	Num 32:20-32</p>
<p>33Moses gave to Gad, Reuben, and the Manasseh half-tribe the kingdoms of Sihon and Og, and the towns and territory around them. 34Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 36Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran—fortified towns and corrals for sheep. 37Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38Nebo, and Baal-meon (new names), and Sibmah. They renamed the towns they built. 39The sons of Machir Ben-Manasseh went to Gilead and took it away from the Amorites. 40Moses gave them Gilead and they lived there. 41“Jair” Ben-Manasseh took its “towns” and called them Havvoth-jair. 42Nobah took Kenath and its villages and renamed it after himself.	  Num 32:33-42</p>
<p>Recounting Israel’s Journey</p>
<p>33:1These are the segments of the journey Israel took when they left Egypt. 2Yahveh told Moses to write them down. 3They traveled from Rameses on the fifteenth day, first month, the day after Passover. They left right in front of the Egyptians 4while they were burying the firstborn that Yahveh struck. Yahveh also carried out judgments against their gods. 	Num 33:1-4</p>
<p>5They left from Ramses 		to Succoth,</p>
<p>6to Etham on the edge of open country,</p>
<p>where they turned back,</p>
<p>7to Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-Zephon,</p>
<p>and camped near Migdol.</p>
<p>8They passed through the sea</p>
<p>to the Wilderness of Etham</p>
<p>for 3 days</p>
<p>They camped at Marah and</p>
<p>9Elim, where there were</p>
<p>12 springs and 70 palms trees.</p>
<p>10They camped by the Red Sea,</p>
<p>11then in the Wilderness of Sin,</p>
<p>12in Dophkah,</p>
<p>13Alush,</p>
<p>4in Rephidim, where there was</p>
<p>no water to drink.</p>
<p>15They camped in the Wilderness of Sinai,			16Kibroth-hattaavah,</p>
<p>17Hazeroth,</p>
<p>18Rithmah,</p>
<p>19Rimmon-perez,</p>
<p>20Libnah,</p>
<p>21Rissah,</p>
<p>23Shepher,</p>
<p>24and Haradah,</p>
<p>25in Makheloth,						26Tahath,</p>
<p>27Terah,</p>
<p>28Mithkah</p>
<p>29and Hashmonah,</p>
<p>30in Maseroth</p>
<p>31and Bene-jaakan,</p>
<p>32in Hor-haggidgad,</p>
<p>33Jotbathah,</p>
<p>34Abronah,</p>
<p>35Ezion-geber,</p>
<p>36in the Wilderness of Zin (Kadesh),</p>
<p>37and at Mount Hor on the edge of Edom</p>
<p>Num 33:5-37</p>
<p>38Yahveh told Aaron to go up to Mount Hor. He died the first day, fifth month, fortieth year after Israel left Egypt; 39he was 123. 40The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard Israel was coming.</p>
<p>41Israel went					from Mount Hor</p>
<p>and camped in Zalmonah,</p>
<p>42then Punon,</p>
<p>43 Oboth,</p>
<p>44Iyeabarim (Iyim) on the border of Moab,</p>
<p>45at Dibon-gad,</p>
<p>46 Almon-diblathaim,</p>
<p>47the mountains of Abarim near Nebo,</p>
<p>48and in the plains of Moab</p>
<p>by the Jordan across from Jericho.</p>
<p>49They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim on the plains of Moab.</p>
<p>Num 33:38-49</p>
<p>50-51Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel there,</p>
<p>“When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 52drive out the people, destroy their carved stones and molten images, and tear down their pagan shrines. 53Take the land and live in it because I’ve given it to you. 54You’ll inherit land by allotment per clan. Bigger clans will inherit more; the smaller ones will inherit less. Their allotments will fall within their tribe. 55If you don’t drive out the people, they’ll be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and cause you trouble. 56I’ll end up doing to you what I intend to do to them.” 	Num 33:50-56</p>
<p>Boundaries of the Land</p>
<p>34:1-2Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel,</p>
<p>“When you go into Canaan, 3your south border will run from the Wilderness of Zin alongside Edom from the end of the Dead Sea eastward. 4Your border will turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and go on along to Zin. It will end south of Kadesh-barnea, go out to Hazaraddar, and on along to Azmon. 5The border will turn from Azmon to where the River of Egypt empties into the Mediterranean Sea.	 Num 34:1-5</p>
<p>6“Your west border will be the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>7“Your north border will stretch from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor, 8Lebo-hamath, Zedad, 9Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan.</p>
<p>10“Your east border will run from Hazar-enan to Shepham 11down to Riblah on the east of Ain down to the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth. 12It will go down to the Jordan and on down to the Dead Sea.”</p>
<p>13Moses told Israel,</p>
<p>“That’s the land you’ll inherit by lot, land Yahveh told you to give to the-nine-and-a-half tribes. 14-15Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe have received their inheritance 15beyond the Jordan.”	 Num 34:6-15</p>
<p>Leaders for Dividing the Land</p>
<p>16Yahveh told Moses,</p>
<p>17“Eleazar the priest and Joshua Ben-Nun will divide up the land. 18Name one leader from each tribe to divide it up:</p>
<p>19from Judah, Caleb Ben-Jephunneh;</p>
<p>20from Simeon, Samuel Ben-Ammihud;</p>
<p>21from Benjamin, Elidad Ben-Chislon;</p>
<p>22from Dan, Bukki Ben-Jogli;</p>
<p>23from Joseph—Manasseh, Hanniel Ben-Ephod;</p>
<p>24	          —Ephraim, Kemuel Ben-Shiphtan;</p>
<p>25from Zebulun, Elizaphan Ben-Parnach;</p>
<p>26from Issachar, Paltiel Ben-Azza;</p>
<p>27from Asher, Ahihud Ben-Shelomi;</p>
<p>28from Naphtali, Pedahel Ben-Ammihud.”</p>
<p>29Yahveh commissioned those men to divide up Canaan for Israel. 	 Num 34:16-29</p>
<p>Towns for the Levites</p>
<p>35:1In the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Yahveh said to Moses,</p>
<p>2“Tell Israel to give the Levites towns to live in, 3along with pastureland for their cattle, herds, and animals. 4The pastures will extend 1500ft out from the wall all around the city, 5a 3,000ft diameter of pastureland. 6Give the Levites 6 cities as refuge for a person to flee to that’s killed someone accidentally. 7Give them 42 other towns with their pastures to make 48 total. 8The towns you give them will be in proportion to the number of towns each tribe inherits.” Num 35:1-8</p>
<p>Cities of Refuge</p>
<p>9-10Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel,</p>
<p>“When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 11identify cities of refuge a person can flee to from killing someone accidentally. 12-13The 6 cities will serve as refuges from an avenger till the slayer can stand public trial: 143 cities beyond the Jordan and three in Canaan. 15They’ll serve Israelites, foreigners, and people living temporarily in Israel.   	  Num 35:9-15</p>
<p>16“If a slayer kills someone with an iron instrument, it’s murder; execute the slayer. 17The same applies if the weapon is stone 18or wood. 19The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 20If one person pushes another in hate, throws something from an ambush, 21or hits barehanded with enmity and kills the other, it’s murder. The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 	Num 35:16-21</p>
<p>22“One person might push someone suddenly without enmity or throw something 23like a stone and hit the other accidentally. 24The community will decide between the slayer and the avenger by these ordinances. 25They’ll protect the slayer from the avenger by returning the slayer to the city of refuge till the high priest dies. 26If the slayer ventures outside the city, 27the avenger is not considered a murderer. 28The slayer should’ve stayed in the city till the high priest died. Then the slayer could have gone home.  	Num 35:22-28</p>
<p>29“These are permanent statutes wherever you live. 30On the testimony of two or more witnesses, execute whoever commits murder. One witness isn’t enough. 31Don’t take a ransom in place of execution 32or for someone that flees to a city of refuge so they can go home early before the high priest dies. 33Don’t defile the land you live in; blood defiles it. Don’t atone for land defiled by blood except by the blood of the one that shed it. 34Don’t defile the land you’re living in because I’m living in it with you.” 	Num 35:29-34</p>
<p>Women Heirs of Property</p>
<p>36:1The heads of clans came down from Gilead (Ben-Machir Ben-Manasseh Ben-Joseph) to Moses and Israel’s leaders. 2They said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh told you to allot land to Israel for inheritance, and to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our relative to his daughters. 3But if they marry outside their tribe, their inheritance will move to the new tribe. 4When Israel’s Year of Jubilee comes, it will become permanent in the new tribe and lost from ours.”</p>
<p>5So from Yahveh Moses said,</p>
<p>“Joseph’s descendants are raising a legitimate issue. 6Do this: the daughters of Zelophehad can marry anyone in their father’s tribe. 7Inheritance can’t move from tribe to tribe. 8Every daughter that inherits must marry in her tribe. 9Each tribe will retain its inheritance.”</p>
<p>10That’s what the daughters of Zelophehad did. 11Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah married their uncles’ sons; 12and their inheritance stayed in their father’s tribe.</p>
<p>13Yahveh gave those commandments to Israel through Moses in the plain of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. 	Num 36:1-13</p>
