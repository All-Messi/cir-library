<p>Peter explained step by step. 10:1“A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius, from the Italian cohort, 2is a devout God-fearer along with his whole house. 30He gave considerable charitable gifts to the people and prayed to God constantly. He was keeping three p.m. prayer in his house. 3In a vision he saw clearly an angel of God coming and standing in front of him, ‘Cornelius.’</p></p>

He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/Babylonia and put them in the treasury. 3He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, 4young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had him teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, 5and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. 6Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. 7The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel was Belteshazzar, Hananiah was Shadrach, Mishael was Meshach, and Azariah was Abed-nego.

There were gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement made out of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. 7Drinks were served in gold cups of different kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty. 8The drinking was done by law: attendees were not compelled, because the king had ordered each official of his household to follow each person’s wishes. 9Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the king’s palace.

<p>A Vision of Living Beings and</p>

<p>1:1The fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 3God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back forth like bolts of lightning.	Ezek 1:1-14</p></p>

<p>The Birth of Samuel</p>
<p>1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham Ben-Elihu (Ben-Tohu Ben-Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.</p>
<p>3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to Yahveh of hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But Yahveh had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to Yahveh’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”	1 Sam 1:1-8</p></p>

<p>THE YAHVEH COVENANT</p>
<p>The Yahveh Covenant presents a modified form of the Old Testament portion of The Conversational Version. Besides the features of that translation, the following points come up in this variant of it.</p>
<p>The Yahveh Covenant uses the personal name of the God of Moses in places where it appears in the Hebrew text. The intent is to highlight the personal character of Old Testament revelation by using God’s personal name instead of substituting a descriptor—Lord, Master, God, Almighty, and the like. There is a difference in feel between listening to a brother talk and listening to John.</p></p>

<p>4Yahveh hurled a gale on the sea, and it was about to break up the ship. 5The sailors were scared, and every man cried out to his god. They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Jonah had gone below and fallen sound asleep. 6The captain came and said, “How come you’re sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Maybe he’ll be concerned about us enough to keep us from dying.” 7They said to one another, “Let’s cast lots to find out who caused this catastrophe to hit us.” They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. 8“Tell us, now! Why has this catastrophe fallen on us? What’s your job? What’s your country? Who are your people?” 	Jon 1:1-8</p></p>
