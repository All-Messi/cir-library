        <p>JEREMIAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1:1The Words of Jeremiah Ben-Hilkiah</p>
<p>from the Priests at Anathoth in Benjamin</p>
<p>2Messages from Yahveh came to him in the thirteenth year of Josiah Ben-Amon, king of Judah. 3They came as well during the reign of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, till the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, till Jerusalem’s exile in the fifth month. 		  Jer 1:1-3</p>
<p>The Call of Jeremiah</p>
<p>4A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>5“I knew you before I formed you in the womb;</p>
<p>I set you apart before you were born</p>
<p>and appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”</p>
<p>6I said,</p>
<p>“Lord Yahveh!</p>
<p>I don’t know how to speak for you;</p>
<p>I’m too young.”</p>
<p>7But Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“Don’t say you’re too young;</p>
<p>you’ll go where I send you</p>
<p>and say what I tell you.</p>
<p>8You don’t need to be afraid of them;</p>
<p>I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>9He reached out and touched my mouth,</p>
<p>“I’ve put my message in you</p>
<p>10and appointed you over nations and kingdoms</p>
<p>to pull up and tear down,</p>
<p>to overthrow and destroy,</p>
<p>to build and plant.”	Jer 1:4-10</p>
<p>11A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>“What do you see, Jeremiah?”</p>
<p>“An ‘almond’ branch.”</p>
<p>12“Yes; I’m “watching,”</p>
<p>and I’ll certainly do what I say.”</p>
<p>13Anothere message came to me:</p>
<p>“What do you see?”</p>
<p>“A boiling pot facing this way from the north.” 	Jer 1:11-13</p>
<p>14Then he said,</p>
<p>“Evil is going to pour out from the north onto the people in this country. 15I’m calling the armies in the kingdoms up north. Each one will set a throne at Jerusalem’s gates, against its walls all round, against the towns in Judah. 16I’ll render judgment on this nation for leaving me and sacrificing to other gods, for worshiping what they’ve made with their own hands. 17Gird up your loins. Get up and tell them everything I’ve told you. Don’t let them intimidate you, or I’ll dishearten you in front of them. 18Today, I’m making you like a fortified city today, like an iron pillar, like bronze walls against the whole land, Judah’s kings, officials, priests, and people. 19They’ll fight you, but they won’t win, because I’m with you.” 	 Jer 1:14-19</p>
<p>Israel Forsakes God</p>
<p>2:1A Message from Yahveh came to Me:</p>
<p>2“Go proclaim in Jerusalem that Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘I remember your devotion when you were young,</p>
<p>your love as my betrothed,</p>
<p>your following me in the open country</p>
<p>through uncultivated land.</p>
<p>3Israel was holy to me,</p>
<p>the first fruits of my harvest.</p>
<p>Everybody that tried to eat some of it became guilty,</p>
<p>and disaster fell on them.’” 				Jer 2:1-3</p>
<p>4A Message from Yahveh to the House of Jacob</p>
<p>and the Families of Israel</p>
<p>5Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“What did your ancestors find wrong with me</p>
<p>that they left me and followed emptiness</p>
<p>and became empty themselves?</p>
<p>6They didn’t say, ‘Where’s Yahveh</p>
<p>that brought us out of Egypt</p>
<p>and led us through the wilderness,</p>
<p>through deserts and pits,</p>
<p>drought and deep darkness,</p>
<p>through land nobody crossed,</p>
<p>where nobody lived?’ 				Jer 2:4-6</p>
<p>7I brought you to a productive land</p>
<p>to eat the good things it produced,</p>
<p>but you defiled it</p>
<p>and made my inheritance detestable.</p>
<p>8The priests didn’t say, ‘Where’s Yahveh?’</p>
<p>Those who administered the Law didn’t know me;</p>
<p>the rulers sinned against me;</p>
<p>the prophets prophesied by Baal</p>
<p>and followed things that didn’t profit.		 Jer 2:7-8</p>
<p>9“So I’ll contend with you and your grandsons.</p>
<p>10Sail to Cyprus and see;</p>
<p>send to Kedar and look carefully</p>
<p>to see if there’s anything like this!</p>
<p>11Has any nation ever changed gods</p>
<p>to what weren’t gods?</p>
<p>But my people have exchanged their honor</p>
<p>for what are worthless.</p>
<p>12Be appalled at that, sky;</p>
<p>shudder and be dismayed.</p>
<p>13My people have committed two sins:</p>
<p>they’ve left me,</p>
<p>the fountain of living water,</p>
<p>and hewed out cracked cisterns</p>
<p>that can’t hold water. 					Jer 2:9-13</p>
<p>14“Is Israel a slave or a home-born servant?</p>
<p>Why has he become prey?</p>
<p>15Young lions have roared at him loudly;</p>
<p>they’ve made his country a wasteland</p>
<p>and destroyed his towns without residents.</p>
<p>16Egyptians from Memphis and Tahpanhes</p>
<p>have broken the crown on his head.</p>
<p>17Haven’t you done this to yourself</p>
<p>by leaving Yahveh your God,</p>
<p>when he was leading you along his way?	Jer 2:14-17</p>
<p>18What are you doing on the road to Egypt</p>
<p>to drink the water in the Nile?</p>
<p>Why go to Assyria</p>
<p>to drink the water of the Euphrates?</p>
<p>19Your own sins will correct you;</p>
<p>your apostasies will rebuke you.</p>
<p>Know then that it’s a sinful, bitter thing</p>
<p>to leave Yahveh your God;</p>
<p>you don’t respect me at all,” the Lord Yahveh of hosts says.   Jer 2:18-19</p>
<p>20“Long ago I broke your yoke</p>
<p>and tore off your slave chains;</p>
<p>but you said, ‘I won’t serve!’</p>
<p>On every tall hill under every green tree,</p>
<p>you’ve lain down like a prostitute.</p>
<p>21Yet I planted you as a choice stock,</p>
<p>as faithful seed.</p>
<p>How then have you turned yourself</p>
<p>into the degenerate sprouts of a wild vine?</p>
<p>22Though you wash yourself with lye and lots of soap,</p>
<p>I can still see the stain from your sin,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says.		Jer 2:20-22</p>
<p>Israel an Unfaithful Wife</p>
<p>23“How can you keep saying, ‘I’m not defiled;</p>
<p>I haven’t gone after the images of Baal’?</p>
<p>Look at your way in the valleys!</p>
<p>Acknowledge what you’ve done!</p>
<p>You’re a restless young camel,</p>
<p>pacing back and forth,</p>
<p>24a wild donkey accustomed to the desert,</p>
<p>in her heat sniffing the wind.</p>
<p>Who can control her?</p>
<p>They don’t need to waste energy looking for her;</p>
<p>she’ll come to them in her month.</p>
<p>25Don’t run after them till your feet are sore</p>
<p>and your throat’s dry.</p>
<p>But you said, ‘Don’t try to change me!</p>
<p>I love those foreign gods;</p>
<p>I’ll keep living their way.’	Jer 2:23-25</p>
<p>26“Like a thief embarrassed at getting caught,</p>
<p>the House of Israel is embarrassed—</p>
<p>they, their kings and officials,</p>
<p>priests and prophets,</p>
<p>27who say to a tree, ‘You’re my father,’</p>
<p>to a stone, ‘You’re my mother.’</p>
<p>They turn their backs on me;</p>
<p>but when trouble comes, they’ll call out,</p>
<p>‘Get up and save us.’</p>
<p>28Where are the gods you made for yourselves?</p>
<p>Have them save you if they can.</p>
<p>Judah, you have as many gods</p>
<p>as you have towns.	Jer 2:26-28</p>
<p>29“Why complain to me?</p>
<p>You’ve all sinned against me.</p>
<p>30I’ve disciplined you for nothing;</p>
<p>you didn’t respond to it.</p>
<p>Your sword has killed your prophets</p>
<p>like a ravenous lion kills prey.</p>
<p>31Generation, listen to Yahveh’s message.</p>
<p>Have I been a desert to Israel</p>
<p>or a land of deep darkness?</p>
<p>Why do my people say, ‘We’re free to roam;</p>
<p>we won’t come to you anymore’?	Jer 2:29-31</p>
<p>32Can a young woman forget her jewelry,</p>
<p>or a bride her wedding dress?</p>
<p>Yet my people have forgotten me time and again.</p>
<p>33You scheme so well to find love!</p>
<p>You’ve even taught immoral women how to do it</p>
<p>34The blood of the innocent poor</p>
<p>you’ve spattered on your clothes</p>
<p>though you didn’t catch them breaking in;</p>
<p>but despite that</p>
<p>35you say, ‘I haven’t done anything wrong;</p>
<p>surely he’s not mad at me!’	Jer 2:32-35</p>
<p>36How lightly you gad around from one way to another;</p>
<p>Egypt will humble you like Assyria did.</p>
<p>37You’ll leave here with your hands on your head,</p>
<p>because Yahveh has rejected the ones you depend on;</p>
<p>you won’t prosper by them.”	Jer 2:36-37</p>
<p>3:1God says,</p>
<p>“If a husband divorces his wife</p>
<p>and she marries another man,</p>
<p>will he take her back?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t that pollute the land?</p>
<p>But you’re a prostitute with lots of lovers;</p>
<p>yet you turn back to me to get help.</p>
<p>2Look up at the barren hills;</p>
<p>where haven’t you committed adultery?</p>
<p>You sit by the roads waiting for them</p>
<p>like a nomad in the desert.</p>
<p>You pollute the land</p>
<p>with your sinful prostitution.</p>
<p>3So I’ve withheld showers;</p>
<p>spring rain hasn’t come;</p>
<p>yet you’re a brazen prostitute</p>
<p>that refuses to be ashamed.</p>
<p>4Haven’t you called out to me just now,</p>
<p>‘Father, you’re the friend I had when I was young’?</p>
<p>5‘Are you going to stay angry forever?</p>
<p>Are you always going to be offended?’&quot;	Jer 3:1-5</p>
<p>Judah Follows Unfaithful Israel</p>
<p>6At the time of King Josiah, Yahveh said to me:</p>
<p>“Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She’s gone up on every tall hill and carried on her prostitution under every green tree. 7I thought that after she’d done that, she’d come back to me. But she didn’t, and her unfaithful sister saw it. 8I gave Israel divorce papers and sent her away for her adultery, but her unfaithful sister Judah wasn’t afraid. She left and became a prostitute too. 9Because prostitution was a small matter to her, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. 10Despite all this, her unfaithful sister Judah didn’t come back to me with all her heart, only in pretense.”	     Jer 3:6-10</p>
<p>Hope Even for Unfaithful Israel</p>
<p>11Yahveh told me:</p>
<p>“Unfaithful Israel has proved to be more upright than unfaithful Judah. 12Go deliver this message toward the north,</p>
<p>‘Come back, unfaithful Israel;</p>
<p>I won’t stay angry forever.</p>
<p>13Just own up to your unfaithfulness to me;</p>
<p>you scattered your favors to foreigners</p>
<p>under every green tree, and you haven’t obeyed me.</p>
<p>14Come back, unfaithful children,</p>
<p>because I’m your master.</p>
<p>I’ll bring back to Zion one from this town and two from that family.</p>
<p>Jer 3:11-14</p>
<p>15I’ll give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you knowledge and insight. 16When you’ve multiplied in the land, they won’t say anymore ‘The Ark of Yahveh’s covenant.’ It won’t be remembered or missed or remade. 17At that time, they’ll call Jerusalem The Throne of Yahveh. All the nations will gather there to be in his presence. They’ll stop following their stubborn, sinful hearts. 18Judah will follow Israel; together they’ll come back from exile in the north to the land I gave their ancestors.	  Jer 3:15-18</p>
<p>19“Then I said how I’d include you among my children</p>
<p>and give you a pleasant land,</p>
<p>the most beautiful inheritance in the world!</p>
<p>I said, ‘Call me “Father”</p>
<p>and not turn aside from following me.’</p>
<p>20But like an unfaithful wife that leaves her husband,</p>
<p>you’ve been unfaithful to me, Israel.”	Jer 3:19-20</p>
<p>21On the barren hills is the sound of</p>
<p>Israel’s people crying and pleading</p>
<p>because they’ve perverted their way</p>
<p>and forgotten their God.</p>
<p>22“Come back, unfaithful children;</p>
<p>I’ll heal your unfaithfulness.”</p>
<p>“We’re coming back to you</p>
<p>because you’re our God.</p>
<p>23The hills are a delusion,</p>
<p>the orgies on them as well.</p>
<p>Truly, in Yahveh our God</p>
<p>lies Israel’s salvation.	Jer 3:21-23</p>
<p>24“But from the time we were young, shameful things have consumed our ancestors’ labors, flocks and herds, sons and daughters. 25Let’s lie down in our shame and cover ourselves with our humiliation. We and our ancestors have sinned against Yahveh our God. We haven’t obeyed him.”      	   Jer 3:24-25</p>
<p>4:1“If you want to come back, you can;</p>
<p>get rid of your detestable idols</p>
<p>and don’t waver back and forth with them.</p>
<p>2Swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives,’</p>
<p>honestly, justly, uprightly;</p>
<p>then the nations will be blessed in him</p>
<p>and glory in him.”</p>
<p>Coming Destruction from the North</p>
<p>3Yahveh says to the people in Judah and Jerusalem:</p>
<p>“Break up your heart’s fallow ground</p>
<p>and don’t throw your seed among its thorns.</p>
<p>4Circumcise yourselves to Yahveh;</p>
<p>remove the foreskins of your heart,</p>
<p>people in Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>so my anger won’t flare because of your sins</p>
<p>and burn with nobody to put it out.”	Jer 4:1-4</p>
<p>5Declare in Judah and Jerusalem:</p>
<p>“Blow the bugle in the land;</p>
<p>call out and say,</p>
<p>‘Flee to the fortified cities.’</p>
<p>6Lift up a standard toward Zion!</p>
<p>Run for refuge;</p>
<p>hurry because I’m bringing</p>
<p>widespread destruction from the north.”</p>
<p>7A lion has come up out of its thicket,</p>
<p>one that destroys nations;</p>
<p>it’s left its den to devastate your land</p>
<p>and make your towns empty ruins.</p>
<p>8Put on burlap for that;</p>
<p>lament and wail,</p>
<p>because Yahveh’s fierce anger</p>
<p>hasn’t turned away from us.	Jer 4:5-8</p>
<p>9“At that time,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“the hearts of the king and officials will fail,</p>
<p>the priests will be terrified,</p>
<p>and the prophets horrified.”</p>
<p>10Then I said, “Lord Yahveh, you completely misled this nation and Jerusalem when you said they’d have peace; they have a sword at their throat!”</p>
<p>11-12“I’ll answer them, ‘A scorching wind from the desert’s barren hills will blow on you, a wind too strong for winnowing grain or sweeping a threshing floor. It will come at my command to pronounce condemnation on you.’ 	  Jer 4:9-12</p>
<p>13Judah’s enemy rises up like clouds;</p>
<p>his chariots go up like a whirlwind;</p>
<p>his horses are faster than eagles.</p>
<p>‘Misfortune awaits us! We’re doomed!’”	Jer 4:13</p>
<p>14Jerusalem, wash the evil off your heart</p>
<p>so you can be saved;</p>
<p>how long will you harbor bad thoughts?</p>
<p>15A voice declares from Dan</p>
<p>and announces from Mount Ephraim</p>
<p>that disaster is on the way.</p>
<p>16“Warn the nearby nations now! Announce it in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>besiegers are coming from a far country</p>
<p>to raise their battle cries at the towns in Judah.</p>
<p>17Like watchmen around a field, they’re against it all around</p>
<p>because it’s rebelled against me,” Yahveh says.</p>
<p>18“Your ways and deeds have brought this on you;</p>
<p>this bitter punishment has cut you to the heart!” 	Jer 4:14-18</p>
<p>Jeremiah Anguish over Judah’s Desolation</p>
<p>19My soul, my soul! I’m in anguish!</p>
<p>My heart’s pounding, I can’t stay still.</p>
<p>My soul, you’ve heard the bugle’s signal for war.</p>
<p>20Disaster on top of disaster is in store,</p>
<p>devastating the whole land.</p>
<p>It’s destroyed my tents in no time;</p>
<p>my curtains were gone in a flash.</p>
<p>21How long do I have to look at the standard</p>
<p>and listen to the bugle?</p>
<p>22“My people are foolish; they don’t know me;</p>
<p>they’re ignorant kids that don’t understand.</p>
<p>They’re good at doing bad,</p>
<p>but they don’t know how to do good.”	Jer 4:19-22</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Vision of Coming Disaster</p>
<p>23I looked at the earth;</p>
<p>it was unformed and empty;</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky;</p>
<p>it didn’t shed any light.</p>
<p>24I looked at the mountains and hills,</p>
<p>quaking back and forth.</p>
<p>25I didn’t see any people;</p>
<p>the birds had flown away.</p>
<p>26The fertile land had become a desert;</p>
<p>its towns lay in ruins</p>
<p>in the face of Yahveh’s fierce anger.	Jer 4:23-26</p>
<p>27Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“The whole country will be a wasteland,</p>
<p>but I won’t completely destroy it.</p>
<p>28The earth will mourn,</p>
<p>and the sky will grow dark;</p>
<p>I’ve told you my intentions,</p>
<p>and I won’t change my mind.”</p>
<p>29At the sound of calvary and archers, every town is scattering;</p>
<p>they’re running into thickets and hiding in rocks;</p>
<p>they’re abandoning the towns.	Jer 4:27-29</p>
<p>30What are you going to do, desolate one?</p>
<p>Though you’re dressed in scarlet</p>
<p>and decorate yourself with gold jewelry</p>
<p>and accent your eyes with mascara,</p>
<p>making yourself beautiful won’t do any good,</p>
<p>because your lovers despise you,</p>
<p>intent on killing you.</p>
<p>31I hear a woman crying out in labor,</p>
<p>the anguish of one giving birth to her first child,</p>
<p>the cry of the young woman of Zion gasping for breath,</p>
<p>stretching out her hands and saying,</p>
<p>“Misfortune awaits me; I’m being murdered.”	Jer 4:30-31</p>
<p>Jerusalem Refuses to Repent</p>
<p>5:1“Wander back and forth in the streets in Jerusalem;</p>
<p>search all around in it.</p>
<p>Look in its open squares:</p>
<p>if you can find one honest person,</p>
<p>one that looks for the truth,</p>
<p>I’ll pardon it.</p>
<p>2Although they swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives,’</p>
<p>they don’t mean it.</p>
<p>3Yahveh, aren’t you looking for honesty?						You’ve struck them,</p>
<p>but they didn’t feel anything;</p>
<p>you’ve consumed them,</p>
<p>but they’ve refused to be corrected;</p>
<p>they’ve set their faces like stone</p>
<p>and refused to repent.”	Jer 5:1-3</p>
<p>4Then I said, “They’re poor and foolish,							because they don’t know the way of Yahveh							or the ordinance of their God.							5I’ll go to their leaders and speak to them;								surely they know the way of Yahveh,</p>
<p>what their God requires.</p>
<p>As a group, their leaders have broken his yoke off</p>
<p>and kicked his traces.</p>
<p>6So a lion from the woods will kill them;</p>
<p>a wolf from the desert will destroy them;</p>
<p>a leopard is watching their towns,</p>
<p>ready to maul anyone that ventures out,</p>
<p>because their sins are many,</p>
<p>their apostasies. numerous.	Jer 5:4-6</p>
<p>7“Why should I pardon you?</p>
<p>Your offspring have left me</p>
<p>and sworn by what aren’t gods.</p>
<p>When I fed them to the full,</p>
<p>they committed adultery</p>
<p>and trooped to houses of prostitution.</p>
<p>8They were well-fed, lusty stallions,</p>
<p>each one neighing for his neighbor’s mare.</p>
<p>9Won’t I punish them</p>
<p>and avenge myself on a nation like that?”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.                     Jer 5:7-9</p>
<p>10“Go through its rows of grapevines</p>
<p>and cut down all but a few;</p>
<p>strip away their branches</p>
<p>because they don’t belong to me.</p>
<p>11Israel and Judah have dealt deviously with me.</p>
<p>12They’ve misjudged me and said,							‘He won’t do anything;									misfortune won’t fall on us;								we won’t see sword or famine.							13His prophets are windbags;								they don’t have any message from him.’						Indeed, those things will happen to them!”		Jer 5:10-13</p>
<p>14So Yahveh God of hosts says.</p>
<p>“Since they’ve claimed that,</p>
<p>I’ll make my word fire in your mouth,</p>
<p>make these people kindling,</p>
<p>and burn them up.</p>
<p>15I’ll bring a distant nation against you, Israel,</p>
<p>an ancient, enduring one</p>
<p>whose language you don’t know,</p>
<p>whose speech you can’t understand.</p>
<p>16Their quiver is like an open grave;</p>
<p>they’re all powerful men.</p>
<p>17They’ll eat your harvest and your food,</p>
<p>kill your children,</p>
<p>eat your flocks and herds,</p>
<p>eat the fruit on your grapevines and fig trees,</p>
<p>and destroy with the sword</p>
<p>the fortified towns you rely on.	Jer 5:14-17</p>
<p>18Yet even at that time,” Yahveh says, “I won’t destroy you completely. 19When they say, ’Why has Yahveh our God done this to us?’ tell them, ‘As you’ve left me and served foreign gods in your country, so you’ll serve foreigners in someone else’s country.’		   Jer 5:18-19</p>
<p>20“Tell Jacob, announce it in Judah, 						21‘Foolish, senseless people, listen to this,							you that have eyes, but don’t see,									and ears, but don’t hear,						22You’re not going to respect me?								You’re not going to tremble in my presence?’”								Yahveh says.        		  Jer 5:20-22a</p>
<p>“I’ve made sand a boundary for the ocean,							an eternal decree it can’t cross;</p>
<p>though the waves toss and roar,</p>
<p>they can’t wash over it.</p>
<p>23But my people have a stubborn, rebellious heart;						they’ve turned aside and left.</p>
<p>24They don’t say in their hearts,</p>
<p>‘Let’s respect Yahveh our God,</p>
<p>who sends rain in its season,</p>
<p>autumn and spring,</p>
<p>who keeps for us</p>
<p>the set weeks for harvest.’	Jer 5:22b-24</p>
<p>25Your iniquities have deprived you of those things;</p>
<p>your sins have robbed you of them.</p>
<p>26Sinners among my people</p>
<p>lie in wait like fowlers in a blind;</p>
<p>they set traps to catch people.</p>
<p>27Like cages full of birds,</p>
<p>their houses are full of deceit;</p>
<p>that’s how they’ve become important and rich.</p>
<p>28They’re healthy and sleek,</p>
<p>excelling in sinful things.</p>
<p>29Won’t I punish them?</p>
<p>won’t I avenge myself on a nation like that?”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.	Jer 5:25-29</p>
<p>30“A shocking, horrible thing is happening in the land;</p>
<p>31the prophets prophesy falsely,</p>
<p>the priests rule on their own authority,</p>
<p>and my people like it that way!</p>
<p>But how will this end for you?	Jer 5:30-31</p>
<p>Jerusalem Under Siege</p>
<p>6:1“People of Benjamin, get out of Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Blow a bugle in Tekoa,</p>
<p>sound the ram’s horn over Beth-haccerem,</p>
<p>because great destruction</p>
<p>looms down from the north.</p>
<p>2I’ll destroy attractive, delicate Zion.</p>
<p>3‘Shepherds’ [commanders] will lead their companies there</p>
<p>and pitch camps around it,</p>
<p>each with his own area to subdue.</p>
<p>4Get ready for war with it;</p>
<p>get up! attack at noon!</p>
<p>But misfortune would await us; it’s getting late;</p>
<p>shadows are getting longer.</p>
<p>5So get up! Let’s attack at night</p>
<p>and destroy its fortified towers.”	Jer 6:1-5</p>
<p>6Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“Cut down its trees;</p>
<p>build a siege wall against it.</p>
<p>Punish Jerusalem;</p>
<p>there’s nothing in it but oppression.</p>
<p>7As a well keeps its water fresh,</p>
<p>this city keeps its sinfulness fresh.</p>
<p>I hear violence and destruction in it;</p>
<p>its sickness and wounds are constantly evident to me.</p>
<p>8Jerusalem, pay attention to the warning,</p>
<p>or I’ll separate you from me</p>
<p>and make you desolate and unoccupied.”	Jer 6:6-8</p>
<p>9Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“They’ll thoroughly glean you like a remnant in Israel;</p>
<p>they’ll pass over you again</p>
<p>like someone that gathers grapes</p>
<p>picks over the branches one more time.”</p>
<p>10How should I warn them?</p>
<p>They’ve covered their ears and can’t listen;</p>
<p>any message from Yahveh offends them.  		Jer 6:9-10</p>
<p>11But I’m full of Yahveh’s anger;</p>
<p>I’m tired of holding it in!</p>
<p>“I’ll pour it out on children in the streets,</p>
<p>on groups of young men;</p>
<p>husbands and wives will both be taken,</p>
<p>the old and gray as well.</p>
<p>12Their houses will pass on to other people,</p>
<p>their fields and wives too,</p>
<p>because I’ll reach out against the people in the land.</p>
<p>13That’s because every one’s greedy								from least to greatest;</p>
<p>every one cheats										from prophet to priest.</p>
<p>14They try to bandage over my people’s wounds</p>
<p>by saying, ‘Everything’s all right,’ when it’s not.</p>
<p>15Are they ashamed of their disgusting acts?</p>
<p>Not at all. They can’t even blush;</p>
<p>so they’ll fall with the falling.</p>
<p>When I punish them,</p>
<p>I’ll cast them down,” Yahveh says.	Jer 6:11-15</p>
<p>16Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“Stand beside the road and ask where the ancient paths are;</p>
<p>ask where the good road is and walk on it;</p>
<p>you’ll find some rest.</p>
<p>But they say, ‘We’re not going to walk there.’</p>
<p>17I posted a watchman over you and said,</p>
<p>‘Listen to the bugle!’</p>
<p>But they said, ‘We don’t have to listen to it.’	Jer 6:16-17</p>
<p>18“So listen, nations;</p>
<p>know, community, what’s among them.</p>
<p>19Listen, earth; I’m going to bring disaster on them,						a disaster that results from their intentions,							because they ignored me									and wouldn’t accept my Law.</p>
<p>20Why offer me frankincense from Sheba</p>
<p>and calamus from some distant land?</p>
<p>Your burnt offerings aren’t acceptable;</p>
<p>your sacrifices don’t please me.”	Jer 6:18-20</p>
<p>21Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll lay obstacles in front of my people</p>
<p>so they’ll trip over them;</p>
<p>Fathers and sons together,</p>
<p>neighbors and friends will perish.”	Jer 6:21</p>
<p>22Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“A big army will rise up</p>
<p>from the remote parts of the world;</p>
<p>a nation will come from a land up north.</p>
<p>23They take up bow and spear;</p>
<p>they’re cruel with no mercy.</p>
<p>They roar like the ocean and ride on horses,</p>
<p>arrayed for battle against you, Zion.&quot;</p>
<p>24We’ve heard the report about them; our hands hang limp;</p>
<p>birth pangs have seized us like a woman in labor.</p>
<p>25Don’t go out in the field or walk on the road,</p>
<p>because the enemy has a sword;</p>
<p>they terrorize everywhere.</p>
<p>26Put on burlap, my people, and roll in ashes;</p>
<p>mourn like you would for an only son—</p>
<p>a bitter lamentation,</p>
<p>because the destroyer will come at you suddenly.	Jer 6:22-26</p>
<p>27“Jeremiah, I’ve made you an assayer among my people</p>
<p>so you can test them and know how they live.</p>
<p>28They’re stubborn and rebellious,</p>
<p>and go around slandering.</p>
<p>They’re as hardened as bronze and iron—</p>
<p>corrupt, every one.</p>
<p>29The bellows blow fiercely,</p>
<p>but the refining doesn’t purify;</p>
<p>the sinfulness does not burn off.</p>
<p>30Assay them as ‘rejected silver’</p>
<p>because Yahveh has rejected them.”	Jer 6:27-30</p>
<p>7:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>Jeremiah Speaks at the Temple</p>
<p>2“Stand in the entrance to Yahveh’s Temple and deliver this message, ‘Listen to a message from Yahveh, all of you in Judah that go in these gates to worship him! 3If you mend your ways, I’ll let you live here. 4Don’t trust in these deceptive words, “This is Yahveh’s Temple, Yahveh’s Temple, Yahveh’s Temple!” 5If you mend your ways</p>
<p>and practice goodness with one another,</p>
<p>6if you don’t oppress foreigners, orphans, or widows;</p>
<p>and don’t shed innocent blood here</p>
<p>or follow other gods to your own ruin—</p>
<p>7then I’ll let you keep living in this land that I gave your ancestors forever.</p>
<p>8“‘You’re trusting in deceiving words to no avail. 9Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, sacrifice to Baal, and follow other gods you’ve not known? 10Then will you come and try to depend on me in this Temple that wears my name, and think you’re safe—and go on doing those same detestable things? 11Do you regard this Temple as a den of thieves? I’ve seen for myself what it is.       			  Jer 7:1-11</p>
<p>12“‘Go to Shiloh, which I identified myself with first. See what I did to it because my people sinned. 13Now you’ve done the same things. I spoke to you about them, getting up early and speaking to you, but you ignored me. I called you, but you wouldn’t answer. 14So, what I did to Shiloh I’ll do to the Temple that wears my name—that you trust in—and to the place I gave you and your ancestors. 15I’ll throw you out of my sight like I did your relatives, Ephraim’s offspring.’</p>
<p>12‘Go to Shiloh, which I identified myself with first. See what I did to it because my people sinned. 13Now you’ve done the same things. I spoke to you about them, getting up early and speaking to you, but you didn’t listen. I called you, but you didn’t answer. 14So, what I did to Shiloh I’ll do to the Temple that wears my name—that you trust in—the place I gave you and your ancestors. 15I’ll throw you out of my sight into exile like I did your relatives, Ephraim’s offspring.’</p>
<p>16“Don’t pray for my people, Jeremiah; don’t lift up a petition for them. Don’t intercede with me; I won’t listen. 17Don’t you see what they’re doing in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 18The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, the women knead dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven.  They pour out liquid offerings to other gods to spite me. 19Do they spite me? Aren’t they doing spite to themselves to their own disgrace? 20So I’ll pour out my anger on people and animals here, trees in the field and produce from the ground. It will burn and not be put out.          	Jer 7:12-20</p>
<p>21“Go on and add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat. 22When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn’t speak to them about burnt offerings and sacrifices so much as 23I commanded them, ‘Obey me, and I’ll be your God, and you’ll be my people. Follow the way I command you so things will go well for you.’ 24Yet they didn’t listen or obey. They followed their own ideas and conducted themselves according to their stubborn, sinful hearts. They went backward, not forward. 25From that time till now, I’ve sent you my prophets, getting up early every day and sending them. 26But you ignored me. You stiffened your neck and did more evil than your ancestors.         	 Jer 7:21-26</p>
<p>27“Tell them that, but they won’t listen; call to them, but they won’t answer. 28Tell them, ‘Truth has disappeared from this nation that didn’t obey Yahveh their God or accept correction.</p>
<p>29‘Cut off your hair and throw it away;</p>
<p>take up a lamentation on the barren hills.</p>
<p>Yahveh has rejected and abandoned</p>
<p>the generation he’s angry with.’</p>
<p>30“Judah has done what I’ve forbidden. Its people have put their detestable things in the Temple that wears my name and defiled it. 31They’ve built high places in Topheth in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, and burned their sons and daughters, which I didn’t command. Such a thing never entered my mind! 32So the time’s coming when it won’t be called Topheth anymore, or The Valley of (Ben)Hinnom. They’ll call it The Valley of Slaughter because they’ll bury in Topheth till there’s no place left to bury. 33Those people’s dead bodies will feed the birds and animals, and nobody will chase them away. 34Then I’ll put a stop to the joy and happiness, the voices of bride and groom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. The land will lie in ruins.”	Jer 7:27-34</p>
<p>8:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“At that time, they’ll bring out of their graves the bones of Judah’s kings, its officials, priests, prophets, and the people of Jerusalem. 2They’ll spread them out to the sun, moon, and stars, which they’ve loved, served, and worshiped. They won’t be gathered up or buried. They’ll be like manure on the ground. 3The remnant of this evil family will chose death rather than life.     	   Jer 8:1-3</p>
<p>False Prophets</p>
<p>4“Tell them, ‘Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“When people fall down,</p>
<p>don’t they get back up?</p>
<p>When they get off course,</p>
<p>don’t they get back on it?”</p>
<p>5Why then do my people, Jerusalem,</p>
<p>turn away and keep backsliding?</p>
<p>They hang onto deceit and refuse to return.</p>
<p>6I’ve been listening to what they’re saying,</p>
<p>and it’s not right.</p>
<p>Nobody’s repented or said,</p>
<p>‘What have I done?!’</p>
<p>Everybody keeps up their old habits</p>
<p>like a horse charging into battle.</p>
<p>7Even a stork in the sky knows when to migrate;</p>
<p>so does a turtledove, swift, or thrush.</p>
<p>But my people don’t know my patterns of living.	Jer 8:4-7</p>
<p>8“How can you say, ‘We’re wise;</p>
<p>we have Yahveh’s Law’?</p>
<p>The scribes’ lying pen</p>
<p>makes a lie out of it.</p>
<p>9The wise are put to shame;</p>
<p>they’re intimidated and trapped.</p>
<p>They’ve rejected Yahveh’s word;</p>
<p>so what kind of wisdom do they have?</p>
<p>10So I’ll give their wives to other people</p>
<p>and their fields to conquerors;</p>
<p>because every one is greedy</p>
<p>from least to greatest;</p>
<p>every one cheats</p>
<p>from prophet to priest.</p>
<p>11They try to bandage over my people’s wounds					by saying, ‘Everything’s all right,’ when it’s not.</p>
<p>12“Are they ever ashamed of their disgusting acts?</p>
<p>Not at all! They can’t even blush;</p>
<p>so they’ll fall among the fallen</p>
<p>when I punish them,” Yahveh says. 		Jer 8:8-12</p>
<p>13“When I snatch them away,										there won’t be any grapes left on the vine								or figs on the tree,											and their leaves will wither;</p>
<p>what I’ve given them will be gone.”							14Why are we sitting here?									Let’s get to fortified cities to die;</p>
<p>Yahveh our God has doomed us</p>
<p>by giving us poisoned water to drink.</p>
<p>15We looked for peace, but it didn’t come;</p>
<p>we waited for healing, but terror came.	Jer 8:13-15</p>
<p>16From Dan we can hear the horses snorting;</p>
<p>at the sound of his stallions’ neighing</p>
<p>the whole land quakes;</p>
<p>they’re coming to devastate the land</p>
<p>and everything in it,</p>
<p>the city and its people.</p>
<p>17“I’m sending ‘snakes’ [troops] among you,</p>
<p>adders you can’t charm,</p>
<p>and they’ll bite you,”		Yahveh says.		Jer 8:16-17</p>
<p>Jeremiah Mourns over Sinful Judah</p>
<p>18My sorrow can’t be healed;</p>
<p>my heart is sick!</p>
<p>19Listen! It’s my people’s outcry from a distant land:</p>
<p>“Isn’t Yahveh in Zion?</p>
<p>Isn’t its king there?”</p>
<p>“Why have they made me angry</p>
<p>with their carved images and foreign idols?”</p>
<p>20“Harvest is past, summer’s over;</p>
<p>and we’re not saved.”	Jer 8:18-20</p>
<p>21I’m hurting for my people’s hurt;</p>
<p>I mourn, panic has seized me.</p>
<p>22Isn’t there any salve in Gilead?</p>
<p>Isn’t there any doctor there?</p>
<p>Why hasn’t my people’s health been restored? 		Jer 8:21-22</p>
<p>9:1Oh that my head was a body of water</p>
<p>and my eyes a fountain of tears,</p>
<p>so I could weep day and night</p>
<p>for my people slain!</p>
<p>2I wish I had an inn in the desert,</p>
<p>so I could escape from my people;</p>
<p>because they’re all adulterers, a pack of liars.</p>
<p>3“They bend their tongues like bows;</p>
<p>lies, not truth, dominate the land.</p>
<p>The people move from one sin to another;</p>
<p>they don’t know me. 	Jer 9:1-3</p>
<p>4“Be leery of your neighbor;</p>
<p>don’t trust your own brother,</p>
<p>because every brother takes advantage of brother</p>
<p>and every neighbor slanders.</p>
<p>5They all deceive their friends;</p>
<p>nobody tells the truth.</p>
<p>They’ve taught their tongues how to lie;</p>
<p>they wear themselves out sinning.</p>
<p>6They live in deceit;</p>
<p>by deceiving, they refuse to know me,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.    	Jer 9:4-6</p>
<p>Judgment for Disobedience</p>
<p>7So he says:</p>
<p>“I’ll refine them and assay them;</p>
<p>what else can I do with them?</p>
<p>8Their tongues are deadly arrows that deceive;</p>
<p>they talk peace to one another,</p>
<p>but inside they’re setting an ambush for them.</p>
<p>9Am I not going to punish them for such things</p>
<p>and avenge myself on a nation like that?			Jer 9:7-9</p>
<p>10“I’ll weep and wail for the mountains</p>
<p>and take up a dirge for the pastures,</p>
<p>because they’re laid waste, so nobody travels that way.</p>
<p>Nobody hears cattle bawling;</p>
<p>birds and animals have left.</p>
<p>11I’ll make Jerusalem a pile of ruins, a den for jackals,</p>
<p>and the towns in Judah ghost towns.”	Jer 9:10-11</p>
<p>12Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is Yahveh talking to that can pass it on? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert nobody travels through? 13Yahveh answers,</p>
<p>“They’ve abandoned the Law I set before them;</p>
<p>they haven’t followed it or obeyed me.</p>
<p>14They’ve followed Baal and their stubborn heart</p>
<p>like their ancestors taught them.</p>
<p>15So I’ll feed them bitter plants to eat</p>
<p>and give them poisoned water to drink.</p>
<p>16I’ll scatter them among nations</p>
<p>they and their ancestors never knew,</p>
<p>and chase them with the sword till I’ve wiped them out.” Jer 9:12-16</p>
<p>17Yahveh of Hosts says:</p>
<p>“Call for mourners;</p>
<p>call for wailing women!</p>
<p>18Have them hurry and raise up wailing for us</p>
<p>so our eyes shed tears</p>
<p>and our eyelids flow with water.</p>
<p>19There is wailing in Zion,</p>
<p>‘We’re ruined!</p>
<p>We’re disgraced</p>
<p>because we’ve left our country,</p>
<p>and they’ve torn down our houses.’”</p>
<p>20Listen to Yahveh’s message, women;</p>
<p>your ears need to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p>Teach your daughters how to wail;</p>
<p>teach your friends a dirge.</p>
<p>21Death has come up into our windows</p>
<p>and climbed into our houses;</p>
<p>it’s killed our children in the streets</p>
<p>and our young men in the town squares.</p>
<p>22Say, “Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Corpses will fall like manure in the pasture,</p>
<p>like bundles behind the reaper;</p>
<p>but nobody will gather them up.’”	Jer 9:17-22</p>
<p>23Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Don’t let the wise brag about their wisdom,</p>
<p>or the strong boast of their strength.</p>
<p>or the rich gloat over their wealth.</p>
<p>24Instead, they need to take pride</p>
<p>in knowing I’m Yahveh</p>
<p>who practices enduring love, justice, and goodness in the world,</p>
<p>because that’s what I delight in.</p>
<p>25“The time’s coming when I’ll punish everyone that’s circumcised in body but not in heart—26Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and the ones in the desert that cut the corners of their hair.</p>
<p>All the nations are uncircumcised;</p>
<p>everyone in Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”              	       Jer 9:23-26</p>
<p>God and Idols</p>
<p>10:1Listen to the message Yahveh’s giving you, Israel:</p>
<p>2“Don’t pick up the ways other nations live;</p>
<p>don’t let the signs in the sky</p>
<p>terrify you that terrify them.</p>
<p>3Their customs are delusions.</p>
<p>They cut down a tree in the woods,</p>
<p>and their craftsmen carve it with a tool;</p>
<p>4they decorate it with silver and gold</p>
<p>and fasten it down with hammer and nails</p>
<p>so it won’t shift.</p>
<p>5Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber patch.</p>
<p>They can’t talk;</p>
<p>they can’t walk, so they have to be carried!</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid of them;</p>
<p>they can’t do any good or harm.”	Jer 10:1-5</p>
<p>6There’s none like you, Yahveh;</p>
<p>you’re great and powerful.</p>
<p>7Who wouldn’t respect you, King of nations?</p>
<p>It’s your due!</p>
<p>There’s no one like you among</p>
<p>the wise in any kingdom.</p>
<p>8But their instruction is completely foolish;</p>
<p>they’re nothing but wood!</p>
<p>9People bring beaten silver from Tarshish</p>
<p>and gold from Uphaz;</p>
<p>craftsmen and goldsmiths make the idols;</p>
<p>they dress them in violet and purple,</p>
<p>artisans’ work.</p>
<p>10But Yahveh is a real God,</p>
<p>a living God and everlasting King.</p>
<p>The ground shakes at his anger;</p>
<p>the nations can’t endure his indignation.	Jer 10:6-10</p>
<p>11Tell them this: “The gods that didn’t make earth and sky</p>
<p>will perish from it.”</p>
<p>12He’s the One that made the earth by his power,</p>
<p>that built the world by his wisdom,</p>
<p>that stretched out the sky by his intelligence.</p>
<p>13When he speaks, there’s thunder in the rain above;</p>
<p>he makes clouds come up from the horizon,</p>
<p>makes lightning for the rain,</p>
<p>and sends wind out of his storehouses.</p>
<p>14Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;</p>
<p>idols disgrace their goldsmiths,</p>
<p>because molten images misrepresent;</p>
<p>they can’t even breathe.</p>
<p>15They’re worthless objects to ridicule;</p>
<p>when they’re punished, they perish.</p>
<p>16Jacob’s portion is not like them;</p>
<p>his God has made everything;</p>
<p>Israel is his inheritance;</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh of Hosts.	Jer 10:11-16</p>
<p>The Looming Destruction</p>
<p>17Pick up your baggage,</p>
<p>you that live under siege!</p>
<p>18Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m tossing out the people that live here</p>
<p>and causing them distress</p>
<p>so no one can find them later.”	Jer 10:17-18</p>
<p>19I’m hurt and my wound can’t heal;</p>
<p>it’s pain I have to bear.</p>
<p>20My tent’s destroyed;</p>
<p>its guy ropes have snapped.</p>
<p>My children are gone;</p>
<p>they don’t exist anymore.</p>
<p>There’s nobody to set up my tent again</p>
<p>or hang my curtains.</p>
<p>21The shepherds don’t use any sense;</p>
<p>they don’t look to Yahveh;</p>
<p>so they haven’t prospered,</p>
<p>and their flock has scattered.</p>
<p>22There’s a loud uproar in the north</p>
<p>that’s headed for the towns in Judah</p>
<p>to make them desolate, dens for jackals.	Jer 10:19-22</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Prayer</p>
<p>23I know, Yahveh, that we don’t set our own way;</p>
<p>when we walk, we don’t set the direction of our steps.</p>
<p>24Correct me, but in due measure,</p>
<p>not with your anger, or you’d destroy me.</p>
<p>25Pour out your anger on nations that don’t know you,</p>
<p>on families that don’t call on you;</p>
<p>because they’ve devastated Jacob</p>
<p>and laid waste his homeland.	Jer 10:23-25</p>
<p>11:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>Judah’s Broken Covenant</p>
<p>2“Listen to this covenant and tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem 3that Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘People are under a curse who ignore the covenant 4that I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the iron furnace. I said, “If you listen to what I’m telling you, you’ll be my people, and I’ll be your God.”  5Doing what I tell you confirms the oath I swore to give you a land flowing with milk and honey, like it is now.’”</p>
<p>I answered, “Yes, Yahveh.”</p>
<p>6He told me,</p>
<p>“Deliver this message in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, ‘Do what the covenant says. 7From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt till now, I solemnly and persistently warned them to listen to me, 8but they didn‘t. They followed their own stubborn hearts. So I brought on them what the terms of the covenant warned would happen if they didn’t keep it.’”    	  Jer 11:1-8</p>
<p>9Then Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“I’ve found mutiny among the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 10They’ve returned to their ancestors’ sins by going after other gods. Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers. 11So I’m going to bring a disaster they can’t escape. Even if they call out to me, I’ll ignore them. 12Then the towns in Judah and the people in Jerusalem will call out to the gods they burn incense to, but they won’t save them when disaster comes. 13Judah, you have as many gods as towns. You have as many incense altars to Baal as you have streets in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14“So, Jeremiah, don’t pray for my people or lift up a cry for them in this disaster. 15What right does my beloved have to live in my house when she’s done so many disgusting things? Can sacrificing meat make her disaster go away and make her happy?”        		 Jer 11:9-15</p>
<p>16Yahveh once called you a green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form. With the noise of great fury, he’s set it on fire and burned up its branches. 17Israel and Judah, Yahveh of Hosts that planted you has pronounced disaster on you because you’ve provoked him by burning incense to Baal.</p>
<p>A Plot Against Jeremiah</p>
<p>18Yahveh, I found out from you their plots against me.</p>
<p>19I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter;</p>
<p>I didn’t know they’d said,</p>
<p>“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit;</p>
<p>let’s cut him off from the land of the living</p>
<p>so nobody remembers him.”</p>
<p>20But, Yahveh of Hosts, who judges justly,</p>
<p>who tries heart and mind,</p>
<p>let me see you pay them back,</p>
<p>because I’ve turned my worries over to you.	    	Jer 11:16-20</p>
<p>21So this is what Yahveh says about the ones in Anathoth that tell me they’ll kill me if I prophesy in his name:</p>
<p>22“Their young men will die by the sword;</p>
<p>their boys and girls will starve to death;</p>
<p>23None of them will survive the disaster</p>
<p>l’m bringing to punish them.”       	 Jer 11:21-23</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Complaint</p>
<p>12:1You render justice, Yahveh,</p>
<p>so I’ll argue my case to you.</p>
<p>Why do the wicked prosper,</p>
<p>and the devious live in ease?</p>
<p>2You planted them and they took root;</p>
<p>they grew and bore fruit.</p>
<p>You’re near their lips</p>
<p>but far from their mind.</p>
<p>3But, Yahveh, you know me;</p>
<p>you see me.</p>
<p>You examine my attitude toward you.</p>
<p>Drag them off like sheep for slaughter;</p>
<p>set them apart to be butchered.</p>
<p>4How long will the land mourn</p>
<p>and the pastures wither?</p>
<p>The animals and birds have disappeared</p>
<p>because the people there are sinners</p>
<p>that say, “He doesn’t see what’s in store for us.”	Jer 12:1-4</p>
<p>God’s Reply</p>
<p>5“If racing against men wears yousg out,</p>
<p>how can you compete with horses?</p>
<p>If you fall down on cleared ground,</p>
<p>how will you fair in the jungle by the Jordan?</p>
<p>6Even the members of your own family</p>
<p>have turned against you and yelled at you;</p>
<p>don’t trust them even if they say nice things to you.	Jer 12:5-6</p>
<p>7“I’ve abandoned my Temple,</p>
<p>forsaken my permanent possession,</p>
<p>and delivered my loved ones to their enemies.</p>
<p>8My permanent possession has roared at me</p>
<p>like a lion in the woods,</p>
<p>and I’ve detested them.</p>
<p>9Is my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?</p>
<p>Are birds of prey swooping at it from every direction?</p>
<p>Round up the wild animals;</p>
<p>bring them to gorge!	Jer 12:7-9</p>
<p>10Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard;</p>
<p>they’ve tramped down my field</p>
<p>and made it barren.</p>
<p>11They’ve made it desolate;</p>
<p>it mourns to me.</p>
<p>The whole country has become a wasteland</p>
<p>because nobody’s taking care of it.</p>
<p>12Destroying armies have come</p>
<p>on all the barren hills.</p>
<p>The sword of Yahveh is devouring</p>
<p>from one end of the land to another;</p>
<p>there’s no peace for anybody.</p>
<p>13They’ve sown wheat and reaped thorns;</p>
<p>they’ve worn themselves out for nothing.</p>
<p>Be ashamed of your harvest</p>
<p>because of Yahveh’s fierce anger.”	Jer 12:10-13</p>
<p>A Message for Israel’s Neighbors</p>
<p>14This is what Yahveh says about neighboring nations that strike at my people’s inheritance:</p>
<p>“I’m about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. 15But afterward I’ll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. 16Then, if they’ll learn to swear by me, ‘As sure as the Lord lives,’ like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I’ll let them live among my people. 17But any nation that won’t listen, I’ll uproot and destroy.” 	  Jer 12:14-17</p>
<p>The Ruined Linen Loincloth</p>
<p>13:1Yahveh told me, “Go buy a linen waistcloth and put it on. Don’t wash it.”</p>
<p>2So I bought one and put it on.</p>
<p>3Then he said,</p>
<p>4“Take it to the Euphrates and hide it in a crevice in a rock.” 5So I went and hid it there. 6A long time later, Yahveh told me to go get it. 7I went and dug it out of where I’d put it. It was ruined.</p>
<p>8Then he told me,</p>
<p>9“This waistcloth illustrates how I’ll ruin arrogant Judah and Jerusalem. 10These people are following their own stubborn hearts in serving and bowing to other gods; they won’t be good for anything—like this waistcloth. 11As it clings to a person’s waist, so I made Israel and Judah for clinging to me so they could be my people, a name, praise, and glory; but they’ve ignored me. 	  Jer 13:1-11</p>
<p>12“So tell them that Yahveh God of Israel says to fill every jug with wine. When they say, ‘Don’t we very well know how to do that?’ 13then say, ‘Yahveh says, “I’m about to make everybody drunk in this land, from kings on David’s throne, to priests and prophets, and the residents in Jerusalem! 14I’ll pit them against one another, even parents against children. Pitying, feeling sorry, having compassion won’t keep me from destroying them.”’”	 Jer 13:12-14</p>
<p>Exile Threatened</p>
<p>15Listen; don’t be proud;</p>
<p>Yahveh has spoken.</p>
<p>16Honor him</p>
<p>before he brings darkness,</p>
<p>before you stumble on the darkened mountains.</p>
<p>If you look for light then,</p>
<p>he’ll turn it into darkness and gloom.</p>
<p>17If you don’t listen,</p>
<p>my soul will sob in secret,</p>
<p>my eyes will weep bitterly,</p>
<p>tears will run down my cheeks</p>
<p>because Yahveh’s flock’s been captured.</p>
<p>18Tell the king and queen mother,</p>
<p>“Take a low seat,</p>
<p>because your beautiful crown</p>
<p>has been taken from your head.”</p>
<p>19The towns in the Negev will be closed;</p>
<p>nobody will be able to open them;</p>
<p>Judah will go into exile.		Jer 13:15-19</p>
<p>20“Look who’s coming from the north.</p>
<p>Where are the beautiful sheep</p>
<p>of the flock you were given?</p>
<p>21What will you say when Yahveh appoints over you</p>
<p>former allies that you taught?</p>
<p>Won’t pains come on you</p>
<p>like a woman in childbirth?</p>
<p>22If you say to yourself,</p>
<p>‘Why has this happened to me?’</p>
<p>It’s because of how sinful you are</p>
<p>that your skirt has been torn off,</p>
<p>and you’re being raped.</p>
<p>23Can a Nubian change the color of his skin</p>
<p>or a leopard change its spots?</p>
<p>Then can you do good</p>
<p>that have the habit of doing evil?</p>
<p>24So I’ll scatter you like chaff in the desert wind.</p>
<p>25That’s the lot I’ve measured out to you,” Yahveh says, 		Jer 13:20-25a</p>
<p>“because you’ve forgotten me and trusted in lies.</p>
<p>26So I have stripped your skirt off over your face</p>
<p>to show your shame.</p>
<p>27I’ve seen your detestable deeds:</p>
<p>your adulteries and neighing,</p>
<p>your lewd prostitution right out in the open on the hills.</p>
<p>Misfortune awaits you, Jerusalem!</p>
<p>How long will you stay defiled?”		Jer 13:25b-27</p>
<p>14:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>About the Drought</p>
<p>2“In Judah’s towns,</p>
<p>commerce has died off at their gates;</p>
<p>the people sit on the ground mourning;</p>
<p>their outcry goes up from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3Nobles send servants to draw water,</p>
<p>but the cisterns are dry.</p>
<p>They come back with empty pots,</p>
<p>demoralized and covering their heads.	Jer 14:1-3</p>
<p>4The ground is cracked</p>
<p>because there’s been no rain;</p>
<p>farmers are demoralized, too, and cover their heads.</p>
<p>5Does out in the country</p>
<p>are abandoning their newborn fawns</p>
<p>because there’s no grass.</p>
<p>6Donkeys stand on the barren hills</p>
<p>and pant for air like jackals;</p>
<p>their eyes are blurry</p>
<p>because there’s no grass.”	Jer 14:4-6</p>
<p>7The people say,</p>
<p>“Although our iniquities show that we’re guilty, Yahveh,</p>
<p>at least do something for your reputation.</p>
<p>Yes, we’re guilty of countless apostasies;</p>
<p>we’ve sinned against you.</p>
<p>8Israel’s Hope, our Savior in distress,</p>
<p>why are you acting like a foreigner here to us</p>
<p>or a traveler just pitching his tent for the night?</p>
<p>9Why are you like someone overwhelmed,</p>
<p>like a strong man that can’t rescue?</p>
<p>Yet you’re among us, Yahveh;</p>
<p>we’re identified with you;</p>
<p>don’t abandon us!”	Jer 14:7-9</p>
<p>10Yahveh answers,</p>
<p>“They like to wander;</p>
<p>they don’t watch where they’re going.</p>
<p>So I don’t accept them as mine;</p>
<p>I remember their iniquity</p>
<p>and take account of their sins.”	Jer 14:10</p>
<p>11Yahveh told me, “Don’t pray for them. 12I’ll ignore their outcry when they fast. When they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won’t accept them. I’ll put an end to them with sword, famine, and disease.”</p>
<p>13But I said, “Lord Yahveh, the prophets are telling them they won’t see sword or famine, that you’ll give them lasting peace here.”</p>
<p>14He answered, “The prophets are prophesying falsely in my name. I haven’t spoken to them. They’re prophesying false visions, worthless fortunetelling, the deceptions in their own minds. 15Though I haven’t sent them, they keep saying there won’t be sword or famine here. So they’ll meet their end by sword and famine! 16The people they’re prophesying to will be victims thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem. There won’t be anybody to bury them, their wives, or children. I’ll pour out their own wickedness on them.	  Jer 14:11-16</p>
<p>17“Tell them this,</p>
<p>‘My eyes flow with tears</p>
<p>day and night without end</p>
<p>because the young virgin—my people—</p>
<p>has been struck a powerful blow;</p>
<p>she has a severely infected wound.</p>
<p>18If I go out in the country,</p>
<p>there are corpses slain by the sword.</p>
<p>If I go in the city,</p>
<p>there’s famine and disease</p>
<p>because prophet and priest ply their trade in the land</p>
<p>and they don’t know what they’re doing.’”	Jer 14:17-18</p>
<p>A Prayer for Healing</p>
<p>19Have you completely rejected Judah?</p>
<p>Do you despise Zion?</p>
<p>Why wound us so bad we can’t heal?</p>
<p>We waited for peace, but nothing good came;</p>
<p>we hoped for healing, but terror came instead!</p>
<p>20We know we’re ungodly, Yahveh;</p>
<p>we know about our ancestors’ sin;</p>
<p>we’ve sinned against you too.</p>
<p>21For your own reputation, don’t despise us;</p>
<p>don’t bring disgrace on your glorious throne</p>
<p>or annul your covenant with us.</p>
<p>22Can any nation’s idols bring rain?</p>
<p>Can the sky grant showers?</p>
<p>Isn’t that from you, Yahveh our God?</p>
<p>So we’re putting our hope in you</p>
<p>because you can do that. 	Jer 14:19-22</p>
<p>Yahveh Will Not Relent</p>
<p>15:1Then Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here, my heart wouldn’t be with this nation. Send them away! 2If they ask you where to go, tell them Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Those destined for death, go to death!</p>
<p>Those destined for the sword, go to the sword!</p>
<p>Those destined for famine, go to famine!</p>
<p>Those destined for captivity, go to captivity!’</p>
<p>3I’ll send four kinds of destruction on you: the sword to slay, dogs to drag away, buzzards to devour, and scavengers to consume. 4I’ll see that the kingdoms abhor you because of what Manasseh Ben-Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Jer 15:1-4</p>
<p>5Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?</p>
<p>Who’s going to cry for you</p>
<p>or come to ask how you’re doing?</p>
<p>6You’ve left me and keep getting worse;</p>
<p>so I’ll go ahead and destroy you;</p>
<p>I’m tired of holding back.</p>
<p>7I’ll winnow you with a winnowing fork</p>
<p>at the country’s ports of entry.</p>
<p>I’ll bereave you of your children</p>
<p>and destroy you as my people</p>
<p>because you refuse to turn back from your ways.</p>
<p>8You’ll have more widows than sand by the sea;</p>
<p>I’ll bring at you a destroyer at noon,</p>
<p>mother of young men,</p>
<p>and suddenly bring down anguish and dread on you.</p>
<p>9She that bore seven sons will pine away</p>
<p>and gasp for breath.</p>
<p>Her sun will set in the daytime;</p>
<p>she’ll be disgraced and humiliated.</p>
<p>So I’ll turn any survivors over</p>
<p>to their enemies’ sword,” Yahveh says.	Jer 15:5-9</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Complaint</p>
<p>10“Misfortune awaits me, mother that bore me</p>
<p>to experience conflict in the world!</p>
<p>I haven’t lent or borrowed;</p>
<p>yet everybody curses me.”</p>
<p>11Yahveh said, “I’ll set you free for good;</p>
<p>I’ll make your enemy appeal to you</p>
<p>when disaster and distress come.</p>
<p>12Can anybody smash iron,</p>
<p>the iron from the north, or bronze?	Jer 15:10-12</p>
<p>13Because of your sins within your borders, I’ll give away your wealth and treasures as plunder free of charge. 14Your enemies will take it to a country you don’t know about, because my anger has been fired up. It’ll burn you up.”</p>
<p>15“Yahveh, you know me; remember me; notice me;</p>
<p>take vengeance on my persecutors.</p>
<p>In light of your patience, don’t let me die young;</p>
<p>remember that I’m dealing with disgrace to honor you.</p>
<p>16When I discovered your words, I devoured them;</p>
<p>they became a delight to me</p>
<p>because I wear your name,</p>
<p>Yahveh God of hosts.		Jer 15:13-16</p>
<p>17I didn’t sit with the revelers;</p>
<p>because your hand was on me, I sat by myself,</p>
<p>filled with indignation over their sin.</p>
<p>18Why does my pain persist?</p>
<p>Why don’t my wounds heal?</p>
<p>Are you going to be like a seasonal stream</p>
<p>we can’t depend on?”	Jer 15:17-18</p>
<p>19So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“If you’ll come back, I’ll restore you;</p>
<p>you can stand in my presence.</p>
<p>If you’ll separate the precious from the worthless,</p>
<p>you can become my spokesman.</p>
<p>They may turn on you,</p>
<p>but don’t turn on them.</p>
<p>20Then for my people I’ll make you</p>
<p>into a fortified wall made out of bronze;</p>
<p>though they fight you, they won’t win</p>
<p>because I’ll save you.</p>
<p>21I’ll keep you away from sinners</p>
<p>and rescue you from cruel people.” 			Jer 15:19-21</p>
<p>16:1A Message from Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel,</p>
<p>That Came to Me</p>
<p>Day of Disaster</p>
<p>2“Don’t get married or have children here.” 3This is what Yahveh says about children born here and their parents,</p>
<p>4“They’ll die from disease,</p>
<p>not mourned or buried.</p>
<p>They’ll come to an end by sword and famine,</p>
<p>and lie like manure on the ground.</p>
<p>Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky</p>
<p>and the scavengers on the ground.	  Jer 16:1-4</p>
<p>5“Don’t go in a house to mourn with people, cry, or console them. From this nation I’ve withdrawn my peace, my enduring love, my mercy. 6From least to greatest will die in the land. There won’t be any friends to bury them, mourn for them, cut themselves, or shave their head for them. 7People won’t offer them a meal to comfort them in mourning or give them a cup to drink to console them for their father or mother.  8Don’t go to sit and eat with them. 9I’m going to eliminate celebration and happiness here, the happy voices of bride and groom. 	  Jer 16:5-9</p>
<p>10“When you tell people that, they’ll say, ‘Why has Yahveh our God declared so much catastrophe on us? What did we do to him?’ 11Tell them, ‘Your ancestors abandoned me for other gods, bowed to them, served them, and didn’t keep my Law. 12You’ve done worse than they did, following your own stubborn hearts and ignoring me. 13So I’m going to expel you from this land to one where you and your ancestors have never been. You’ll serve other gods there because I won’t help you.</p>
<p>Hope Despite Disaster</p>
<p>14“The time’s coming when people won’t swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ 15They’ll swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites back from the countries up north where he’d banished them.’ I will return them to the land I gave their ancestors.</p>
<p>16“I’ll send lots of fishermen to fish for them, lots of hunters to hunt for them in every mountain, hill, and cave. 17I see what they’re doing; their sin’s not hid from me. 18But first I’ll doubly repay their sin because they’ve polluted my permanent possession with the carcasses of their detestable idols and carved images.” 				  Jer 16:10-18</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Praye</p>
<p>19Yahveh, my strength and fortress</p>
<p>my refuge in troubled times,</p>
<p>nations around the world will come to you and say,</p>
<p>“We didn’t inherit anything but lies from our ancestors,</p>
<p>foolish idols that can’t do anything.”</p>
<p>20Can mortals make gods?</p>
<p>Things like that aren’t gods! 	Jer 16:19-20</p>
<p>21So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Now I’ll show them my strength and power;</p>
<p>at last they’ll learn that I’m Yahveh.”	Jer 16:21</p>
<p>Judah’s Sin</p>
<p>17:1“Judah’s sin is recorded with an iron stylus;</p>
<p>with a diamond point it’s engraved on their heart</p>
<p>and the horns on their altars.</p>
<p>2As well as they remember their children,</p>
<p>they remember their pagan altars and Asherah poles</p>
<p>beside every green tree on the tall hills.</p>
<p>3My mountain in the open country,</p>
<p>I’ll give your wealth and treasures for spoil</p>
<p>as the price for your sin throughout your territory.</p>
<p>4You’ll voluntarily let go of the inheritance I gave you;</p>
<p>I’ll make you serve your enemies	in a foreign land</p>
<p>because you’ve sparked my anger</p>
<p>that will keep burning.”	Jer 17:1-4</p>
<p>5Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“People are under a curse who trust in other people,</p>
<p>who rely on physical strength,</p>
<p>who turn their hearts away from me.</p>
<p>6They’re like a tamarisk shrub in the desert</p>
<p>that won’t flourish;</p>
<p>they’ll live in stony wastes,</p>
<p>in a salted land with no inhabitants.</p>
<p>7Fortunate are the people that trust in Yahveh,</p>
<p>that put their faith in him.</p>
<p>8They’re like a tree planted by water</p>
<p>that sends down its roots</p>
<p>and doesn’t worry when hot weather comes.</p>
<p>Its leaves stay green;</p>
<p>it doesn’t worry about a year-long drought;</p>
<p>it keeps bearing fruit.	Jer 17:5-8</p>
<p>9“The heart is more deceitful than anything;</p>
<p>it’s desperately corrupt.</p>
<p>Who can make sense of it?</p>
<p>10I, Yahveh, search hearts and test minds</p>
<p>to repay everyone according to their deeds</p>
<p>as measured by consequences.			Jer 17:9-10</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Trust in God</p>
<p>11People that make a fortune unjustly</p>
<p>are like a partridge that gathers a brood she didn’t hatch;</p>
<p>in midlife they’ll lose their wealth</p>
<p>and in the end be fools.”</p>
<p>12From the beginning, our sanctuary</p>
<p>has been a glorious throne on high.</p>
<p>13Yahveh, hope of Israel,</p>
<p>everybody that leaves you ends up disgraced;</p>
<p>a record will be kept of those who turn away on earth</p>
<p>because they’ve left Yahveh, the spring of fresh water.</p>
<p>14Yahveh, I’ll be healed if you heal me;</p>
<p>I’ll be saved if you save me;</p>
<p>you’re the only one I praise.</p>
<p>15They keep asking to me,</p>
<p>“Where’s a message from Yahveh?</p>
<p>Let it come now!”</p>
<p>16But I haven’t hurried away from serving as your shepherd;</p>
<p>I haven’t desired a time for disaster, as you know.</p>
<p>Whatever I said, I said to your face.</p>
<p>17Don’t be a terror to me;</p>
<p>you’re my refuge in disaster.</p>
<p>18Disgrace those who harass me;</p>
<p>don’t let me be the one disgraced.</p>
<p>Bring disaster on them;</p>
<p>crush them with double disaster!	Jer 17:11-18</p>
<p>Observing the Sabbath</p>
<p>19Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“Go stand in the gate that Judah’s kings use, and in the other gates around Jerusalem. 20Say, ‘Listen to Yahveh’s message, Judah, kings of Judah, people living in Jerusalem who use these gates: 21For your own good, don’t carry any load on the Sabbath or bring anything in through these gates. 22Don’t carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or work. Set the Sabbath aside like I told your ancestors. 23But they stiffened their necks and wouldn’t follow directions.</p>
<p>Jer 17:19-23</p>
<p>24“’Listen carefully and don’t carry any load through this city’s gates on the Sabbath. Set it aside by resting on it. 25Then through these gates will come kings and officials who sit on David’s throne, who ride in chariots and on horses, people of Judah and Jerusalem. People will live in this city permanently. 26They’ll come in from the towns in Judah and places around Jerusalem, from Benjamin, the western foothills, the hill country, and the Negev. They’ll bring thanksgiving sacrifices to Yahveh’s Temple. 27If you don’t set the Sabbath aside, I’ll light a fire in Jerusalem’s gates. It will spread to the palaces in Jerusalem, and it won’t be put out.’”	      	     		  Jer 17:24-27</p>
<p>18:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>The Potter’s Shop</p>
<p>2“Go down to the potter’s shop. I’ll give you my message there.”</p>
<p>3When I got down to his shop, he was there, working at his wheel. 4But the jar he was making with his hands didn’t come out the way he wanted; so he made another one out of it that he was satisfied with.	        	 Jer 18:1-4</p>
<p>5Then Yahveh’s message came to me:</p>
<p>6“Israel, can’t I deal with you like this potter did? You’re like clay in my hands. 7At one time I might talk about uprooting, tearing down, or destroying a nation. 8If it turns from its sin, I’ll relent. 9At another time I might talk about planting it or building it up. 10If it doesn’t obey, I’ll change my mind about the good I was going to do for it. 11So tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘I’m preparing a catastrophe for you. Turn back from your sinful lives, every one of you. Reform your ways and deeds.’</p>
<p>12“But they say, ‘We’re not going to do that! We’re going to make our own plans and do what we want to!’” 	Jer 18:5-12</p>
<p>13So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Ask around the nations;</p>
<p>who ever heard of anything like that?</p>
<p>The virgin Israel has done something terrible.</p>
<p>14Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave</p>
<p>the rocky mountaintops out in the open country?</p>
<p>Does the cold, flowing mountain water ever dry up?</p>
<p>15My people have forgotten me</p>
<p>and burn incense to foreign gods;</p>
<p>they stumble off their ancient ways</p>
<p>to walk on footpaths instead of a good road.</p>
<p>16They end up making their land desolate,</p>
<p>something for other people to mock;</p>
<p>everybody that goes by just shake their heads at.</p>
<p>17I’ll scatter them ahead of their enemies like an east wind</p>
<p>and turn my back on them when disaster comes.’”	Jer 18:13-17</p>
<p>A Plot Against Jeremiah</p>
<p>18Then they said,</p>
<p>“Let’s lay a plot to stop Jeremiah.</p>
<p>We’ll still have the Law through our priests;</p>
<p>we can get our advice from other advisors;</p>
<p>the message can come from other prophets!</p>
<p>Let’s spread rumors about him</p>
<p>and ignore what he says.”</p>
<p>19“Listen, Yahveh;</p>
<p>do you hear what my opponents are saying!?</p>
<p>20Should people repay good with bad?</p>
<p>They’ve dug a pit to put me in.</p>
<p>Remember how I stood in your presence</p>
<p>to speak good on their behalf</p>
<p>and turn your anger away from them.	Jer 18:18-20</p>
<p>21So let their children starve;</p>
<p>deliver them to the sword.</p>
<p>Have their wives become childless widows;</p>
<p>let their husbands be struck down</p>
<p>and their young men die in battle.</p>
<p>22May they scream in their houses</p>
<p>when raiders suddenly break into them,</p>
<p>because they’ve dug a pit to capture me</p>
<p>and hidden snares for me to step in.</p>
<p>23Yahveh, you know about their deadly designs against me.</p>
<p>Don’t forgive their iniquity;</p>
<p>don’t blot out their sin;</p>
<p>overthrow them in anger!”				Jer 18:21-23</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Broken Flask</p>
<p>19:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Go buy a clay pot. Take some elders and senior priests along 2to the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom by the entrance to the Potsherd Gate. Deliver my message there, 3‘Listen to a message from Yahveh, kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. I’m about to bring such catastrophe here that will make everybody’s ears ring when they hear about it. 4You’ve abandoned me and made this a foreign place, and burned sacrifices here to gods that you, your ancestors, and the kings of Judah never knew. You’ve filled it with innocent people’s blood 5and built high places for Baal so you can burn your sons as offerings to him. I never commanded that. Such a thing never even entered my mind! 6So the time’s coming when this place won’t be called Topheth or The Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter. 7I’ll void the plans that Judah and Jerusalem have. I’ll make them fall by the sword and give their carcasses to buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 8This city will be desolate, something to gasp at. Everybody that goes by will marvel at its disaster. 9They’ll eat their sons and daughters during the siege and distress their enemies bring on them.’       	  Jer 19:1-9</p>
<p>10“Then break the pot in front of the men that go with you. 11Say, ‘Yahveh of Hosts says, “Just like a shattered potter’s jug you can’t repair, I’ll shatter this nation and this city. They’ll bury people in Topheth; there won’t be any place else to bury them. [12] 13Their houses, including the kings’ palace, will be defiled like Topheth, because on their roofs they burned sacrifices to the host of heaven and poured out liquid offerings to other gods.”’”</p>
<p>14Jeremiah came back from Topheth and spoke to the people in the court of Yahveh’s Temple,</p>
<p>15“Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m about to bring on this city and surrounding towns the entire catastrophe I’ve declared against it. You’ve stiffened your necks and ignored me.’”	Jer 19:10-15</p>
<p>Jeremiah and Pashur</p>
<p>20:1When Pashhur Ben-Immer, the priest in charge of Yahveh’s Temple, heard Jeremiah prophesying that, 2he had him beaten and put in stocks at the upper Benjamin Gate of the Temple. 3The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah told him,</p>
<p>“Yahveh doesn’t call you Pashhur, but The Man Surrounded by Terror. 4He says, ‘I’m going to make you a terror to yourself and your friends. While you watch, they’ll fall by their enemies’ sword. I’ll turn Judah over to the king of Babylon to carry away and kill. 5I’ll turn over this city’s wealth, its produce, its expensive things, the treasures of Judah’s kings to take to Babylon. 6Pashhur, you, everybody in your house, and the friends you’ve falsely prophesied for will go into captivity and be buried in Babylon.’”   	  Jer 20:1-6</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Complaint</p>
<p>7“Yahveh, you’ve deceived me;</p>
<p>you’re stronger than I am and have prevailed.</p>
<p>I’m a laughingstock all day long;</p>
<p>everybody makes fun of me.</p>
<p>8When I speak, I cry out</p>
<p>violence and destruction.</p>
<p>Because of me your message has led</p>
<p>to constant disgrace and derision.</p>
<p>9But if I say, ‘I won’t remember him</p>
<p>or speak in his name anymore,’</p>
<p>my heart burns inside me</p>
<p>like fire in my bones.</p>
<p>I get tired of trying to hold it in;</p>
<p>I can’t endure it.	Jer 20:7-9</p>
<p>10I’ve heard many whispering,</p>
<p>‘There’s terror everywhere!</p>
<p>Denounce him; let’s denounce him!’</p>
<p>My trusted friends watch for my downfall and say,</p>
<p>‘Maybe he’ll make a mistake</p>
<p>so we can take revenge on him.’</p>
<p>11But you’re with me like a dreaded warrior,</p>
<p>so the ones that persecute me will trip and fall.</p>
<p>They’ll be totally ashamed because they’ll fail</p>
<p>with a disgrace people won’t forget.</p>
<p>12Yahveh of Hosts, you that test the godly,</p>
<p>who see the heart and mind,</p>
<p>let me watch you take revenge on them</p>
<p>because I’ve turned my concerns over to you.”</p>
<p>13Sing praise to Yahveh;</p>
<p>he delivers the poor from their oppressors.		Jer 20:10-13</p>
<p>14Curse the day I was born;</p>
<p>don’t celebrate the day my mother bore me!</p>
<p>15Curse the one that told my father,</p>
<p>“You have a baby!” and made him so happy.</p>
<p>16Let that man be like the cities</p>
<p>Yahveh overthrew without restraint.</p>
<p>Terrify him with a morning battle cry,</p>
<p>a shout of alarm at noon,</p>
<p>17because he didn’t kill me before I was born</p>
<p>and make my mother my tomb—</p>
<p>make her womb pregnant forever.</p>
<p>18Why was I ever born</p>
<p>to see trouble, sorrow, and shame? 			Jer 20:14-18</p>
<p>21:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>When King Zedekiah Sent Him Pashhur Ben-Malchijah</p>
<p>and Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah, the Priest</p>
<p>Jerusalem to Fall to Nebuchadnezzar</p>
<p>2“Inquire from Yahveh for us; Nebuchadnezzar is attacking us. Maybe Yahveh will show us one of his wonderful acts so our enemy will withdraw.”</p>
<p>Jer 21:1-2</p>
<p>3Jeremiah told them,</p>
<p>“Tell Zedekiah 4that Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘I’m going to make your weapons useless for fighting those who are laying siege outside the wall. I’ll let them come to the center of the city. 5I’ll fight you myself with outstretched hand and strong arm in anger, wrath, and fury. 6I’ll strike down people and animals with a severe plague. 7After that, I’ll turn over to Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah, his officials, and people that survive the sword, famine, and disease. He won’t spare, he won’t pity, he won’t have mercy.’                      	Jer 21:3-7</p>
<p>8“Tell the people Yahveh says, ‘I’m giving you a choice, a way to live and a way to die. 9If you stay in the city, you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease. If you surrender, you’ll have your life as the reward of war. 10I’ve decided to give this city to the king of Babylon to burn.’ 	Jer 21:8-10</p>
<p>11“Then tell the king of Judah’s household, ‘Listen to Yahveh’s message, 12dynasty of David:</p>
<p>“Render justice every morning;</p>
<p>deliver from their oppressors those being robbed</p>
<p>so my anger won’t flare</p>
<p>and burn with nobody to put it out</p>
<p>because of your sins.			   	Jer 21:11-12</p>
<p>13“I’m against you, Jerusalem,</p>
<p>you that live above the valley in that rocky fortress,</p>
<p>you that say, ‘Who can touch us up here?</p>
<p>Nobody can break in where we live.’</p>
<p>14I’ll punish you in proportion to your sin;</p>
<p>I’ll set a fire in your forest</p>
<p>and burn up everything around you.”’”		Jer 21:13-14</p>
<p>Message About Judah’s Kings</p>
<p>22:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Go to the king’s palace in Judah and say, 2‘Listen to this message from Yahveh, king of Judah on David’s throne—you, your officials, and your people that come in these gates. 3“Be just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who’ve been robbed. Don’t mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  4If you do that, kings who sit on David’s throne will come in these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. 5If you won’t, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty.”’”</p>
<p>6He says this about the king of Judah’s palace:</p>
<p>“You’re like Gilead to me,</p>
<p>like the top of Lebanon;</p>
<p>yet I’ll make a desert out of you,</p>
<p>an empty city.</p>
<p>7I’ll send destroyers against you with their weapons</p>
<p>to cut down your best cedars</p>
<p>and throw them in the fire.				        Jer 22:1-7</p>
<p>8“Nations will pass this city and say, ‘Why did Yahveh do that to this great city?’ 9People will answer, ‘Because they abandoned his covenant with them and served other gods.’</p>
<p>10“Don’t mourn for the dead king;</p>
<p>weep bitterly for the one that’s leaving;</p>
<p>he’ll never come back to see his native land.”	Jer 22:8-10</p>
<p>Message About Jehoahaz</p>
<p>11This is what Yahveh says about Shallum/Jehoahaz Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here:</p>
<p>“He’s never coming back;</p>
<p>12where he goes is where he’ll die.</p>
<p>Message About Jehoiakim</p>
<p>13“Misfortune awaits Jehoiakim</p>
<p>that’s built his palace with forced labor,									his upper rooms with injustice:										he made his countrymen work for him for nothing;								14he said, ‘I’ll build myself a grand palace									      		with large upper rooms, 									            cut out windows for it,												panel it with cedar,												and paint it red.’		Jer 22:11-14</p>
<p>15Do you think you’re a king because you traffic in cedar?						Didn’t your father eat and drink,										do justice and goodness?										Things went well for him.</p>
<p>16He defended the poor and needy;</p>
<p>isn’t that what it means to know me?</p>
<p>17But you have eyes and heart										only for your own dishonest gain,									for shedding innocent blood,										for practicing oppression and violence.”		Jer 22:15-17</p>
<p>18So Yahveh says about Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, king of Judah:</p>
<p>“They won’t mourn for him, as in								‘My brother,’ ‘My sister!’</p>
<p>They won’t mourn for him, as in								‘My master’ or ‘He had such splendor!’								19They’ll him buried like a donkey,									dragged off and thrown out of Jerusalem.					20Go up to Lebanon and cry out;										shout in Bashan.</p>
<p>Cry out from Abarim												because your lovers have been destroyed.</p>
<p>21I spoke to you in your prosperity;									but you said, ‘I don’t have to do that!’								That’s the way you’ve acted since you were young.	Jer 22:18-21</p>
<p>22The wind will blow your allies away;									your buddies will go into captivity.								Your sinfulness will disgrace you.							2	3You that live nested in cedars from Lebanon,								how you’ll groan when pangs come on you									like a woman in childbirth!</p>
<p>Message About Jehoiachin</p>
<p>24“As I live,” Yahveh says, “even if you, Coniah/Jehoiachin Ben-Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I’d pull you off 25and hand you to the executioners you dread: Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. 26I’ll expel you and your mother from your native land. 27You won’t return to the land you’ll yearn to see. 	  Jer 22:22-27</p>
<p>28“Why is Coniah/Jehoiachin a despised, shattered pot,						an unwanted container?							Why have he and his descendants been expelled							into a foreign country?							29Land, land, land,										listen to Yahveh’s message:							30‘Let the records show that this man had no children;							he was a failure in his own time.						He won’t have a descendant to succeed him							on David’s throne in Judah.’”		Jer 22:28-30</p>
<p>The Righteous Branch</p>
<p>23:[1] 2This is what Yahveh God of Israel says about shepherds that scatter and destroy his sheep instead of tending to them, “I’m about to tend to you for the evil you’ve done. 3But I’ll gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries where I’ve driven them, and bring them back to their pasture to reproduce and multiply. 4I’ll raise up shepherds to tend them. They won’t be afraid anymore, and none of them will go missing.</p>
<p>5“The time’s coming</p>
<p>when I’ll raise up a good Branch for David;</p>
<p>he’ll reign as King, deal wisely,</p>
<p>and carry out justice and goodness in the land.</p>
<p>6In his time Judah will be safe;</p>
<p>Israel will live safely.</p>
<p>They’ll call him Yahveh Our Goodness.</p>
<p>7People won’t swear then, ‘As sure as sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ 8They’ll swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives who brought Israel’s descendants back from the north countries where he’d banished them.’ They’ll live again on their own land.”        	Jer 23:1-8</p>
<p>Message About False Prophets</p>
<p>9As for the false prophets:</p>
<p>My heart’s broken; my body’s shaking;</p>
<p>I’m like someone drunk on wine</p>
<p>because of Yahveh and his holy message.</p>
<p>10The country is full of adultery;</p>
<p>it languishes under a curse.</p>
<p>The pastures have dried up;</p>
<p>the prophets all do evil;</p>
<p>they misuse their authority.	Jer 23:9-10</p>
<p>11“Prophet and priest are ungodly;</p>
<p>I’ve found their wickedness right in my Temple.</p>
<p>12So their road will be a slippery path in the dark</p>
<p>where they’ll be driven and fall down.</p>
<p>I’ll bring catastrophe on them</p>
<p>when I punish them.	Jer 23:11-12</p>
<p>13“I’ve seen something offensive about the prophets in Samaria;</p>
<p>they’ve prophesied by Baal and misled my people.</p>
<p>14Now I’ve seen something horrible about the prophets in Jerusalem;</p>
<p>they’ve committed adultery and followed lies.</p>
<p>They encourage the ones that do evil,</p>
<p>so nobody turns back from sin.</p>
<p>They’ve become like Sodom to me,</p>
<p>like the people in Gomorrah.</p>
<p>15So this is what Yahveh says about the prophets:</p>
<p>‘I’ll feed them bitter plants to eat</p>
<p>and give them poisoned water to drink,</p>
<p>because the prophets in Jerusalem</p>
<p>have spread ungodliness in the land.’”	Jer 23:13-15</p>
<p>16Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“Ignore your prophets;</p>
<p>they’re giving you false hopes.</p>
<p>They talk to you about visions they imagine,</p>
<p>not visions from me.</p>
<p>17They keep telling those who despise me</p>
<p>that Yahveh has said they’ll have peace;</p>
<p>they say to the ones who follow their own stubborn heart</p>
<p>that catastrophe won’t happen to them.</p>
<p>18But who has stood in the council of Yahveh</p>
<p>to see and hear his message?</p>
<p>Who has paid attention to what he says?</p>
<p>19An angry storm has gone out like a tornado,</p>
<p>like a micro-burst on the heads of sinners.</p>
<p>20Yahveh’s anger won’t let up</p>
<p>till he’s carried out his intentions.</p>
<p>Later, you’ll understand.	Jer 23:16-20</p>
<p>21“I didn’t send those prophets;</p>
<p>yet they hurried to deliver their ideas;</p>
<p>I didn’t speak to them;</p>
<p>yet they kept on prophesying.</p>
<p>22If they’d stood in my council,</p>
<p>they would’ve delivered my message</p>
<p>and turned back from their own ways and deeds.</p>
<p>23“Am I a God that’s close by</p>
<p>and not one that’s far off?</p>
<p>24Can anybody hide from me?</p>
<p>Don’t I fill earth and sky? 	     Jer 23:21-24</p>
<p>25“I’ve heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’ 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw’s different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I’m against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim IY said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They’re no benefit them at all.     	Jer 23:25-32</p>
<p>33“When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, ‘What’s Yahveh’s burden?’ tell him he’s the burden, and Yahveh is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, ‘Yahveh’s burden,’ I’ll punish along with his family. 35You’re to ask your brother and fellow citizen, ‘What has Yahveh answered?’ ‘What has Yahveh said?’ 36Don’t use the expression ‘Yahveh’s burden’ anymore; that ‘burden’ is nothing but somebody’s own idea that perverts the message from the living God, Yahveh of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, ‘What has Yahveh answered you?’ ‘What has Yahveh said?’ 38If you say, ‘Yahveh’s burden,’ 39I’ll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I’ll permanently disgrace you.’” 	Jer 23:33-40</p>
<p>Two Baskets of Figs</p>
<p>24:1Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon Jeconiah/Jehoiachin Ben-Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials in Judah along with the craftsmen and artisans. Then Yahveh showed me two baskets of figs sitting in front of the Temple. 2One basket had nice figs in it, like first-ripe ones; the other basket held rotten ones.</p>
<p>3He said, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”</p>
<p>I said, “Figs, really good ones and really bad ones you can’t eat because they’re rotten.”</p>
<p>Jer 24:1-3</p>
<p>4Then his message came to me:</p>
<p>5“Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘Like those good figs, I’ll treat as good the captives of Judah that I’ve sent out to Babylonia. 6I’ll tend to them and bring them back. I’ll build them up, not tear them down; plant them, not pull them up. 7I’ll give them a heart to know me because I’m Yahveh. They’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God. They’ll come back to me with all their heart.</p>
<p>8‘But like those bad figs, I’ll treat Zedekiah, his officials, the remnant in Jerusalem, and the ones living in Egypt. 9I’ll make them something every kingdom can see: a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, a curse wherever I scatter them. 10I’ll send them sword, famine, and disease till they’re gone from the land I gave them and their ancestors.’”	         	Jer 24:4-10</p>
<p>25:1A Message to Jeremiah About the People in Judah</p>
<p>in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>(the First Year of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon)</p>
<p>Seventy Years of Captivity</p>
<p>2Jeremiah told the people in Judah and Jerusalem:</p>
<p>3“From the thirteenth year of Josiah Ben-Amon, king of Judah, till now (23 years), Yahveh’s message has been coming to me. I’ve spoken to you again and again, but you’ve ignored me. 4He has sent you his prophets over and over, 5‘Turn from your sinful ways and deeds, and live on the land I’ve given you and your ancestors forever. 6Don’t worship and serve other gods. Don’t make me angry with what you’ve made with your hands, and I won’t hurt you.’ 7But you ignored me and made me angry with what you’ve made with your hands to your own hurt.		         	Jer 25:1-7</p>
<p>8“‘So, because you haven’t obeyed me, 9I’m going to send for the armies in the north and for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant, and bring them against this land and surrounding nations. I’ll destroy them, make them something to abhor, to gasp at, a permanent wasteland. 10I’ll take away the joy and happiness, the voices of bride and groom, the sound of millstones, the light from lamps. 11This whole region will be desolate. Those nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.</p>
<p>12“‘When the 70 years are up, I’ll punish the king of Babylon and the Babylonians for their sin. I’ll make it a permanent wasteland 13and bring on it everything I’ve threatened in this scroll that Jeremiah prophesied. 14Many nations and great kings will make slaves out of them too. I’ll pay them back for what they’ve done and their hands have made.’”</p>
<p>The Cup of God’s Anger</p>
<p>15Yahveh God of Israel told me, “Take this cup of the wine of my anger and make the nations drink it. 16They’ll stagger and go crazy because of the sword that’s coming among them.” 	Jer 25:8-16</p>
<p>17Yahveh handed me the cup, and I made the nations drink it: 18Jerusalem and the towns in Judah, its kings and officials—to make them a ruin, something to abhor, to gasp at and curse, like it is now: 19Pharaoh, Egypt’s king, his attendants, officials, and people; 20foreigners, the kings of Uz, the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); 21Edom, Moab, the Ammonites; 22the kings of Tyre, Sidon, and regions beyond the sea; 23Dedan, Tema, Buz, those who clip the hair on their temples; 24the kings of Arabia and the foreigners that live in the desert; 25the kings of Zimri, Elam, Media; 26the north near and far, one with another—all the kingdoms in the region. The king of Sheshach/Babylon will drink after them.     	         Jer 25:17-26</p>
<p>27“Tell them Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘Drink it, get drunk, vomit, fall down, and not get up; I’m sending a sword among you.’ 28If they try to refuse, tell them Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘You will drink it! 29I’m about to bring a catastrophe on this city I’ve identified with, and you think you’ll avoid getting punished?! I’m calling for a sword against everybody on the earth.”     Jer 25:27-29</p>
<p>30“Prophesy these things against them:</p>
<p>‘Yahveh will roar from on high</p>
<p>and speak from his holy dwelling place.</p>
<p>He’ll roar mightily against his fold.</p>
<p>He’ll shout like someone treading grapes,</p>
<p>against everybody on earth.</p>
<p>31The judgment cry will resound to the end of the earth,</p>
<p>because Yahveh is indicting the nations.</p>
<p>He’s entering into judgment with everybody;</p>
<p>he’s delivering sinners to the sword.”	Jer 25:30-31</p>
<p>32Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>“Catastrophy is moving out from nation to nation;</p>
<p>a great storm is brewing</p>
<p>from the most remote parts of the earth.</p>
<p>33Yahveh will slay from one end of earth to the other.</p>
<p>They won’t be mourned, gathered, or buried;</p>
<p>they’ll be like manure on the ground.</p>
<p>34Wail, shepherds; cry out;</p>
<p>wallow in ashes, you flock leaders.</p>
<p>It’s time for you to be scattered and slaughtered;</p>
<p>you’ll fall like the best of the flock.	Jer 25:32-34</p>
<p>35The shepherds won’t be able to get away;</p>
<p>the flock leaders can’t escape.</p>
<p>36Listen to the shepherds’ cries,</p>
<p>the wailing of the flock leaders!</p>
<p>Yahveh’s destroying their pasture.</p>
<p>37The peaceful folds will become a wasteland</p>
<p>because of his fierce anger.</p>
<p>38He has left his hiding place like a lion looking for prey</p>
<p>because their land has become abhorrent,</p>
<p>because of how fierce the oppressing sword is,</p>
<p>and because of his fierce anger.”	Jer 25:35-38</p>
<p>26:1A Message from Yahveh at the Beginning</p>
<p>of the Reign of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>Jeremiah Escapes Death</p>
<p>2Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Stand in the court of Yahveh’s Temple and speak to the towns in Judah that have come to worship here. Don’t hold back a word! 3Maybe they’ll listen so I can change my mind about the catastrophe I’m planning for them. 4Tell them, ‘If you won’t follow the Law I’ve given you 5or listen to the prophets I’ve sent you time and again, 6then I’ll make this Temple like Shiloh and this city accursed to every nation.’”</p>
<p>7The priests, the prophets, and the people were listening to Jeremiah saying this. 8When he finished, they grabbed him, “You have to die! 9Why did you prophesy in Yahveh’s name that this Temple will be like Shiloh and this city without residents?” The people gathered around him.</p>
<p>Jer 26:1-9</p>
<p>10When the officials of Judah heard about that, they came up from the king’s palace to Yahveh’s Temple and sat in the entrance of the New Gate. 11The priests and prophets told the officials and the people, “This man has to die! You’ve heard him prophesy against this city.”</p>
<p>12Then Jeremiah answered,</p>
<p>“Yahveh sent me to prophesy the message you heard. 13If you mend your ways and deeds and obey him, he’ll change his mind about this misfortune. 14Do to me what you like. 15Just know that if you put me to death, you’ll bring innocent blood on yourselves, this city, and its people.”          	Jer 26:10-15</p>
<p>16The officials and the people told the priests and prophets, “This man doesn’t deserve to die. He’s spoken to us in the name of Yahveh our God.”</p>
<p>17Some elders of the land stood up and told the assembly,</p>
<p>18“Micah of Moresheth prophesied at the time of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He told the people in Judah,</p>
<p>‘Yahveh of Hosts has said,</p>
<p>“Zion will be plowed like a field;</p>
<p>Jerusalem will become a ruins;</p>
<p>the Temple mount will be like a thicket.”’</p>
<p>19Did Hezekiah and Judah put him to death? Didn’t they respect Yahveh and ask for his blessing? Yahveh changed his mind about the misfortune he‘d pronounced on them. We’re about to do ourselves great harm.”	Jer 26:16-19</p>
<p>20Another man prophesied in Yahveh’s name, Uriah Ben-Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. Like Jeremiah, he was prophesying against this city and the land. 21When King Jehoiakim, his officials, and soldiers heard it, the king tried to put him to death, but Uriah found out and fled to Egypt. 22The king sent Elnathan Ben-Achbor and some others to Egypt, 23and they brought him back. Jehoiakim killed him with a sword and threw his body into the graves for commoners. 24But Ahikam Ben-Shaphan defended Jeremiah; so he wasn’t executed. 	Jer 26:20-24</p>
<p>27:1A Message to Jeremiah from Yahveh</p>
<p>at the Beginning of the Reign of Zedekiah</p>
<p>Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>Jeremiah Wears an Ox Yoke</p>
<p>2“Make yokes and straps and put them on your neck. 3Send back a message to the kings of Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, Tyre, and Sidon by the couriers that come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah. 4Have them tell their masters, ‘Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 5“By my power I made the world, its people and animals. I’ll give it to whoever pleases me. 6I’ve given these countries to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. I’ve even given him the wild animals. 7Every nation will serve him, his son, and his grandson till the time when many nations and great kings make him and his land their servant. 	       Jer 27:1-7</p>
<p>8“Any kingdom that doesn’t surrender and put its neck under his yoke, I’ll punish with sword, famine, and disease. 9Don’t listen to prophets, fortunetellers, dreamers, soothsayers, and sorcerers that tell you not to surrender; 10they’re lying. You’ll be exiled and perish. 11But a nation that puts its neck under his yoke, I’ll let remain on its land, cultivate it, and keep living there.”’”</p>
<p>12I told Zedekiah, king of Judah,</p>
<p>“Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Surrender and you’ll stay alive! 13Why die by sword, famine, and disease like Yahveh warned any nation that wouldn’t serve him? 14-15I didn’t send the prophets that tell you otherwise. They’re prophesying falsely in my name. As a result, I’ll drive you out; you and those prophets will perish.”	   Jer 27:8-15</p>
<p>16I told the priests and the people,</p>
<p>“Yahveh says not to listen to prophets that tell you the articles from the Temple will soon come back from Babylon. 17Surrender and you’ll stay alive! Why let this city become a ruin? 18If those prophets have Yahveh’s message, let them ask him that the articles still in his Temple not go to Babylon. 19Yahveh of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the stands, the articles still in this city—20things Nebuchadnezzar didn’t take when he exiled Jeconiah and the nobles in Judah and Jerusalem—[21] 22‘He’ll take them to Babylon till I go and bring them back.’”   	     		      	Jer 27:16-22</p>
<p>Jeremiah Condemns Hananiah</p>
<p>28:1That same year in the fifth month, fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Hananiah Ben-Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahveh’s Temple with the priests and the people standing there:</p>
<p>2“Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’ve broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3Within two years I’ll bring back the articles from Yahveh’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon.  4I’ll also bring back Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah that went to Babylon. I’ll break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”</p>
<p>5Jeremiah answered him, 	  Jer 28:1-5</p>
<p>6“Amen! May Yahveh do just that! Bring back the articles and exiles from Babylon! 7But listen to what I’m telling you! 8For centuries, the prophets have prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms about war, catastrophe, and disease. 9A prophet that predicts a peace that actually comes, is one Yahveh has actually sent.”</p>
<p>10Then Hananiah grabbed the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 11He told the people, “Yahveh says, ‘In the same way, two years from now I’ll break Nebuchadnezzar’s yoke from off the neck of all the nations.’”</p>
<p>Jeremiah left.				  Jer 28:6-11</p>
<p>12A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>After Hananiah Had Broken the Yoke off His Neck</p>
<p>13“Go tell Hananiah that Yahveh says, ‘You’ve broken a wooden yoke, but I’ve replaced it with an iron one 14on those nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar. I’ve even given him the wild animals.’</p>
<p>15“Hananiah, Yahveh didn’t send you. You made the people believe a lie. 16So he says you’re going to die this year because you’ve advised rebellion against him.”</p>
<p>17Hananiah died two months later in the seventh month.	              Jer 28:12-17</p>
<p>29:1The Letter Jeremiah Sent from Jerusalem</p>
<p>to the Rest of the Elders, Priests, Prophets, and People</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar Had Taken from Jerusalem to Babylon</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles</p>
<p>(2This was after King Jeconiah/Jehoiachin, the queen mother, the court officials, the other officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and smiths were deported from Jerusalem.) 3Jeremiah sent the letter by Elasah Ben-Shaphan and Gemariah Ben-Hilkiah, ambassadors Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon:	         			  Jer 29:1-3</p>
<p>4“Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to the exiles he’s sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, 5‘Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they grow. 6Get married and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands to have sons and daughters. Multiply there, don’t decrease. 7Look out for the welfare of the city where I’ve sent you. Pray to me on its behalf; in its welfare you’ll fair well. 8Don’t let your prophets and fortunetellers mislead you with their dreams. 9They’re lying in my name. I haven’t sent them.</p>
<p>10“At the end of 70 years in Babylon, I’ll fulfill my promise to bring you back here. 11I know my plans for giving you hope and a future. 12Then you’ll pray, and I’ll listen. 13You’ll look for me and find me when you search with all your heart. 14I’ll restore your fortunes and gather you back to the place I exiled you from.	       	       	  Jer 29:4-14</p>
<p>15“Because you’ve said, ‘Yahveh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ 16this is what I say about the king on David’s throne and about your brothers in this city who didn’t go into exile with you: 17-18I’ll chase them with sword, famine, and disease. They’ll be like burst-open figs no one can eat because they’re rotten. I’ll make them a terror, a curse, something abhorred, to gasp at, a disgrace among the nations where I’ve banished them. 19They didn’t listen when I sent them my prophets time and again. 20So, you exiles that I’ve sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to what I’m telling you.</p>
<p>21“This is what Yahveh says about Ahab Ben-Kolaiah and Zedekiah Ben-Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in my name: ‘I’ll deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar; he’ll execute them in your presence. 22The exiles from Judah in Babylon will use this curse, “Yahveh make you like Zedekiah and Ahab that the king of Babylon roasted in fire.” 23They acted foolishly in Israel and committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives. They lied in my name. I’m the One who knows; I see everything that happens.’” 	  Jer 29:15-23</p>
<p>A Message for Shemaiah</p>
<p>24Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,</p>
<p>25“Because you’ve sent letters in your own name to the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah the priest and all the other priests, and said, 26‘Yahveh has made you priests in place of Jehoiada, to oversee his Temple over every mad man that prophesies, to put him in stocks and an iron collar. 27Why haven’t you rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you? 28He sent to us in Babylon and said, “It will be a long exile. Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they grow.”’”	 Jer 29:24-28</p>
<p>29Zephaniah the priest read that letter to Jeremiah, 30and a message came from Yahveh to Jeremiah, 31“Send to all the exiles:</p>
<p>‘Yahveh says this about Shemaiah because he’s prophesied to you though I didn’t send him and made you believe a lie: 32“I’m about to punish him. He won’t have any descendants or see the good I’m going to do for my people, because he incited rebellion against me.”’” 	Jer 29:29-32</p>
<p>30:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>A Promise to Restore Israel</p>
<p>2“Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘Write in a scroll everything I’ve told you, 3because the time’s coming when I’ll restore the fortunes of Israel and Judah. I’ll bring my people back to take over the land I gave their ancestors.’”</p>
<p>4This is what Yahveh said about Israel and Judah:</p>
<p>5“I’ve heard the sound of terror and dread;</p>
<p>there’s no peace.</p>
<p>6Ask and see if a man can have a baby.</p>
<p>Why do I see every man</p>
<p>with his hands on his crotch</p>
<p>like a woman in childbirth?</p>
<p>Why have their faces turned pale?</p>
<p>7That day will be like no other,</p>
<p>a time of Jacob’s distress,</p>
<p>but I’ll deliver him from it.</p>
<p>8I’ll break the yoke off his neck and tear off its straps. Foreigners won’t enslave him anymore. 9He’ll serve Yahveh his God and David his king that I’ll raise up for him.”     	  Jer 30:1-9</p>
<p>10“Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;</p>
<p>don’t be distressed, Israel.</p>
<p>From a long way off, I’ll save you and your offspring</p>
<p>from the land where you’re captive.</p>
<p>Jacob will come back and be at ease;</p>
<p>nobody will terrorize him.</p>
<p>11‘I’m with you to save you,</p>
<p>to destroy the nations where I’ve scattered you.</p>
<p>You’re the one I won’t destroy completely.</p>
<p>I’ll discipline you justly</p>
<p>and certainly not let you go unpunished.	Jer 30:10-11</p>
<p>12“Your wound can’t heal;</p>
<p>you’re too seriously injured.</p>
<p>13There’s nobody to argue your case,</p>
<p>no healing for your sore,</p>
<p>no recovery for you.</p>
<p>14All your lovers have forgotten about you;</p>
<p>they’re not looking for you.</p>
<p>I’ve wounded you like a cruel enemy would</p>
<p>because your sins were severe and numerous.</p>
<p>15Why cry out because of your injury?</p>
<p>Your pain can’t be relieved.</p>
<p>I’ve done that to you</p>
<p>because of your great iniquity,</p>
<p>your many sins.</p>
<p>16So everybody that devours you will be devoured;</p>
<p>your captors will go into captivity.</p>
<p>Your plunderers will become plunder;</p>
<p>those who prey on you I’ll make prey.</p>
<p>17I’ll restore you to health and heal your wounds,</p>
<p>because they’ve called you an outcast and said,</p>
<p>‘That’s Zion; nobody cares about it.’	Jer 30:12-17</p>
<p>18“Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘I’ll restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents</p>
<p>and have mercy on where he’s living.</p>
<p>The city will be rebuilt on its ruins;</p>
<p>the palace will stand in its rightful place.</p>
<p>19Thanksgiving will go out from them,</p>
<p>and the sound of people having fun.</p>
<p>I’ll multiply them, not decrease them;</p>
<p>I’ll honor them; they’ll be significant.</p>
<p>20They’ll have children like before;</p>
<p>their community will be safe with me;</p>
<p>I’ll punish their oppressors.	Jer 30:18-20</p>
<p>21One of their own will lead them;</p>
<p>their ruler will come from among themselves.</p>
<p>I’ll bring him near, and he’ll approach me;</p>
<p>who would dare risking his life to approach me on his own?</p>
<p>22You’ll be my people,</p>
<p>and I’ll be your God.’”	Jer 30:21-22</p>
<p>23Yahveh’s storm!</p>
<p>His anger has gone out like a tornado;</p>
<p>it will burst down on the heads of sinners.</p>
<p>24Yahveh’s fierce anger won’t relent</p>
<p>till he’s accomplished his purpose.</p>
<p>Later you’ll understand.	Jer 30:23-24</p>
<p>31:1“At that time,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll be the God of every family in Israel,</p>
<p>and they’ll be my people.</p>
<p>2The people that survived the sword</p>
<p>found grace in the desert</p>
<p>when Israel was looking for rest.”</p>
<p>3Yahveh appeared to him from afar and said,</p>
<p>“I’ve loved you with enduring love;</p>
<p>so I’ve drawn you with lovingkindness.</p>
<p>4I’ll rebuild you, virgin of Israel!</p>
<p>You’ll pick up your tambourines again</p>
<p>and join the dance.</p>
<p>5You’ll plant your vineyards on Samaria’s hills again;</p>
<p>you that plant them will enjoy them.</p>
<p>6There’ll be a time when watchmen</p>
<p>on the hilltops in Ephraim will call out,</p>
<p>‘Let’s go up to Zion to Yahveh our God.’”	Jer 31:1-6</p>
<p>7Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Sing out loud with happiness for Jacob;</p>
<p>shout among the chiefs of the nations.</p>
<p>Proclaim, give praise, and say,</p>
<p>‘Yahveh, save the remnant of Israel.’</p>
<p>8I’ll bring them from the north country;</p>
<p>I’ll gather them from the remote parts of the world,</p>
<p>the blind and lame among them,</p>
<p>the pregnant,</p>
<p>and those in labor—</p>
<p>that large company will come back here.</p>
<p>9They’ll come weeping,</p>
<p>and I’ll be leading them with consolation;</p>
<p>I’ll make them walk by streams</p>
<p>on a straight path where they won’t stumble;</p>
<p>I’m Israel’s father;</p>
<p>Ephraim’s my firstborn.”	Jer 31:7-9</p>
<p>10Nations, listen to a message from Yahveh</p>
<p>and announce it in distant lands:</p>
<p>“The One that scattered Israel will gather him</p>
<p>and keep him like a shepherd keeps his flock.”</p>
<p>11Yahveh has ransomed Jacob,</p>
<p>redeemed him from someone stronger than he is.</p>
<p>12“They’ll come and shout for joy on Zion’s hill,</p>
<p>and be radiant over the bounty from Yahveh—</p>
<p>the grain, new wine, and olive oil;</p>
<p>the young in the flock and herd;</p>
<p>they’ll thrive like a watered garden</p>
<p>and never wilt again.</p>
<p>13The virgins will celebrate in the dance;</p>
<p>the young men and old will celebrate together.</p>
<p>I’ll turn your mourning into joy,</p>
<p>comfort you, and replace sorrow with happiness.</p>
<p>14I’ll fill the soul of the priests with abundance;</p>
<p>my goodness will be satisfying to my people.”	Jer 31:10-14</p>
<p>15Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“A sound was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p>weeping and bitter crying,</p>
<p>Rachel weeping for her children;</p>
<p>she couldn’t be consoled,</p>
<p>because they were gone.”				Jer 31:15</p>
<p>16Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Don’t cry or shed tears;</p>
<p>your work will be rewarded.</p>
<p>They’ll come back from their enemy’s land.</p>
<p>17There’s hope for your future;</p>
<p>your children will return to their own land.</p>
<p>18I’ve heard Ephraim moaning,</p>
<p>‘You’ve disciplined me like an untrained calf.</p>
<p>Bring me back so I can be restored</p>
<p>because you’re Yahveh my God.</p>
<p>19After I turned around, I repented;</p>
<p>after I was instructed, I struck my thigh.</p>
<p>I was ashamed and humiliated</p>
<p>because I carried the disgrace of my youth.’</p>
<p>20Is Ephraim my dear son,</p>
<p>my delightful child?</p>
<p>As often as I’ve spoken against him,</p>
<p>I’ll still remember him.</p>
<p>My heart yearns to have mercy on him.			Jer 31:16-20</p>
<p>21“Set up road signs, erect guideposts;</p>
<p>look at the highway you used when you left.</p>
<p>Come, virgin of Israel;</p>
<p>come back to your cities.</p>
<p>22How long will you wander around,</p>
<p>unfaithful daughter?</p>
<p>Yahveh has created a new thing in the world—</p>
<p>a woman protecting a man.”	Jer 31:21-22</p>
<p>23Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “They’ll speak this message again in Judah’s towns when I restore their fortunes:</p>
<p>‘Yahveh bless you, righteous home, holy hill!’</p>
<p>24Judah’s townspeople, farmers and herdsmen will live in harmony. 25I’ll satisfy the weary and refresh the fainting.”	  	   Jer 31:23-25</p>
<p>26Then I woke up; my sleep was pleasant.</p>
<p>27“The time’s coming when I’ll sow Israel and Judah with people and animals. 28As I’ve watched over them to pull up, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster; so I’ll watch over them to plant and build. 29They won’t say anymore,</p>
<p>‘The parents ate sour grapes,</p>
<p>and the children’s mouths puckered.’</p>
<p>30Everybody will die for their own sin. Those who eat sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths pucker.</p>
<p>31“The time’s coming,” Yahveh says, “when I’ll make a new covenant with Israel and Judah. 32It won’t be like the one I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I was a husband to them. 33I’ll make this kind of covenant with them: I’ll put my Law inside them; I’ll write it on their heart. I’ll be their God and they’ll be my people. 34No one will be teaching their brother and fellow citizen to know Yahveh, because they’ll all know me from least to greatest. I’ll forgive their sin; I won’t keep it in mind anymore.”                	Jer 31:26-34</p>
<p>35Yahveh says—</p>
<p>who provides the sun to light the day</p>
<p>and the moon and stars for light at night,</p>
<p>who makes the sea roar,</p>
<p>whose name is Yahveh of Hosts—</p>
<p>36“If this fixed order can disappear,</p>
<p>then Israel’s offspring can disappear</p>
<p>from being a nation that serves me.</p>
<p>37If the sky above can be measured</p>
<p>and the earth’s foundations can be explored,</p>
<p>then I can throw away Israel’s offspring</p>
<p>for everything they’ve done.	Jer 31:35-37</p>
<p>38“The time’s coming,” Yahveh says, “when the city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 39The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb and then turn to Goah. 40The whole valley of dead bodies and ashes, the fields over to the Brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate on the east—will be sacred to me, never again uprooted or thrown down.”				       	       Jer 31:38-40</p>
<p>32:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>in the Tenth Year of Zedekiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>(Eighteenth Year of Nebuchadnezzar)</p>
<p>Jeremiah Buys a Field</p>
<p>2-3Babylon’s army was laying siege to Jerusalem. Zedekiah had shut Jeremiah up in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace, and said,</p>
<p>“Why do you prophesy that Yahveh says, ‘I’m about to give the city to the king of Babylon. 4Zedekiah won’t escape; the king of Babylon will speak to him face to face.  5He’ll take him to Babylon till I visit him. If you fight the Babylonians, you’ll lose’?”</p>
<p>6Jeremiah said,</p>
<p>“A message from Yahveh came to me, 7‘Hanamel Ben-Shallum your uncle is coming to tell you to buy his field in Anathoth; you have first-right to redeem it.’”</p>
<p>8He did come to me in the courtyard of the guard like Yahveh said, and told me, “Buy my field at Anathoth in Benjamin. It’s yours to redeem.”	Jer 32:1-8a</p>
<p>Then I knew it was a message from Yahveh. 9I bought the field from my cousin and weighed out 6.8 oz 17 shekels of silver for him. 10I called in witnesses, signed and sealed the deed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. 11I took the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, and the unsealed copy, 12and gave them to Baruch Ben-Neriah Ben-Mahseiah in front of Hanamel and the witnesses who signed it in the presence of the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. 13In front of them I told Baruch, 	  Jer 32:18b-13</p>
<p>14“Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘Take the sealed deed of purchase and the unsealed copy and put them in a clay jar to preserve them a long time. 15People will buy houses, fields, and vineyards in this land again.’”</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Prayer</p>
<p>16After I gave Baruch the deed, I prayed, 17“Lord Yahveh, you made earth and sky by your great power! There’s nothing you can’t do. 18You show enduring love to thousands, but pay the consequences of one generations’ sins on the next, great powerful God. Your name is Yahveh of Hosts. 19You’re great in counsel and powerful in deed. You see everything people do and repay them accordingly. 20You showed signs and wonders in Egypt, in our time in Israel, and elsewhere. You’ve made a name for yourself. 21You brought your people out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand, outstretched arm, and great terror. 22You gave them this land you swore to their ancestors you’d give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 23They took possession of it, but they didn’t obey your Law; so you brought this catastrophe on them. 24Siege mounds have come up to take it by sword, famine, and disease. You’ll give it to the Babylonians. What you said has happened. 25Lord Yahveh, you told me to buy the field and call witnesses, even though you’re giving the city to the Babylonians.’”	       Jer 32:14-25</p>
<p>26A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>27“I’m Yahveh God of all people. Is there anything I can’t do? 28I’m about to give this city to the Babylonians, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. 29They’ll come in and set it on fire and burn down the houses where people made me angry by offering incense to Baal on the roofs and pouring out liquid offerings to other gods. 30From the beginning, Israel and Judah have been doing everything I’ve forbidden. 31This city has been provoking me ever since they built it. I’m going to put it out of my sight 32because of the sinful things the kings, leaders, priests, prophets, and people in Judah and Jerusalem have done. 33They turned their back on me. Though I taught them over and over, they wouldn’t accept my instruction. 34With the detestable things they put in it, they defiled the Temple that wears my name. 35They built high places to Baal in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom and sacrificed their sons and daughters as burnt offerings to Molech. I didn’t command that! It never entered my mind that they would do something so detestable.       		 Jer 32:26-35</p>
<p>36So this is what Yahveh God of Israel says about this city he has given over to sword, famine, and disease: 37“I’ll gather them out of the lands where I drive them in my anger, wrath, and great indignation, and bring them back here to live safely. 38They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. 39I’ll give them one heart and one way so they’ll always respect me for the good of them and their descendants. 40I’ll make an everlasting covenant not to abandon them and to put respect for me in their hearts so they won’t abandon me. 41With all my heart and soul, I’ll enjoy doing them good and faithfully planting them in this land. 42Just as I brought this catastrophe on them, I’ll bring on them all the good I’m promising. 43People will buy fields in this land that you say is ‘a waste without people or animals,’ a land lost to the Babylonians. 44They’ll call witnesses and seal deeds in Benjamin, in Jerusalem, in the towns in Judah, the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev. I’ll restore their fortunes.”	 Jer 32:36-44</p>
<p>33:1Yahveh’s Second Message to Jeremiah</p>
<p>While Confined in the Courtyard of the Guard</p>
<p>2This is what Yahveh says who made the earth, formed and established it: 3“Call out to me, and I’ll tell you important things you don’t know.” 4The God of Israel says this about the houses in this city—including the palace of Judah’s kings—that were torn down to get materials for defending against the siege mounds and the sword, 5“They’re coming to fight the Babylonians and fill the houses with the corpses of men that in my anger I’ve destined to die. I withdrew because of their sinfulness. 6Later I’ll bring them health and healing, and show them true prosperity and peace. 7I’ll restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them like they were before. 8I’ll cleanse them from their sin against me. 9This city will have a world-wide reputation for joy, praise, and honor to me. The nations will hear about the good I’m doing for it, and tremble at the peace I’m making for it.”	        	      Jer 33:1-9</p>
<p>10Yahveh says, “You say this place is a waste without people or animals—desolate towns in Judah and streets in Jerusalem. 11But you’ll hear again the sound of happiness, the voices of bride and groom, of people who say,</p>
<p>‘Thank Yahveh of Hosts;</p>
<p>he’s good;</p>
<p>his love endures forever.’</p>
<p>You’ll hear people bringing thank offerings to his Temple. I’ll restore the fortunes of the land like they were in the beginning.’</p>
<p>12Yahveh of Hosts says, “Shepherds will bed down their flocks in the towns that are ‘a waste without people or animals.’ 13Flocks will pass again under the hands of the one that’s counting them in the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, in Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and Judah.	     Jer 33:10-13</p>
<p>14“The time’s coming when I’ll keep the promise I’ve made about Israel and Judah. 15A good Branch will sprout from David and carry out justice and goodness in the land. 16Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live safely. His name will be Yahveh Is Our Goodness [Yahveh Tsidekenu]. 17David will always have a man on the throne. 18The Levitical priests will always have a man to offer me burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices.”  Jer 33:14-18</p>
<p>19A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>20“If my covenant with day and night could be broken so they wouldn’t happen at their appointed times, 21then my covenant could also be broken so that David wouldn’t have a descendant on his throne and the Levitical priests wouldn’t serve as my ministers. 22As the stars in the sky can’t be counted and the sand on the shore can’t be numbered, that’s how much I’ll multiply the descendants of David my servant and the Levites my ministers.”	       Jer 33:19-22</p>
<p>23A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>24“Have you noticed how the people say Yahveh has rejected the two families he chose? They don’t consider my people one nation. 25My covenant with day and night stands. As sure as I’ve established the patterns of earth and sky, 26I’ll keep the offspring of Jacob and choose a descendant of David to rule the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I’ll show them mercy and restore their fortunes.’” 		      	 Jer 33:23-26</p>
<p>34:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>When Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon,</p>
<p>and His Army and the Kingdoms He Ruled Were</p>
<p>Fighting Jerusalem and Surrounding Towns</p>
<p>A Warning to Zedekiah</p>
<p>2Go tell Zedekiah, king of Judah, that Yahveh says, “I’m giving this city to the king of Babylon, and he’ll burn it. 3You’ll be captured and turned over to him. You’ll see him in person, he’ll speak to you directly, and you’ll go to Babylon.” 4But listen to Yahveh, Zedekiah! “You won’t die by the sword; 5you’ll die in peace. As they burned spices for the kings before you, they’ll burn spices and lament, ‘Ah, lord!’ for you. I’ve spoken.”</p>
<p>6That’s what Jeremiah told Zedekiah 7while Babylon’s army was fighting Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah, the only fortified cities left in Judah. 	Jer 34:1-7</p>
<p>8A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>After King Zedekiah Made an Agreement</p>
<p>with the People in Jerusalem to Declare Liberty</p>
<p>9Each man was to free his Hebrew male and female slaves so nobody would enslave a fellow Jewish. 10The officials and the people obeyed and agreed not to hold them as slaves any longer. 11But afterward they went back on their word and brought their freed slaves back into subjection.					    Jer 34:8-11</p>
<p>12Then a message from Yahveh came to Jeremiah:</p>
<p>13Yahveh God of Israel says, “I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of bondage in Egypt. 14At the end of seven years, set your fellow Hebrew free that’s been sold to you. But your ancestors didn’t obey me. 15Recently you changed and did what was right. You freed your fellow citizen and made a covenant in my presence. 16But you’ve gone back on your word and profaned my name. You’ve enslaved again the slaves you’d freed.     	  Jer 34:12-16</p>
<p>17“You haven’t obeyed me by releasing your brother and fellow citizen; so I’m releasing you to sword, famine, and disease. I’ll make you something other kingdoms abhor. 18-20The ones that didn’t keep that covenant, I’ll release to their enemies that want to kill them: officials in Judah and Jerusalem, court officers, priests, and common people who cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 21I’ll deliver Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies, 22and direct them to attack this city again, burn it, and fill Judah with ghost towns.”</p>
<p>Jer 34:17-22</p>
<p>35:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>at the Time of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>The Obedience of the Racabites</p>
<p>2“Go bring the Rechabites to a room in Yahveh’s Temple and offer them wine.”</p>
<p>3I took Jaazaniah Ben-Jeremiah Ben-Habazziniah, his brothers and sons—the whole family of Rechabites—4to Yahveh’s Temple to the office for the sons of Hanan Ben-Igdaliah, the man of God. It was close to the officials’ quarters, above the room for Maaseiah Ben-Shallum, the doorkeeper. 5I put pitchers of wine and cups in front of the Rechabites, “Have a drink!”</p>
<p>6But they said,</p>
<p>“We won’t drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab/Jehonadab Ben-Rechab told us, ‘Never drink wine, you or your descendants, forever. 7Don’t build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards, or own them. Live in tents so you’ll live a long time in the land.’ 8We, our wives, sons, and daughters have obeyed him. 9We don’t build houses or own vineyards, fields, or seed. 10We live in tents. 11But when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the land, we came to Jerusalem before the Babylonian and Syrian armies got here. So we’ve been living in Jerusalem.”	     Jer 35:1-11</p>
<p>12Then a message from Yahveh came to Jeremiah,</p>
<p>13Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,</p>
<p>“Tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Won’t you receive instruction and listen to me? 14The descendants of Jonadab still observe his command not to drink wine. I’ve spoken to you time and again, but you’ve ignored me. 15I’ve sent you prophets time and again and said, “Turn from your sinful way, correct your deeds, stop worshiping other gods so you can live in the land I’ve given you and your ancestors.” But you’ve ignored me. 16Jonadab’s descendants have observed their ancestor’s command, but you’ve ignored me. 17So, I’m bringing on Judah and Jerusalem the disaster I’ve threatened.</p>
<p>I spoke to them, but they ignored me;</p>
<p>I called out to them, but they didn’t answer.’”</p>
<p>18Then Jeremiah told the Rechabites, “Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘Because you’ve obeyed Jonadab, 19he’ll always have descendants to serve me.’” 	  35:12-19</p>
<p>36:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah,</p>
<p>Baruch Reads Aloud Yahveh’s Messages</p>
<p>2“On a scroll, write down everything I’ve told you about Israel, Judah, and the nations from Josiah’s time till now. 3Maybe Judah will listen to the catastrophe I intend to bring on them to get them to repent. Then I’ll forgive their sin.”</p>
<p>4Jeremiah called for Baruch Ben-Neriah, and he wrote down Yahveh’s messages that Jeremiah dictated. 5He told Baruch,</p>
<p>“I can’t go to Yahveh’s Temple. 6So you go on a fast day and read to the people the messages you’ve written. Read them to the people in Judah who come from their towns. 7Maybe they’ll turn from their sinful ways and ask for his forgiveness. Yahveh has pronounced great anger against them.”</p>
<p>8Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.	Jer 36:1-8</p>
<p>9In the ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim/Coniah, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to Yahveh. 10What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah Ben-Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.</p>
<p>11When Micaiah Ben-Gemariah heard it, 12he went down to the scribe’s office in the king’s palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah Ben-Shemaiah, Elnathan Ben-Achbor, Gemariah Ben-Shaphan, Zedekiah Ben-Hananiah, and the others. 13He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. 14They sent Jehudi Ben-Nethaniah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Cushi) to Baruch and said, “Bring the scroll you read to the people.”</p>
<p>So Baruch took it to them. 	 Jer 36:9-14</p>
<p>15“Sit down and read it to us.”</p>
<p>16When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, “We’ll have to report this to the king. 17Tell us how you wrote this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”</p>
<p>18“He dictated it to me, and I wrote it in ink on the scroll.</p>
<p>19The officials said, “Both of you, go hide. Don’t tell anybody where you are.”</p>
<p>King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll</p>
<p>20So they reported to the king what it said, but they’d deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. 21He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. 22The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. 23When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them in the brazier till he’d burned up the whole scroll. 24The king and his attendants weren’t afraid and didn’t tear their clothes. 25Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. 26He told Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah Ben-Azriel, and Shelemiah Ben-Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but Yahveh hid them.	Jer 36:15-26</p>
<p>27A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>After the King Burned the Scroll</p>
<p>Baruch Had Written at Jeremiah’s Dictation</p>
<p>Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll</p>
<p>28“Take another scroll and write down everything again. 29Say to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, ‘You burned this scroll and said, “Why did you write that the king of Babylon will destroy this land and empty out its people and animals?” 30This is Yahveh’s answer: ‘You won’t have any descendant to sit on David’s throne. They’ll toss your dead body out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. 31I’ll punish you, your family, and your attendants for your sins. I’ll bring on you and the people in Jerusalem and Judah the catastrophe I’ve declared—but they didn’t listen.’”</p>
<p>32So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.		Jer 36:27-32</p>
<p>Jeremiah Imprisoned</p>
<p>37:1Zedekiah Ben-Josiah, that Nebuchadnezzar had appointed king in Judah, ruled in place of Coniah Ben-Jehoiakim. 2But he, his attendants, and the people that were left ignored what Yahveh said through Jeremiah.</p>
<p>3Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal Ben-Shelemiah and Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah to say, “Pray to Yahveh our God on our behalf.” 4Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people because they hadn’t put him in prison yet. 5Meantime, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt. When the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard about that, they lifted the siege. 					  Jer 37:1-5</p>
<p>6A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>7“Tell the king that sent you to inquire from me, ‘Pharaoh’s army that‘s come out to help you will go back to Egypt. 8The Babylonians will come back and attack this city, capture and burn it. 9Don’t deceive yourselves into thinking they’ll leave. 10Even if you’d defeated the whole Babylonian army and only the wounded were left in their tents, they’d get up and burn the city.’”</p>
<p>11When the Babylonian army lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, 12Jeremiah left Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to take over some property there. 13At the Benjamin Gate, a sentry named Irijah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Hananiah) arrested him, claiming he was deserting to the Babylonians! 14Jeremiah denied it, but he wouldn’t listen. He arrested him and took him to the officials. 15They were mad at Jeremiah, and beat him and put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they’d converted into a prison. 	Jer 37:6-15</p>
<p>Jeremiah Put in a Cistern</p>
<p>38:1Shephatiah Ben-Mattan, Gedaliah Ben-Pashhur, Jucal Ben-Shelemiah, and Pashhur Ben-Malchijah heard what Jeremiah was telling the people:</p>
<p>2“Yahveh says, ‘If you stay in the city, you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease. If you surrender, you’ll have your life as a reward of war. 3The king of Babylon’s army is going to capture the city.’”</p>
<p>4The officials told the king,</p>
<p>“Execute him. He’s discouraging the fighting men in the city and the people by telling them things like that. He’s not looking out for their welfare, but their harm.”</p>
<p>5King Zedekiah said, “Do with him whatever you want.”</p>
<p>6They put Jeremiah in a cistern that belonged to Malchijah the king’s son in the court of the guardhouse. They let him down with ropes. There wasn’t any water in it, but he sank in the mud. 					Jer 38:1-6</p>
<p>7But Ebed-melech the Nubian, a eunuch in the king’s palace, heard they’d put him in the cistern. The king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate. 8Ebed-melech left the palace to speak to him,</p>
<p>9“My lord the king, these fellows have done something awful to Jeremiah; they’ve put him in a cistern. He’ll starve to death; there’s no more bread in the city.”</p>
<p>10The king said, “Take 30 men from here under your authority and get him out before he dies.”</p>
<p>11So Ebed-melech took them to a place under the storeroom in the king’s palace. They took worn-out clothes and rags, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. 12“Put these under your arms over the ropes.” 13They pulled him up out of the cistern, and he remained in the court of the guardhouse.	     Jer 38:7-13</p>
<p>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again</p>
<p>14Then King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought to the third entrance of Yahveh’s Temple, “I’m going to ask you something. Don’t keep back anything from me.”</p>
<p>15Jeremiah said, “If I tell you, won’t you put me to death? If I give you advice, you won’t take it.”</p>
<p>16But King Zedekiah swore to him privately, “As sure as Yahveh lives who made this life for us, I won’t put you to death or turn you over to the ones who want to kill you.”</p>
<p>17So Jeremiah said,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of hosts says, ‘You’ll live if you go out to the officials of Babylon. The city won’t be burned, and you and your household will survive. 18If you don’t surrender, the city will fall, they’ll burn it, and you won’t escape.’”</p>
<p>Jer 38:14-18</p>
<p>19King Zedekiah said, “I’m afraid the Jews that have deserted to the Babylonians may turn me over to them, and they’ll torture me.”</p>
<p>20“They won’t do that. Obey Yahveh so you’ll live. 21If you keep refusing to go out, this is what Yahveh has shown me. 22The women that are left in the palace are going to be brought out to the officers of Babylon, and they’ll say,</p>
<p>‘Your trusted friends have deceived you</p>
<p>and prevailed over you.</p>
<p>Now that your feet are sunk in the mire,</p>
<p>they desert you.’</p>
<p>23They’ll bring out your wives and sons to the Babylonians, and you won’t escape. The king of Babylon will capture you and burn the city.”</p>
<p>24Zedekiah told Jeremiah,</p>
<p>“Don’t tell anybody what you’ve said, and you won’t die. 25If the officials hear that I’ve talked to you, ‘Tell us what you and the king talked about; don’t keep back any of it from us, and we won’t put you to death’; 26then tell them, ‘I pleaded with the king not to put me back in Jonathan’s house to die.’”</p>
<p>27Then the officials came to question Jeremiah. So he told them what the king commanded him, and they dropped the issue since nobody had heard the conversation. 28So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse till Jerusalem fell. 	   Jer 38:19-28</p>
<p>The Fall of Jerusalem</p>
<p>39:1In the tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and began to lay siege to it. 2The ninth day, fourth month, eleventh year of Zedekiah, they breached the wall. 3The officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer the Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the rest. 4When Zedekiah and his soldiers saw them, they fled at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls and headed toward the Arabah. 5But the Babylonian army caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him up to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 6He executed Zedekiah’s sons right in front of him and executed the nobles of Judah. 7Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in bronze restraints, and took him to Babylon. 8The Babylonians burned the king’s palace and the people’s houses and tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 9Nebuchadnezzar exiled to Babylon the rest of the people in the city and the ones that defected to him. 10Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, left some people in Judah that didn’t have anything, and gave them vineyards and fields.	                 Jer 39:1-10</p>
<p>11Nebuchadnezzar gave Nebuzaradan orders about Jeremiah, 12“Look after him; don’t harm him. Deal with him like he tells you.” 13So Nebuzaradan, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the leading officials of the king of Babylon 14sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah to take him home. So he stayed among the people.	Jer 39:11-14</p>
<p>15A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>While He Was in the Guardhouse</p>
<p>16“Go tell Ebed-melech the Nubian, ‘Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “I’m about to bring my message on this city for disaster, not prosperity. It’ll take place before yousg on that day. 17But yousg won’t be given over to the men you dread. 18I’ll rescue you so you won’t fall by the sword. You’ll have to save your life by being a reward of war, because you’ve trusted in me.”’” 	  Jer 39:15-18</p>
<p>40:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>After Nebuzaradan Released Him from Ramah,</p>
<p>When He’d Taken Him Bound in Chains</p>
<p>Among the Exiles from Jerusalem and Judah</p>
<p>That Were Being Exiled to Babylon</p>
<p>Jeremiah Freed</p>
<p>2The captain of the bodyguard took Jeremiah and told him,</p>
<p>“Yahveh your God declared this catastrophe on this place. 3He brought it on and did what he declared. Because your people sinned against him and didn’t listen to him, this happened to youpl. 4But I’m freeing yousg from your chains. If you prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along. I’ll take care of you. But if you prefer not to, don’t. The whole land is open to you. Go wherever seems right. 5Go to Gedaliah Ben-Ahikam Ben-Shaphan that the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns in Judah. Stay with him among the people or go somewhere else.”</p>
<p>So he gave him a ration and a gift, and released him. 6Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah and stayed with him among the people left in the land. 	Jer 40:1-6</p>
<p>Governor Jedaliah Assassinated</p>
<p>7The commanders of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah over the land and put him in charge of the men, women, and children, the poorest left in the land. 8So they and their men went to Gedaliah: Ishmael Ben-Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah; Seraiah Ben-Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite. 9Gedaliah swore to them and their men,</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to serve the Babylonians. If you stay and serve the king of Babylon, you’ll survive. 10I’ll be at Mizpah to represent you to the Babylonians that come to us. Gather in wine, summer fruit, and oil, and put them in storage containers. Live in the towns you’ve taken over.          	 Jer 40:7-10</p>
<p>11The Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and appointed Gedaliah over them. 12They came back to him in Judah and gathered a bumper crop of wine and summer fruit.</p>
<p>13Johanan and the commanders of his forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 14and said, “Are you aware that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael to kill you?” But Gedaliah didn’t believe it. 15Then Johanan spoke secretly to him,</p>
<p>“Let me go kill Ishmael; nobody will know it. Why should he take your life, and the Jews that have gathered to you, get scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”</p>
<p>16But Gedaliah said, “Don’t do that. What you’re telling me isn’t true.”     	Jer 40:11-16</p>
<p>41:1In the seventh month, Ishmael Ben-Nethaniah Ben-Elishama from the royal family and a chief officer of the king, along with 10 men, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. While they were eating there, 2Ishmael and the 10 men got up and struck down Gedaliah with the sword. 3He also struck down the Jews that were with Gedaliah as well as the Babylonian soldiers there. 		           		Jer 41:1-3</p>
<p>4The next day, before anybody knew what had happened, 580 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria with their beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed. They had grain offerings and incense to present at Yahveh’s Temple. 6Ishmael went out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come in to Gedaliah.” 7But as soon as they came in the city, he and the men killed them and threw them in a cistern. 8But 10 of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us. We have stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey stashed in the field” so he didn’t kill them. 9The cistern that Ishmael filled with corpses was the one King Asa had made because of Baasha, king of Israel. 10Then he took captive everybody left in Mizpah, the king’s daughters, and the remaining people that Nebuzaradan had put under Gedaliah’s charge. He set out with them to cross over to the Ammonites.    	  Jer 41:4-10</p>
<p>11But Johanan Ben-Kareah and his commanders heard what Ishmael had done. 12So they took all the men and went to fight him; they found him by the large pool in Gibeon. 13When the people with Ishmael saw Johanan and his commanders, they were happy; 14so the ones Ishmael had taken captive defected to Johanan. 15But Ishmael escaped from Johanan with 8 men and went to the Ammonites. 16Johanan and his commanders took from Mizpah the remnant of the people he’d recovered from Ishmael—the soldiers, the women, children, and eunuchs. 17They went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem, with the intention of going to Egypt. 18They were afraid of the Babylonians since Ishmael had struck down Gedaliah. 	  Jer 41:11-18</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Warning to Stay in Judah</p>
<p>42:1Then Johanan, his commanders, Jezaniah Ben-Hoshaiah, and the people least to greatest came 2to Jeremiah,</p>
<p>“Please honor our petition. Pray for us to Yahveh your God for this remnant. There are just a few of us left, as you can see. 3Pray that Yahveh will tell us what we should do.”</p>
<p>4Jeremiah said,</p>
<p>“I’ll pray to him and not keep back a word of his answer.”</p>
<p>5They said,</p>
<p>“May Yahveh be a true and faithful witness against us if we don’t obey his whole message. 6Whether pleasant or not, we’ll listen so things will go well with us. 					Jer 42:1-6</p>
<p>7Ten days later, a message came to Jeremiah. 8He called Johanan, his commanders, and the people,</p>
<p>9“Yahveh says, 10‘If you stay in this land, I’ll plant you and build you up, and relent from the catastrophe I’ve inflicted on you. 11Don’t be afraid; I’ll deliver you from the king of Babylon 12and show you mercy so he’ll have mercy and return you to your own land. 13But if you say, 14“We’ll go stay in Egypt, where we won’t be near war, hear the bugle, or go hungry,” [15] 16then the sword you fear will catch up with you, the famine you’re anxious about will follow soon after you arrive, and you’ll die there. 17Everybody that goes to Egypt will die by sword, famine, and disease. Nobody will survive the catastrophe I’ll bring.’”</p>
<p>Jer 42:7-17</p>
<p>18“‘As I’ve poured out my anger on the people in Jerusalem, I’ll pour it out on you in Egypt. You’ll become a curse, something abhorred, a disgrace. You won’t be coming back here.’ 19Yahveh is telling you today not to go to Egypt! 20You’re only deceiving yourselves. You said, ‘Pray to Yahveh our God; we’ll do whatever he says.’ 21But you’re not doing it. 22So understand that you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease where you want to go live.”               	 Jer 42:18-22</p>
<p>Jeremiah Taken to Egypt</p>
<p>43:1As soon as Jeremiah finished, 2Azariah Ben-Hoshaiah, Johanan Ben-Kareah, and the arrogant men told him, “You’re lying. Yahveh didn’t say not to go live in Egypt. 3Baruch Ben-Neriah is prompting you to turn us over to the Babylonians so they can execute us or exile us to Babylon.”  4-5So Johanan and the commanders took to Egypt the entire remnant that had come back from the countries where they’d been driven: 6men, women, children, the king’s daughters, everyone Nebuzaradan had left with Gedaliah, together with Jeremiah and Baruch. 7They got as far as Tahpanhes. 	          			  Jer 43:1-7</p>
<p>8Yahveh told Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,</p>
<p>9“Bury some big rocks in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes so some of the Jews can see it. 10Tell them that Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’m going to send for Nebuchadnezzar my servant and set his throne on those rocks. He’ll spread his canopy over them 11when he comes to strike Egypt. The ones destined to die will die; the ones destined for captivity will go captive, the ones destined for the sword will die by the sword. 12-13He’ll burn the temples of Egypt’s gods and shatter the obelisks in Heliopolis. He’ll wrap himself with Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself in his coat and leave unscathed.’” 			Jer 43:8-13</p>
<p>44:1A Message to Jeremiah for the Jews Living in Egypt</p>
<p>in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the Territory of Pathros</p>
<p>Disaster Because of Idolatry</p>
<p>2“Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘You’ve seen the catastrophe I brought on Jerusalem and the towns in Judah; they’re in ruins. Nobody’s living in them 3because their sinfulness made me angry.  They kept serving and burning sacrifices to gods they and their ancestors hadn’t known. 4Yet I sent them my prophets time and again, saying not to do that detestable thing. 5‘But they didn’t listen, turn from their sin, or quit burning sacrifices to other gods. 6So my anger boiled over and burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem.’ 7Now Yahveh says, ‘Why harm yourselves and slay man and woman, child and infant, from Judah and leave yourselves without even a remnant? 8You’ve made me angry with the things you’ve made with your hands and the sacrifices you’ve burned to other gods in Egypt. You’ll be destroyed and become a curse and disgrace among the nations. 9Have you forgotten your ancestors’ sinfulness, the sinfulness of Judah’s kings and their wives, the sinfulness you and your wives committed in Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 10You haven’t humbled yourselves or respected me to this day or followed the Law and statutes I set before you and your ancestors.’	 Jer 44:1-10</p>
<p>11“So Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’ll destroy everybody that’s from Judah 12and remove the remnant that’s determined to go live in Egypt. From least to greatest will meet their end here by sword or famine. They’ll become a curse, something abhorred, a disgrace. 13Like I’ve punished Jerusalem, I’ll punish Egypt with sword, famine, and disease. 14Only a few refugees will ever make it back to the land they long to see.’” 	Jer 44:11-14</p>
<p>15The men that knew their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods and the women that were standing by—including a large number from Pathros—answered Jeremiah,</p>
<p>16“We don’t have to listen to you! 17We’ll keep burning sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her like we and our ancestors, our kings and officials did in Judah and Jerusalem. We were well off then with plenty of food and no misfortune. 18Since we stopped doing that, we’ve lacked everything and met our end by sword and famine.” 19The women said, “When we were burning sacrifices to her, pouring out liquid offerings to her, and making sacrificial cakes in her image, didn’t our husbands know it?” 	  Jer 44:15-19</p>
<p>20Jeremiah responded, 21“Didn’t Yahveh know about the smoking sacrifices you and your ancestors, kings and official, and common people burned? 22He wouldn’t put up with your sinful deeds and detestable acts anymore. So your land has become a ruin, abhorred, a curse, and uninhabited. 23This catastrophe has fallen on you because you’ve burned sacrifices and sinned against him, and didn’t obey him or follow his Law, statutes, or testimonies. [24] 25You and your wives have said, ‘We’ll keep our vows to burn sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out liquid offerings to her.’ Go ahead and keep your vows! 26But listen to what Yahveh says, ‘I’ve sworn by my great name that nobody from Judah that’s in Egypt will ever invoke my name again, “As the Lord Yahveh lives . . .” 27I’ll see to it that they’re harmed. They’ll meet their end by sword and famine. 28Only a few will ever make it back to Judah. Then the remnant in Egypt will know whose message will stand, theirs or mine. 29-30This is how you’ll know: I’ll punish you here too and deliver Pharaoh Hophra [Apries] to his enemies like I turned Zedekiah over to Nebuchadnezzar.’”          	  Jer 44:20-30</p>
<p>45:1The Message Jeremiah Spoke to Baruch</p>
<p>When He’d Written It in a Scroll at Jeremiah’s Dictation</p>
<p>in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>A Message for Baruch</p>
<p>2“This is what Yahveh God of Israel says to you, Baruch: 3‘You said, “Misfortune awaits me! Yahveh has added sorrow to pain. I’m exhausted from groaning. I can’t sleep.”’ 4Tell him Yahveh says, ‘What I’ve built up I’m about to tear down. What I’ve planted I’m about to uproot—the whole land. 5Are you anticipating great things for yourself? Don’t. I’m going to bring disaster on everybody, but I’ll give you your life as a reward of war wherever you go.’”</p>

<p>3“Line up the shields and bucklers,</p>
<p>and advance for battle!</p>
<p>4Harness the horses, mount the steeds,</p>
<p>take your positions, put your helmets on!</p>
<p>Polish the spears;</p>
<p>put on the coats of mail!</p>
<p>5But what do I see?</p>
<p>The Egyptian army is panicking; they’re retreating.</p>
<p>Their soldiers are being defeated;</p>
<p>they fleeing without looking back.</p>
<p>They’re terrorized in every direction,”</p>

<p>6The fast can’t flee;</p>
<p>the strong can’t escape.</p>
<p>They’ve stumbled and fallen</p>
<p>in the north by the Euphrates.</p>
<p>7Who is this that’s flooding like the Nile,</p>
<p>like rivers out of their banks?</p>
<p>8Egypt floods like the Nile,</p>
<p>like rivers whose water surges.</p>
<p>It has said, “I’ll flood the land;</p>
<p>I’ll destroy city and residents.”</p>
<p>9Advance, horses; drive wildly, chariots,</p>
<p>so the infantry can march forward:</p>
<p>Nubia and Put, that wield the shield,</p>
<p>Lybians, that bend the bow.				Jer 46:6-9</p>
<p>10That day belongs to the Lord Yahveh of hosts,</p>
<p>a time of revenge on his enemies.</p>
<p>The sword will devour till it’s satisfied</p>
<p>and drink its fill of their blood.</p>
<p>There’ll be a slaughter for the Lord Yahveh of hosts</p>
<p>in the north by the Euphrates.</p>
<p>11Go up to Gilead and buy salve,</p>
<p>virgin daughter in Egypt!</p>
<p>In vain do you use lots of medicines;</p>
<p>they won’t heal you up.</p>
<p>12The nations have heard about your humiliation;</p>
<p>the whole world has heard your distress cry.</p>
<p>One soldier stumbles over another,</p>
<p>and they both fall together.				Jer 46:10-12</p>
<p>13The Message Yahveh Spoke to Jeremiah</p>
<p>About Nebuchadnezzar Coming to Strike Egypt</p>
<p>14“Declare it in Egypt, announce it in Migdol,</p>
<p>tell it in Memphis and Tahpanhes;</p>
<p>‘Be prepared and stand ready</p>
<p>because the sword has taken everybody around you.’</p>
<p>15Why are your soldiers prostrate?</p>
<p>Because Yahveh has beat them down.</p>
<p>16He made many stumble;</p>
<p>they have fallen over one another.</p>
<p>Then they said, ‘Get up! Let’s go back</p>
<p>to our own people, to our native land,</p>
<p>away from the oppressor’s sword.’			Jer 46:13-16</p>
<p>17They cried out there,</p>
<p>‘Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just a lot of noise;</p>
<p>he’s let the stated time pass by!’</p>
<p>18“As I live,” the King says,</p>
<p>whose name is Yahveh of Hosts,</p>
<p>“somebody is coming like Tabor among the mountains</p>
<p>or like Carmel by the sea.</p>
<p>19Get your baggage ready for exile,</p>
<p>daughter that lives in Egypt,</p>
<p>because Memphis will be desolate,</p>
<p>burned down, and uninhabited.</p>
<p>20Egypt is a pretty heifer,</p>
<p>but a horsefly is coming from the north!</p>
<p>21Egypt’s mercenaries are like grain-fed calves;</p>
<p>even they have retreated and fled together.</p>
<p>They didn’t stand their ground;</p>
<p>their catastrophe has descended on them;</p>
<p>it’s their time to be punished.				Jer 46:17-21</p>
<p>22“Egypt is as silent as a snake slithering away,</p>
<p>because its enemies are moving in on it like an army,</p>
<p>like woodsmen with axes.</p>
<p>23They’ll cut down its forest;</p>
<p>it certainly won’t exist anymore,</p>
<p>even though it’s too numerous to count.</p>
<p>24Egypt has been humbled,</p>
<p>delivered to the powerful ones up north.”	Jer 46:22-24</p>
<p>25Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “I’m going to punish Amon of Thebes, Egypt along with its gods and kings, Pharaoh and those who put their trust in him. 26I’m going to deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar and his officers, who want to kill them. Afterwards people will live in Egypt like before. 	Jer 46:25-26</p>
<p>27“But you, Jacob my servant,</p>
<p>don’t be afraid or intimidated!</p>
<p>I’ll rescue you from a long way off</p>
<p>and your descendants from where they’re captive.</p>

<p>with nobody to make him shudder.</p>
<p>28Jacob,, don’t be afraid;</p>
<p>I’m with you.</p>
<p>I’ll make a complete end to the nations</p>
<p>where I’ve driven you,</p>
<p>but I won’t make a complete end of you;</p>
<p>I’ll discipline you appropriately—</p>
<p>(not leave you unpunished).”	Jer 46:27-28</p>
<p>47:1A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</p>
<p>About the Philistines Before Pharaoh Conquered Gaza</p>
<p>2Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“A flood is swelling up from the north;</p>
<p>it will become a tsunami.</p>
<p>It’ll flood the land and everything in it,</p>
<p>the cities and those who live in them.</p>
<p>People will cry out;</p>
<p>everybody in the land will wail.</p>
<p>3Because of the noise of stallions,</p>
<p>rushing chariots, wheels,</p>
<p>fathers won’t look back for their children;</p>
<p>they’ll be too overwhelmed	Jer 47:1-3</p>
<p>4by what’s coming</p>
<p>to destroy the Philistines,</p>
<p>to cut off from Tyre and Sidon</p>
<p>every ally that’s left.</p>
<p>Yahveh will destroy the Philistines,</p>
<p>the remnant along the coast of Crete.</p>
<p>5Gaza will be bald;</p>
<p>Ashkelon will lie in ruins.</p>
<p>Remnant in the plain,</p>
<p>how long will you gash yourselves?</p>
<p>6Sword of Yahveh,</p>
<p>how long before you’re still,</p>
<p>before you go back into your sheath?</p>
<p>7But how can it be still</p>
<p>when Yahveh has ordered it to attack</p>
<p>against Ashkelon and the seacoast?”	Jer 47:4-7</p>
<p>48:1About Moab</p>
<p>Yahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, says,</p>
<p>“Misfortune awaits Nebo—laid waste;</p>
<p>Kiriathaim will be disgraced—taken;</p>
<p>the fortress will be humiliated—torn down.</p>
<p>2No more renown for Moab;</p>
<p>disaster’s in store for Heshbon</p>
<p>to cease being a nation!</p>
<p>Put Madmen to silence too;</p>
<p>chase it with a sword.	Jer 48:1-2</p>
<p>3“An outcry from Horonaim,</p>
<p>‘Devastation and destruction!’</p>
<p>4Moab’s to be destroyed;</p>
<p>its little ones cry out in terror.</p>
<p>5At the ascent to Luhith,</p>
<p>Moab’s refugees go up crying;</p>
<p>at the descent to Horonaim</p>
<p>they’ve heard the anguished cry.</p>
<p>6Run, save yourselves</p>
<p>so you can be a juniper in the countryside.	Jer 48:3-6</p>
<p>7Because you trusted in your wealth and skill,</p>
<p>you’ll be captured too.</p>
<p>Chemosh will go into exile</p>
<p>with his priests and officials.</p>
<p>8A destroyer will come on every city;</p>
<p>no city will escape.</p>
<p>The valley will perish;</p>
<p>the plateau will be destroyed like Yahveh said.</p>
<p>9Give Moab wings so it can fly away;</p>
<p>its towns will be desolate without residents.</p>
<p>10A curse on the one that does Yahveh’s work halfheartedly;</p>
<p>a curse on the one that restrains his sword from blood.	Jer 48:7-10</p>
<p>11“Moab hasn’t been disturbed since it was founded;</p>
<p>its dregs haven’t been unsettled.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been poured from jug to jug—</p>
<p>or carried into exile.</p>
<p>So it still tastes clean;</p>
<p>its aroma has body.</p>
<p>12“But the times coming,” Yahveh says, “when I’ll send it to the ones that upset jugs, and they’ll turn it upside down. They’ll empty its jugs and shatter its jars. 13Moab will be disillusioned with Chemosh like Israel lost confidence in Bethel.</p>
<p>14How can you claim to be great soldiers,</p>
<p>brave men in battle?</p>
<p>15Moab will be destroyed;</p>
<p>its towns will be under attack;</p>
<p>its elite young men will go down in slaughter,”</p>
<p>the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts</p>
<p>16“Moab’s disaster is on its way;</p>
<p>its destruction will be swift.</p>
<p>17Mourn for it, you that live near it,</p>
<p>you that know its name.</p>
<p>Say, ‘How the powerful scepter has broken</p>
<p>that splendid staff!’	Jer 48:11-17</p>
<p>18“Come down from your glory</p>
<p>and sit on parched dirt,</p>
<p>people in Dibon;</p>
<p>the one that destroyed Moab</p>
<p>is coming after you.</p>
<p>He’ll destroy your fortresses.</p>
<p>19Stand by the road and watch,</p>
<p>people in Aroer;</p>
<p>ask him that’s fleeing and her that’s escaping,</p>
<p>‘What’s happened?’</p>
<p>20‘Moab has been disgraced;</p>
<p>it’s shattered.</p>
<p>Wail and cry out;</p>
<p>declare by the Arnon,</p>
<p>‘Moab’s been destroyed.’	Jer 48:18-20</p>
<p>21“Judgment has also come on the plateau—on Holon and Jahzah, on Mephaath, 22Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 23on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 24on Kerioth, Bozrah, and the towns in Moab near and far. 25Moab’s horn has been cut off and his arm broken,” Yahveh says.</p>
<p>26“Get him drunk because he’s gotten arrogant toward Yahveh. So Moab will wallow in his own vomit, something to be ridiculed. 27Wasn’t Israel someone you ridiculed? Was he a thief caught stealing? Every time you spoke about him, you shook your head in scorn.	     Jer 48:21-27</p>
<p>28“Leave the towns and live in caves, people in Moab;</p>
<p>be like pigeons nesting in the cliffs along the gorge.</p>
<p>29We’ve heard about Moab’s great pride,</p>
<p>his haughtiness, arrogance, and self-exaltation.</p>
<p>30I know his insolence,” Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“but it’s pointless;</p>
<p>his idle boasts are empty claims.</p>
<p>31So I’ll wail can cry out for Moab;</p>
<p>I’ll moan for the people of Kir-heres/hareseth.</p>
<p>32“More than for Jazer,</p>
<p>I’ll weep for you, vine of Sibmah!</p>
<p>Your branches once reached the sea,</p>
<p>the Sea of Jazer [Dead Sea].</p>
<p>The destroyer has destroyed</p>
<p>your summer fruits and grape harvest.	Jer 48:28-32</p>
<p>33So happiness and joy have been taken away</p>
<p>from Moab’s fertile fields.</p>
<p>I’ve made wine quit flowing from the winepresses;</p>
<p>nobody will tread them with shouts of joy;</p>
<p>the shouts won’t be shouts of joy.</p>
<p>34“From Heshbon, Elealeh, and Jahaz, from Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath-shelishiyah, they’ve raised their voice; because even the water in Nimrim will dry up. 35I’ll put an end to Moab that offers sacrifice on the high place and burns incense to its god. 36So my heart wails like a flute for Moab and the people in Kir-heres. They’ve lost the abundance it produced. 37Every head’s bald; every beard’s shaved off. Everybody has gashes on their hands and burlap around their waists. 38There’s mourning everywhere in Moab’s streets and on its housetops, because I’ve broken it like a pot nobody cares about. 39How shattered it is! How they wail! How Moab has turned its back in humiliation. So it’s something to laugh at, an object of terror to everyone around it.”	   Jer 48:33-39</p>
<p>40Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“One will fly fast like an eagle</p>
<p>and spread its wings against Moab.</p>
<p>41Its towns will be taken,</p>
<p>its fortresses seized.</p>
<p>So the hearts of the strong men of Moab</p>
<p>will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</p>
<p>42Moab will be destroyed from being a people</p>
<p>because it’s become arrogant toward Yahveh.</p>
<p>43Terror, pit, and snare are coming on you.</p>
<p>44The one that runs from the terror</p>
<p>will fall into a pit.</p>
<p>The one that climbs out of the pit</p>
<p>will step in a snare.</p>
<p>That’s what I’ll bring on Moab</p>
<p>when I punish it. 	Jer 48:40-44</p>
<p>45“Refugees will stand in the shadow of Heshbon</p>
<p>with no strength to flee any farther;</p>
<p>fire has erupted from Heshbon,</p>
<p>a flame from Sihon.</p>
<p>46Misfortune awaits you, Moab!</p>
<p>The people of Chemosh will perish;</p>
<p>your sons will be taken captive,</p>
<p>your daughters too.</p>
<p>47Yet later I’ll restore Moab’s fortunes.”</p>
<p>That’s the judgment on Moab.	Jer 48:45-47</p>
<p>49:1About Ammon</p>
<p>Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Doesn’t Israel have any descendants?</p>
<p>Doesn’t he have an heir?</p>
<p>Why then has Malcam/Milcom taken possession of Gad,</p>
<p>and his people settled in its towns?</p>
<p>2The time’s coming</p>
<p>when I’ll raise the battle cry</p>
<p>against Rabbah of the Ammonites.</p>
<p>It’ll be a desolate mound;</p>
<p>its towns will be burned,</p>
<p>Then Israel will expel the ones that expelled him.	 Jer 49:1-2</p>
<p>3“Wail, Heshbon, because Ai is destroyed!</p>
<p>Cry out, young women of Rabbah;</p>
<p>put on burlap and lament;</p>
<p>run back and forth inside the walls.</p>
<p>Malcam/Milcom will go into exile</p>
<p>along with his priests and officials.</p>
<p>4Why do you brag about your fertile valleys?</p>
<p>Your valleys are flowing away, unfaithful daughter</p>
<p>that trusts in her treasures and says,</p>
<p>‘Who’s going to attack me?’</p>
<p>5I’m going to bring terror on you</p>
<p>from every direction.</p>
<p>Every one of you will be driven out headlong</p>
<p>with nobody to round up the refugees.</p>
<p>6Yet later I’ll restore Ammon’s fortunes.”			Jer 49:3-6</p>
<p>7About Edom</p>
<p>Yahveh of hosts says,</p>
<p>“Is there no wisdom in Teman?</p>
<p>Has good advice disappeared from the prudent?</p>
<p>Has its wisdom declined?</p>
<p>8Turn around, run away,</p>
<p>live deep in the deserts, people in Dedan,</p>
<p>because I’ll bring disaster on Esau</p>
<p>when I punish him.</p>
<p>9If grape-gatherers come to you,</p>
<p>wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?</p>
<p>If thieves came at night,</p>
<p>wouldn’t they destroy only enough for themselves?	Jer 49:7-9</p>
<p>10But I’ll strip bare Esau’s land</p>
<p>and expose its hiding places</p>
<p>so its people can’t hide.</p>
<p>Its inhabitants will be killed,</p>
<p>relatives and friends;</p>
<p>its land won’t be alive anymore.</p>
<p>11But leave its orphans behind; I’ll keep them alive;</p>
<p>its widows will need to depend on me.”	Jer 49:10-11</p>
<p>12Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“If the ones that didn’t deserve the cup have to drink it, will you be let off? You will drink it! 13I’ve sworn by myself that Bozrah will be something to abhor, a disgrace, a ruin, a curse. Its towns will lie in permanent ruins.”</p>
<p>14I’ve heard a message from Yahveh;</p>
<p>a messenger is going among the nations and says,</p>
<p>“Gather together and attack it;</p>
<p>rise up for battle!”</p>
<p>15I’ll make you small among the nations;</p>
<p>people will despise you.</p>
<p>16The terror you inspired</p>
<p>has deceived you into an arrogant attitude,</p>
<p>you that live in the clefts of the rock,</p>
<p>that occupy the height of a hill.</p>
<p>Though you make your nest high like an eagle’s,</p>
<p>I’ll bring you down from there. 				Jer 49:12-16</p>
<p>17“Edom will be something to abhor. Everybody that goes past it will be horrified and hiss at its wounds. 18Like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, and its neighbors, nobody will live there. 19Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I’ll chase everybody away from it. I’ll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me.  20So listen to Yahveh’s plan for Edom, his intentions for Teman. They’ll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 21The ground will shake at their downfall. The outcry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea. 22It’s enemy will soar high and swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom’s mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor.”	      	Jer 49:17-22</p>
<p>23About Damascus</p>
<p>“Hamath and Arpad are in panic;</p>
<p>they’ve heard bad news.</p>
<p>They’re disheartened;</p>
<p>their anxiety rages like a sea</p>
<p>that can’t be quieted.</p>
<p>24Damascus is helpless;</p>
<p>Its people have fled.</p>
<p>Panic, anguish, and pain have gripped it</p>
<p>like a woman in labor.</p>
<p>25How that famous city has been deserted,</p>
<p>the city of my joy!</p>
<p>26Its young men will fall in its streets;</p>
<p>its soldiers will go silent that day,”</p>
<p>Yahveh of Hosts says.</p>
<p>27“I’ll set fire to the walls of Damascus</p>
<p>that will burn down Benhadad’s fortified towers.”	Jer 49:23-27</p>
<p>28About Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor</p>
<p>That Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon Defeated</p>
<p>“Attack Kedar;</p>
<p>destroy the people from the east.</p>
<p>29They’ll take away their tents and flocks,</p>
<p>their ornate tent curtains, goods, and camels.</p>
<p>They’ll cry out,</p>
<p>‘There’s terror everywhere!’</p>
<p>30Run! Flee! Live in deep caves,</p>
<p>people in Hazor,” 			Yahveh says.		Jer 49:28-30a</p>
<p>“Nebuchadnezzar has devised a plan against you</p>
<p>and plotted a scheme:</p>
<p>31to attack a nation that’s at ease,</p>
<p>that lives securely,</p>
<p>that doesn’t have gates or bars,</p>
<p>that lives apart by itself.</p>
<p>32Their camels will be plunder;</p>
<p>their livestock will be spoil.</p>
<p>I’ll scatter to the winds</p>
<p>those who clip the hair on their temples</p>
<p>and bring catastrophe from every direction,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.</p>
<p>33“Hazor will be a haunt for jackals,</p>
<p>a permanent wasteland.</p>
<p>Nobody will live there.”					Jer 49:30b-33</p>
<p>34A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About Elam</p>
<p>at the Beginning of the Reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah</p>
<p>35“Yahveh of Hosts says,</p>
<p>‘I’m going to break the bow of Elam,</p>
<p>the main weapon of their power.</p>
<p>36I’m going to bring on Elam the four winds</p>
<p>from the four ends of the sky.</p>
<p>I’ll scatter them to all those winds;</p>
<p>there won’t be any nation</p>
<p>the refugees from Elam can flee to.</p>
<p>37I’ll scatter Elam ahead the enemies</p>
<p>that want to kill them.</p>
<p>I’ll bring catastrophe on them,</p>
<p>my fierce anger.</p>
<p>I’ll send out the sword after them</p>
<p>till I’ve consumed them all.</p>
<p>38Then I’ll set my throne in Elam</p>
<p>and destroy its king and officials.</p>
<p>39Yet later I’ll restore Elam’s fortunes.’”			Jer 49:34-39</p>
<p>50:1A Message Yahveh Spoke About Babylon,</p>
<p>the Land of the Babylonians, Through the Prophet Jeremiah:</p>
<p>2“Announce it among the nations;</p>
<p>hoist a standard everyone can see:</p>
<p>‘Babylon has been captured,</p>
<p>Bel humbled,</p>
<p>Marduk shattered,</p>
<p>its images disgraced,</p>
<p>its idols smashed.’</p>
<p>3A nation has come down against it from the north. It will make the land something to abhor; nobody will live there. People and animals will wander off.</p>
<p>4“At that time, Israel and Judah will return home. They’ll go along weeping, looking for Yahveh their God. 5They’ll ask how to get to Zion and turn in that direction to join Yahveh in an everlasting covenant they won’t forget.</p>
<p>Jer 50:1-5</p>
<p>6“My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds had led them astray and abandoned them on the mountains. They’ve gone along from mountain to hill and lost track of their resting place. 7Everyone that came at them has devoured them. Their enemies have said, ‘We didn’t do anything wrong; they’d sinned against Yahveh, where goodness lives, who was their ancestors’ hope.’</p>
<p>8“Wander away from Babylon and leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like male goats at the head of the flock. 9I’m going to bring against Babylon a horde of great nations from farther north. They’ll draw up their battle lines and capture it. Their arrows will fly from skilled soldiers that won’t come back empty-handed. 10Babylonia will become plunder. Those who plunder it will gather as much as they want,” 	Yahveh says. 	Jer 50:6-10</p>
<p>11“Though you’re happy and jubilant now,</p>
<p>you that plundered my permanent possession,</p>
<p>though you run around like a heifer on grass</p>
<p>and neigh like a stallion,</p>
<p>12your mother will be ashamed;</p>
<p>she that bore you will be humiliated.</p>
<p>She’ll be the least of the nations,</p>
<p>a parched wilderness, a desert.</p>
<p>13Because of Yahveh’s anger,</p>
<p>Babylon will be empty,</p>
<p>completely desolate.</p>
<p>Everybody that goes past it will be appalled</p>
<p>and gasp at its wounds.</p>
<p>14Draw up your battle lines on every side of Babylon,</p>
<p>you that bend the bow.</p>
<p>Shoot at it; don’t spare your arrows</p>
<p>because it’s sinned against Yahveh.			Jer 50:11-14</p>
<p>15Raise your battle cry at it everywhere!</p>
<p>It has given up; its pillars have fallen;</p>
<p>its walls have been torn down.</p>
<p>This is Yahveh’s revenge:</p>
<p>carry out that revenge on it;</p>
<p>do to it what it’s done to others.</p>
<p>16Eliminate the sower from Babylon</p>
<p>and the one that swings the sickle at harvest time.</p>
<p>Each one will retreat from the sword</p>
<p>back to their own people;</p>
<p>they’ll flee to their own land.	Jer 50:15-16</p>
<p>17“Israel is like a flock driven away and scattered by lions. The king of Assyria devoured it first. Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, broke its bones. 18So Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m going to punish Babylon like I punished Assyria. 19I’ll bring Israel back to his pasture so he can graze on Carmel and Bashan. He’ll eat as much as he wants in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 20At that time, they’ll search for Israel’s iniquity and Judah’s sin, but they won’t find any. That’s because I’ll pardon the ones I’m leaving as a remnant.’          		  Jer 50:17-20</p>
<p>21“Go up against the land of Merathaim</p>
<p>and the people in Pekod.</p>
<p>Slay and destroy them,” Yahveh says.</p>
<p>“Do everything I’ve commanded you.</p>
<p>22The noise of battle is in the land</p>
<p>and great destruction.</p>
<p>23How the sledgehammer of the whole world</p>
<p>has been cut off and broken!</p>
<p>How Babylon has become</p>
<p>something to abhor among the countries!	Jer 50:21-23</p>
<p>24I set a snare for you and caught you, Babylon,</p>
<p>while you weren’t watching.</p>
<p>You’ve been found and captured</p>
<p>because you’ve engaged Yahveh in conflict.”</p>
<p>25Yahvehhas opened his armory</p>
<p>and brought out his weapons of wrath.</p>
<p>This is his work against the Babylonians.</p>
<p>26Attack it from the farthest border;</p>
<p>open your arms, pile it in heaps,</p>
<p>destroy it.</p>
<p>Don’t leave anything.</p>
<p>27Kill its young bulls with the sword;</p>
<p>let them go down to slaughter!</p>
<p>Misfortune awaits them because their time has come,</p>
<p>the time for their punishment.</p>
<p>28There’s the sound of fugitives from Babylon;</p>
<p>it speaks of Yahveh’s revenge for his Temple.		Jer 50:24-28</p>
<p>29“Summon many nations against Babylon,</p>
<p>every one that bends the bow;</p>
<p>camp against it all the way around;</p>
<p>don’t let anyone escape.</p>
<p>Repay it according to its work;</p>
<p>do to it everything it has done,</p>
<p>because it’s been arrogant against Yahveh,</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>30So its young men will fall in its streets;</p>
<p>its fighting men will fall silent then.</p>
<p>31I’m against you, arrogant one;</p>
<p>it’s time for me to punish you.</p>
<p>32The arrogant one will stumble and fall</p>
<p>with nobody to help him up.</p>
<p>I’ll set fire to his towns</p>
<p>and consume his surroundings.”	Jer 50:29-32</p>
<p>33Yahveh of hosts says,</p>
<p>“Israel is oppressed,</p>
<p>Judah as well.</p>
<p>All who have taken them captive</p>
<p>have held onto them fast</p>
<p>and won’t let go.</p>
<p>34Their redeemer is strong;</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh of Hosts.</p>
<p>He’ll certainly argue their case</p>
<p>and give rest to their land;</p>
<p>he’ll bring unrest to the people in Babylon.</p>
<p>35A sword against them,</p>
<p>their officials and wise men!       				Jer 50:33-35</p>
<p>36A sword against their fortunetellers</p>
<p>so they’ll become fools!</p>
<p>A sword against their fighting men</p>
<p>so they’ll be shattered!</p>
<p>37A sword against their horses and chariots,</p>
<p>against the foreigners in it</p>
<p>so they’ll become women!</p>
<p>A sword against its treasures</p>
<p>so they’ll be plundered!</p>
<p>38A drought to dry up its water</p>
<p>because it’s a land of idols,</p>
<p>and they’re crazy about their idols</p>
<p>39“So the desert animals will live there along with jackals and owls. Nobody will ever live in it again 40as when I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors. 		Jer 50:39-40</p>
<p>41“People are coming from the north;</p>
<p>a big empire with many kings</p>
<p>will rise up from the remote parts of the earth.</p>
<p>42They take hold of bow and javelin;</p>
<p>they’re cruel with no mercy.</p>
<p>They roar like the sea; they ride on horses,</p>
<p>arrayed against you like soldiers for battle, Babylon.</p>
<p>43The king of Babylon has heard the reports about them,</p>
<p>and his hands hang limp;</p>
<p>anguish has seized him,</p>
<p>agony like a woman in childbirth.	      Jer 50:41-43</p>
<p>44“Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I’ll chase everyone away from it in an instant. I’ll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me?”</p>
<p>45So listen to what Yahveh has planned for Babylon and the Babylonians. They’ll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 46At the shout, “Babylon’s been captured!” the ground will shake. The nations will hear the shout. 	Jer 50:44-46</p>
<p>51:1Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m going to stir up the spirit of the destroyer</p>
<p>against Babylon and the people in Leb-kamai.</p>
<p>2I’ll send foreign winnowers to Babylon</p>
<p>to devastate its land.</p>
<p>On every side they’ll oppose it</p>
<p>at the time of its catastrophe.</p>
<p>3Let the defending archer not bend his bow</p>
<p>or stand in his coat of mail.</p>
<p>Don’t spare the young men;</p>
<p>devote the whole army to destruction.</p>
<p>4They’ll fall down dead in the land of the Babylonians,</p>
<p>pierced through in their streets.”	Jer 51:1-4</p>
<p>5God, Yahveh of Hosts,</p>
<p>has not abandoned Israel and Judah</p>
<p>even though their land is full of guilt</p>
<p>in front of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>6Escape from Babylon;</p>
<p>save yourselves!</p>
<p>Don’t get destroyed in its punishment;</p>
<p>this is Yahveh’s revenge;</p>
<p>he’s going to render retribution to it.</p>
<p>7Babylon has been a gold cup in Yahveh’s hand,</p>
<p>intoxicating the whole region.</p>
<p>The nations have drunk its wine;</p>
<p>so they’re acting crazy.	Jer 51:5-7</p>
<p>8All of a sudden Babylon has fallen!</p>
<p>Wail for it!</p>
<p>Bring salve to heal its pain.</p>
<p>9We tried to heal Babylon, but it didn’t heal;</p>
<p>so abandon it and get to your own country.</p>
<p>Its judgment has reached heaven;</p>
<p>it towers as high as the sky.</p>
<p>10Yahveh has brought about our vindication;</p>
<p>let’s recount in Zion the work of Yahveh our God!		Jer 51:8-10</p>
<p>11Sharpen the arrows, fill the quills!</p>
<p>Yahveh has stirred up the kings of the Medes</p>
<p>to destroy Babylon.</p>
<p>It’s Yahveh’s revenge for his Temple.</p>
<p>12Raise up a standard against the walls of Babylon;</p>
<p>post a strong guard, station sentries, set men in ambush!</p>
<p>It’s Yahveh’s revenge for his Temple.</p>
<p>13You that live by lots of water, abundant in treasures,</p>
<p>your end has come; your life cord’s been cut.</p>
<p>14Yahveh of Hosts has sworn by himself:</p>
<p>“I’ll fill you with soldiers like locusts;</p>
<p>they’ll raise shouts of victory over you.”	Jer 51:11-14</p>
<p>A Hymn of Praise to Yahveh</p>
<p>15He’s the One that made the earth by his power,</p>
<p>that established the world by his wisdom,</p>
<p>that stretched out the sky with his intelligence.</p>
<p>16When he speaks, there’s thunder in the rain above;</p>
<p>he makes clouds rise up from the horizon,</p>
<p>makes lightning for the rain,</p>
<p>and brings wind out of his storehouses.</p>
<p>17Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;</p>
<p>goldsmiths are disgraced by their idols</p>
<p>because their molten images misrepresent;</p>
<p>they can’t even breathe.</p>
<p>18They’re worthless objects to ridicule;</p>
<p>when they’re punished, they perish.</p>
<p>19Jacob’s portion is not like theirs.</p>
<p>His God has made everything;</p>
<p>Israel is his inheritance;</p>
<p>his name is Yahveh of Hosts. 				Jer 51:15-19</p>
<p>Babylon’s Destruction</p>
<p>20“You’re my battle-ax and weapon;</p>
<p>I’ll shatter nations with you;</p>
<p>I’ll destroy kingdoms.</p>
<p>21I’ll break horse and rider in pieces,</p>
<p>22chariot and occupant,</p>
<p>man and woman, young and old.</p>
<p>23With you I’ll destroy shepherd and flock,</p>
<p>farmer and ox team,</p>
<p>governors and prefects.	Jer 51:20-23</p>
<p>24“I’ll repay Babylon and the Babylonians</p>
<p>for the devastation they’ve brought on Zion</p>
<p>right in my presence,” 	Yahveh says.</p>
<p>25“I’m against you, destroying mountain</p>
<p>that destroys the world.</p>
<p>I’ll reach out against you</p>
<p>and roll you down from the crags</p>
<p>and make you a burned-out ruble.</p>
<p>26They won’t reuse from you</p>
<p>a cornerstone or foundation stone.</p>
<p>You’ll be as permanent wasteland.”	Jer 51:24-26</p>
<p>27Set up a standard in the land;</p>
<p>blow the bugle among the nations.</p>
<p>Consecrate the nations against it;</p>
<p>summon Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.</p>
<p>Appoint a marshal against it;</p>
<p>bring on horses like bristling locusts.</p>
<p>28Prepare the nations against it,</p>
<p>the kings of the Medes,</p>
<p>their governors and officials,</p>
<p>and every land they control.</p>
<p>29So the ground shakes</p>
<p>because Yahveh’s intention against Babylon stands:</p>
<p>to make it an uninhabited wasteland.	Jer 51:27-29</p>
<p>30The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting;</p>
<p>they’re staying in the barracks.</p>
<p>They’ve used up their strength</p>
<p>and become like women.</p>
<p>Their houses are on fire;</p>
<p>the bars of its gates are broken.</p>
<p>31One courier runs to another,</p>
<p>one ambassador runs to another</p>
<p>to tell the king of Babylon</p>
<p>his city’s been captured from end to end.</p>
<p>32They’ve seized the fords;</p>
<p>they’ve burned the fortifications;</p>
<p>the army is in panic.	Jer 51:30-32</p>
<p>33Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,</p>
<p>“Babylon is like a threshing floor tamped firm;</p>
<p>in a little while threshing will begin on it.	Jer 51:33</p>
<p>34“Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,</p>
<p>has devoured me and crushed me.</p>
<p>He has set me down like an empty cup,</p>
<p>swallowed me like a monster,</p>
<p>filled his stomach with my delicacies,</p>
<p>and rinsed me out.”</p>
<p>35Zion will say,</p>
<p>“May the violence done to us</p>
<p>be done to Babylon.”</p>
<p>Jerusalem will say,</p>
<p>“May my blood be on the people in Babylon.”</p>
<p>36So Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll argue your case</p>
<p>and take full revenge for you;</p>
<p>I’ll dry up its River</p>
<p>and dry up its oasis.	Jer 51:34-36</p>
<p>37Babylon will be a pile of rubble, a den for jackals,</p>
<p>something to abhor and gasp at;</p>
<p>nobody will live there.</p>
<p>38They’ll roar together like young lions;</p>
<p>they’ll growl like lion cubs.</p>
<p>39When they get hungry,</p>
<p>I’ll serve them their banquet.</p>
<p>I’ll make them drunk till they pass out</p>
<p>and put them to sleep forever.</p>
<p>40I’ll bring them down like lambs to slaughter,</p>
<p>like rams and male goats for sacrifice.	Jer 51:37-40</p>
<p>41“How Sheshak has been captured!</p>
<p>What the whole world praised has been seized!</p>
<p>How Babylon has become something to abhor among the nations!</p>
<p>42The River has flooded Babylon,</p>
<p>swamped it in crashing waves.</p>
<p>43Its towns have become something to abhor,</p>
<p>a parched land, a desert,</p>
<p>a land where nobody lives</p>
<p>and nobody visits.</p>
<p>44I’ll punish Bel in Babylon</p>
<p>and make him vomit what he’s swallowed.</p>
<p>The nations won’t stream to him anymore;</p>
<p>even Babylon’s walls have fallen down!	Jer 51:41-44</p>
<p>45“Get out of there, my people!</p>
<p>save yourselves from myY fury!</p>
<p>46Don’t let your heart faint;</p>
<p>don’t be afraid at the report in the land</p>
<p>when a report comes one year,</p>
<p>another one comes a year later,</p>
<p>and violence is in the land</p>
<p>with ruler against ruler.</p>
<p>47So the time’s coming</p>
<p>when I’ll punish the idols in Babylon.</p>
<p>Its whole land will be disgraced;</p>
<p>its slain will fall inside it.</p>
<p>48Earth and sky and everything in them</p>
<p>will shout for joy over Babylon,</p>
<p>because its destroyers will come from the north,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.			Jer 51:45-48</p>
<p>49Babylon will fall in payment for the slain in Israel</p>
<p>and the whole region.</p>
<p>50You that have escaped the sword,</p>
<p>leave! Don’t stay!</p>
<p>Remember Yahveh from afar</p>
<p>and keep Jerusalem in your mind.</p>
<p>51We’re ashamed because we’ve heard reproof;</p>
<p>disgrace shows on our faces</p>
<p>because foreigners have entered</p>
<p>the holy places in Yahveh’s Temple.	Jer 51:49-51</p>
<p>52“So the time’s coming</p>
<p>when I’ll punish its idols,</p>
<p>and the mortally wounded will groan throughout its land.</p>
<p>53Even if Babylon ascends to the sky</p>
<p>and fortifies its lofty fortress,</p>
<p>destroyers will come to it from me,”</p>
<p>Yahveh says.			Jer 51:52-53</p>
<p>54There’s an outcry from Babylon,</p>
<p>great destruction in the land of the Babylonians!</p>
<p>55Yahveh is going to destroy it</p>
<p>and quiet its loud noise.</p>
<p>The waves of enemies will roar,</p>
<p>and the noise from their uproar will increase.</p>
<p>56The destroyer is coming against Babylon;</p>
<p>he’ll capture its strong men.</p>
<p>Yahveh is a God that exacts recompense;</p>
<p>he’ll fully repay.</p>
<p>57“I’ll make its officials and wise men drunk,</p>
<p>its governors, officers, and strong men too;</p>
<p>they’ll sleep forever,”</p>
<p>the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts.</p>
<p>58“Babylon’s thick walls will be completely torn down,</p>
<p>its massive gates set on fire;</p>
<p>so the nations will have worked for nothing;</p>
<p>the builders will have worn themselves out</p>
<p>only to get their work burned.” 	Jer 51:54-58</p>
<p>59The Message Jeremiah Gave to Seraiah Ben-Neriah,</p>
<p>Grandson of Mahseiah, When He Went with Zedekiah, King of Judah,</p>
<p>to Babylon in the Fourth Year of His Reign</p>
<p>(Seraiah Was Quartermaster.)</p>
<p>60Jeremiah wrote in one scroll the catastrophe to come on Babylon. 61He told Seraiah,</p>
<p>“As soon as you get to Babylon, read this message out loud: 62‘Yahveh, you’ve promised to cut this place off so nothing will live in it, people or animals, so it’ll be a permanent desolation.’ 63As soon as you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. 64Say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink and not float back up because of the catastrophe I’m going to bring on it. The workers will have worn themselves out for nothing.’”</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s message ends here. 	Jer 51:59-64</p>
<p>The Fall of Jerusalem</p>
<p>52:1Zedekiah was 21 when he became king and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal Bat-Jeremiah of Libnah. 2He did all the evil Jehoiakim had done. 3Because of Yahveh’s anger over that, he put Jerusalem and Judah out of his presence.</p>
<p>Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon. 4The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar came with his army, set up camp against Jerusalem, and built a siege wall around it. 5The city lay under siege till Zedekiah’s eleventh year. 6The ninth day, fourth month, the famine was so severe in the city that the people didn’t have any food left. 7Then they broke into the city, and the fighting men fled at night through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden, even though the Babylonians were all around the city. They went toward the Arabah, 8but the Babylonian army overtook the king in the plains by Jericho. His whole army scattered from him. 9They captured him and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 10He executed Zedekiah’s sons right in front of him and executed the officials of Judah. 11Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze bonds, and took him to Babylon. He put him in prison till his death.	      Jer 52:1-11</p>
<p>The Temple Burned</p>
<p>12The tenth day, fifth month, nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the king of Babylon’s bodyguard, came to Jerusalem. 13He burned Yahveh’s Temple, the king’s palace, the houses in Jerusalem, and the important buildings. 14The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 15Nebuzaradan took into exile some of the poorest people, people left in the city, those who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. 16He left some destitute to dress grapevines and plow fields.                    	Jer 52:12-16</p>
<p>17The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze pillars in front of Yahveh’s Temple, the stands, and the bronze sea; and carried their bronze to Babylon. 18They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, basins, pans—all the bronze articles for the Temple service. 19The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, firepans, basins, pots, lampstands, dishes for incense and liquid offering bowls, what was gold and fine silver. 20The 2 pillars, the sea, the 12 bronze bulls under the sea, and the stands King Solomon had made for Yahveh’s Temple—the bronze in all those items was too much to weigh. 21Each pillar was 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference—4 fingers thick and hollow. 22The bronze capital on each pillar was 7½ft high, with bronze network and pomegranates all around it. 23There were 96 pomegranates on the sides—100 altogether. 				     			Jer 52:17-23</p>
<p>24Nebuzaradan took</p>
<p>Seraiah the chief priest,</p>
<p>Zephaniah the second priest,</p>
<p>three of the Temple’s doorkeepers,</p>
<p>25one city official that oversaw the fighting men,</p>
<p>seven of the king’s council they found in the city,</p>
<p>the secretary to the commander of the army who mustered the people, and</p>
<p>60 men they found in the city.</p>
<p>26He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 27and the king put them to death there in Hamath. So they led Judah away into exile.</p>
<p>28These are the people Nebuchadnezzar carried away:</p>
<p>in his seventh year, 3,023 Jews;</p>
<p>29in his eighteenth year, 832 from Jerusalem;</p>
<p>30in his twenty-third year Nebuzaradan took away, 745 Jews:</p>
<p>4,600 in all.	   Jer 52:24-30</p>
<p>Jehoiachin Released</p>
<p>31The twenty-fifth day, twelfth month, thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin’s exile, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, was gracious to Jehoiachin and brought him out of prison. 32He was kind to him and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings that were with him in Babylon. 33So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals with the king regularly 34till his death.          	  Jer 52:31-34</p>
