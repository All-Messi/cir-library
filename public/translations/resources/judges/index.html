<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>Partial Conquest of Remaining Territory</p>
<p>1:1After Joshua died, the people asked Yahveh, “Who will go up first to fight the Canaanites?”</p>
<p>2He said, “Judah. I’ll deliver the land to him.”</p>
<p>3Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Go with me to my territory to fight the Canaanites, and I’ll go with you to yours.”</p>
<p>So he went with him.</p>
<p>4Judah went up and Yahveh delivered 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites to him at Bezek. 5-6They attacked Adoni-bezek 6and he fled, but they caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 7He said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. God has done to me what I’ve done.” They took him to Jerusalem, where he died.</p>
<p>8Judah fought Jerusalem and took it. They struck it with the sword and set it on fire. 9Then they went down to fight the Canaanites in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills. 10Judah attacked the Canaanites in Hebron (called Kiriath-arba before) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.	   Jud 1:1-10</p>
<p>11From there they attacked Debir (called Kiriath-sepher before). 12Caleb said, “Whoever takes Keriath-sepher, I’ll give my daughter Achsah as a wife.” 13Othniel Ben-Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, and Caleb gave her to him. 14When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked, “What do you want for yourself?”</p>
<p>15“A present. Since you’ve put me in the Negev, give me springs.”</p>
<p>Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.</p>
<p>16The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, moved from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad, and settled with the people. 17Judah went with Simeon and defeated the Canaanites in Zephath and destroyed it; so the city was called Hormah. 18Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, and their territories. Yahveh was with Judah, and he gained possession of the hill country, but he couldn’t drive out the people in the plain; they had iron chariots. 20They gave Hebron to Caleb, like Moses had said. He drove out Anak’s three sons. 	Jud 1:11-20</p>
<p>21But Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites in Jerusalem; they still live there among them.</p>
<p>22Joseph went up against Bethel and Yahveh was with them. 23Joseph’s house spied out Bethel (called Luz before). 24The spies saw a man coming out of the city, and said, “Show us how to get into the city, and we’ll have mercy you.” 25He showed them. They struck it with the sword, but they let him and his family go. 26He went to the Hittites and built a city he called Luz. That’s still its name.</p>
<p>27Manasseh didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, or Megiddo and their villages. The Canaanites kept living there. 28When Israel grew stronger, they put them to forced labor; but they didn’t completely drive them out. 	  Jud 1:21-28</p>
<p>29Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites in Gezer, who kept living among them.</p>
<p>30Zebulun didn’t drive out the people in Kitron or Nahalol, who kept living among them, subject to forced labor.</p>
<p>31Asher didn’t drive out the people in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. 32They lived among the Canaanites.</p>
<p>33Naphtali didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shemesh or Beth-anath. They lived among those Canaanites, who became forced labor.</p>
<p>34The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country. They wouldn’t let them come down to the plain. 35They went on living in Mount Heres. Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But Joseph’s house pressed heavily on them and subjected them to forced labor. 36The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and up.	 Jud 1:29-36</p>
<p>The Angel of the Lord Comes to Bokim</p>
<p>2:1The angel of Yahveh went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said,</p>
<p>“I brought you up from Egypt to this land that I swore to give your ancestors. I said, ‘I’ll never break my covenant with you. 2Don’t make any covenant with the people here. Tear down their altars.’ But you haven’t obeyed me. 3So I won’t drive them out. They’ll become adversaries, and their gods will be a snare to you.”</p>
<p>4When the angel of Yahveh told the people that, they “cried” out loud. 5They called the place Bochim and sacrificed to Yahveh there.</p>
<p>The Death of Joshua</p>
<p>6When Joshua dismissed the people to their inheritances, 7they served Yahveh while he was alive and the elders that outlived him, who’d seen Yahveh’s great work for Israel. 8He died at 110. 9They buried him in his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 10That whole generation passed on to their ancestors, and another generation grew up that hadn’t known Yahveh or seen his work for Israel. 	Jud 2:1-10</p>
<p>Disobedience and Defeat</p>
<p>11The people did sin and served the images of Baal 13and Ashtoreth 12and forsook their ancestors’ God. They worshiped the gods of people around them. That made Yahveh angry; 14so he let plunderers sell them to their enemies so they couldn’t stand against them any longer. 15Whenever they marched out, he opposed them like he’d sworn. They were in dire straits.</p>
<p>16Then Yahveh raised up judges to save them from their plunderers, 17but they wouldn’t listen to them. They carried on prostitution with other gods and soon turned aside from the way their ancestors lived. 18Whenever he raised up a judge for them, he was with him and saved them as long as the judge was alive. He took pity on their groaning. 19But whenever the judge died, they’d turn back and do worse than their ancestors and wouldn’t quit 20Yahveh was angry and said,</p>
<p>“They’ve sinned against my covenant like their ancestors. 21From now on, I won’t drive out any nation Joshua left when he died. 22I’ll use them to test Israel to see if they’ll follow meY like their ancestors.” [23]    	Jud 2:11-23</p>
<p>3:1Yahveh left those nations to the test the Israelites that hadn’t experienced war in Canaan. [2] 3The nations were</p>
<p>the five lords of the Philistines,</p>
<p>all the Canaanites,</p>
<p>Sidonians,</p>
<p>the Hivites on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.</p>
<p>4They served to test whether Israel would obey Yahveh’s commandments to their ancestors by Moses. 5So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 6They intermarried with them and served their gods.</p>
<p>Othniel Judges Israel</p>
<p>7Israel forgot Yahveh its God and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. 8He was angry and sold Israel to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for 8 years. 9When they appealed to Yahveh, he raised up Othniel Ben-Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, to deliver them. 10The Spirit of Yahveh stirred him up to judge Israel. He went out to war, and Yahveh delivered Cushan-rishathaim to him. 11The land had peace for 40 years. Then Othniel died.	 Jud 3:1-11</p>
<p>Ehud Judges Israel</p>
<p>12The people sinned again, and Yahveh strengthened Eglon, king of Moab. 13He gathered the Amorites and Amalekites, defeated Israel, and took the City of Palms. 14Israel served him for 18 years.</p>
<p>15But when Israel appealed to Yahveh, he raised up Ehud Ben-Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon. 16Ehud made a double-edged sword 18ins long and fastened it under his right thigh under his clothes. 17He presented the tribute to Eglon, an obese man. 18When he’d presented it, he sent away the people that carried it. 19At the idols near Gilgal, he turned back and said, “I have a private message for you, King.” He said, “Just a minute.” His attendants went out. 20Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof room. He said, “I have a message from God for you.” He got up from his seat. 21Ehud reached with his left hand, took his sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly. 22The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. He didn’t pull it out, and the refuse came out. 23Ehud went out to the anteroom, closed the doors to the roof room, and locked them.</p>
<p>Jud 3:12-23</p>
<p>24When he’d gone, the servants came and saw the doors locked, and thought he was relieving himself in the cool room. 25They waited till they were completely confused. When he still didn’t come out, they took the key and opened the doors. There he was, on the floor, dead.</p>
<p>26While they delayed, Ehud escaped past the idols to Seirah. 27When he arrived, he blew the ram’s horn in the hill country of Ephraim. The people went down from the hill country with him leading. 28He told them, “Follow me. Yahveh will deliver the Moabites to you.” They went down and seized the fords of the Jordan from the Moabites and wouldn’t let anybody cross. 29They killed about 10,000 Moabites, strong, able-bodied men. No one escaped. 30Israel subdued Moab that day. The land had peace for 80 years.</p>
<p>Shamgar Judges Israel</p>
<p>31After him came Shamgar Ben-Anath, who killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad and delivered Israel.	 Jud 3:24-31</p>
<p>Deborah Judges Israel</p>
<p>4:1After Ehud died, the people sinned again, 2and Yahveh sold them to Jabin, king of Canaan in Hazor. Sisera commanded his army from Harosheth-hagoyim. 3The people appealed to Yahveh because Sisera had 900 iron chariots and oppressed Israel cruelly for 20 years.</p>
<p>4Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. 5She sat under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people came up to her for judgment. 6She sent for Barak Ben-Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of Israel commands you, ‘Gather to Mount Tabor 10,000 troops from Naphtali and Zebulun. 7I’ll draw out Sisera, Jabin’s general, to meet you by the Kishon River with his chariots and troops. I’ll give him to you.’”</p>
<p>8Barak said, “If you’ll go, I’ll go. If you won’t, I won’t.”</p>
<p>9“I’ll go with you, but that won’t give you any honor. Yahveh will be selling Sisera to a woman.”</p>
<p>She went with him to Kedesh, 10and Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; 10,000 men went up with him. 	Jud 4:1-10</p>
<p>11Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law*. He had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</p>
<p>12When Sisera heard that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, 13he called out his 900 iron chariots and all his army from Harosheth-hagoyim to the Kishon River. 14Deborah told Barak, “Get up! Yahveh is going to deliver Sisera to you today. Isn’t it Yahveh that’s leading you out?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men, 15and Yahveh routed Sisera, his chariots, and army. Sisera jumped down from his chariot and fled on foot. 16Barak chased the chariots and the army back home to Harosheth-hagoyim, and Sisera’s whole army fell by the sword.</p>
<p>17Sisera fled to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, because he and Heber’s family had been on good terms. 18Jael came out to meet him, “Turn aside, Sir. You don’t have to be afraid.” He turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a rug. 19He said, “Please give me a little water. I’m thirsty.” She opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him up. 20He said, “Stand at the door. If anybody comes and asks if anybody’s here, say, ‘No.’” 21But she took a tent peg and a hammer, and went quietly to him and drove the peg into his temple till it stuck into the ground while he was asleep, exhausted. That’s how he died. 22As Barak pursued him, Jael went out to meet him, “Come here, I’ll show you the man you’re looking for.” He went into her tent and found Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temple.</p>
<p>23God subdued Jabin that day in front of Israel. 24They kept pressing harder and harder on him till they’d destroyed him. 	  Jud 4:11-24</p>
<p>The Song of Deborah</p>
<p>5:1Deborah and Barak sang that day,</p>
<p>2“Bless Yahveh!</p>
<p>because the leaders led in Israel,</p>
<p>the people volunteered.</p>
<p>3Hear, you kings; listen, you officials;</p>
<p>I’ll sing to Yahveh;</p>
<p>I’ll praise Israel’s God.</p>
<p>4Yahveh, when you went out from Seir,</p>
<p>when you marched from Edom,</p>
<p>the ground quaked;</p>
<p>the sky dripped;</p>
<p>yes, the clouds dripped water.</p>
<p>5The mountains shook in front of Yahveh;</p>
<p>you, Sinai, shook in front of Israel’s God.	Jud 5:1-5</p>
<p>6“In the days of Shamgar Ben-Anath,</p>
<p>in the days of Jael, caravans ceased;</p>
<p>travelers kept to the back roads.</p>
<p>7The rural people ceased in Israel;</p>
<p>they ceased till you arose, Deborah,</p>
<p>as a mother in Israel.</p>
<p>8When the people chose new gods,</p>
<p>war was in the gates.</p>
<p>Not a shield or spear was seen</p>
<p>among 40,000 in Israel.</p>
<p>9My heart goes out to Israel’s commanders,</p>
<p>who volunteered willingly among the people.</p>
<p>Bless Yahveh.		Jud 5:6-9</p>
<p>10“Sing, you that ride white donkeys,</p>
<p>who sit on rich carpets</p>
<p>and travel on the highway.</p>
<p>11At the sound of those who separate flocks</p>
<p>by the watering places,</p>
<p>they repeat Yahveh’s triumphs,</p>
<p>the triumphs of his rural people in Israel.</p>
<p>Then Yahveh’s people went down to the gates.	Jud 5:10-11</p>
<p>12“Wake up, wake up, Deborah!</p>
<p>Wake up, wake up, and sing!</p>
<p>Arise, Barak;</p>
<p>lead away your captives, Ben-Abinoam.</p>
<p>13The remnant of the nobles came down;</p>
<p>Yahveh’s people came down</p>
<p>for him against the powerful.</p>
<p>14They set out to the valley from Ephraim;</p>
<p>they followed you, Benjamin, with your kin.</p>
<p>The commanders marched down from Machir;</p>
<p>from Zebulun they marched</p>
<p>who carry the marshal’s staff.		Jud 5:12-14</p>
<p>15The princes of Issachar came with Deborah;</p>
<p>as Issachar came so did Barak.</p>
<p>They rushed out to the valley at his heels,</p>
<p>but the clans of Reuben held back.</p>
<p>16Why did you linger among the sheepfolds?</p>
<p>To hear the piping for the flocks?</p>
<p>There was high resolve</p>
<p>among the clans of Reuben.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>17Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan.</p>
<p>Why did Dan stay with his ships?</p>
<p>Asher sat still at the coast by the sea,</p>
<p>and settled down by his landings.</p>
<p>18Zebulun wass a people that risked their lives;</p>
<p>Naphtali, too, on the high places in the countryside.</p>
<p>Jud 5:15-18</p>
<p>19“The kings came and fought;</p>
<p>they fought the kings of Canaan</p>
<p>at Taanach by the water of Megiddo.</p>
<p>They got no spoils of silver.</p>
<p>20The stars fought from the sky;</p>
<p>from their courses they fought Sisera.</p>
<p>21The current of the Kishon swept them away,</p>
<p>the rushing torrent in the Kishon.</p>
<p>March on, my soul, with confidence!</p>
<p>22“Then the horses’ hoofs beat loud</p>
<p>with the galloping of steeds.			Jud 5:19-22</p>
<p>23“‘Curse Meroz,’ the angel of Yahveh says;</p>
<p>‘put its people under a severe curse.</p>
<p>They didn’t come to help Yahveh</p>
<p>against the powerful.’</p>
<p>24May Jael be most fortunate among women,</p>
<p>the wife of Heber the Kenite,</p>
<p>most fortunate among women in the tent.</p>
<p>25He asked for water; she gave him milk.</p>
<p>She brought him curds in a beautiful bowl.</p>
<p>26She took a tent peg</p>
<p>and a workman’s hammer;</p>
<p>she struck Sisera a blow,</p>
<p>and crushed his head.</p>
<p>She shattered and pierced his temple.</p>
<p>27He sank, he fell;</p>
<p>he lay still at her feet.</p>
<p>He sank and fell down dead at her feet. 	Jud 5:23-27</p>
<p>28She looked out the window;</p>
<p>Sisera’s mother gazed through the lattice.</p>
<p>‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?</p>
<p>Why do the hoof beats with his chariots tarry?’</p>
<p>29Her wise ladies answer;</p>
<p>no, she answers herself,</p>
<p>30‘Aren’t they finding and dividing the spoil—</p>
<p>a young woman or two for every man;</p>
<p>spoil of embroidered dyed work for Sisera,</p>
<p>two pieces of dyed work the spoiler’s neck?’</p>
<p>31“May all your enemies perish that way, Yahveh!</p>
<p>But may your friends be like the sun</p>
<p>when it rises at it brightest.”</p>
<p>The land had peace for 40 years.	Jud 5:28-31</p>
<p>Gideon Judges Israel</p>
<p>6:1Israel did what Yahveh considered evil; so he gave them over to Midian for 7 years. 2Because of Midian, the Israelites made dens and caves and barricades in the mountains. 3Whenever they sowed anything, the Midianites, Amalekites, and people from the east would come up and attack them. 4They’d camp against them and destroy their crops as far as the territory around Gaza. They wouldn’t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. 5They’d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land 6and brought Israel low. The people appealed to Yahveh, 	Jud 6:1-6</p>
<p>[7] 8and he sent a prophet,</p>
<p>“Yahveh God of Israel says,’ I led you out of slavery in Egypt, 9and delivered you from other oppressors. I drove them out and gave you their land. 10I told you, “I’m Yahveh your God. Don’t be afraid of the Amorites’ gods where you’re living.” But you ignored me.’”</p>
<p>11Now the angel of Yahveh came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.</p>
<p>12The angel appeared to him, “Yahveh is with you, brave soldier!” 	Jud 6:7-12</p>
<p>13Gideon said,</p>
<p>“Sir, if he’s with us, why is this happening? Where are his wonderful deeds our ancestors talked about when he brought us up from Egypt?’ He’s thrown us away now and delivered us to Midian.”</p>
<p>14“Take your strength and deliver Israel from them. Haven’t I sent you?”</p>
<p>15“Yahveh, how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I’m the least in my family.”</p>
<p>16“l’ll be with you. You’ll strike the Midianites as if they were one man.”</p>
<p>17“If I’m pleasing to you, give me a sign that it’s you speaking to me.  18Don’t leave till I come back with your present.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait.”	Jud 6:13-18</p>
<p>19Gideon went into the house and fixed a kid and cakes without yeast from 1.1 bushels     1 ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and took them to him under the terebinth tree. 20God’s angel said, “Put the meat and cakes on this rock and pour the broth over them.”  When he did that, 21the angel touched the meat and cakes with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed them, and he vanished. 22Then Gideon surmised that he was the angel of Yahveh, “Lord Yahveh! I’ve seen the angel of Yahveh directly.” 23But Yahveh said, Don’t be afraid. You won’t die.” 24Then Gideon built an altar to him and called it Yahveh Is Peace [Yahveh Shalom]. It’s still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</p>
<p>25That night Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“Take your father’s bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down your father’s altar to Baal. Cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 26Build an altar to Yahveh your God on top of the fortress here, with stones laid in order. Offer the second bull as a burnt offering with the wood from the Asherah pole you cut down.”</p>
<p>27Gideon took ten servants and did that. He was too afraid of family and townspeople to do it in the daytime, so he did it at night. 	Jud 6:19-27</p>
<p>28When people in town got up early, Baal’s altar was pulled down, the Asherah pole was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar Gideon built. 29They asked one another who did it. After they asked around, people said, “Gideon Ben-Joash.” 30They told Joash, “Bring your son out to die. He pulled down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole.” 31Joash said to everybody lined up against him,</p>
<p>“Will you defend Baal or his cause? Whoever fights for him will be put to death by morning. If he’s a god, he can defend himself. It’s his altar that Gideon tore down!” 	Jud 6:28-31</p>
<p>32That day he called him Jerubbaal (“Let Baal fight him.”) because he tore down his altar.</p>
<p>33Then the Midianites, Amalekites, and people east of the Jordan joined forces, crossed the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 34The Spirit of Yahveh stirred up Gideon. He blew the ram’s horn and called the Abiezrites to follow him. 35He sent messengers all over Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to follow him too. They went up to meet them.</p>
<p>36Then Gideon said to God,</p>
<p>“If you’re going to deliver Israel by me, 37I’m laying a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there’s dew on it but the ground around it’s dry, I’ll know you’ll deliver Israel by me.”</p>
<p>38That’s what happened. When he got up early, he wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl. 39Then he said to God,</p>
<p>“Don’t be angry with me. Let me test you one more time with the fleece. Let it be dry and the ground around it have dew on it.”</p>
<p>40That’s what God did that night. It was dry just on the fleece; the ground was wet.  	Jud 6:32-40</p>
<p>7:1Then Jerubbaal (Gideon) and the people got up early and camped beside the Spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was in the valley north of them by the Hill of Moreh.</p>
<p>2Yahveh told Gideon,</p>
<p>“You have too many for me to deliver the Midianites to you. I don’t want Israel to pride themselves in thinking they’ve delivered themselves.  3Tell whoever is afraid and trembling to go home.”</p>
<p>Gideon tested them; 22,000 went back, 10,000 stayed.</p>
<p>4Yahveh told Gideon,</p>
<p>“There are still too many. Take them down to the creek; I’ll test them. The one I tell you, will go with you. The others won’t.”</p>
<p>5He took them down to the water. Yahveh told Gideon,</p>
<p>“The ones that lap water like a dog, put in a group. Those who kneel down to drink put in another group.”</p>
<p>6300 put their hands to their mouths. The rest got on their knees to drink from the water. 7Yahveh told Gideon, “I’ll deliver the Midianites to you with 300 men. Send the rest home.” 8He took the people’s jars and rams’ horns and sent the rest home. Midian camped below them in the valley.	Jud 7:1-8</p>
<p>9That night Yahveh told him,</p>
<p>“Get up and go down against the camp. I’ll deliver it to you. 10If you’re afraid, go down with your servant Purah. 11You’ll hear what they’re saying and be confident about attacking the camp.”</p>
<p>He went down with Purah to the outposts of the camp. 12The Midianites, Amalekites, and people from east of the Jordan lay along the valley like locusts. Their camels were without number, like sand on the shore. 13When Gideon got there, a man was telling his friend about a dream,</p>
<p>“I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp. It knocked a tent over and flattened it.”</p>
<p>14His friend answered, “That’s the sword of Gideon, a man of Israel. God is going to deliver Midian and the rest of the army to him.” 	Jud 7:9-14</p>
<p>15When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship and went back to camp. He said, “Get up! Yahveh is going to deliver Midian’s army to you.” 16He divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them all rams’ horns and empty jars with torches inside. 17He told them,</p>
<p>“Do what I do when I get to the edge of the camp. 18When I and the ones with me blow the rams’ horns, then blow your rams’ horns all around the camp, and raise the battle cry, ‘For Yahveh and Gideon!’”</p>
<p>19Gideon and the 300 got to the edge of the camp when they’d just set the middle watch. 20They blew the rams’ horns and broke the jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the rams’ horns in their right, and raised the battle cry, “A sword for Yahveh and Gideon!” 21Every man stood in place all around the camp, and Midian’s whole army screamed and fled. 22When the Israelites blew the 300 rams’ horns, Yahveh set every man’s sword against his fellow soldier throughout Midian’s army. The army fled all the way to Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. 23Gideon called out Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to chase them. 24He sent messengers all over the hill country of Ephraim, “Come down against the Midianites and seize control of the water, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” Ephraim came out and seized it. 25They captured Oreb and Zeeb, Midian’s two rulers. In the chase they killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon beyond the Jordan. 	Jud 7:15-25</p>
<p>8:1The men in Ephraim said to him,</p>
<p>“What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?” They were in animated contention with him.</p>
<p>2He said,</p>
<p>“What have I done compared to you? Isn’t the gleaning of grapes in Ephraim better than the vintage in Abiezer? 3God delivered Oreb and Zeeb to you. What have I done compared to that?”</p>
<p>They calmed down.</p>
<p>4Gideon and the 300 crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. 5He said to the men in Succoth, “Give loaves of bread to the ones with me. I’m afraid they’re worn out, and I’m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”</p>
<p>6The officials in Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your army?”</p>
<p>7Gideon said, “All right, then. When Yahveh delivers them to me, I’ll flail you with wild briers and thorns.” 8He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.</p>
<p>9He told them, “When I come back after peace is restored, I’ll tear down this tower.”</p>
<p>Jud 8:1-9</p>
<p>10Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east of the Jordan; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and caught them in a surprise attack. 12Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.</p>
<p>13When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, 14he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the names of the 77 officials and elders in Succoth. 15Gideon came and said, “Look, Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your exhausted men?’ 16He disciplined the city elders with wild thorns and briers from the countryside. 17He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.</p>
<p>18He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”</p>
<p>They answered, “Every one of them was like you, like a king’s son.”</p>
<p>19He said, “They were my brothers, my mother’s sons. As sure as Yahveh lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn’t have killed you.”</p>
<p>20He told Jether his firstborn to get up and kill them.</p>
<p>But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.</p>
<p>21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Be a man. Come do it yourself.”  	Jud 8:10-21</p>
<p>Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels’ necks.</p>
<p>22Then the Israelites said to him, “Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well. You’ve delivered us from Midian.”</p>
<p>23“I won’t be your ruler. My son won’t either. Yahveh will be your ruler. 24Let me ask you for one thing, though. Each of you, give me the earrings from your spoil.”</p>
<p>25“We’ll be glad to.” They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. 26The gold earrings weighed 50 pounds 1700 shekels of gold—plus the camels’ crescents. 27Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 28So Israel subdued Midian; they didn’t threaten anymore. The land had peace for 40 years during Gideon’s life.</p>
<p>29Jerubbaal/Gideon went and lived in his own house. 30He had 77 sons from many wives. 31A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. 32Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.</p>
<p>33As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. 34They didn’t remember Yahveh their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, 35or show kindness to Jerubbaal’s family in return for everything he’d done for Israel. 	Jud 8:22-35</p>
<p>Abimelech’s Conspiracy</p>
<p>9:1Abimelech went to his mother’s relatives in Shechem and said to her clan, 2“Ask the leaders in Shechem which is better, for Jerubbaal’s 70 sons to rule you, or for one man to rule you. Remember, I’m your flesh and bone.” 3His mother’s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him because he was their kin. 4They gave him 70 pieces of silver from Baal-berith’s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows 5to go with him to his father’s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, hid. 6The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem. 	Jud 9:1-6</p>
<p>7When Jotham heard about it, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted,</p>
<p>“Listen, men of Shechem, so God will listen to you. 8The trees went out to anoint a king. They asked the olive tree to rule them. 9But the olive tree said, ‘Should I leave my richness that honors gods and men, and go sway over the trees?’ 10The trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and rule us.’ 11But the fig tree said, ‘Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go sway over the trees?’ 12The trees said to the grapevine, ‘You come and rule us.’ 13But the grapevine said, ‘Should I leave my wine that cheers gods and mortals, and go sway over the trees?’ 14Then the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and rule us.’ 15The bramble said, ‘If you’re anointing me king in good faith, then come and take refuge in my shade. If not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’</p>
<p>“[16] 17My father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from Midian. 18You’ve risen up against his family and killed his 70 sons on one rock. You’ve made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king of Shechem because he’s your relative. 19If you’ve acted honorably in good faith with Jerubbaal and his family as his deeds deserved, then be happy with one another. 20If not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the people in Shechem and Beth-millo.”</p>
<p>21Jotham fled to Beer and lived there for fear of his half-brother. 	Jud 9:7-21</p>
<p>22Abimelech ruled Israel for 3 years. 23God put animosity between him and the people in Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with him. 24That was so the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come on Abimelech who murdered them and on the men who helped him. 25The men in Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops and robbed everybody that went by. Abimelech heard about it.</p>
<p>26Gaal Ben-Ebed moved to Shechem with his relatives and gained the confidence of the people there. 27They went out and gathered grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and held a feast. They went to the temple of their god and ate and drank, and ranted about Abimelech. 28Gaal said,</p>
<p>“Who is Abimelech? Why should we serve him? Didn’t the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him? 29If these people were under my command! I’d remove Abimelech. I’d tell him to muster an army and come out and fight.”</p>
<p>Jud 9:22-29</p>
<p>30When Zebul the ruler of the city heard what Gaal said, he was mad, 31and sent ambassadors to Abimelech at Arumah,</p>
<p>“Gaal and his relatives have come to Shechem; they’re stirring up the city against you. 32So you and your men go during the night and lie in ambush in the fields. 33In the morning at sunup, rush on the city. When he and his men come out against you, do to them what you can.”</p>
<p>34Abimelech and his men got up during the night and laid in ambush against Shechem in four companies. 35Gaal went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and his men rose up from the ambush. 36When Gaal saw them, he told Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountain!”</p>
<p>Zebul said, “You’re just seeing the mountains’ shadows.”</p>
<p>37Gaal said again, “Look, men are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”</p>
<p>38Then Zebul said, “Where’s your bragging now, you that said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Aren’t these the men you despised? Go fight them.” 39Gaal led the men out to fight him. 40Abimelech chased him and he fled. Many fell wounded all the way back to the entrance of the gate. 41Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so they couldn’t keep living in Shechem.	       Jud 9:30-41</p>
<p>42The next day the men went out to the fields. Abimelech heard about it. 43He divided his men into three companies and laid in wait there. When the men come out of the city, he attacked them and killed them. 44Abimelech and his company rushed up and stood at the entrance to the city gate while the two companies attacked and killed the ones in the fields. 45Abimelech fought the city all day and took it. He killed the people in it, tore it down, and scattered salt all over it.</p>
<p>46When people in the tower at Shechem heard about it, they went into the fortress of El-berith’s temple. 47When Abimelech found out they were in the tower, 48he and his men went up to Mount Zalmon. He cut a bundle of brush with an axe and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. 49Each one cut a bundle and followed him. He piled the bundles against the fortress and set it on fire over the ones inside. Everybody in the tower died, about 1,000 men and women.	Jud 9:42-49</p>
<p>50Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and took it. 51But the city had a strong tower. The men and women fled to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof. 52He attacked it and came to burn down the tower door. 53A woman threw an upper millstone down on him and cracked his skull. 54Right away he called to his young armor bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me so people won’t say a woman killed me.” His young man thrust him through, and he died. 55When Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they went home. 56So God repaid him for his crime against his father in killing his 70 brothers. 57God also made the sinfulness of the men in Shechem come back on their heads and made Jotham’s curse fall on them.	Jud 9:50-57</p>
<p>Tola Judges Israel</p>
<p>10:1After Abimelech, Tola Ben-Puah Ben-Dodo from Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel. He lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim, 2and judged Israel 23 years. He died and was buried at Shamir.</p>
<p>Jair Judges Israel</p>
<p>3Then Jair from Gilead arose and judged Israel 22 years. 4He had 30 sons that rode 30 donkeys and had 30 “towns” people still call Havvoth-jair in Gilead. 5He died and was buried in Kamon.	 Jud 10:1-5</p>
<p>6Again, Israel sinned and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites and Philistines. They forsook Yahveh. 7His anger flared at them, and he sold them to the Ammonites and Philistines. 8They crushed and oppressed Israel that year. For 18 years they oppressed Israel beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites (Gilead). 9The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim; Israel was severely distressed.</p>
<p>10Israel cried out to Yahveh, “We’ve sinned against you; we’ve left our God and served the images of Baal.”</p>
<p>11He said to them,</p>
<p>“Didn’t I deliver you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines? 12The Sidonians, Amalekites, Maonites oppressed you too. You appealed to me and I delivered you from them. 13Yet you’ve left me and served other gods; so I won’t deliver you anymore. 14Call out to the gods you’ve chosen. Have them deliver you.”</p>
<p>15They said to Yahveh, “We’ve sinned. Do whatever you think’s good. Just deliver us today, please.” 16They put away the foreign gods and served Yahveh; he couldn’t bear Israel’s misery any longer. 17The Ammonites called to arms and encamped in Gilead. Israel came together and camped in Mizpah. 18The leaders in Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will lead the fight against the Ammonites will rule everyone in Gilead.”  	Jud 10:6-18</p>
<p>Jephthah Judges Israel</p>
<p>11:1Jephthah from Gilead was a strong soldier, but he was a prostitute’s son. His father was Gilead. 2Gilead’s wife also bore him sons. When her sons grew up, they shoved Jephthah out, “You won’t inherit in our father’s house. You’re another woman’s son.” 3He ran away and lived in the land of Tob. Ruffians gathered around him and went on raids with him.</p>
<p>4After a time the Ammonites went to war against Israel. 5The elders in Gilead went to bring Jephthah from Tob, 6“Come, lead us so we can fight the Ammonites.”</p>
<p>7“Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s family? Why come to me now when you’re in trouble?”</p>
<p>8“That’s why we’ve turned to you so you can lead us in Gilead to fight the Ammonites.”</p>
<p>9“If you take me home again to fight the Ammonites, and Yahveh gives them to me, I’ll lead you.”</p>
<p>10“Yahveh is witness. We’ll do that.”</p>
<p>11Jephthah went with them, and the people made him their leader. He swore in at Mizpah in front of Yahveh. 	Jud 11:1-11</p>
<p>12He sent messengers to the Ammonite king, “What do you have against me that you’ve attacked my land?”</p>
<p>13The king answered his messengers, “Because when Israel came out of Egypt, he took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok to the Jordan. Return it peacefully.”</p>
<p>14Jephthah sent messengers back to him,</p>
<p>15“Jephthah says,</p>
<p>‘Israel didn’t take away Moab’s or Ammon’s land. 16When the Israelites came up from Egypt, they went through open country to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 17Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom to let them pass through your land. But he wouldn’t. They sent to the king of Moab too, but he wouldn’t consent; so Israel stayed at Kadesh. 18Then they traveled through open country and went around Edom and Moab. They arrived at the east side of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They didn’t go into Moab; the Arnon was its border. 19Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king at Heshbon, to let them pass through his land to go to their own country. 20But Sihon wouldn’t trust Israel. He gathered his people, camped at Jahaz, and fought them. 21Yahveh God of Israel delivered them all to Israel and defeated them. Israel took over Amorite territory 22from the Arnon to the Jabbok, from the desert to the Jordan. 23Yahveh expelled the Amorites in front of his own people, and you’re going to take it back? 24Wouldn’t you keep what your god Chemosh gave you? We’ll keep everything Yahveh our God has taken for us. 25Are you any better than Balak Ben-Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel or go to war with them? 26Why didn’t you recover them while Israel lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, and in the towns on the banks of the Arnon for 300 years? 27I haven’t sinned against you. You’ve wronged me by attacking me. May Yahveh the Judge decide today between Israel and Ammon.”</p>
<p>28But the Ammonite king of the Ammonites wouldn’t listen. 	Jud 11:12-28</p>
<p>29The Spirit of Yahveh stirred up Jephthah, and he went through Gilead and Manasseh to Mizpah in Gilead and on to the Ammonites. 30He vowed to Yahveh, “If you’ll give the Ammonites to me, 31whatever comes out of my house to meet me when I get back, I’ll offer up for a burnt offering.” 32He crossed over to fight them, and Yahveh gave them to him. 33He massacred them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, 20 towns, and as far as Abel-keramin. So Israel subdued the Ammonites.</p>
<p>34Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah, and his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She was his only child. 35When he saw her, he tore his clothes,</p>
<p>“My daughter! You’ve brought me low! You’ve brought me great trouble! I’ve opened my mouth to Yahveh, and I can’t take back my vow.”</p>
<p>36She said, “Father, if you’ve vowed to Yahveh, do to me what you’ve vowed, now that he has avenged you of the Ammonites. 37Do this for me: let me alone two months so my companions and I can wander in the mountains and mourn my virginity.”</p>
<p>38He said, “Go ahead.”</p>
<p>He sent her away; she and her companions left to mourn her virginity for two months. 39She came back to her father, who did with her according to his vow. She never knew a man. It became a custom in Israel 40that the young women went four days a year to mourn the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.	Jud 11:29-40</p>
<p>12:1The men of Ephraim gathered an army, crossed over the Jordan to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites and not call us to go with you? We’ll burn your house on top of you.”</p>
<p>2Jephthah told them, “My people and I had a major conflict with the Ammonites. When I called you, you didn’t deliver me from them. 3When I saw that you wouldn’t deliver me, I took my life in hand and crossed over against them, and Yahveh delivered them to me. Why then have you come up to fight me?”</p>
<p>4Jephthah gathered the men from Gilead and struck Ephraim because they said, “You Gileadites are refugees from Ephraim in Ephraim and Manasseh.” 5The Gileadites captured the Jordan fords. When a refugee from Ephraim asked to go across, the Gileadites would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” 6they’d tell him to say shibboleth. He’d say sibboleth because he couldn’t pronounce it right; so they’d kill him. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites fell.</p>
<p>7Jephthah judged Israel 6 years. He died and was buried in his city in Gilead. 	Jud 12:1-7</p>
<p>Ibzan Judges Israel</p>
<p>8After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 9He had 30 sons and gave 30 daughters in marriage outside his clan. He brought in 30 daughters from outside for his sons. He judged Israel 7 years. 10He died and was buried at Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Elon Judges Israel</p>
<p>11After him Elon from Zebulun judged Israel for 10 years. 12He died and was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun.</p>
<p>Abdon Judges Israel</p>
<p>13After him Abdon Ben-Hillel from Pirathon judged Israel. 14He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons that rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel 8 years. 15He died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.	Jud 12:8-15</p>
<p>The Samson Cycle</p>
<p>13:1Israel sinned again, and Yahveh gave them to the Philistines for 40 years.</p>
<p>2A man named Manoah in Zorah from the tribe of Dan had a wife that couldn’t have children. 3The angel of Yahveh appeared to her,</p>
<p>“You haven’t been able to have children, but you’ll have a son. 4Make sure not to drink wine or alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean. 5Your son is not to shave his head. He’ll be a Nazirite to me from birth and begin delivering Israel from the Philistines.”</p>
<p>6She went and told her husband,</p>
<p>“A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, really awesome. I didn’t ask him where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 7He said, ‘You’ll have a son; don’t drink wine or alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean, because he’ll be a Nazirite to me from birth to death.’”</p>
<p>Jud 13:1-7</p>
<p>8Manoah pleaded with Yahveh, “Please let the man you sent come again and teach us what to do with the boy.” 9His angel came again while she was sitting alone in the field. 10She ran and told Manoah, “The man that came to me the other day has appeared to me.”</p>
<p>11Manoah got up and followed her, “Are you the man that talked to her?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>12“When your promise comes true, how should the boy live? What’s he supposed to do?”</p>
<p>13“Make sure to do everything I told her. 14She’s not to eat anything from the grapevine. Don’t let her drink wine or strong drink or eat anything ceremonially unclean.”</p>
<p>15“Let me detain you and fix you a kid.”</p>
<p>16“If you detain me, I won’t eat your food. If you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to Yahveh.” (Manoah didn’t know he was the angel of Yahveh.)</p>
<p>17“What’s your name, so when your promise comes true, we can honor you?”</p>
<p>18“Why ask what my name is? You can’t understand it.”</p>
<p>19Manoah took the kid with its grain offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahveh, who worked wonders while Manoah and his wife watched. 20When the flame went up from the altar, the angel of Yahveh went up in it. They fell on their faces on the ground.	 Jud 13:8-20</p>
<p>21The angel of Yahveh never appeared to them again. Then Manoah realized he was the angel of Yahveh. 22He told his wife, “We going to die! We’ve seen God.” 23But she said, “If he meant to kill us, he wouldn’t have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering. He wouldn’t have shown us those things or told us such things.” 24She had a son and named him Samson. He grew and Yahveh blessed him. 25The Spirit of Yahveh began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.	    Jud 13:21-25</p>
<p>Samson’s Marriage</p>
<p>14:1Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman. 2He came up and told his parents, “I saw a young Philistine woman at Timnah. Get her for me for a wife.”</p>
<p>3They said, “Isn’t there a woman among your relatives or all our people that you have to marry a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?”</p>
<p>But he told his father, “Get her for me; I really like her.”</p>
<p>4His parents didn’t know it was all right with Yahveh because he was looking for an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines controlled Israel.</p>
<p>5Samson went down to Timnah with his parents and came to the vineyards at Timnah. A young lion roared at him, 6and the Spirit of Yahveh came mightily on him. Barehanded he tore the lion apart like it was a kid. 7He went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased him well. 8After a while, he went back to take her and turned aside to see the lion’s carcass. There was a swarm of bees and honey in it. 9He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. He came to his parents and gave them some to eat; but he didn’t tell them he got it out of the lion’s carcass. 	Jud 14:1-9</p>
<p>10His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there. That’s the way young men used to do. 11When the people saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him.</p>
<p>12Samson said to them,</p>
<p>“Let me put a riddle to you. If you can figure it out and tell me during the week of the feast, I’ll give you 30 linen tunics and 30 festive robes. 13If you can’t, you’ll give me that many.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>14He said, “Out of the eater came something to eat.</p>
<p>Out of the strong came something sweet.”</p>
<p>In three days, they couldn’t explain the riddle.	 Jud 14:10-14</p>
<p>15The fourth day, they told Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle means, or we’ll burn you and your father’s family. Have you invited us here to make us poor?”</p>
<p>16Samson’s wife cried in front of him, “You just hate me, you don’t love me. You’ve put a riddle to my countrymen and haven’t told me what it means.”</p>
<p>He told her, “I haven’t told my own parents. Am I going to tell you?”</p>
<p>17She cried in his presence the week the feast lasted. The seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told her countrymen the riddle. 18The men of the city told him on the seventh day before the sun set,</p>
<p>“What’s sweeter than honey?</p>
<p>What’s stronger than a lion?”</p>
<p>He told them,</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,</p>
<p>you wouldn’t have solved my riddle.”</p>
<p>19The Spirit of Yahveh came on him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 men from the city. He took their spoil and gave the festive robes to the ones that told him the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house. 20So Samson’s father-in-law gave his wife to his companion, who had been his best man.	Jud 14:15-20</p>
<p>Samson’s Vengeance on the Philistines</p>
<p>15:1After a while at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid. He said, “I’ll sleep with my wife in her room.”</p>
<p>But her father wouldn’t let him go in, 2“I thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister better looking? Take her instead.”</p>
<p>3Samson told them, “This time I’ll be blameless for harming the Philistines.”</p>
<p>4Samson caught 300 foxes, turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each set of tails. 5He lit the torches and released the foxes in the Philistines’ standing grain and olive orchards. 6The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They said, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because he gave his wife to his companion.” The Philistines came up and burned her and her father. 7Samson told them, “If this is what you do, I swear I’ll take my revenge on you, and after that I’ll quit.” 8He struck them hip and thigh with great slaughter and went down to stay in the cave at Etam.	Jud 15:1-8</p>
<p>9Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. 10The men in Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”</p>
<p>They said, “We’ve come to tie up Samson, to do to him as he did to us.”</p>
<p>11Then 3,000 men from Judah went down to the cave at Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you know the Philistines rule us? What have you done to us? 12We’ve come down to tie you up and give you to the Philistines.”</p>
<p>“Swear that you won’t fall on me yourselves.”</p>
<p>13“We’ll tie you up and give you to them. We won’t kill you.”</p>
<p>So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.  	Jud 15:9-13</p>
<p>14When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him, and the Spirit of Yahveh came on him powerfully. The ropes on his arms became like smoldering flax, and his bonds melted off his hands. 15He found a fresh jawbone from a donkey and killed 1,000 men with it. 16He said,</p>
<p>“With a donkey’s ‘jawbone’,</p>
<p>piles on piles.</p>
<p>With a donkey’s jawbone</p>
<p>I’ve killed 1,000 men.”</p>
<p>17After he said that, he threw it away. That place was called Ramath-lehi [Jawbone Hill].</p>
<p>18He was thirsty and “cried out” to Yahveh, “You’ve granted me this great deliverance. Am I to die from thirst and fall into the hands of uncircumcised men?” 19God split open the hollow place that’s in Lehi, and water started coming out of it. When he drank it, his energy returned, and he revived; so he named it En-hakkore; it’s still at Lehi. 20He judged Israel 20 years during the time of the Philistines. 						     Jud 15:14-20</p>
<p>Samson and Delilah</p>
<p>16:1Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute and slept with her. 2The Gazites heard he was there. They surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, “Let’s wait till morning light, then kill him.” 3But Samson lay till midnight, he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and its two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that’s near Hebron. 	Jud 16:1-3</p>
<p>4Later he fell in love with a woman named Delilah in the Valley of Sorek. 5The lords of the Philistines came and told her,</p>
<p>“Entice him to see where his great strength lies so we can overpower him, tie him up, and subdue him. We’ll each give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”</p>
<p>6Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies and how you can be tied up.”</p>
<p>7“If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that haven’t been dried, I’ll become as weak as other men.”</p>
<p>8The lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings, and she tied him up with them. 9She had men lying in wait in an inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings like a piece of string snaps when it touches the fire. So they didn’t find out the secret of his strength. 	Jud 16:4-9</p>
<p>10Delilah said to Samson, “You’ve made fun of me and lied to me. Please tell me how you can be tied up.”</p>
<p>11“If they tie me up with brand new ropes, I’ll become weak like other men.”</p>
<p>12So she tied him up with new ropes, and said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” The men lying in wait were in an inner room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.</p>
<p>13She said to Samson, “You’re making fun of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied up.”</p>
<p>“If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, I’ll become as weak as other men.”</p>
<p>14So while he was asleep, she wove the seven locks of his hair into the web. She made them tight with the pin, and said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” But he woke up and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.	Jud 16:10-14</p>
<p>15She said to him,</p>
<p>“How can you say you love me when you’re not honest with me? You’ve made fun of me three times, and haven’t told me where your great strength lies.”</p>
<p>16When she pressed him hard day after day, it distressed him to death. 17He told her honestly,</p>
<p>“A razor has never come on my head. I’ve been a Nazarite to God from birth. If I’m shaved, my strength will leave, and I’ll become as weak as any other man.”</p>
<p>18When Delilah saw that he’d been straight with her, she called the lords of the Philistines, “Come up one more time. He’s told me his mind.” They came and brought her the money. 19She had him sleep on her knees and called a man to shave off the seven locks on his head. 20She said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” He woke up and said, “I’ll go out as at other times and shake myself free.” He didn’t know Yahveh had left him. 21The Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains. He ground at the mill in the prison, 22but his hair began to grow again.</p>
<p>Jud 16:15-22</p>
<p>The Death of Samson</p>
<p>23The lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a big sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. “Our god has delivered our enemy to us.” 24When the people saw him, they praised their god; “Our god has delivered our enemy to us, the destroyer of our country who has killed many of us.” 25When they’d got half drunk, they said, “Call Samson so he can entertain us.” So they called him out of the prison to entertain them. They made him stand between the pillars. 26He told the boy that was holding him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars the temple rests on so I can lean on them.” 27The temple was filled with men and women, and the lords of the Philistines were there. There were about 3,000 men and women on the roof, watching while Samson entertained them.</p>
<p>28Samson called to Yahveh, “Lord Yahveh, remember me this one time so I can be avenged on the Philistines for my eyes.” 29Samson took hold of the two middle pillars the temple rested on, and leaned his weight on them, his right hand on one, his left hand on the other. 30He said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed with all his might, and the house fell on the lords and people in it. He killed more people in his death than in his life. 31His brothers and family came down to get him. They took him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in Manoah’s tomb. He’d judged Israel 20 years.	 Jud 16:23-31</p>
<p>Micah’s Idols</p>
<p>17:1A man named Micah in the hill country of Ephraim 2told his mother, “I took the 1,100 pieces of silver that were stolen from you, that you told me about and I heard you speak a curse on; I have them.” She said, “May Yahveh bless my son.” 3He gave them back to her. She said, “I consecrate the silver to Yahveh for my son to make a carved image and a molten image. Now I’ll return it to you.” 4She gave 200 pieces of it to a silversmith to make a graven image and a molten image. It was in Micah’s house. 5He had a shrine and appointed one of his sons as his priest. 6In those days, there wasn’t any king in Israel. Everyone did what seemed right to them.</p>
<p>Jud 17:1-6</p>
<p>7A young Levite from the family of Judah was living temporarily in Bethlehem in Judah. 8He left to find a place to live. As he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. 9Micah asked him where he was from.</p>
<p>“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I’m going away to find a place to live.”</p>
<p>10“Stay with me. Be a father and a priest for me. I’ll give you 10 pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and living expenses.”</p>
<p>11The Levite was content to live with him and became like one of his sons. 12Micah installed the Levite as his priest in his house. 13Then he said, “Now I know Yahveh will prosper me; I have a Levite as a priest.”	Jud 17:7-13</p>
<p>Idolatry Among the Danites</p>
<p>18:1In those days there wasn’t any king in Israel. The tribe of Dan was looking for an territory to live in, because no inheritance in Israel had fallen to them yet. 2They sent out from Zorah and Eshtaol five capable men from their tribe to spy out the land and explore it. They happened to come to Micah’s house and lodged there. 3While they were at his house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite and turned aside to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>4“Micah has done such and such with me and hired me to be his priest.”</p>
<p>5“Ask God so we can know if our journey will be successful.”</p>
<p>6“Goodbye. Yahveh is watching the journey you’re on.”	 Jud 18:1-6</p>
<p>7The five men left and came to Laish and saw how the people lived in security, like the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing and possessing wealth. They saw how far they were from Sidon and had no dealings with anybody. 8When they came to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol, they asked them for their report. 9They said,</p>
<p>“Let’s go up against them. The land is fertile. Aren’t you going to do anything? Don’t hesitate to take the land. 10When you go, you’ll come to an unsuspecting people. The land is extensive. Yes, God will give you the place that doesn’t lack anything.”</p>
<p>11Then 600 armed men from  the tribe of Dan set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 12They went up and “camped” at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That’s why the place is still called Mahaneh-dan—west of Kiriath-jearim. 13They went on from there to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.	 Jud 18:7-13</p>
<p>14The five men that had spied out the country of Laish told their kin, “Did you know there are household idols, an ephod, a carved image, and a molten image in these houses? Think what you can do.” 15They turned aside to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s home and asked him how he was doing. 16The 600 armed Danites stood by the gate entrance, 17and the five men went in and took the carved image, ephod, household idols, and molten image, while the priest stood by the gate entrance with the 600 men. 18When they went into Micah’s house and took those things, the priest asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>19They told him, “Keep your voice down, cover your mouth, and come with us. Be a father and priest for us.  Is it better to be a priest for one man’s house, or for a family and tribe in Israel?”</p>
<p>20The priest was happy. He took the ephod, household idols, and graven image and went in among the people.</p>
<p>21So they turned around and left, putting their little ones, livestock, and goods in front of them. 22When they were a good way from Micah’s house, the men in the houses close by were called out and overtook the Danites. 23They shouted at them. They turned around and said to Micah, “What ails you that you’ve come with such a crowd?”</p>
<p>24He said, “You take away the gods I made, and the priest, and what do I have left? What do you mean, ‘What ails you?’”</p>
<p>25The Danites said, “Don’t raise your voice at us or angry fellows might fall on you. You’ll lose your life and your family’s lives.”</p>
<p>26The Danites left. Micah saw that they were too strong for him and went home.	 Jud 18:14-26</p>
<p>27The Danites took what Micah had made and his priest, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the sword and burned the town. 28There wasn’t any deliverer because it was too far from Sidon, and they didn’t have dealings with anybody. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the town and lived in it. 29They renamed it Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son. 30They set up the carved image, and Jonathan Ben-Gershom Ben-Moses and his descendants were priests for the tribe of Dan till the time of the captivity. 31They set up the carved image Micah made for as long as God’s house was at Shiloh.</p>
<p>Jud 18:27-31</p>
<p>A Levite and His Concubine</p>
<p>19:1At that time, there wasn’t any king in Israel. A Levite was living in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim. He took a concubine from Bethlehem, Judah. 2She got mad at him and went back to her father’s family in Bethlehem for four months. 3Then her husband went after her to speak graciously to her and bring her back. He had a servant and a couple donkeys with him. SheLXX brought him to her father’s family. When her father saw him, he was glad to see him. 4His father-in-law urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days. They ate and drank and lodged there. 5On the fourth day, they got up early, and he got ready to go, but the girl’s father told him, “Strengthen yourself with some bread and after that you can go.” 6The two men sat and ate and drank together. The girl’s father told him, “Spend the night and enjoy yourself.” 7When he got up to go, his father-in-law urged him till he stayed there again. 8On the fifth day, he got up early to leave, and the girl’s father said, “Strengthen yourself and wait till this afternoon.” So they ate together again. 9When the man, his concubine, and his servant got up to leave, his father-in-law said, “It’s getting toward evening; stay here tonight and relax. You can get up early tomorrow for your trip home.”	Jud 19:1-9</p>
<p>10But he wouldn’t. He left and headed toward Jebus (Jerusalem) with two saddled donkeys and his concubine. 11When they got close to Jebus, it was late in the day, and the servant said, “Let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”</p>
<p>12His master said,</p>
<p>“We won’t turn aside to a city that doesn’t belong to Israel. We’ll go on toward Gibeah. 13Let’s get close to a place there and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah.”</p>
<p>14So they went on past Jebus. The sun went down on them near Gibeah, in Benjamin. 15They stopped there to go in and spend the night. He sat down in the open square of the town because nobody had taken them home.	 Jud 19:10-15</p>
<p>16At evening an old man came in from working in the field. He was from the hill country of Ephraim and living in Gibeah. The men there were Benjamites. 17He saw the traveler in the open square, and said, “Where are you from, and where are you going?”</p>
<p>18He said, “We’re going from Bethlehem to a distant part of Ephraim, where I come from. I went to Bethlehem, and I’m going home. Nobody is taking me to his house. 19We have straw and hay for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me, my maidservant, and the young man with us. We have everything we need.”</p>
<p>20The old man said, “Don’t worry. I’ll take care of everything you need. Just don’t spend the night in the square.”</p>
<p>21He took him into his house and gave the donkeys hay. They washed their feet and ate.</p>
<p>Jud 19:16-21</p>
<p>22As they were relaxing, some riffraff from the city surrounded the house, beating on the door and saying to the old man that owned the house, “Bring the man out that came to your house so we can rape him.” 23The man went out and said,</p>
<p>“No, brothers, don’t do something so wicked. He has come to my house; don’t do that awful thing. 24Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what you want, but don’t do such an awful thing.”</p>
<p>25But the men wouldn’t listen, so the man grabbed his concubine and put her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night till morning. As it started getting daylight, they let her go. 26She came and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was.</p>
<p>27Her husband got up in the morning; and when he opened the doors to leave, his concubine was lying there at the door with her hands on the threshold. 28He said to her, “Get up; let’s go on.” But she didn’t answer. He put her on the donkey and went on to his home. 29When he got there, he took a knife and divided her limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent them all over Israel. 30Everybody that saw it said, “Such an awful thing has never happened since Israel came up from Egypt. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”			     	     Jud 19:22-30</p>
<p>Israel Fights the Benjamites</p>
<p>20:1The people came out from Dan to Beersheba, including Gilead, and gathered in unity to Yahveh at Mizpah. 2The chiefs from all the tribes presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people, 400,000 infantry that drew sword. 3(Now the Benjamites heard that the people had gone up to Mizpah.) They said, “How did this wickedness happen?” 4The Levite, husband of the murdered woman, said,</p>
<p>“My concubine and I came to Gibeah, in Benjamin, to spend the night. 5The men there rose against me and set on the house around me after dark. They meant to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she’s dead. 6I cut her up in pieces and sent them all over Israel because they’ve committed a detestable, disgraceful act. 7People of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.”</p>
<p>8The people arose in agreement,</p>
<p>“None of us will go to his tent or house. 9We’ll go up against Gibeah by lot. 10We’ll take 10 men from 100 from all the tribes, 100 from 1,000, 1,000 from 10,000, to bring provisions for the people, so when they come, they can pay back Gibeah for that awful crime.”</p>
<p>11The men of Israel gathered in unity against the town.	 Jud 20:1-11</p>
<p>12The tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, and said, “What’s this wickedness that’s taken place among you? 13Give up the base men of Gibeah, so we can put them to death, and purge sin from Israel.” But the Benjamites wouldn’t listen. 14They came together out of the towns to Gibeah to fight. 15That day they mustered 26,000 swordsmen, besides 700 elite men in Gibeah. 16Among them were 700 elite men that were left-handed. Every one could sling a stone at a hair, and not miss. 17Israel, not including those from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 swordsmen.</p>
<p>18The people of Israel went up to Bethel and asked God, “Which of us should go up first to fight Benjamin?” Yahveh said, “Judah.” 19The people got up in the morning and camped against Gibeah. 20They went out to fight Benjamin and drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. 21The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and felled 22,000 Israelites that day. 22But the people took courage and formed the battle line again in the same place. 23They went up and cried to Yahveh till evening, and asked him, “Should we go again against our relatives the Benjamites?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”	Jud 20:12-23</p>
<p>24So they attacked the Benjamites the second day. 25Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day and felled 18,000 swordsmen. 26Then the entire army of Israel went up to Bethel and cried. They sat in front of Yahveh and fasted that day till evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Yahveh. 27(The Ark was there at that time, 28and Phinehas Ben-Eleazar Ben-Aaron performed service in front of it.) They asked him, “Should we go up again against our fellow Jews?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll deliver them to you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>29Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. 30On the third day, they went up against the Benjamites and set themselves in formation against Gibeah like before. 31The Benjamites came out against them and drew away from the town. As at other times, they began to strike down and kill some people in the highways—one that goes up to Bethel, the other to Gibeah—and in the countryside, about 30 men of Israel. 32The Benjamites said, “They’re routed like the first time.” But the men of Israel said, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the town onto the highways.” 33They rose up out of their place and set themselves in formation at Baal-tamar, and the men lying in ambush rushed out of their place west of Geba. 3410,000 elite men out of all Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was hard, but the Benjamites didn’t know that disaster was coming. 35Yahveh defeated Benjamin in front of Israel. Israel destroyed 25,100 Benjamite swordsmen that day. 36Then the Benjamites realized they were defeated.	Jud 20:24-36a</p>
<p>The men of Israel gave ground, because they relied on the ones in ambush to attack the town. 37The men in ambush hurried out and struck the whole town with the sword. 38The signal by the men in ambush was that when they made a big cloud of smoke rise out of the town, 39the men of Israel should turn around in battle. Benjamin said, “We’ve struck them down like in the first battle.” 40But when the signal began to rise, the Benjamites looked back. The whole town was going up in smoke. 41Then Israel turned around and Benjamin panicked when they saw that disaster was on them. 42So they turned their backs on Israel toward open country, but the battle overtook them. Those who came out of the towns 43cut them down and pursued them down from Nohah all the way across from Gibeah to the east. 4418,000 Benjamites fell. 45They turned and fled toward open country to the Rock of Rimmon. On the roads they cut down 5,000 more and pursued them hard to Gidom and killed another 2,000. 4625,000 Benjamites fell that day, trained soldiers. 47But 600 fled toward open country to the Rock of Rimmon and stayed there four months. 48The men of Israel turned back and struck them with the sword, people and animals and everybody they found. They set on fire the towns they found.	 Jud 20:36b-48</p>
<p>Wives for Benjamites</p>
<p>21:1The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah that none of them will give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin. 2The people came to Bethel and sat till evening in front of God and cried bitterly. 3“Yahveh God of Israel, why has this happened that a tribe should be missing from Israel?” 4The people got up early the next day, built an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 5They said, “Which tribe didn’t come up to the assembly to Yahveh?” They’d taken an oath at Mizpah to put to death anyone that didn’t come up to Yahveh. 6They felt sorry for Benjamin, their fellow Jews, “A tribe has been eliminated from Israel today. 7What are we going to do for wives for the ones that are left? We’ve sworn by Yahveh not to give them our daughters for wives.”	Jud 21:1-7</p>
<p>8They said, “What tribe didn’t come up?” 9When the people mustered, not one person from Jabesh-gilead was there. 10The community sent 12,000 of their bravest men, “Go strike the people in Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including women and children. 11Destroy every male and every woman that has been with a man.” 12They found 400 young virgins in Jabesh-gilead and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.</p>
<p>13Then the whole community sent word to Benjamin at the Rock of Rimmon to announce a truce. 14Benjamin came back, and they gave them the women they’d saved from Jabesh-gilead, but they weren’t enough. 15The people had mercy on Benjamin because Yahveh had created a division in the tribes.	Jud 21:8-15</p>
<p>16The elders of the community said,</p>
<p>“What are we going to do for the rest of them? The women from Benjamin had been destroyed. 17There has to be an inheritance for the survivors so a tribe doesn’t disappear. 18But we can’t give them our daughters for wives.”</p>
<p>The people had sworn, “Anybody that gives a wife to Benjamin is under a curse.”</p>
<p>19They said, “There’s the annual festival of Yahveh at Shiloh, north of Bethel, east of the road from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah.”</p>
<p>20They told the Benjamites,</p>
<p>“Lie in wait in the vineyards 21and watch. If the young women in Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, each man come out of the vineyards and grab his wife, and go to Benjamin’s land. 22When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we’ll say, ‘Grant them graciously to us because we didn’t take wives for them in battle. You didn’t give them wives; otherwise, you’d be guilty.’”</p>
<p>23The Benjamites did that and took their wives according to their number from the dancers they carried off. They went back to their inheritance, rebuilt the towns, and lived in them. 24Each man of Israel went to his tribe and family, to his inheritance.</p>
<p>25In those days there wasn’t a king in Israel. Everybody did what seemed right to them.</p>
