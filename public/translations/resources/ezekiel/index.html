        <p>EZEKIEL</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>A Vision of Living Beings and</p>
<p>the Glory of Yahveh</p>
<p>1:1The fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 3God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back forth like bolts of lightning.	Ezek 1:1-14</p>
<p>15A wheel appeared on the ground beside each living being. 16The wheels looked like glowing chrysolite built with a wheel inside a wheel. 17When they moved in any of the four directions, they moved without turning. 18Their rims were tall with eyes all the way around.            19-20When the living beings left the ground or moved, the wheels moved with them. The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. [21]</p>
<p>22A bright expanse glowed like crystal above them. 23Under it their wings stretched out toward one another, and two wings covered the sides of their bodies. 24Their wings sounded like rushing water, like the Almighty, like war, like an army camp. When they stood still, they lowered their wings, 25and a voice spoke from the expanse above them.  	  Ezek 1:15-25</p>
<p>26High above the expanse was a throne the color of lapis lazuli; the One sitting on it resembled a man. 27From the waist up, he glowed like metal on fire; from the waist down, he resembled fire. The radiance around him was 28like a rainbow on a rainy day. This scene looked like the glory of Yahveh. When I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice, 	     Ezek 1:26-28</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s Call</p>
<p>2:1“Son of man, stand up so I can talk to you!” 2When the Spirit stood me up, 3he said,</p>
<p>“I’m sending you to the Israelites, a rebellious people. They and their ancestors have been sinning against me to this day. 4Tell those impudent, stubborn children, ‘The Lord Yahveh says.’ 5Whether they listen or not, they’ll know a prophet’s been there. 6Don’t be afraid of them or intimidated by what they say, though you’re surrounded by briars and thorns and sitting on scorpions. 7Tell them what I’ve said whether they listen or not.      	         	          Ezek 2:1-7</p>
<p>8“Don’t be like that rebellious house. Eat what I’m giving you.” 9A hand held out a scroll to me. 10When he unrolled it for me, I could see writing on both sides—lamentations, mourning, and misfortune. 3:1“Eat this scroll and go speak to Israel.” 2So I opened my mouth, and he fed it to me. 3It tasted sweet like honey.	   Ezek 2:8-3:3</p>
<p>[4] 5-6“I’m not sending you to people that speak a hard foreign language you can’t understand. I’m sending you to people that should listen; 7but they won’t listen to you, because they won’t listen to me. The whole house is stubborn. 8I’ve made your face and forehead as hard as theirs, 9like corundum, harder than flint. So don’t be afraid of them or be intimidated by them though they’re rebellious people. 10Listen closely and take everything to heart that I tell you. 11Go to your people in exile and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,’ whether they listen or not.”</p>
<p>12The Spirit picked me up, and I heard a loud rumbling behind me, “Bless Yahveh in his place.” 13I was hearing the wings of the living beings that touched one another and had the wheels beside them. 14The Spirit took me away; I felt bitter and angry, and Yahveh’s hand weighed heavy on me. 15I went to the exiles by the Chebar River at Tel-abib and sat there with them for a week, feeling overwhelmed. 	  Ezek 3:4-15</p>
<p>A Watchman for Israel</p>
<p>16A week later a message came from Yahveh:</p>
<p>17“Son of man, I’ve appointed you to be a watchman for Israel. Whenever you hear something from me, warn them. 18When I tell sinful people they’re going to die, and you don’t warn them so they can live, they’ll die in their sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for it. 19If you’ve warned them, and they don’t change, they’ll die in their sin, but you’ve delivered yourself. 20On the other hand, when good people start sinning and I block them, they’ll die. Since you didn’t warn them, they’ll die in their sin. I won’t consider the good they’d done, but I’ll hold you responsible for their death. 21But if you’ve warned them and they quit sinning, they’ll live because they listened, and you’ll deliver yourself.”</p>
<p>Ezek 3:16-21</p>
<p>22Yahveh put hand on me there ad said, “Get up and go out to the plain, and I’ll talk to you.” 23The glory of Yahveh was there, glory like I’d seen by the Chebar River; I fell on my face. 24The Spirit came into me and stood me up, and said,</p>
<p>“Go shut yourself up in your house. 25They’ll tie you up with ropes so you can’t go out among them. 26I’ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you can’t talk. You won’t be able to rebuke them because they’re a rebellious house. 27But when I speak to you and you tell them, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,’ the ones that listen will listen; the ones that won’t, won’t. They’re a rebellious house.         	Ezek 3:22-27</p>
<p>Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized</p>
<p>4:1“Now, son of man, take a tablet and etch Jerusalem on it. 2Lay a siege against it with a siege wall and ramp, pitch camps, and position battering rams all around it. 3Then set up an iron plate as a wall between you and the city. Face it and press the siege against it. It’s an omen for Israel.</p>
<p>4“Lie down on your left side, and I’ll lay Israel’s punishment on you. You’ll bear their punishment for the number of days you lie on it. 5Lie like that one day for each of the 390 years they’ve sinned. 6When you’ve finished, lie down on your right side, and bear Judah’s sin. I’ve assigned you 40 days, one for each year. 7Then you’ll face the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. 8I’ve tied you up with ropes so you can’t turn from one side to the other till you’ve finished the days of your siege. 	        Ezek 4:1-8</p>
<p>9“Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in one container and bake bread. Eat it for the 390 days you’re lying on your side. 10Once a day eat 8 oz 20 shekels of food 11and drink a quart ⅙ hin of water. 12Eat it like a barley cake after you’ve baked it in front of them over human feces. 13That’s how the Israelites will eat their bread unclean among the nations where I’ll banish them.”</p>
<p>14But I said, “Lord Yahveh, since I was a kid, I’ve never defiled myself by eating ceremonially unclean meat, anything that died, anything an animal had torn in pieces.”</p>
<p>15He said, “I’ll give you cow manure instead of human feces to bake your bread. 16I’m going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They’ll ration bread by weight with fear and water by measure in alarm. 17Bread and water will be scarce; people will look at one another in dismay and waste away in their sin.”</p>
<p>Ezek 4:9-17</p>
<p>5:1“Son of man, take a sharp sword and shave off your hair and beard. Divide up the hair on a scales. 2Burn a third of it in the center of the city when the siege is over. Strike a third of it with a sword all around the city. Scatter another third of it in the wind, because I’m going to chase my people with a drawn sword. 3Attach a few to the hem of your robe. 4Throw a few in the fire. They’ll spread from the fire to the whole House of Israel.  5I’ve set Jerusalem in the center of the nations. 6It rebelled against my ordinances and statutes more than those other nations did.” 	 Ezek 5:1-6</p>
<p>7So the Lord Yahveh says, “I’m against you; there’s more turmoil in you than in the nations around you. You haven’t followed my statutes or observed my ordinances or even [LXX] the ordinances of surrounding nations. 8I’ll carry out judgments on you for the nations to see. 9Because of your detestable deeds, I’ll do to you what I’ve never done before or will ever do again. 10Fathers will eat their own sons and sons will eat their fathers. My condemnations will scatter your remnant in every direction. 11As I live, I’ll withdraw from you because you’ve defiled my sanctuary with your detestable idols and graven images. I won’t pity or spare. 12A third of you will die by disease and starvation, a third will fall by the sword, a third I’ll scatter in every direction from a drawn sword.	      Ezek 5:7-12</p>
<p>13“That’s how I’ll vent my fury on you. You’ll know I’ve said so. 14I’ll make a wasteland out of you among the nations, something everyone that passes by will consider a disgrace, 15a taunt, a warning, something they’ll abhor when I carry out condemnations on you in anger and rebuke. 16When I send you the deadly arrows of famine meant for your foes, I’ll intensify it to break your staff of bread. 17Wiild animals will bereave you of your children. Disease, sword, and bloodshed will surge through you. I’ve said so.” 	Ezek 5:13-17</p>
<p>A Prophecy Against the Mountains of Israel</p>
<p>6:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, face Israel’s mountains and prophesy, 3‘Listen to the Lord Yahveh’s message to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys: “I’m going to bring a sword against you and destroy your high places. 4Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars smashed. You’ll fall slain in front of your idols, 5and I’ll scatter your bones around your altars. 6Everywhere you live, towns will be waste, high places desolate, idols broken, incense altars cut down, and the religious objects you’ve made, destroyed. 7You’ll know I’m Yahveh.</p>
<p>8“But I’ll leave a few of you. Some will escape the sword in the nations where you scatter. 9You’ll think back to me where they take you captive—how you’ve hurt me with your adulterous hearts and with eyes that carried on prostitution with idols. You’ll abhor yourselves for those detestable deeds. 10You’ll know I’m Yahveh, that I meant it when I said I’d inflict you with this disaster.”’     	Ezek 6:1-10</p>
<p>11“The Lord Yahveh says, ‘Clap your hands, stomp your feet, say, “This has happened because of Israel’s abominations. It will fall by sword, famine, and disease! 12The one that’s far off will die by the disease. The one that’s nearby will fall by the sword. The one that’s left and besieged will starve to death.” That’s how I’ll vent my fury on you. 13Your slain will lie among your idols, around your altars, on every tall hill and mountaintop, under every green tree and leafy terebinth tree—where you offered a soothing aroma to your idols. 14The land will be more desolate than the desert toward Diblah. That’s how you’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”	    Ezek 6:11-14</p>
<p>The End Has Come</p>
<p>7:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, the Lord Yahveh says to Israel, ‘The end is coming on the four corners of your land. 3I’ll judge you by your ways, direct my anger at you, and bring your detestable things against you. 4I won’t pity or spare when I bring on you the consequences of your deeds with the detestable things you’ve used.’  5A disaster—a unique disaster—is coming! 6The end is here! It has awakened against you! 7You’re doomed, resident in the land—confusion instead of happy shouting on the mountains. [8] 9You’ll know that I Yahveh am striking you.</p>
<p>10“The rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed, 11violence has grown into a rod of sinfulness. Nothing will remain of their multitude, their wealth, or anything outstanding that they have. 12The buyer shouldn’t celebrate, the seller shouldn’t mourn, because anger is aimed at their abundance. 13The seller won’t regain what he sold as long as they’re both alive, because the vision about their affluence won’t fade away. Because of his sin, neither will live.      	      Ezek 7:1-13</p>
<p>14“They’ve blown the bugle and everything’s ready, but nobody is going to battle because I’m angry with this whole population. 15The sword’s outside; famine and disease are inside. The ones out in the country will die by the sword; famine and disease will kill the ones in the city. 16Even when survivors escape, they’ll be on the mountains like pigeons from the valley, mourning over his sinfulness. 17Hands will hang limp; knees will be like water. 18They’ll put on burlap and shudder. Their faces will blush; their heads will be bald. 19They’ll toss their silver into the streets and abhor their gold. Their silver and gold won’t be able to deliver them from Yahveh’s anger. They won’t satisfy their hunger with it because that’s what made them stumble. 20The beautiful jewels they were so proud of, they used for making detestable idols; so I’ll turn their wealth into something detestable to them. 21I’ll give them to foreigners as plunder, to the sinful as spoil; and they’ll defile them. 22I’ll look the other way while invaders profane my precious land. Robbers will go in and defile it 23and make it desolate.    	Ezek 7:14-23a</p>
<p>“The land’s filled with bloody crimes; the city’s full of violence. 24So I’ll bring the worst of the nations to take over their houses. I’ll put an end to their proud strength and profane their holy places. 25When anguish comes, they’ll look for peace, but there won’t be any, 26just disaster on top of disaster, rumor on top of rumor. They’ll find no vision from a prophet; the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders. 27The king will mourn; the prince will put on rags; the people’s hands will tremble. I’ll deal with them by the way they’ve acted, judge them by their own judgments. They’ll know I’m Yahveh’”</p>
<p>Ezek 7:23b-27</p>
<p>Idolatry in the Temple</p>
<p>8:1The fifth day, sixth month, sixth year, I was sitting in my house with Judah’s elders sitting in front of me, and the hand of the Lord Yahveh came down on me. 2I saw what looked like a man. From the waist down, he looked like fire; from the waist up, he looked like bright glowing metal. 3He reached out and took hold of my hair. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and sky, and took me in a vision to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, to the seat of the idol that provokes jealousy. 4The glory of Israel’s God was there—like what I’d seen in the plain.</p>
<p>5He said, “Son of man, look north.” North of the altar gate at the entrance, I saw this idol that made God jealous. 6“Do you see the detestable things Israel is doing here to keep me out of my own sanctuary? But you’ll see still more detestable things.”  	       		        Ezek 8:1-6</p>
<p>7Then he took me to the entrance to the court and showed me a hole in the wall. 8“Dig through the wall.” I dug through it and found an entrance. 9“Go in and see what awful, detestable things they’re doing.” 10I went in and saw the shape of every crawling thing, every animal and detestable thing along with Israel’s idols carved all around the wall. 11Seventy elders of Israel were standing in front of them with Jaazaniah Ben-Shaphan. Each one was holding a censer, and the fragrance of the incense was rising in a cloud.</p>
<p>12“See what Israel’s elders are doing in the dark in the room of carved images? They’re saying, ‘Yahveh’s not watching us; he’s abandoned the land.’ 13You’ll see still more detestable things they’re doing.”        	        	        Ezek 8:7-13</p>
<p>14He took me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple. Women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. 15“See that? You’ll see still more detestable things.” 16He took me to the inner court. At the entrance to the Temple between the porch and altar, about 25 men with their backs to the Temple were facing east, prostrating themselves toward the sun.</p>
<p>17“See that? Isn’t it enough for Judah to do those detestable things, that they’ve filled the land with violence and provoked me time and again? They’re putting a twig up their nose. 18I’ll deal in anger. I won’t pity or spare. Though they call out loudly, ‘ll ignore them.”          			      	      Ezek 8:14-18</p>
<p>Idolaters Killed</p>
<p>9:1He shouted, “Executioners, come here with your weapons.” 2Six men holding a shattering weapon, came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. One of them was wearing linen with a scribe’s inkhorn on his hip. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</p>
<p>3The glory of God rose up from the cherub it rested on and went to the threshold of the Temple. He called out to the man with the inkhorn, 	  Ezek 9:1-3</p>
<p>4“Go all over the city and mark the foreheads of people who sigh and groan over the detestable things going on here.” 5-6He told the others, “Follow him and kill old men, young men, girls, little children, and women. Don’t pity or spare, but don’t touch anybody with the mark. Start at my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders that were in front of the Temple. 7He told them, “Defile the Temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down the people in the city. 8While they were striking them down and I was by myself, I fell on my face and shouted, “Lord Yahveh! Are you going to destroy the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out your anger on Jerusalem?”</p>
<p>9He told me, “The sinfulness of Israel and Judah is extreme. The land is filled with blood; the city is full of perversion. They’re saying, ‘Yahveh has abandoned the land; he’s not watching us!’ 10I won’t pity or spare. I’ll bring the consequences of their actions on their own heads.”</p>
<p>11The man with the inkhorn reported, “I’ve done what you said.”                          	           Ezek 9:4-11</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Glory Leaves the Temple</p>
<p>10:1Then in the expanse above the cherubs, I saw something like a sapphire stone shaped like a throne. 2He spoke to the man dressed in linen, “Go between the turning wheels under the cherubs and fill your hands with coals. Scatter them over the city.” I watched him go in.</p>
<p>3The cherubs were standing on the right side of the Temple when he went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 4The glory of Yahveh rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the Temple. The cloud filled the Temple, and the bright glory of Yahveh filled the court. 5The cherubs’ wings could be heard all the way to the outer court—like God Almighty when he speaks.	   Ezek 10:1-5</p>
<p>6When he told the man in linen to take fire from between the turning wheels, he went in and stood beside a wheel. 7A cherub reached out to the fire between the cherubs, took some coals, and put them in the man’s hand. He took them and went out. 8The cherubs had what looked like a man’s hand under their wings.</p>
<p>9Then I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one beside each one. The wheels glowed like chrysolite. 10All four looked alike as if one wheel was inside another wheel. 11When they moved they went in any of four directions without turning from the direction they faced. 12Their whole bodies were covered with eyes—backs, hands, wings, and their wheels. 13I heard the wheels called “whirling wheels.” 14They had four faces each—a cherub, man, lion, and eagle.</p>
<p>Ezek 10:6-14</p>
<p>15The cherubs rose up—the living beings I’d seen by the Chebar River. 16When they moved, the wheels went beside them. When they lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels stayed beside them. 17When they stood still, the wheels stood still, because the spirit of the living beings was in them.</p>
<p>18The glory of Yahveh went from the Temple threshold to stand above the cherubs. 19When they left, I saw them lift their wings and rise up from the ground with the wheels beside them. They stood at the entrance of the Temple’s east gate, and the glory of God hovered over them. 20They were the living beings I’d seen below God by the Chebar River; so I knew they were cherubs. [21-22]	Ezek 10:15-22</p>
<p>Judgment on Israel’s Leaders</p>
<p>11:1The Spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of theY Temple. There were 25 men at the entrance of the gate, including Jaazaniah Ben-Azzur and Pelatiah Ben-Benaiah, leaders of the people. 2He told me,</p>
<p>“Those men devise sin and give bad advice in this city. 3They say, ‘Isn’t it time to build houses? This city is the pot and we’re the meat.’ 4So prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!” 	Ezek 11:1-4</p>
<p>5The Spirit of Yahveh fell on me:</p>
<p>“Say, ‘Yahveh says, “I know your thoughts. 6You’ve multiplied the slain in this city and filled its streets with them. 7‘So the slain are the meat, and the city is the pot; but I’ll take you out of it. 8You’ve been afraid of the sword; so I’ll bring the sword on you. 9I’ll remove you from the city and deliver you to foreigners to carry out your condemnation. 10You’ll fall by the sword all the way to Israel’s border. 11This city won’t be a pot for you, and you won’t be the meat in it. 12You’ll know I’m Yahveh because you haven’t followed my statutes or carried out my ordinances. You’ve followed the ordinances of the nations around you.”’”</p>
<p>13As I prophesied, Pelatiah died. I fell on my face and shouted, “Lord Yahveh! Are you going to put an end to the remnant of Israel completely?”					     Ezek 11:5-13</p>
<p>A New Heart and Spirit for Israel</p>
<p>14A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>15“Son of man, your brothers, relatives, fellow exiles, and the whole House of Israel are the ones the people in Jerusalem have told, ‘Go far away from Yahveh; we’ve received this land.’ 16So say, ‘The Lord Yahveh says, “Though I’ve removed them far away, yet I’ve been a sanctuary for them a little while where they’ve gone. 17I’ll gather them out of those countries back to Israel.”’ 18They’ll get rid of its abominations and detestable things. 19I’ll give them one heart and a new spirit. I’ll take out their stone heart and give them a real one 20so they can follow my statutes and keep my ordinances. They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. 21Those who go after detestable things will have the consequences of their conduct come down on their own heads,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says.   	   Ezek 11:14-21</p>
<p>22Then the cherubs lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of God hovered over them. 23His glory went up from the city and stood above the mountain east of it. 24The Spirit of God lifted me up and took me in a vision to the exiles in Babylonia. So the vision I’d seen left me. 25I told the exiles what Yahveh had shown me. 	   Ezek 11:22-25</p>
<p>Judah’s Exile Symbolized</p>
<p>12:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, you’re living with a rebellious people. They have eyes but don’t see, and ears but don’t hear. 3So get together baggage for exile and go into exile in the daytime so they can watch; go from one place to another. Maybe they’ll understand, though they’re a rebellious house. 4Bring your baggage out in the daytime. Then go out in the evening as if you’re going into exile. 5Make a hole in the wall so they can watch you go out through it.           	Ezek 12:1-5</p>
<p>6“Put the baggage on your shoulder and carry it out in the dark. Cover your face so you can’t see where you’re going. I’m using you as an object lesson for Israel.”</p>
<p>7So in the daytime I brought out my baggage like an exile. In the evening I made a hole in the wall with my hands. I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder while they watched. 	Ezek 12:6-78In the morning a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>9“Son of man, hasn’t the rebellious House of Israel asked you what you’re doing? 10Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahveh says, “This oracle is about the official in Jerusalem and the House of Israel that’s there.” 11I’m an object lesson for you. As I’ve done, you’ll do. you’ll go into exile.’ 12The official that’s among you will put his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. He’ll make a hole in the wall to take it out. He’ll cover his face so he can’t see where he’s going. 13‘I’ll throw my net over him and take him to Babylon among the Babylonians, but he won’t see it even though he’s going to die there. 14I’ll scatter in every direction his helpers and troops, and chase them with a sword. 15They’ll know I’m Yahveh when I scatter them among the countries. 16I’ll spare a few from sword, famine, and disease so they can confess their detestable acts to the nations where they go.”      	Ezek 12:8-16</p>
<p>17A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>18“Son of man, eat your bread cringing; drink your water shuddering with anxiety. 19Then tell the people the Lord Yahveh says, ‘The people in Jerusalem will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with alarm, because everybody living there will strip them violently. 20The populated towns will be laid waste; the land will be desolate. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.”” 	Ezek 12:17-20</p>
<p>21A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>22“Son of man, what’s this proverb you people have about Israel, ‘The days are long and every vision fails’? 23Tell them the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll make this proverb stop being used. The time’s coming soon for fulfilling every vision. 24From now on, there won’t be false vision or flattering fortunetelling in Israel. 25I’ll speak and it’ll happen without delay. In your days, rebellious people, what I’ll say I’ll do,’”</p>
<p>26A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>27“Son of man, Israel is saying, ‘The vision he sees is for years from now.’ 28Tell them, ‘None of what I’m saying will delay any longer. It will happen soon,’” 	the Lord Yahveh says. 	   Ezek 12:21-28</p>
<p>False Prophets Condemned</p>
<p>13:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, prophesy against Israel’s prophets who prophesy their own ideas, 3‘The Lord Yahveh says, “Misfortune awaits foolish prophets that follow their own imagination and haven’t seen anything. 4Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins. 5You haven’t gone up into the breaches or built the wall around the House of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of Yahveh. 6They see falsehood and lying fortunetelling who say, ‘Yahveh says,’ when heY hasn’t sent them. They’re just hoping their message will be what happens. 7Didn’t you see a false vision and say a lying fortunetelling when you said, ‘Yahveh says’? I’m not the one that spoke.”’” 	Ezek 13:1-7</p>
<p>8“So because you’ve lied, 9I’m against the prophets that see false visions and say lying fortunetelling. You won’t be in the council of my people, be recorded in the registry of Israel, or go to the land of Israel. You’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh. 10That’s because you’ve misled my people by saying, ‘Peace!’ when there isn’t any. When somebody builds a wall, he daubs it with whitewash. 11Tell him it will fall. A downpour will come, hailstones will fall, violent wind will blow. 12When it falls, won’t they ask you where the plaster is you daubed on it?’”</p>
<p>Ezek 13:8-12</p>
<p>13So the Lord Yahveh says, “In my anger I’ll make a violent wind break out with hailstones and a downpour to bring down that wall. 14What you daubed with whitewash I’ll bring down till its foundation shows. When it falls, it will bring you down with it. You’ll know I’m Yahveh. 15I’ll spend my anger on the wall and the ones that whitewashed it. I’ll tell you, ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers too, 16along with the prophets in Jerusalem that see visions of peace for it when there isn’t any.’</p>
<p>17“Now, son of man, set your face against your people that are prophesying from their own imagination. Prophesy against them, 18‘Misfortune awaits women that sew magic bands on everybody’s wrists and make every size of veil for the people’s heads to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down my people, but preserve others for yourselves? 19For handfuls of barley and scraps of bread, you’ve profaned me to my people, killing some who shouldn’t die and protecting others that shouldn’t live. You’ve done it by lying to my people.’ 	         Ezek 13:13-19</p>
<p>20“I’m against the magic bands you use to hunt lives like birds. I’ll tear them off your arms and let go the ones you hunt like birds. 21I’ll tear off your veils and deliver my people from you. They won’t be in your hands to be hunted. 22Since you disheartened good people with falsehood when I didn’t cause them grief, since you’ve encouraged the wicked not to turn from their sins and have kept them alive, 23your women won’t see false visions anymore or practice fortunetelling. I’ll deliver my people from you. That’s how you’ll know I’m Yahveh.” 	  Ezek 13:20-23</p>
<p>Israel’s Idolatrous Leaders Condemned</p>
<p>14:1Then some elders of Israel came and sat down in front of me. 2A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>3“Son of man, these people have set up idols in their hearts, and put their sins in front of them to trip over. Should they consult me? 4So tell them, ‘The Lord Yahveh says, “If any Israelites or immigrants in Israel set up idols in their heart, put their sin in front of him to trip over, and then come to a prophet to inquire from me, I’ll answer them myself because of their many idols. 5I’ll do it to lay hold of the hearts in Israel that are alienated from me by their idols.”’	Ezek 14:1-5</p>
<p>6’So repent and turn away from your detestable idols. [7] 8I’ll oppose you and make an example out of you and a proverb. I’ll cut you off from my people. So you’ll know I’m Yahveh. 9But if the prophet is tempted to speak a message, I’m the one that tempted him, and I’ll destroy him from my people. 10The inquirer and the prophet will get the same punishment for their iniquity. 11That’s so Israel won’t stray from me anymore and defile themselves with their sins.’”	Ezek 14:6-11</p>
<p>Jerusalem Not Spared</p>
<p>12A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>13“Son of man, if a country is unfaithful to me, and I destroy its food supply, send famine on it, and slay its people and animals, 14even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they’d only deliver themselves. 15If I let wild animals overrun it and make it so dangerous nobody would go through it, 16though these three men were in it, as I live, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They’d only deliver themselves; the country would be a wasteland. 17If I bring a sword on that country to cut off people and animals, 18though these three men were in it, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They’d only deliver themselves. 19If I send a disease on it and pour out my anger on it to slay people and animals, 20even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They would only deliver themselves by their goodness.</p>
<p>Ezek 14:12-20</p>
<p>21“How much more, then, when I send my four severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild animals, and disease to slay people and animals in it! 22But some children will survive and come out to you to comfort you from the catastrophe I’ve brought on Jerusalem. 23They’ll comfort you when you see their deeds, and you’ll know I’ve done it for a reason.” 	 Ezek 14:21-23</p>
<p>Jerusalem, a Useless Vine</p>
<p>15:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, how does the wood in a grapevine compare to the wood in a tree limb? 3Can you make anything out of grapevine wood, say, a peg to hang a bucket on? 4If it’s been put in the fire for fuel, is burned on both ends and charred in the middle, can you make anything out of it? 5If it’s intact and you can’t make it into anything, how much less when fire has burned and charred it.” 6So the Lord Yahveh says, “Like grapevine wood that I’ve put in the fire for fuel, I’ve given up the people in Jerusalem. 7Though they’ve come out of the fire, it’s charred them. You’ll know I’m Yahveh when I set myself against them. 8I’ll make the country desolate because they’ve been unfaithful.” 	Ezek 15:1-8</p>
<p>Jerusalem, an Unfaithful Wife</p>
<p>16:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, confront Jerusalem about her detestable things. 3Say, ‘Your birth was from the Canaanites—an Amorite father and a Hittite mother. 4When you were born, your umbilical cord wasn’t cut off, you weren’t washed, or rubbed with salt, or even wrapped in cloth. 5Nobody took pity on you to do any of those things for you. You were tossed out in an open field because you were repulsive.</p>
<p>Ezek 16:1-5</p>
<p>6“When I went by and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you, ‘Live!’ 7I made you as numerous as plants in a field. You grew up tall and filled out. Your breasts formed and your hair grew, but you were naked and bare. 8Then I went by and saw you were at the age to be sexually active; so I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my word and made a covenant with you so you’d be mine. 9I gave you a bath, washed off your blood, and anointed you with oil. 10I dressed you with embroidered cloth, put porpoise-skin sandals on you, wrapped you in fine linen, and covered you with silk. 11I adorned you with bracelets, a necklace, 12a ring in your nostril, earrings, and a beautiful crown. 13You wore gold and silver, fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were especially beautiful, and advanced to royalty. 14You became famous in every country because of your beauty. It was perfect because of the splendor I put on you. 	Ezek 16:6-14</p>
<p>15“But you trusted in your beauty and played the prostitute because you were famous. You poured out your prostitutions on every passer-by that was willing. 16You took some of your clothes and made high places of various colors, and played the prostitute on them. That shouldn’t have happened. 17You took the beautiful gold and silver jewels I gave you, and made male images so you could carry on prostitution with them. 18You took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered my oil and incense to them. 19The bread I gave you, the fine flour, oil, and honey I fed you, you offered in front of them for a soothing aroma. 20You took the sons and daughters you bore to me and sacrificed them to idols. Were your prostitutions a small thing? 21You slaughtered my children and offered them up to idols by making them pass through fire. 22Besides your abominations and prostitutions, you forgot your youth when you were naked, squirming in your blood. 	Ezek 16:15-22</p>
<p>23“Then after all your sinfulness (The Lord Yahveh says, ‘Misfortune awaits you!’), 24you built a shrine and made a high place in every square. 25You built a high place at the head of every street and made your beauty detestable. You spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your prostitution. 26You carried on prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, to make me angry. 27I reached out against you, diminished your rations, and delivered you to those who hate you, the young women of the Philistines, who are embarrassed by your lewd behavior. 28You carried on prostitution with the Assyrians 29and multiplied it with the merchants of Babylon. You still weren’t satisfied.”’”    	Ezek 16:23-29</p>
<p>30“How lovesick your heart is,” the Lord Yahveh says, “while you do all this brazen prostitution. 31When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you weren’t like a prostitute—32you adulteress wife that takes strangers instead of your husband! 33Men pay prostitutes but you pay your lovers to get them to come to you. 34Nobody carries on prostitution like you do. You do the paying!”</p>
<p>Ezek 16:30-34</p>
<p>35So, prostitute, listen to what Yahveh says, 36“Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers and your detestable idols, and because of your sons’ blood that you gave to idols, 37I’ll gather the lovers you had pleasure with, the ones both loved and hated. I’ll gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them. 38That’s how I’ll judge you—like women that commit adultery or shed blood. I’ll bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 39I’ll deliver you to your lovers. They’ll tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip off your clothes, steal your jewels, and leave you naked. 40They’ll stir up a mob against you, stone you, and cut you to pieces with swords. 41Many women will watch me burn your houses and carry out judgments on you. I’ll make you quit being a prostitute. You won’t be paying your lovers anymore. 42I’ll calm my fury against you. My jealousy will leave you, and I’ll be at peace. 43Since you’ve forgotten your youth and angered me with those things, I’ll bring your deeds down on your own head. So you won’t continue to commit that lewdness in addition to your other disgusting deeds. 	Ezek 16:35-43</p>
<p>44“Everybody that quotes sayings will quote this one about you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ 45You’re your mother’s daughter, who despised her husband and children. You’re your sisters’ sister, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite; your father was an Amorite. 46Your older sister is Samaria that lives north of you with her daughters. Your younger sister is Sodom that lives south of you with her daughters. 47You haven’t just done disgusting things like theirs; you’ve done worse. 48As I live, Sodom your sister and her daughters haven’t done like you and your daughters have done. 49This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she didn’t help the poor and needy. 50They were arrogant and committed disgusting sins in my presence; so I removed them. 51Samaria didn’t commit half the sins you did. 52Deal with your disgrace because you’ve made judgment easier on your sisters. Your sins are worse than theirs. They’re better than you. Be ashamed and deal with your disgrace, because by comparison you make your sisters look good. 	Ezek 16:44-52</p>
<p>53“But, I’ll overturn the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, along with your captivity, 54so you can deal with your humiliation, and feel ashamed of everything you’ve done when you become a consolation to them. 55Your sisters, Sodom and Samaria with their daughters, will come back to their former condition, and you with your daughters will come back to your former condition. 56-57Before your own sinfulness was revealed, you wouldn’t even say the name of your sister Sodom in your pride. 57So now you’ve become the disgrace of the Edomites and everybody around them, the disgrace of the Philistines, people around you that despise you. 58You’ve borne the penalty for your lewdness. 59I’ll do to you what you’ve done—you that have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.	Ezek 16:53-59</p>
<p>60“Nevertheless, I’ll remember my covenant with you when you were young, and I’ll establish an everlasting covenant with you. 61Then you’ll remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters Samaria and</p>
<p>Sodom, your older and younger ones. I’ll give them to you as daughters even though they’re not part of our covenant. 62That’s how I’ll re-establish my covenant with you, and you’ll know I’m Yahveh. 63In your humiliation, you won’t open your mouth when I forgive you for everything you’ve done,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says. 	     Ezek 16:60-63</p>
<p>Two Eagles and a Vine</p>
<p>17:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, tell Israel this parable. 3‘A large eagle with big wings, long pinions, and full plumage of many colors flew to Lebanon and plucked off 4the top of a cedar tree. He took it to a land filled with merchants and planted it in a city full of tradesmen. 5He also took a seedling from the land and planted it in fertile soil, like a willow beside a stream. 6It took root and became a low, spreading vine with branches turned upward toward the eagle and roots growing down into the soil. It put out shoots and grew branches. 	Ezek 17:1-6</p>
<p>7‘But then another large eagle came along with big wings and full plumage. Now the vine bent its roots and branches toward him so he would water it. 8It was already planted in good soil beside plenty of water so it could grow branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.’ 9Say, ‘The Lord Yahveh asks, “Will it thrive? I’ll pull it up by the roots, cut off its fruit, and let its leaves wither. I won’t need great strength or a big army to uproot it. 10If it’s transplanted, will it thrive? It will completely wither when the east wind blows on it in the soil where it had grown so well before.”’”	Ezek 17:7-10</p>
<p>11A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>12“Say to this rebellious nation, ‘Do you know what that parable means? The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and officials to Babylon. 13He made a covenant with one royal family member and put him under oath. He took away the leaders in the land 14so the kingdom would stay subject to him and not try to mount an insurrection. That way it could continue. 15But the royal seed rebelled and sent ambassadors to Egypt to get horses and troops. Will that work? Will anybody avoid the consequences of doing something like that? Can he break the covenant and get away with it? 16As I live, he’ll die in Babylon—in the land of the king that put him on the throne, whose oath he disregarded, whose covenant he broke. 17Pharaoh’s large, powerful army won’t help the royal seed in war, when the Babylonians build mounds and siege walls to take countless lives. 18The royal seed disregarded the oath by breaking the covenant; he pledged allegiance but rebelled. He won’t get away with it.’”</p>
<p>19So the Lord Yahveh says: “As I live, I’ll bring down on his head consequences of the solemn oath he disregarded, and the covenant sworn in my name that he broke. 20I’ll cast my net over him, take him to Babylon, and condemn him there for his unfaithfulness to me. 21His elite troops will fall by the sword; survivors will scatter in every direction. You’ll know I Yahveh have said it.” 	  Ezek 17:11-21</p>
<p>22-23“I’ll pluck a young tender twig from the highest branches of a cedar tree and plant it on Israel’s high mountain. It will put out branches, produce seed, and become a stately cedar birds will nest in. 24All the trees will know I’m Yahveh. I’ll cut down the tall tree, grow up the short one, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I’m Yahveh; I’ll do what I say.”	 Ezek 17:22-24</p>
<p>The Soul That Sins Will Die</p>
<p>18:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“What do you mean by the proverb about Israel,</p>
<p>‘The parents ate sour grapes,</p>
<p>and the children’s mouths puckered’?</p>
<p>3As I live, you’re not going to use that proverb in Israel anymore. 4Every soul belongs to me, the parent’s as well as the children’s. The soul that sins is the one that dies.</p>
<p>5“If a man practices goodness,</p>
<p>6doesn’t eat at the mountain shrines or</p>
<p>look up to the idols in Israel,</p>
<p>defile his neighbor’s wife or</p>
<p>approach a woman during her period;</p>
<p>7if he doesn’t oppress anybody, but</p>
<p>restores the debtor’s pledge;</p>
<p>if he doesn’t steal,</p>
<p>but feeds the hungry and clothes the naked,</p>
<p>8if he doesn’t lend money with interest</p>
<p>or take increase,</p>
<p>if he keeps from sinning and</p>
<p>carries out true goodness between people,</p>
<p>9if he follows my statutes and ordinances to deal faithfully—</p>
<p>he’s good; he’ll live.” 		 Ezek 18:1-9</p>
<p>10“If he has a violent son that</p>
<p>sheds blood and</p>
<p>does any of those sins to a brother 11(though the father didn’t</p>
<p>do any of them himself)—</p>
<p>eats at the mountain shrines and</p>
<p>defiles his neighbor’s wife,</p>
<p>12oppresses the poor and needy,</p>
<p>steals,</p>
<p>doesn’t return a pledge, but</p>
<p>looks up to idols and</p>
<p>commits disgusting acts,</p>
<p>13lends money with interest—</p>
<p>will he live? No! He’s committed detestable acts;</p>
<p>put him to death. His blood will be on himself. 	Ezek 18:10-13</p>
<p>14“If he has a son that’s seen his father’s sins and doesn’t do them—</p>
<p>15if he doesn’t eat at the mountain shrines or</p>
<p>look up to idols in Israel or</p>
<p>defile his neighbor’s wife,</p>
<p>16if he doesn’t oppress anybody or</p>
<p>keep a pledge or steal,</p>
<p>but gives bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked,</p>
<p>17refuses to hurt the poor,</p>
<p>doesn’t take interest or increase,</p>
<p>but carries out my ordinances and follows my statutes—</p>
<p>he won’t die for his father’s sins; he’ll live. 	Ezek 18:14-17</p>
<p>18Because the father practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what wasn’t good, he’ll die for his own sins.</p>
<p>19“Yet you say, ‘Why shouldn’t a child take the punishment for a parent’s sins?’ When children practice goodness and observe my statutes, they’ll live. 20The one that sins is the one that dies. An offspring won’t take the punishment for a parent’s sins or vice versa. A person’s goodness or sinfulness applies to the one that does it. 		Ezek 18:18-20</p>
<p>21“If sinful people quit sinning, keep my statutes, and practice goodness, they’ll live. 22The sins they’ve committed I won’t hold against them. Because they’re practicing goodness now, they’ll live. 23Do I get any satisfaction out of seeing a sinner die,” the Lord Yahveh says, “instead of turning from sin and living?</p>
<p>24“But when good people turn away from their goodness, and do what sinful people do, will they live? I won’t consider their good deeds before; they’ll die for the treachery they’re committing now. 25Yet you say Yahveh’s way’s not right. Listen, Israel! Aren’t your ways the ones that aren’t right? 26When good people turn away from their goodness, they’ll die in their sin. 27When sinful people quit sinning and practice what’s right, they’ll save their life. 28They’ll live because they thought it over and turned away from their sin. 29But Israel says, Yahveh’s way isn’t right.’ Aren’t my ways right, Israel? Aren’t your ways the ones that aren’t? 		Ezek 18:21-29</p>
<p>30“So I’ll judge you, Israel, each person by their own behavior. Repent and quit sinning so your sins won’t make you stumble. 31Get rid of them. Make a new heart and spirit for yourselves! Why die, Israel? 32I don’t get any satisfaction out of seeing anybody die. So repent and live.” 	Ezek 18:30-32</p>
<p>A Funeral Song for Israel’s Princes</p>
<p>19:1“Sing this funeral song for Israel’s officials:</p>
<p>2‘What was your mother?</p>
<p>A lioness among lions!</p>
<p>She lay down among young lions;</p>
<p>she raised her cubs.</p>
<p>3When she brought up one of her cubs,</p>
<p>he became a young lion,</p>
<p>learned to catch prey,</p>
<p>and devoured people.				Ezek 19:1-3</p>
<p>4Then nations heard about him.</p>
<p>They captured him in their pit,</p>
<p>and brought him with hooks to Egypt.</p>
<p>5As time went on, she saw</p>
<p>that her hope was lost,</p>
<p>and took another of her cubs</p>
<p>and made him a young lion.</p>
<p>6He walked around among the lions.</p>
<p>He became a young lion</p>
<p>learned to catch prey,</p>
<p>and devoured people. 				Ezek 19:4-6</p>
<p>7He destroyed their fortresses</p>
<p>and laid waste their towns;</p>
<p>everybody in the</p>
<p>were terrified at his roaring.</p>
<p>8Then nations attacked him</p>
<p>on every side from their provinces.</p>
<p>They threw their net over him,</p>
<p>and captured him in their pit.</p>
<p>9With hooks they put him in a cage,</p>
<p>and took him to the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>They took him in hunting nets</p>
<p>so people could hear him anymore</p>
<p>on the mountains in Israel. 			Ezek 19:7-9</p>
<p>10Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,</p>
<p>planted near water.</p>
<p>It was fruitful and lots of branches</p>
<p>because it had plenty of water.</p>
<p>11Its strong stems became rulers’ scepters.</p>
<p>It was taller than the clouds,</p>
<p>so it could be seen with its mass of branches.</p>
<p>12But it was plucked up in fury</p>
<p>and dashed to the ground.</p>
<p>The east wind dried up its fruit.</p>
<p>and tore off and withered its strong branches.</p>
<p>Fire burned it up.					Ezek 19:10-12</p>
<p>13Now it stands in the wilderness,</p>
<p>in a dry, thirsty land.</p>
<p>14The fire that broke out in its branches</p>
<p>and burned up its fruit</p>
<p>didn’t leave any branch</p>
<p>strong enough to be a ruler’s scepter.’”</p>

<p>Israel’s Rebellion</p>
<p>20:1The tenth day, fifth month, seventh year, some of Israel’s elders came to inquire from Yahveh and sat in front of me. 2A message from him came to me:</p>
<p>3“Son of man, tell Israel’s elders the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Are you coming to inquire from me? As I live, I won’t let you.’</p>
<p>4“Are you willing to judge them, son of man? Then remind them about their ancestors’ detestable deeds. 5Tell them that when I chose Israel, swore to Jacob’s descendants, and made myself known to them in Egypt,6I swore I’d take them out of Egypt to a land I’d chosen, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all the lands. 7I told them to throw away the detestable things their eyes feasted on and not defile themselves with Egypt’s idols. I’m Yahveh their God. 8But they wouldn’t discard them. 	 Ezek 20:1-8a</p>
<p>“So I resolved to pour out my wrath on them in Egypt. 9I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the nations that I revealed myself to by bringing Israel out of Egypt. 10So I took them into the desert, 11and gave them my statutes and ordinances that would give people life if they kept them. 12I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us so they’d know I’m Yahveh who sanctifies them. 13But Israel rebelled. So I resolved to pour out my anger on them in the desert and wipe them out. [14] 15I swore to them there that I wouldn’t bring them to the land I’d given them. [16] 17Yet I didn’t wipe them out in the desert. 	Ezek 20:8b-17</p>
<p>18“I told their children in the desert, ‘Don’t follow the statutes of your fathers, keep their ordinances, or defile yourselves with their idols. 19I’m Yahveh your God; follow my statutes and keep my ordinances, 20sanctify my Sabbaths as a sign between us so you can know that I’m Yahveh their God.’ 21But the children wouldn’t do it. 22I withdrew my hand to keep my name from being profaned in the nations that saw me bring them out of Egypt. 23I swore to them in the desert that I’d scatter them among the nations 24for their rebellion. 25I let them keep statutes that weren’t good and ordinances that couldn’t give life. 26I pronounced them unclean for making their firstborn pass through fire so I could make them desolate.			  Ezek 20:18-26</p>
<p>Judgment and Restoration</p>
<p>27“So, son of man, tell Israel the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Your ancestors blasphemed me by acting deceitfully against me. 28When I did bring them to the land I swore to give them, they looked at every tall hill and leafy tree, and offered their sacrifices there and presented their provoking offerings. They made their soothing aroma and poured out their liquid offerings. 29Then I said to them, “What’s the ‘high place’ that you go to?” Its name is still Bamah.’ 30So say to Israel the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Will you defile yourselves like your ancestors did, and carry on prostitution with their detestable things? 31When you offer your gifts—making your sons pass through fire—you’re still defiling yourselves with your idols. Will you inquire from me, House of Israel? As I live, I won’t let you.</p>
<p>32“What you imagine won’t happen—as when you say you’ll be like the nations and tribes in the lands and serve wood and stone.’    	   Ezek 20:27-32</p>
<p>33“As I live, I’ll rule you with a strong hand, outstretched arm, and anger poured out. 34From the lands where you’re scattered, 35I’ll take you to the wilderness of the nations and judge you directly 36like I judged your ancestors in the desert in Egypt. 37I’ll make you pass evaluation and bring you into the covenant. 38I’ll purge from you the rebels that sin against me. I’ll bring you out of the land where you’re living temporarily, but you won’t enter Israel. So you’ll know I’m Yahveh.</p>
<p>39“Go on and serve your idols, Israel; later you’ll listen. You won’t profane my holy name anymore with your idols and offerings.   	Ezek 20:33-39</p>
<p>40-41“On my holy hill, Israel’s high mountain, the whole House of Israel will serve me. Like a soothing aroma, I’ll accept you there and seek your contributions and choice gifts with your holy things. I’ll prove myself holy among you for the nations to see 42when I bring you to the land I swore to give your ancestors. 43You’ll think back there to the ways you defiled yourselves, and you’ll despise yourselves for the sins you’ve committed. 44You’ll know I’m Yahveh when I’ve dealt with you to maintain my reputation more than to punish your sins.’”</p>
<p>Ezek 20:40-44</p>
<p>Judgment Against the Negev</p>
<p>45A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>46“Son of man, face Teman. Prophesy against the south, against the forest in the Negev, 47‘Listen to what the Lord Yahveh says, “I’m about to light a fire in you that will burn up every tree in you, green or dry. It won’t be put out till it has burned the whole surface from south to north. 48Everybody will see that I lit it.”’”</p>
<p>49Then I said, “Lord Yahveh, they’re saying I’m just telling stories.”</p>
<p>Ezek 20:45-49</p>
<p>Babylon, God’s Sword of Judgment</p>
<p>21:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, face Jerusalem. Speak against its sanctuaries and prophesy against Israel, 3‘Yahveh says, “I’ll draw my sword and slay the good and the bad in you, 4everybody from south to north. 5Everyone will know I’ve drawn it, and it won’t go back into its sheath.”’</p>
<p>6“Son of man, moan with breaking heart and bitter grief. 7When they ask why you’re moaning, say, ‘Over the news that’s coming. Hearts will melt, hands will go limp, spirits will faint, knees will be as weak as water.’” 	Ezek 21:1-7</p>
<p>8Again, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>9“Son of man, prophesy,</p>
<p>‘A sword, a sword,</p>
<p>sharpened and polished!</p>
<p>10sharpened for slaughter,</p>
<p>polished to flash like lightning!</p>
<p>Or should we be happy? Son, you’ve despised the rod and everything wood. 11A sword is sharpened and polished for the executioner. 12Cry out and wail, son of man. It’s against my people and their officials. They’ve been delivered to the sword, so strike your thigh. 13It won’t be for disciplining. What good would that do if you despise the rod? 	Ezek 21:8-13</p>
<p>14‘So prophesy, son of man. Clap your hands; bring the sword down twice, three times on the slain, for the great slaughter on everyone around. 15Their hearts will melt and many will fall at their gates. I’ve provided the glittering sword, made for striking like lightning, wrapped and ready for slaughter, 16to cut sharp wherever it’s aimed. 17I’ll clap my hands and vent my fury. I’ve said so.’”</p>
<p>Ezek 21:14-17</p>
<p>18A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>19“Son of man, mark two roads for the king of Babylon to take that fork off from the same land. Put up a sign at the beginning of the road to each city. 20Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah in Ammon and Jerusalem in Judah. 21The king of Babylon is standing at the fork in the road ready to use fortunetelling, to shake arrows, to consult household idols, to inspect the liver. 22The lot for Jerusalem comes into his right hand, to set up battering rams against its gates, to lift up the battle cry for slaughter, to build mounds and a siege wall. 23It will seem to them like false fortunetelling; they’ve sworn solemn oaths. But he’s remembering their sin; so he’ll seize them.</p>
<p>24“So the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Because you’ve made your sin memorable and your transgressions evident in everything you do, they’ll take you. 25You slain sinful, prince of Israel, whose time has come for final punishment, 26take off your turban, remove your crown. Things are going to be different. Raise up what’s low, abase what’s high. 27I’ll make it a ruin. There won’t be any trace of it till the one comes that I’ve given the right to have it.’      		     		     Ezek 21:18-27</p>
<p>28“So prophesy, son of man, ‘The Lord Yahveh says about the Ammonites and their disgrace: ‘a sword drawn, polished to slaughter like lightning—29while they see false visions for you, while they tell you lying fortunes—to place that sword on the necks of the sinful slain at their time of final punishment. 30Put it back in its sheath. I’ll condemn you where you originated. 31I’ll pour out my indignation on you, blow fire on you out of my anger, and turn you over to brutal men that know how to destroy. 32You’ll be fuel for the fire; your blood will be spilled in your own land. You’ll be forgotten. I’ve said so.’”	   Ezek 21:28-32</p>
<p>Israel’s Sins</p>
<p>22:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, are you willing to judge the bloody city? Then tell it about its abominations. 3Say, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“A city that sheds blood in it,</p>
<p>a city whose time will come,</p>
<p>a city that makes idols to defile itself!</p>
<p>4-5You’ve become guilty by shedding blood</p>
<p>and defiled by making idols.</p>
<p>You’ve brought your appointed time near,</p>
<p>you infamous one full of turmoil;</p>
<p>I’ve made you a disgrace to nations near and far,</p>
<p>something to ridicule. 			        	Ezek 22:1-5</p>
<p>6“Every ruler in Israel is intent on shedding blood, each according to his power. 7They treat parents with contempt, oppress foreigners, wrong the fatherless and widows. 8They despise my holy things and profane my Sabbaths. 9Slanderous men accuse falsely to get the death penalty, eat at the mountain shrine, commit lewd acts. 10They uncover their father’s nakedness and rape women that are in their period. 11One commit detestable acts with his neighbor’s wife, another defiles his daughter-in-law, another rapes his sister. 12You do murder for hire, charge interest, oppress other people for gain, and forget me.”</p>
<p>13“I slap my hand at your bloodshed and crooked gain. 14Will you have the courage and strength to deal with me when I do what I’ve said? 15I’ll scatter you across the nations and burn off your uncleanness. 16You’ll profane yourself in the sight of the nations. You’ll know I’m Yahveh.”’”   	  Ezek 22:6-16</p>
<p>17A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>18“Son of man, Israel is slag to me. Its people are bronze and tin, iron, lead, and silver from a furnace. 19So the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Because you’re slag, I’m going to gather you to Jerusalem. 20Like they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin and melt it down in a furnace, I’ll melt you down there 21with fire from my anger. [22]’” 			Ezek 22:17-22</p>
<p>The Sins of Israel’s Leaders</p>
<p>23A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>24“Son of man, say, ‘You’re a polluted land that won’t get any rain to wash it off all during the time of my indignation.’ 25There‘s a conspiracy among your prophets. Like a roaring lion mauling its prey, you devour lives. You steal treasure and precious things and make many widows.</p>
<p>26Israel’s priests violate my Law and profane my holy things. They don’t distinguish holy from profane or teach the difference between clean and unclean. They don’t observe my Sabbaths, and they dishonor me among themselves. 27Israel’s leaders are like wolves tearing apart prey. They shed blood and destroy lives to get gain. 28Its prophets smear whitewash for them, see false visions, tell lying fortunes for them, and say, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,’ when I haven’t said. 29They oppress and rob the people, wrong the poor and needy, and mistreat temporary residents with injustice.</p>
<p>30“I looked for someone to build the wall around it and stand in the gap for Israel so I wouldn’t destroy it, but I didn’t find anybody.  31So I’ve poured out my indignation on them. I’ve burned them up with the fire from my anger and brought the consequences of their ways on their heads.”	    Ezek 22:23-31</p>
<p>The Adultery of Oholah and Oholibah</p>
<p>23:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. 3They carried on prostitution in Egypt when they were young. Their breasts were pressed there and their virgin bosom was handled. 4Their names were Oholah the older and Oholibah her sister. They became mine and had children. Samaria is Oholah; Jerusalem is Oholibah.</p>
<p>5“Oholah played the prostitute while she belonged to me, and doted on her lovers, the Assyrians, her neighbors, 6who dressed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on their horses. 7She bestowed her prostitution on them, choice men of Assyria. She defiled herself with their idols. 8She didn’t abandon her prostitution from the time she was in Egypt. When she was young, men had lain with her, and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. 9So I gave her to her lovers, the Assyrians. 10They uncovered her nakedness; they took her children but killed her with a sword. So she became a byword among women, and they carried out judgments on her.</p>
<p>Ezek 23:1-1011</p>
<p>“Her sister Oholibah saw that and became even more corrupt in doting on her lovers. Her prostitution was worse than her sister’s. 12She doted on the Assyrians, nearby governors and officials, magnificently attired, horsemen riding horses, all desirable young men. 13I saw that she’d defiled herself; they both had followed the same path. 14So she increased her prostitution. She saw men painted on the wall, images of Babylonians painted with vermilion, 15wearing waistbands, with flowing turbans on their heads, all looking like officers, like Babylonians in Babylonia, the land where they were born. 16When she saw them, she doted on them and sent messengers to them in Babylonia. 17The Babylonians came to her bed of lust and defiled her with their prostitution. When they’d defiled her, she became disgusted with them. 18She uncovered her prostitution and her nakedness. Then I became disgusted with her like I had with her sister. 19She still increased her prostitution and remembered her youth when she carried on prostitution in Egypt. 20She doted on her paramours, whose members are like donkeys’ and whose issue is like horses’. 21So she longed for the lewdness of her youth when the Egyptians handled her young breasts. 	  Ezek 23:11-21</p>
<p>God’s Judgment on Oholibah</p>
<p>22“So, Oholibah, the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll arouse your lovers against you—the ones you’re alienated from&ndash;and bring them against you from every direction: 23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and the Assyrians, desirable young men, governors and officials all, officers and soldiers every one, riding horses. 24They’ll attack you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and an army of soldiers arrayed against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet. I’ll let them judge you by their customs, 25and direct my jealousy against you in anger. They’ll cut off your nose and ears, and any survivors will fall by the sword. They’ll capture your children and burn your survivors. 26They’ll strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. 27That’s how I’ll stop your lewdness and prostitution with Egypt so you won’t look up to it or remember it anymore. 28I’ll turn you over to the ones you despise, people you’re alienated from. 29They’ll deal with you in hate, take your property, and leave you naked. 30Your lewdness and prostitution will be exposed. 31You’ve followed your sister’s ways; so I’ll give you her cup to drink.’ 	  Ezek 23:22-31</p>
<p>32“The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘You’ll drink your sister’s cup,</p>
<p>which is deep and wide.</p>
<p>You’ll be laughed at and ridiculed,</p>
<p>because it holds a lot.</p>
<p>33You’ll be filled with drunkenness and sorrow:</p>
<p>the cup of horror and desolation,</p>
<p>the cup of your sister Samaria.</p>
<p>34You’ll drink it and drain it.</p>
<p>Then you’ll pull out your hair</p>
<p>and beat your breasts.</p>
<p>I’ve said so.’</p>
<p>35Because you’ve tossed me behind you and forgotten me, take the punishment for your lewdness and prostitution.’” 	Ezek 23:32-35</p>
<p>God’s Judgment on Both Sisters</p>
<p>36Yahveh said:</p>
<p>“Son of man, are you willing to judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then remind them of their detestable acts. 37Say,</p>
<p>‘You’ve committed adultery and murder—</p>
<p>adultery by worshiping your idols,</p>
<p>murder by burning your children as food for them—</p>
<p>children you bore to me.</p>
<p>38You’ve defiled my sanctuary</p>
<p>and profaned my Sabbaths.</p>
<p>39The very day you killed your children for your idols,</p>
<p>you went into my sanctuary to worship—my Temple!</p>
<p>40“You sisters” even sent messengers</p>
<p>to bring men from a long way off.</p>
<p>You took baths,</p>
<p>put on eyeshadow and fine jewelry,</p>
<p>41and sat down on a splendid couch</p>
<p>by a table where you’d put my oil and incense.</p>
<p>42The sound of debauchery surrounded you,</p>
<p>and common drunks were brought in from the wilderness.</p>
<p>They put bracelets on your wrists</p>
<p>and beautiful crowns on your heads.       	Ezek 23:36-42</p>
<p>43Then I said about you women</p>
<p>that were worn out from committing adulteries,</p>
<p>“Will these guys commit adultery</p>
<p>with women in that condition?!”</p>
<p>44But they slept with you like prostitutes,</p>
<p>Oholah and Oholibah, lewd women.</p>
<p>45But good men will condemn you</p>
<p>for your adultery and murder.’</p>
<p>46“The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Bring an army against them;</p>
<p>turn them over to terror and plunder:</p>
<p>47stone them,</p>
<p>cut them down with swords,</p>
<p>kill their children,</p>
<p>burn their houses.</p>
<p>48That’s how I’ll stop lewdness in the land.</p>
<p>Warn every woman not to do like “the sisters” have done,</p>
<p>49“Your lewdness will come back on you</p>
<p>as the penalty for worshiping idols.</p>
<p>That way you’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh.’”	Ezek 23:43-49</p>
<p>The Cooking Pot</p>
<p>24:1The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, write down the date. The king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem today. 3Tell the rebellious people a parable, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Put a pot on and pour water in it;</p>
<p>4put good pieces in it,</p>
<p>thigh and shoulder;</p>
<p>fill it with choice bones.</p>
<p>5Take the best of the flock,</p>
<p>and put wood under the pot.</p>
<p>Boil it hard;</p>
<p>seethe its bones with the meat.”			Ezek 24:1-5</p>
<p>6‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Misfortune awaits the bloody city;</p>
<p>it awaits the rusty pot!</p>
<p>Take out piece after piece</p>
<p>without choosing which ones.</p>
<p>7The blood she shed is in her;</p>
<p>she put it on a bare rock;</p>
<p>she didn’t pour it on the ground</p>
<p>and cover it with dirt.</p>
<p>8To cause anger to rise up</p>
<p>and take revenge,</p>
<p>I’ve put her blood on a bare rock</p>
<p>so it won’t be covered.” 			Ezek 24:6-8</p>
<p>9‘So the Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Misfortune awaits the bloody city!</p>
<p>I’ll make it a big pile.</p>
<p>10Pile on the wood, kindle the fire,</p>
<p>boil the meat well,</p>
<p>mix in the spices,</p>
<p>burn the bones.</p>
<p>11Then set it empty on its coals</p>
<p>To get it hot</p>
<p>so its bronze will glow,</p>
<p>its dross will dissolve,</p>
<p>its rust burn off.</p>
<p>12I’ve worked hard for nothing,</p>
<p>because its extreme rust isn’t gone;</p>
<p>let it rust in the fire!				Ezek 24:9-12</p>
<p>13In your filthiness is lewdness;</p>
<p>I wanted to clean you up,</p>
<p>but you didn’t want to be clean.</p>
<p>You won’t be clean from your filthiness,</p>
<p>till I’ve spent my wrath on you.</p>
<p>14I Yahveh have said it; it’s coming, I’ll do it. I won’t hold back, I won’t pity or be sorry. I’ll judge you according to your ways and deeds.”’”	Ezek 24:13-14</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s Wife Dies</p>
<p>15A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>16“Son of man, I’m about to take away the delight of your eyes in one stroke, but don’t mourn or cry or shed tears. 17Groan silently; don’t perform ritual mourning for the dead. Wrap your turban on, put your shoes on, don’t cover your mouth in sorrow, or eat the bread of mourning.”	 Ezek 24:15-17</p>
<p>18I told the people about it in the morning; that evening my wife died. The next morning I did what God told me.</p>
<p>19The people said, “Won’t you tell us what you’re doing means for us?”</p>
<p>20I told them,</p>
<p>“A message from Yahveh came to me, 21‘Tell Israel, “I’m about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes and soul. The children you’ve left behind will fall by the sword. 22Do what I’ve done. Don’t cover your mouth in sorrow or eat the bread of mourning. 23Put your turbans on your heads and your shoes on your feet. Don’t mourn or weep, but pine away in your sins and groan to one another. 24Follow Ezekiel’s example. When it comes, you’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh.”’	Ezek 24:18-24</p>
<p>25“Son of man, won’t that be when I take their fortresses away from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, their children—26when somebody escapes and comes to you with the news? 27Then you can speak to the one that escaped. You’ll be a sign to them. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.”</p>
<p>Ezek 24:25-27</p>
<p>A Message for Ammon</p>
<p>25:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Face the Ammonites and prophesy against them, 3’Because you said, “Ha!” at my sanctuary when it was profaned, and at Israel when it became a wasteland, and at Judah when they went into exile, 4I’m going to turn you over to the people from the east. They’ll set up their camps among you and live there, eat your fruit and drink your milk. 5I’ll make Rabbah into a pasture for camels and the Ammonites a resting place for flocks. 6Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and celebrated with scorn at Israel, 7I’ll give you to the nations for spoil, cut you off from the peoples, and make you perish from the land so you’ll know I’m Yahveh.’     	Ezek 25:1-7</p>
<p>A Message for Moab</p>
<p>8“The Lord Yahveh says, ‘Because Moab and Seir consider Judah like any other nation, 9I’m going to take away from Moab its frontier towns, the pride of its land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 10I’ll give it and the Ammonites to the people from the east and the Ammonites will pass from memory. 11I’ll carry out judgments on Moab. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”</p>
<p>12“The Lord Yahveh says, ‘Edom has taken revenge on Judah and incurred grievous guilt, 13so I’ll slay its people and animals and lay it waste. They’ll fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan. 14I’ll take revenge on Edom by my people Israel. They’ll act in Edom according to my anger; so they’ll know my payback.’</p>
<p>15“The Lord Yahveh says, ‘The Philistines have acted in scornful revenge to destroy with everlasting enmity. 16So I’ll slay the Cherethites and destroy the remnant along the coast. 17I’ll carry out severe vengeance with angry rebukes. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.’” 	   Ezek 25:8-17</p>
<p>A Message for Tyre</p>
<p>26:1The first day of the month, eleventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, Tyre has said about Jerusalem, ‘Ha! its gate’s broken; it has swung open to me. I’ll be filled now that it’s laid waste.’ 3But the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll bring nations against you, Tyre, like waves in the sea. 4They’ll destroy your walls and tear down your towers. I’ll scrape away the rubble and make you a bare rock, 5a place for spreading nets by the sea. I’ve spoken: you’ll become spoil for the nations, 6and your inhabitants on the mainland will die by the sword. You’ll know I’m Yahveh.’” 	Ezek 26:1-6</p>
<p>7“From the north I’ll bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and an enormous army. 8He’ll slay your inhabitants on the mainland with the sword, build siege walls, put up a mound and a roof of shields against you. 9He’ll aim his battering rams at your walls and tear down your towers with his axes. 10The huge number of his horses will cover you with dust; your walls will shake from his cavalry, wagons, and chariots when they pour through your gates like men overwhelming a breached city. 11He’ll trample your streets with his horses and slay your people with the sword. He’ll tear down your strong pillars, 12make spoil out of your wealth, and plunder out of your merchandise. He’ll tear down your walls, destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea. 13So I’ll silence your songs and harps. 14You’ll be a bare rock, a place to spread nets. You won’t rebuild; I’ve said so.”       			Ezek 26:7-14</p>
<p>15“The Lord Yahveh says to Tyre, ‘Won’t the whole coastline quake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter is taking place in you? 16Then the rulers of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, strip off their embroidered clothes, and dress themselves with trembling. They’ll sit on the ground, shaking every moment, appalled at you. 17They’ll take up a lamentation over you,</p>
<p>“How you’ve disappeared from the seas, renowned city.</p>
<p>You and your residents were powerful seafarers.</p>
<p>You imposed fear on people everywhere!</p>
<p>18The islands trembled the day you fell.</p>
<p>Yes, the islands in the sea</p>
<p>were distressed at your passing.”’” 	Ezek 26:15-18</p>
<p>19The Lord Yahveh says, “When I make you a desolate city, like towns with no residents, when I wash the deep up over you and big rivers flood you, 20then I’ll take you down to the Pit to the people of old, and make you live in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places. So people won’t live in you, but I’ll set glory among the living. 21I’ll bring terrors on you, and you won’t exist anymore. Though people look for you, they’ll never find you.” 	   Ezek 26:19-21</p>
<p>A Lament for Tyre</p>
<p>27:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre 3that sits at the port to the sea, the nations’ merchant to many ports, The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘Tyre, you’ve said “I’m perfectly beautiful.”</p>
<p>4Your borders extend into the heart of the sea;</p>
<p>your builders have perfected your beauty.</p>
<p>5They’ve made your planks out of fir trees from Seir;</p>
<p>they’ve taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.</p>
<p>6They shaped your oars out of oaks from Bashan;</p>
<p>with ivory they’ve inlaid your deck with boxwood</p>
<p>from the coasts of Cyprus.</p>
<p>7Your sail was made out of fine embroidered linen from Egypt;</p>
<p>it became your identifying mark.</p>
<p>Your awning was blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.</p>
<p>8The residents of Sidon and Arvad rowed for you;</p>
<p>your wise men, Tyre, were on board as your navigators.</p>
<p>9The elders of Gebal and its skilled men caulked your seams.</p>
<p>All the ships in the sea and their sailors were with you,</p>
<p>dealing in your merchandise.’ 				        Ezek 27:1-9</p>
<p>10“Persia, Lud, and Put were soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls and set forth your splendor. 11Men from Arvad and your army stood all around on your walls, and brave soldiers were in your towers. Their shields hung on your walls and completed your beauty.	Ezek 27:10-11</p>
<p>12“Tarshish was your customer because you had such a store of all kinds of wealth; they bought your merchandise with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they bought your merchandise with men’s lives and bronze containers. 14Beth-togarmah gave horses, war horses, and mules for your wares. 15Dedan traded with you. Distant lands served as your markets; they paid with ivory tusks and ebony. 16Syria was your customer because you had an abundance of goods; they bought your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 17Judah and Israel traded with you; they bought your merchandise with wheat from Minnith, cakes, honey, olive oil, and salve. 18Damascus was your customer because you had an abundance of goods, an abundance of all kinds of wealth, and because of the wine from Helbon and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan paid for your casks of wine from Izal with wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane. 20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 21Arabia and the princes of Kedar traded with you; 22they paid with gold, precious stones, and the finest spices. 23Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you 24for choice garments, clothes made out of blue and embroidered work, carpets of many colors and in tightly wound cords.   				   Ezek 27:12-24</p>
<p>25The ships of Tarshish carried your wares.</p>
<p>You were full and quite magnificent</p>
<p>in the heart of the seas.</p>
<p>26“Your rowers have taken you</p>
<p>onto stormy high seas;</p>
<p>the east wind has capsized you</p>
<p>in the middle of the sea.</p>
<p>27Your wealth, your wares and your merchandise,</p>
<p>your sailors and captains,</p>
<p>ship builders and merchants,</p>
<p>all the soldiers and everyone on board—</p>
<p>sink into the sea.</p>
<p>28At the outcry of your terrified captains,</p>
<p>the countryside shakes. 					Ezek 27:25-28</p>
<p>29The ones that row, the captains of the sea,</p>
<p>abandon ship and stand on shore.</p>
<p>30They wail over you</p>
<p>and cry bitterly.</p>
<p>They throw dust on their heads</p>
<p>and wallow in ashes.</p>
<p>31They shave their heads for you</p>
<p>and put on burlap.</p>
<p>They weep bitterly for you.					 Ezek 27:29-31</p>
<p>32As they wail, they take up</p>
<p>a funeral song for you:</p>
<p>‘Who is like Tyre</p>
<p>that’s silent at the bottom of the sea?</p>
<p>33When your wares came from the sea,</p>
<p>you satisfied many nations.</p>
<p>With your great wealth and merchandise,</p>
<p>you enriched the kings everywhere.		Ezek 27:32-33</p>
<p>34Now the sea has wrecked you</p>
<p>in open water;</p>
<p>your merchandise and your crew</p>
<p>have sunk with you.</p>
<p>35The people that live along the coasts</p>
<p>are appalled at what’s happened to you.</p>
<p>Their kings are horribly afraid;</p>
<p>their countenance has fallen.</p>
<p>36The merchants among the nations gasp at you;</p>
<p>you’ve come to a horrible end</p>
<p>and won’t exist anymore.’”			Ezek 27:34-36</p>
<p>A Message for Tyre’s King</p>
<p>28:1A message from Yahveh came to me again:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, tell the leader of Tyre;</p>
<p>‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“You’re arrogant; you’ve said,</p>
<p>‘I’m a god; I sit in God’s seat</p>
<p>in the heart of the sea.’</p>
<p>But you’re a mortal, not God,</p>
<p>though you exalt yourself as if you were God.</p>
<p>(3You think you’re wiser than Daniel,</p>
<p>that no secret is a match for you.</p>
<p>4By your wisdom and intelligence,</p>
<p>you’ve become rich,</p>
<p>and gained gold and silver for your treasuries.		Ezek 28:1-4</p>
<p>5By your great wisdom and trade,</p>
<p>you’ve increased your wealth,</p>
<p>and you’re arrogant because of it.)”</p>
<p>6‘So the Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Because you’ve exalted yourself as if you were God,</p>
<p>7I’ll bring foreigners on you,</p>
<p>the most ruthless of nations.</p>
<p>They’ll draw their swords</p>
<p>against the beauty of your wisdom</p>
<p>and defile your splendor.</p>
<p>8They’ll bring you down to the Pit,</p>
<p>and you’ll die like those killed</p>
<p>in the middle at sea.					Ezek 28:5-8</p>
<p>9Will you still say, ‘I’m a god,’</p>
<p>in the presence of your slayer?</p>
<p>Though you’re a mortal, not God,</p>
<p>will you still say, ‘I’m a god,’</p>
<p>in the hands of the ones who mortally wound you?</p>
<p>10You’ll die the death of the uncircumcised</p>
<p>by the hand of foreigners.</p>
<p>I’ve said so!”’” 		Ezek 28:9-10</p>
<p>11A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>12“Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre.</p>
<p>Tell him, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“You had the seal of perfection;</p>
<p>wise and perfectly beautiful.</p>
<p>13You were in Eden, God’s orchard.</p>
<p>You wore every precious stone:</p>
<p>rubies, topaz, diamonds,</p>
<p>beryl, onyx, and jasper</p>
<p>lapis lazuli, turquoise, emeralds.</p>
<p>There was gold workmanship</p>
<p>for your settings and engravings.</p>
<p>They were prepared the day you were created.</p>
<p>14I placed an anointed cherub to guard you.</p>
<p>You were on God’s holy mountain,</p>
<p>and walked among the burning stones.			Ezek 28:11-14</p>
<p>15You were blameless in your ways</p>
<p>from the time you were created</p>
<p>till sin became obvious in you.</p>
<p>16By the abundance of your trade,</p>
<p>you became violent and sinned.</p>
<p>So I’ve thrown you as profane</p>
<p>from God’s mountain.</p>
<p>I’ve destroyed you, guardian cherub,</p>
<p>from among the burning stones.</p>
<p>17You became proud of your beauty,</p>
<p>and corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor.</p>
<p>I threw you on the ground;</p>
<p>I put you in front of kings</p>
<p>so they could see you.					Ezek 28:15-17</p>
<p>18By the great number of your sins</p>
<p>committed in your trading,</p>
<p>you profaned your sanctuaries.</p>
<p>So I’ve brought fire out of you,</p>
<p>and it’s you up.</p>
<p>I’ve turned you to ashes in the world</p>
<p>in front of everybody that sees you.</p>
<p>19Everybody that knows you</p>
<p>is appalled at what’s happened to you.</p>
<p>You’ve panicked,</p>
<p>and won’t exist anymore.”’”				Ezek 28:18-19</p>
<p>A Message for Sidon</p>
<p>20A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>21“Son of man, face Sidon and prophesy against it.</p>
<p>22‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m against you, Sidon,</p>
<p>and I’ll be honored by what I do to you.</p>
<p>They’ll know I’m Yahveh,</p>
<p>when I carry out judgments on you;</p>
<p>I’ll demonstrate my holiness in you.</p>
<p>23I’ve sent a disease to you</p>
<p>and blood in your streets.</p>
<p>The wounded will fall in you</p>
<p>by the sword everywhere.</p>
<p>You’ll know I’m Yahveh.					Ezek 28:20-23</p>
<p>24“For Israel there won’t any longer be a briar to prick or a thorn to hurt them from any that scorn them. They’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh.”</p>
<p>25‘The Lord Yahveh says, “When I gather Israel back from the nations where they’re scattered and demonstrate my holiness in them in front of the nations, then they’ll live in the land I’ve given Jacob. 26They’ll live in it securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. I’ll carry out judgment on everybody that scorns them. They’ll know I’m Yahveh their God.”’”  	Ezek 28:24-26</p>
<p>A Message for Egypt</p>
<p>29:1The twelfth day, tenth month, tenth year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, turn toward Pharaoh, Egypt’s king, and prophesy against him and Egypt. 3’The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m against you, Pharaoh Egypt’s king,</p>
<p>the big crocodile that lies in your streams,</p>
<p>that has said, ‘My Nile belongs to me; I made it.’</p>
<p>4I’ll put hooks in your jaws,</p>
<p>and make the fish in your streams stick to your scales.</p>
<p>I’ll drag you out on your shore</p>
<p>with fish clinging to your scales. 	Ezek 29:1-4</p>
<p>5I’ll abandon you to the wilderness,</p>
<p>you and the fish in your streams.</p>
<p>You’ll fall in the open field,</p>
<p>and not be buried.</p>
<p>I’ll make you food for scavengers on the ground</p>
<p>and buzzards in the sky.</p>
<p>6Then you residents in Egypt will know I’m Yahveh,</p>
<p>because to Israel you’ve been only a staff made out of reeds.</p>
<p>7When he took hold of you,</p>
<p>you cut his hands;</p>
<p>when he leaned on you,</p>
<p>you broke and his loins buckled.	Ezek 29:5-7</p>
<p>8’So the Lord Yahveh says, “I’m going to bring a sword on you, and slay people and animals. 9Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, I made it,’ 10I’m against you and your streams. Egypt will become a wasteland from Migdol to Syene to the border of Nubia. 11People and animals won’t travel through it; nobody will live there for 40 years. 12So I’ll make Egypt desolate among desolate lands and its cities desolate among desolate cities for 40 years. I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations.</p>
<p>13‘The Lord Yahveh says, “After 40 years, I’ll gather the Egyptians back from where they’ve scattered. 14I’ll return their fortunes and make them go back to the land of Pathros and become a minor kingdom there. 15Egypt will be low among the kingdoms and never again raise itself above them. I’ll make it too small for that. 16Israel will never rely on it again. They’ll be reminded of their sin in going back to Egypt. They’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh.’” 	Ezek 29:8-16</p>
<p>17The first day, first month, twenty-seventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>18“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army struggle hard against Tyre. Every head became bald, and every shoulder was rubbed raw. But he and his army didn’t get enough from Tyre to pay for the struggle. 19So I’ll give him Egypt so he can carry off its wealth, capture its spoil, and seize its plunder to pay his army. 20I’ve given him Egypt for his struggle because he acted on my behalf. 21At that time, I’ll make a horn sprout for Israel and open your mouth among them. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.” 	  Ezek 29:17-21</p>
<p>A Lament for Egypt</p>
<p>30:1A message from Yahveh came to me again:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, prophesy, ‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“Wail, ‘Oh for the day!’</p>
<p>3The day of Yahveh is near,</p>
<p>a cloudy day of doom for the nations.</p>
<p>4A sword will come at Egypt;</p>
<p>there’ll be anguish in Nubia</p>
<p>when the slain fall in Egypt.</p>
<p>They’ll carry away its wealth</p>
<p>and tear up its foundations.</p>
<p>5Nubia, Put, Lud, Arabia, Libya, and the people of any land allied with them will fall by the sword with them. 					        Ezek 30:1-5</p>
<p>6’Yahveh says:</p>
<p>“Those who support Egypt will fall;</p>
<p>its proud power will collapse.</p>
<p>From Migdol to Syene</p>
<p>they’ll fall by the sword.</p>
<p>7They’ll be desolate among desolate lands;</p>
<p>its cities will desolate among devastated cities.</p>
<p>8They’ll know I’m Yahveh</p>
<p>when I set Egypt on fire</p>
<p>and break down its helpers.</p>
<p>9At that time, I’ll send messengers in ships</p>
<p>to terrify secure Nubia;</p>
<p>anguish will come down on them as at Egypt’s doom.</p>
<p>It’s coming!”</p>
<p>10‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“By Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,</p>
<p>I’ll put an end to Egypt’s wealth.				Ezek 30:6-10</p>
<p>11Him and his people, the most ruthless of the nations,</p>
<p>I’ll bring in to destroy the land.</p>
<p>They’ll draw their swords against it,</p>
<p>and fill the country with the slain.</p>
<p>12I’ll dry up the Nile’s canals,</p>
<p>and sell the land to evil men.</p>
<p>I’ll use foreigners to make the land desolate</p>
<p>and everything that’s in it,</p>
<p>I Yahveh have said it.”					Ezek 30:11-12</p>
<p>13‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll destroy the idols</p>
<p>and make images cease in Memphis.</p>
<p>There won’t be a prince in Egypt anymore;</p>
<p>I’ll put fear in Egypt.</p>
<p>14I’ll make Pathros desolate;</p>
<p>I’ll set fire to Zoan,</p>
<p>and carry out judgment on Thebes.</p>
<p>15I’ll pour out my anger on Sin, Egypt’s fortress;</p>
<p>I’ll slay the population in Thebes,</p>
<p>16I’ll set Egypt on fire.</p>
<p>Sin will writhe in anguish;</p>
<p>Thebes will be breached;</p>
<p>Memphis will endure daily distress.				Ezek 30:13-16</p>
<p>17The young men of On and Pi-beseth</p>
<p>will fall by the sword;</p>
<p>the women will go into captivity.</p>
<p>18It will be a dark day in Tehaphnehes</p>
<p>when I break the yoke bars of Egypt there.</p>
<p>The pride in its power will be gone;</p>
<p>a cloud will cover it,</p>
<p>and Egypt’s inhabitants will go into captivity.</p>
<p>19So I’ll carry out judgments on Egypt,</p>
<p>and they’ll know I’m Yahveh.”’”				Ezek 30:17-19</p>
<p>20The seventh day, first month, eleventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>21“Son of man, I’ve broken the arm of Pharaoh, Egypt’s king. It hasn’t been put in a sling to mend or wrapped with a bandage to get strong enough to hold a sword.’ 22So the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll break both of his arms, the good arm and the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand. 23I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations. 24I’ll strengthen the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. Pharaoh will groan from his wounds. 25I’ll strengthen the king of Babylon’s arms, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall. When the king of Babylon holds out his sword against Egypt 26and I scatter the Egyptians among the nations, they’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”       	Ezek 30:20-26</p>
<p>A Cedar in Lebanon</p>
<p>31:1The first day, third month, eleventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, tell Pharaoh and his large host,</p>
<p>‘Who is as great as you?</p>
<p>3Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon</p>
<p>with beautiful branches and forest shade</p>
<p>and its top in the clouds.</p>
<p>4The water made it grow, the underground water made it tall;</p>
<p>rivers continually flowed where it was planted;</p>
<p>it sent out its channels to all the trees.</p>
<p>5So it was taller than any other tree.</p>
<p>It grew lots of long branches</p>
<p>because it had plenty of water;</p>
<p>it spread them out.					Ezek 31:1-5</p>
<p>6Birds nested in it;</p>
<p>animals from the countryside gave birth under it;</p>
<p>all the nations lived in its shade.</p>
<p>7So it was beautiful in its size and the length of its branches,</p>
<p>because its roots went down to abundant water.</p>
<p>8The cedars in God’s forest couldn’t match it;</p>
<p>the cypress couldn’t compare with its branches;</p>
<p>the trees in the plane couldn’t equal its limbs.</p>
<p>No tree in God’s forest could compare with its beauty.</p>
<p>9I made it beautiful with its many big branches;</p>
<p>all the trees in Eden, which were in God’s orchard,</p>
<p>were jealous of it.					Ezek 31:6-9</p>
<p>10‘So the Lord Yahveh says, “Because it was tall with its top in the clouds and was proud of its height, 11I’ll give it to a despot to deal with according to the sinfulness it deserves. 12Foreign tyrants will cut it down and leave its limbs on the mountains and in the valleys. They’ll lie piled up in the ravines. Everybody on earth will leave its shade. 13Birds will live on its remains, and animals will be on its fallen branches. 14None of the trees beside water will grow tall and set their tops in the clouds or their terebinth trees stand tall in their height. They’ll die, given over to the underworld among mortals.” 	Ezek 31:10-14</p>
<p>15‘The Lord Yahveh says, “When it goes down to Sheol, I’ll chant dirges, close the deep over it, and hold back its many streams. I’ll cover Lebanon with gloom for it, and the trees will wither away because of it. 16The nations will shake from the sound of its fall when I send it down to the Pit. The well-watered trees of Eden, Lebanon’s best, will find comfort in the nether world. 17They’ll go down with it to those slain by the sword, who were its strength and lived under its shade among the nations. 18Which of Eden’s trees equals you in size and beauty? Yet you’ll go down with Eden’s trees to the underworld and lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. That’s the way it will be with Pharaoh and his large army!”’”  		 Ezek 31:15-18</p>
<p>A Lament for Pharaoh</p>
<p>32:1The first day, twelfth month, twelfth year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh, Egypt’s king. Tell him,</p>
<p>‘You consider yourself a young lion among the nations,</p>
<p>but you’re like a sea monster in the ocean.</p>
<p>You splash around in your rivers,</p>
<p>stir up the water with your feet,</p>
<p>and muddy the rivers.’”</p>
<p>3The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’ll cast my net over you</p>
<p>along with a host of nations;</p>
<p>they’ll haul you up from the water.</p>
<p>4I’ll dash you on the ground,</p>
<p>toss you in an open field,</p>
<p>let the birds light on you,</p>
<p>and have the animals gorge on you. 	Ezek 32:1-4</p>
<p>5I’ll scatter your bodies on the mountains,</p>
<p>and fill the valleys with your carcasses.</p>
<p>6The land will soak up your blood</p>
<p>all the way to the mountains;</p>
<p>I’ll fill the ravines with you.</p>
<p>7When I blot you out,</p>
<p>I’ll veil the sky, darken the stars,</p>
<p>and cover the sun with a cloud;</p>
<p>the moon won’t shine.</p>
<p>8I’ll darken the lights in the sky above you</p>
<p>and cover your land in darkness. 	Ezek 32:5-8</p>
<p>9I’ll trouble many nations when I take you captive among them to lands you haven’t known. 10They’ll be appalled at what’s happened to you. Because of you their kings will be horribly afraid when I brandish my sword at them. When you fall, they’ll shudder every minute for their whole life.”	 Ezek 32:9-10</p>
<p>11The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“The sword of Babylon’s king will come on you. 12I’ll make your large army fall by the swords of powerful men, all of them tyrants over nations.</p>
<p>They’ll crush Egypt’s pride</p>
<p>and destroy its army.</p>
<p>13I’ll destroy its livestock from beside the waterways;</p>
<p>nobody’s foot or animal’s hoof</p>
<p>will muddy them anymore.</p>
<p>14I’ll make their waterways soak up the water</p>
<p>and make their streams flow like olive oil.”</p>
<p>15When I make Egypt desolate</p>
<p>and the land lacking in what filled it,</p>
<p>when I strike everybody that lives there,</p>
<p>they’ll know I’m Yahveh.</p>
<p>16That’s the dirge the nations will chant over Egypt and its army.” 	  Ezek 32:11-16</p>
<p>17The fifteenth day, first month, twelfth year, a message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>18“Son of man, wail for Egypt’s army. Along with the powerful nations, take it down to the nether world with those who go down to the Pit.</p>
<p>19‘Who are you more beautiful than?</p>
<p>Go make your bed with the uncircumcised.’</p>
<p>20They’ll fall among those slain by the sword. Egypt will be delivered to the sword; they’ll take it and its army away. 21Out of Sheol the strong among the powerful will talk about Egypt and its allies. ‘The uncircumcised have gone down, they lie still, slain by the sword.’ 	Ezek 32:17-21</p>
<p>22“Assyria is there with all its company, all slain by the sword. 23They who had spread terror among the living lie in the most remote parts of the Pit.</p>
<p>24“Elam is there with its army around its grave, all of them fallen by the sword. They who had spread terror among the living bore their disgrace with the ones they sent down to the Pit. 25They’ve made a bed for Elam among the slain—all uncircumcised.</p>
<p>26“Meshech, Tubal, and their armies are there, their graves around them, all slain by the sword, uncircumcised, though they’d spread terror among the living. 27They don’t lie beside the fallen heroes of old, the uncircumcised who went down to Sheol with their weapons, whose swords were laid under their heads, whose shields rested on their skeletons, though the living once feared them, 28they’ll be broken among the uncircumcised and lie with the ones they’d slain.    				Ezek 32:22-28</p>
<p>29“Edom is there, its kings and princes, who, despite their power, lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword with those who go down to the Pit.</p>
<p>30“All the chiefs from the north are there too, and all the Sidonians, who, for the terror resulting from their power, went down in disgrace with the ones they’d slain. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit.”</p>
<p>31The Lord Yahveh says, “Pharaoh will see them, and be comforted for his army slain. 32Though I had spread the fear of him among the living, he and his army will lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.” 	Ezek 32:29-32</p>
<p>Ezekiel Is Israel’s Watchman</p>
<p>33:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Tell your people, ‘If I bring the sword on a country, and the people’s watchman 3blows the ram’s horn to warn them—4then those who don’t pay attention are responsible for their own death. 5If they’d taken warning, they would’ve saved their life. 6If the watchman sees the sword coming and doesn’t warn the people, if the sword takes some people, they’ll be taken away in their sin, but I’ll hold the watchman responsible for it.’</p>
<p>7“Son of man, I’ve made you a watchman for Israel so you’ll hear a message from me to warn them. 8When I tell sinful people they’re going to die, but you don’t warn them, they’ll die in their sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for it.  9But if you warn them and they don’t turn from your way, they’ll die in their sin, but you’ve saved your life.	   Ezek 33:1-9</p>
<p>10“Now, son of man, tell Israel, ‘You’ve said, “Our sins are on us and we’re rotting away in them. How can we survive?”’ 11Tell them, ‘As I live,’ the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I don’t get any satisfaction out of seeing sinful people die. I want them to turn from their way and live. Turn back from your sinful way! Why die, Israel?’ 12Son of man, tell your fellow citizens, ‘People’s goodness won’t deliver them when they sin. People’s sinfulness won’t prevent them from living when they quit doing it. Good people can’t have life from goodness when they practice sin. 13When I say to a good man he’ll surely live and he presumes on his goodness and starts sinning, I won’t consider his good deeds; he’ll die in that sin. 14But when I say to a sinful man, ‘You’ll surely die,’ and he quits sinning—15if he returns a pledge, repays what he stole, follows the statutes that give life and doesn’t sin—he’ll surely live. 16I won’t hold his past sins against him. He is doing good; he’ll live.		  					Ezek 33:10-16</p>
<p>17“Yet your people say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right,’ when it’s their own way that’s not right. 18When a good man turns from his goodness, he’ll die because he practices sin. 19When a wicked man turns from his wickedness, he’ll live because he’s practicing goodness. 20Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right.’ House of Israel, I’ll judge each of you by your own ways.” 	  Ezek 33:17-20</p>
<p>Israel’s Fall Explained</p>
<p>21The fifth day, tenth month, twelfth year of our exile, refugees from Jerusalem came to tell me the city had fallen.  22Yahveh’s hand had been heavy on me the evening before. When they came the next morning, he made me able to talk again.</p>
<p>23A message from him came to me:</p>
<p>24“Son of man, those who live in Israel’s waste places are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land. So to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.’ 25Tell them the Lord Yahveh says, ‘You eat meat with blood in it, and look up to your idols as you shed innocent blood. Should you have the land? 26You rely on your sword, you commit disgusting deeds, you defile your neighbor’s wife. Should you have the land? 27As I live, those who live in the waste places will fall by the sword. Whoever is in the open country wild animals will kill. The ones in strongholds and caves will die from disease. 28I’ll make the land desolate; pride about its power will stop. Israel’s mountains will be so desolate nobody can get through them. 29They’ll know I’m Yahveh when I make the land desolate because of their disgusting deeds.’</p>
<p>Ezek 33:21-29</p>
<p>30“Son of man, your fellow citizens talk about you by the walls and in the doorways, ‘Come on, let’s hear a message from Yahveh.’ 31They come and sit with you like my people, but they do the lustful things they talk about and set their hearts on making money. 32As far as they’re concerned, you’re someone with a beautiful voice that plays an instrument well and sings love songs. They hear what you’re saying, but they don’t do it. 33So when what you say does happen—as it surely will—they’ll know a prophet was among them.” 	Ezek 33:30-33</p>
<p>Prophecy Against Israel’s Shepherds</p>
<p>34:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, prophesy against Israel’s shepherds. ‘The Lord Yahveh says, “Misfortune awaits you, shepherds that feed yourselves! Shouldn’t shepherds feed the flock? 3You eat the healthy and dress with their wool. You slaughter the healthy sheep without feeding the flock. 4You don’t strengthen the sickly, heal the diseased, bandage up the crippled, bring back the scattered, or look for the lost. With force and severity, you bully them. 5They’re scattered all over the world because they didn’t have a shepherd; they became prey for wild animals. 6My flock wandered around in the mountains and tall hills; nobody looked for them.	       	Ezek 34:1-6</p>
<p>7‘So, shepherds, listen to Yahveh, [8-9] 10“Give me my sheep. You’re fired. I’ll protect my flock so you can’t eat them anymore.”’”</p>
<p>11The Lord Yahveh says, “I’ll look for my sheep myself. 12Like a shepherd does when he’s among them, I’ll bring them back from where they scattered on a cloudy, gloomy day. 13-14I’ll gather them from other countries, feed them on good pasture, and graze them on Israel’s high mountains, by its streams, in populated places. 15I’ll lead my flock to rest, 16bandage up the crippled, doctor the sick, watch over the healthy and strong. I’ll feed them with justice.” 	 Ezek 34:7-16</p>
<p>17The Lord Yahveh says, “My flock, I’ll decide between one sheep and another, between rams and billy goats. 18Do you care so little about feeding on good pasture that you tramp it down? Do you care so little about drinking clean water that you muddy it up with your hooves? 19My flock has to eat what you tramp down and drink what you muddy up!”</p>
<p>20So the Lord Yahveh says, “I’ll decide between healthy sheep and sickly ones. 21You butt and shove with your shoulder and gouge the weak with your horns till you drive them off. 22I’ll protect my flock so they won’t be prey anymore, and judge one sheep from another. 23I’ll set one shepherd over them, my servant David; he’ll feed them. 24I’ll be their God; he’ll be their prince. I’ve said so.  	    									    Ezek 34:17-24</p>
<p>25“I’ll make a peace treaty with them and get rid of dangerous animals so they can be safe in the countryside and sleep in the woods. 26I’ll make them and the places around my mountain a blessing. It will rain when it’s supposed to—showers of blessing. 27The trees in the orchard will bear their fruit; the ground will grow its crops. They’ll know I’m Yahveh when I’ve broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from those who enslave them. 28They won’t be prey for other nations anymore, and the animals in the world won’t devour them. Nobody will make them afraid. 29Their land will be famous for growing crops, and they won’t ever be victims of famine or have to put up with insults from other nations. 30They’ll know that I, Yahveh their God, am with them, and they’re Israel, my people. 31My ‘sheep’ in my pasture, you’re my people and I’m your God,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says. 	Ezek 34:25-31</p>
<p>Prophecy Against Mount Seir</p>
<p>35:1A message from the Lord came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, face Mount Seir and prophesy against it, 3‘The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>“I’m against you, Mount Seir;</p>
<p>I’ll make you a wasteland.</p>
<p>4I’ll lay your towns waste,</p>
<p>and you’ll be desolate.</p>
<p>You’ll know I’m Yahveh.</p>
<p>5In your endless enmity, you delivered Israel to the sword at the time of its catastrophe, its final punishment. 6So as I live, I’ll deliver you to bloodshed. Since you haven’t despised bloodshed, it’ll pursue you. 7I’ll make Mount Seir a waste and slay everyone that tries to escape or return there. 8I’ll fill its mountains with the dead. They’ll fall in its hills, valleys, and ravines. 9I’ll make it a permanent wasteland and its towns uninhabited. It will know I’m Yahveh.  	 Ezek 35:1-9</p>
<p>10“Mount Seir has said, ‘I’m going to take over those two lands and make them mine’—though Yahveh was there. 11So as I live,” the Lord Yahveh says. “I’ll deal with you in proportion to the anger, envy, and hate you’ve shown them. I’ll make myself known among them when I condemn you. 12You’ll know that I’ve heard your contempt for the mountain in Israel, ‘They’re desolate; they’ve been given to us to devour.’ 13I’ve heard you speak arrogantly against me over and over. 14While the whole world celebrates, I’ll make you desolate. 15As you celebrated Israel’s desolation, you’ll be desolate, Mount Seir and all Edom. You’ll know I’m Yahveh.”’ 	Ezek 35:10-15</p>
<p>Prophecy to the Mountains of Israel</p>
<p>36:1“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, ‘Listen to 2what the Lord Yahveh says, “Your enemy has ridiculed you, ‘Ha!’ and ‘The everlasting mountains are ours now!’” 3So prophesy, ‘For good reason other nations made you desolate and crushed you from every direction, took possession of you, and mocked and whispered.’” 4‘So, mountains of Israel, listen to the message from the Lord Yahveh to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, desolate wastes and abandoned towns that have become prey and objects of derision. 5“In my burning jealousy, I’ve spoken against those nations, particularly Edom that took over my land with wholehearted joy and scornful attitude. I’ve sworn to drive it out to become prey. 6So prophesy to Israel’s mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, “I’ve spoken in my anger because you’ve had to endure insults from other nations. 7I swear they will endure insults.’” 	Ezek 36:1-7</p>
<p>8“But you, mountains of Israel, will grow branches and bear fruit for my people, because they’ll be coming back soon. 9I’ll return to you, and you’ll be cultivated and planted. 10People will multiple in Israel to live in the towns and rebuild the places in ruins. 11People and animals will reproduce in you. I’ll make you lived-in like before and treat you better than at first. So you’ll know I’m Yahveh. 12My people will carry on their lives in you and own you. You’ll become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.” 13The Lord Yahveh says, ‘Other nations tell you, “You’ve devoured your people and bereaved them of children,” 14but you won’t do that anymore. 15I won’t let you listen to their insults anymore. You won’t make your nation stumble anymore.’”	Ezek 36:8-15</p>
<p>16A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>17“Son of man, when Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it with their ways and deeds. Their way was unclean like a woman in her period. 18So I poured out my anger on them for the blood they’d shed, because they’d defiled the land with their idols. 19I scattered them among the nations and judged them by their ways and deeds. 20When they got to those nations, they profaned my holy name, because people said, ‘These are Yahveh’s people; yet they’ve come out of his land.’ 21I was concerned about my holy name that they’d profaned among the nations.</p>
<p>22“So, tell Israel, ‘It’s not so much for your sake that I’m about to act; it’s in regard to my holy name that you’ve profaned where you’ve gone. 23I’ll vindicate the holiness of my great name. Then the nations will know I’m Yahveh.”</p>
<p>Ezek 36:16-23</p>
<p>24“I’ll bring you back from the nations, 25sprinkle clean water on you to cleanse you from your filthiness and idols, 26and give you a new heart and spirit. I’ll take out your stone heart and give you a physical one., 27and put my spirit in you so you’ll follow my statutes and observe my ordinances. 28You’ll live in the land I gave your ancestors. You’ll be my people, and I’ll be your God. 29I’ll save you from your uncleanness, give you abundant crops of grain, and keep famine away from you. 30I’ll multiply fruit on your trees and produce in the fields, 31You’ll remember your sinful ways and deeds, and abhor yourselves. 32Understand that I’m not doing this because you deserve it. Be ashamed of yourselves, Israel!” 	Ezek 36:24-32</p>
<p>33“When I cleanse you from your sins, the towns will be rebuilt and lived in again. 34The land will be cultivated for everybody to see that goes by. 35They’ll say, ‘This wasteland has become like the orchard of Eden. The waste, desolate, ruined towns are fortified and lived in.’ 36Then the nations that are left around you will know I’ve rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I’ll do what I’ve said.”</p>
<p>37“The Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll let Israel ask me to increase their people like a flock. 38People’s flocks will fill the wasted towns like sacrifices in Jerusalem at festival time. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.’” 	Ezek 36:33-38</p>
<p>A Valley of Dry Bones</p>
<p>37:1-2Yahveh’s hand was on me. He took me out in spirit and put me down in a valley full of dry bones, 2and had me walk around among them.</p>
<p>3“Son of man, can these bones come alive?”</p>
<p>“Lord Yahveh, you know.”</p>
<p>4“Prophesy over them, ‘Dry bones, listen to Yahveh. 5I’ll put breath in you so you can come to life. 6I’ll put sinews on you, make flesh grow back, and cover you with skin. You’ll know I’m Yahveh.’”</p>
<p>7As I prophesied, there was a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8I saw sinews on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but they weren’t breathing.	Ezek 37:1-8</p>
<p>9He told me to prophesy to their breath, “The Lord Yahveh says to come from the four winds and breathe on these slain so they can come to life.”</p>
<p>10So I prophesied. Breath came into them, they came to life, and stood up, a big army.</p>
<p>11Then he said,</p>
<p>“Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They’re saying, ‘Our bones are dried up. Our hope is gone. We’re completely cut off.’ 12So prophesy that the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll open your graves and resurrect you, and take you to Israel. 13You’ll know I’m Yahveh when 14I’ve put my breath in you, you’ve come to life, and I’ve put you in your own land.’” 	Ezek 37:9-14</p>
<p>Reunion of Israel and Judah</p>
<p>15A message from Yahveh came to me again:</p>
<p>16“Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and the people of Israel, his companions.’ Take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and the House of Israel, his companions.’ 17Then put them together in your hand to become one stick. 18When your people ask you what these sticks mean, 19say that the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I’ll take Joseph’s stick—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and the tribes of Israel, his companions, and put them with Judah’s stick to make one stick in my hand.’ 20The sticks you write on they’ll see in your hand. 21Tell them the Lord Yahveh says he’ll gather the people of Israel from among the nations where they’ve gone and bring them to their own land. 22He’ll make them one nation under one king. 23They won’t defile themselves with idols, detestable things, or any of their sins. He’ll deliver them from the places where they live, where they’ve sinned, and cleanse them. They’ll be his people, and he’ll be their God.” 	Ezek 37:15-23</p>
<p>24-25“My servant David will be their king, their one shepherd forever. They’ll follow my ordinances and keep my statutes. They and their descendants will live permanently on the land I gave Jacob, where your ancestors lived. 26I’ll make an everlasting peace treaty with them, bless and multiply them, set my sanctuary among them, 27live with them, and be their God; and they’ll be my people. 28The nations will know I’m Yahveh who sanctifies Israel when my sanctuary is with them forever.”’”  				              Ezek 37:24-28</p>
<p>A Message for Gog</p>
<p>38:1A message from Yahveh came to me:</p>
<p>2“Son of man, face Gog of the land of Magog, the prince that rules Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 3‘The Lord Yahveh says, “I’m against you, Gog. 4I’ll turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and take you out—you, your army, horses and horsemen, all splendidly attired, a large army with buckler and shield, wielding swords; 5Persia, Nubia, and Put with them, all with shield and helmet; 6Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops—many nations with you.</p>
<p>7“Be prepared, you and the armies allied with you as their commander. 8After a long time you’ll be drawn to a land restored from the sword, whose residents live safely. They will have gathered from many nations to the mountains in Israel, which had been a continual waste. 9You and your troops will come down on them like a storm, like a cloud over the land.”		        Ezek 38:1-9</p>
<p>10‘The Lord Yahveh says, “At that time, you’ll start plotting, 11‘I’m going to go up against a land with unwalled villages, against people at rest, that live safely, that don’t have walls, bars, and gates. 12I’ll capture spoil, seize plunder, and attack waste places that are lived in now and people that gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, and think the world revolves around them.’ 13But Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish and its surrounding villages, will ask you, ‘Do you think the army you’ve gathered can capture lots of spoil, seize plunder and goods, carry off silver and gold, and drive away livestock?’				    	    			    		    Ezek 38:10-13</p>
<p>14“So, son of man, prophesy against Gog that the Lord Yahveh says, ‘When my people are living securely, you’ll know it, won’t you? 15You’ll come from the far north, riding horses, a great army 16swooping down like a cloud over the land. In the last days, Gog, I’ll bring you against my land so the nations can see my holiness displayed by what happens to you.’ 	Ezek 38:14-16</p>
<p>17‘The Lord Yahveh says, “Aren’t you the one I spoke about in former times through my prophets in Israel? They predicted for many years that I’d bring you against them. 18‘When Gog comes against Israel, my fury will flare.’ 19In my zeal and blazing anger, there will be a violent earthquake in Israel. 20Fish in the sea, buzzards in the sky, scavengers in the open country, things crawling on the ground, and everybody in the world will shudder at my presence. Mountains will crumble, cliffs will collapse, walls will crash to the ground. 21I’ll call for a sword against Gog on all my mountains. His swordsmen will turn against each other. 22With disease and blood I’ll render judgment on him: rain on him, his troops, and many allies, a torrential rain with hailstones, fire, and sulfur. 23I’ll show my greatness, sanctify myself, make myself known where many nations can see me. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.”’	Ezek 38:17-23</p>
<p>39:1“Son of man, prophesy against Gog, ‘The Lord Yahveh says, “I’m against you, ruler of Meshech, and Tubal. 2I’ll turn you around, drive you on, take you up from the most remote parts in the north, and bring you against Israel. 3I’ll knock the bow out of your left hand, and the arrows out of your right hand. 4-5You and your troops will fall on the mountains in Israel. I’ll feed you to every vulture and wild animal in the open country. I’ve said so.  6I’ll rain down fire on Magog and those who live securely in distant lands. They’ll know I’m Yahveh.’ 									       			       Ezek 39:1-6</p>
<p>7“I’ll make my holy name known among my people; I won’t let it be profaned anymore. The nations will know I’m Yahveh, the Holy One in Israel. 8The day I’m talking about is coming; it will happen.’</p>
<p>9“For seven years, the people in the towns of Israel will go out and build fires with the weapons, shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears. 10They won’t get wood from the pasture or gather firewood from the woods; they’ll build fires out of weapons and plunder the ones that plundered them,” 				the Lord Yahveh says.	     	     Ezek 39:7-10</p>
<p>11“When I give Gog a burial ground in Israel—in the valley east of the Dead Sea, it will block travelers. They’ll bury Gog with all his army there and call it the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 12It will take Israel seven months of burying to clean up the land. 13The common people will do the burying to their renown when I glory myself,” the Lord Yahveh says. 14“They’ll appoint men to go through the land and bury the ones left on the ground. 15When they see a human bone, they’ll put a marker by it till those who do the burying put it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 16The city’s name will be Hamonah [Horde]. So they’ll clean up the land.”      					Ezek 39:11-16</p>
<p>17“Son of man, tell every bird and wild animal, ‘Gather to the great sacrifice I’m going to make for you on the mountains in Israel so you can eat flesh and drink blood. 18You’ll eat the flesh of powerful men and drink the blood of princes as if they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—grain-fed animals from Bashan. 19You’ll eat till you’re gorged, and drink blood till you’re drunk from the sacrifice I’ll make for you. 20At my table you’ll gorge on horses, charioteers, and mighty warriors,” 	the Lord Yahveh says.	Ezek 39:17-20</p>
<p>21“I’ll establish my honor among the nations. They’ll see the judgment I’ve carried out on them. 22Israel will know I’m Yahveh their God from then on. 23The nations will know Israel went into exile for their sin, and I hid from them. I abandoned them to their enemies, and they fell by the sword. [24]”’”</p>
<p>25So the Lord Yahveh says, “Now I’ll restore Jacob’s fortunes, and have mercy on the whole House of Israel. I’ll be zealous for my holy name. 26When they live securely in their own land with nobody to threaten them, they’ll forget their shame and unfaithfulness to me. 27When I bring them back from the nations, they’ll sanctify me in a way many lands can see. 28They’ll know I’m Yahveh their God because I exiled them and then gathered them back. I won’t leave any of them there. 29I won’t hide from them anymore because I’ve poured out my Spirit on Israel.”   			 Ezek 39:21-29</p>
<p>VISION OF THE NEW TEMPLE AREA</p>
<p>40:1At the beginning of the twenty-fifth year of our exile, the tenth month, fourteenth year after the city fell, Yahveh’s hand weighed heavy on me. 2In visions he took me to Israel and set me on a tall mountain. On it to the south was a structure like a city. 3He took me over there. Standing in the gate was a bronze-looking man with a flax line and a measuring rod in his hand. 4He told me,</p>
<p>“Son of man, look, listen, pay attention to everything I show you. That’s why Yahveh brought you here. Tell Israel everything you see.” 	Ezek 40:1-4</p>
<p>The East Gate</p>
<p>5There was a wall all the way around the Temple. The man holding a measuring rod (10&rsquo; 4&quot; long, each cubit being 17.72&quot; ordinary cubit plus 2.95&quot; ordinary palm = 20.8&quot; royal cubit) measured the thickness and height of the wall at 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 1 reed each. 6Then he went to the east gate, up its steps, and measured its threshold at 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 1 reed wide and deep. 7The guard rooms were 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 1 reed square with 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 5 cubits between them. The threshold of the gate facing inward was 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 1 reed, 8and the porch of the gate facing inward was 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 1 reed. 9He measured the porch of the gate at 13&rsquo; 10&quot; 8 cubits; the porch of the gate faced inward. 10There were 3 guardrooms on each side of the gate, all the same size. The side pillars were square. 11The opening of the gate was 17&rsquo; 3&quot; 10 cubits wide and 20&rsquo; 5&quot; 13 cubits deep. 12There was a barrier wall in front of the guardrooms 21&quot; 1 cubit thick on each side, and the guardrooms were 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 6 cubits square. 13He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other as 43&rsquo; 1&quot; 25 cubits wide from one door to the opposite door. 14He made the side pillars 103&rsquo; 6&quot; 60 cubits high. The gate extended around to the side pillar of the courtyard. 15From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 cubits. 16There were beveled windows narrowing inward toward their side pillars within the gate all around; the same for the porches. The porch had windows all around inside, and the dividing walls were decorated with palm trees.	Ezek 40:5-16</p>
<p>The Outer Court</p>
<p>17Then he took me to the outer court. There were rooms and a pavement made for the court all the way around—30 rooms that faced the pavement. 18The lower pavement ran alongside the gates, corresponding to their length. 19Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the outside of the inner court at 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 50 cubits on the east and north.</p>
<p>The North Gate</p>
<p>20He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court that faced north. 21It had 3 guardrooms on each side, and its side pillars and porches had the same measurements as the first gate. It was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; long and 43&rsquo; 1&quot; wide 50 x 25 cubits. 22Its windows and porches and its palm tree had the same measurements as the gate that faced east. 7 steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them. 23The inner court had a gate across from the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; he measured 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits from one gate to the other.	    Ezek 40:17-23</p>
<p>The South Gate</p>
<p>24Then he led me south to the south gate. He measured its side pillars and porches; they were the same as the others. 25The gate and its porches had windows all the way around like the other windows. It was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; long and 43&rsquo; 1&quot;wide 50 x 25 cubits. 26There were 7 steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them. It had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. 27The inner court had a gate facing south, and he measured 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 cubits from gate to gate.</p>
<p>Gates to the Inner Court</p>
<p>28Then he took me to the inner court by the south gate. It was the same size as the others. 29Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches were the same size as the others. The gate and its porches had windows all the way around; it was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; by 43&rsquo; 1&quot; 50 x 25 cubits. 30There were porches all the way around that measured 43&rsquo; 1&quot; by 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 25 x 5 cubits. 31Its porches faced the outer court. There were palm trees on its side pillars; its stairway had 8 steps.	    Ezek 40:24-31</p>
<p>32He took me to the inner court on the east side. That gate had the same measurements as the others. 33Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches measured the same as the others. The gate and its porches had windows all the way around; it was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; by 43&rsquo; 1&quot; 50 x 25 cubits. 34Its porches faced the outer court.  There were palm trees on its side pillars on each side; its stairway had 8 steps.</p>
<p>35Then he took me to the north gate. It also had the same measurements as the others. 36Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches were the same as the others. The gate had windows all the way around; it, too, was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; by 43&rsquo; 1&quot; 50 x 25 cubits. 37Its side pillars faced the outer court. There were palm trees on each side of its side pillars; its stairway had 8 steps.  	Ezek 40:32-37</p>
<p>Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices</p>
<p>38There was a room with its doorway by the side pillars at the gates, where they would wash the burnt offering. 39In the porch of the gate, there were 2 tables on each side for slaughtering the burnt offering, sin offering, and guilt offering. 40On the outer side, as you went up to the gate toward the north, there were 2 tables on each side of the gate; 414 tables were on each side next to the gate—8 tables for slaughtering sacrifices. 42For the burnt offering there were 4 hewn-stone tables 2&rsquo; 7&quot; 1½ cubits square and 1&rsquo; 8&quot; high 1 cubit. On them they lay the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 43The double hooks—4&quot; 1 handbreadth long—were fastened on the Temple all the way around. The meat from the offering was to be laid on the tables	Ezek 40:38-43</p>
<p>Rooms for the Priests</p>
<p>44From the outside to the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, one of which was at the side of the north gate with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the east gate facing north. 45He said,</p>
<p>“This room that faces south is for the priests that keep charge of the Temple. 46The room that faces north is for the priests that are in charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok from the sons of Levi, who approach Yahveh to minister to him.”</p>
<p>The Temple Courtyard and Temple</p>
<p>47He measured the court at 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits square. The altar stood in front of the Temple.</p>
<p>48Then he took me to the porch of the Temple and measured each side pillar of it—8&rsquo; 7&quot; 5 cubits square; each side of the gate was 5&rsquo; 2&quot; 3 cubits square. 49The porch measured 34&rsquo; 6&quot; x 19&rsquo; 20 x 11 cubits. At the stairway by which it was ascended, were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side.					Ezek 40:44-49</p>
<p>41:1Then he took me to the nave and measured the side pillars. Each pillar was 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 6 cubits square. 2The entrance was 17&rsquo; 3&quot; 10 cubits wide; the sides of the entrance were 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 3 cubits on each side. He measured the length and width of the nave at 69&rsquo; x 34&rsquo; 6&quot; 40 x 20 cubits. 3He went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway at 3&rsquo; 5&quot; 2 cubits, and the doorway at 6&rsquo; 10&quot; high and 12&rsquo; 1&quot; wide 6h x 7w cubits. 4He measured the front of the nave at 34&rsquo; 6&quot; 20 cubits square He told me, “This is the Holy Place.”	Ezek 41:1-4</p>
<p>5He measured the Temple wall at 10&rsquo; 4&quot;&rsquo; 6 cubits and the width of the side rooms at 6&rsquo; 11&quot; 4 cubits all around the Temple. 6The side rooms were three stories high, 30 rooms on each floor. They extended to the wall on their inside all around so they could be fastened and not be fastened into the wall of the Temple. 7The side rooms surrounding the Temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the Temple went up by stages on all sides of it, the width of the Temple increased as it went higher. So one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story. 8I saw also that the Temple had a raised platform all around. The foundations of the side rooms were 10&rsquo; 4&quot; 6 long cubits. 9The outer wall of the side rooms was 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 5 cubits thick. But the space between the side rooms belonging to the Temple 10and the outer rooms was 34&rsquo; 6&quot; 20 cubits wide all around the Temple. 11The doorways of the side rooms opened onto the part of the platform that was left free, one door to the north and one to the south. The width of the part that was left free was 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 5 cubits all around.	Ezek 41:5-11</p>
<p>12The building in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was 105ft wide. The building’s wall was 8&rsquo; 7&quot; 5 cubits thick all around, and it was 155&rsquo; 3&quot;long 90 cubits. 13Then he measured the Temple at 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits long. The separate area with the building and its walls was also 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits long. 14The front of the Temple and the separate area along the east side were 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits.</p>
<p>15He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side at 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits. 	Ezek 41:12-15a</p>
<p>He also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court. 16The nave of the Temple, the inner room, and the outer vestibule were paneled. Around all three there were windows with recessed frames. The threshold was paneled with wood all around from the floor to the windows (which were covered), 17to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. On all the walls round about in the inner room and the nave were carved likenesses 18of cherubs alternating with palm trees. Each cherub had two faces: 19the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole Temple round about. 20From the floor to above the door, cherubs and palm trees were carved on the wall.	Ezek 41:15b-20</p>
<p>21The doorposts of the nave were square. In front of the Holy Place was something like 22an altar of wood 3&rsquo; 5&quot; x 3&rsquo; 5&quot; x 5&rsquo; 2&quot; 2 x 2 x 3 cubits tall. Its corners, base, and sides were wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before Yahveh.” 23The nave and Holy Place each had a double door. 24The doors had two swinging leaves apiece. 25On the doors of the nave were carved cherubs and palms trees, such as were carved on the walls. There was a wood canopy in front of the vestibule outside. 26There were recessed windows and palm trees on each side on the side walls of the vestibule.	 Ezek 41:21-26</p>
<p>Rooms for the Priests</p>
<p>42:1Then he took me north to the outer court, to the rooms across from the Temple yard and the north building. 2The length of the building on the north side was 172&rsquo; 5&quot; x 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 x 100 cubits. 3Beside the 34&rsquo; 6&quot; 20 cubits that belonged to the inner court and facing the pavement of the outer court, there was a three-story gallery. 4In front of its rooms was an inner walkway 17&rsquo; 3&quot; wide x 172&rsquo; 5&quot; long 10 x 100lcubits with doorways on the north. 5The upper rooms were narrower, because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle floors of the building. 6The rooms had three stories and didn’t have any pillars like the pillars in the courts. So the upper rooms were set back more than the lower two levels. 7The outer wall beside the rooms toward the court was 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 cubits long. 8The rooms in the outer court were 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 cubits long. The rooms facing the Temple were 172&rsquo; 5&quot; 100 cubits long. 9Below those rooms, was the east entrance as you enter them from the outer court, where the outside wall begins.	 Ezek 42:1-9</p>
<p>10On the east across from the yard and the building there were rooms 11with a passage in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and with the same exits, arrangements, and doors. 12Below the south rooms, there was an entrance on the east side—where a person goes into the passage—and across from them there was a dividing wall.</p>
<p>13Then he told me,</p>
<p>“The north and south rooms, across from the separate area, are holy rooms where the priests that are near Yahveh are to eat the most holy things. They’ll lay the most holy things there—the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering; because the place is holy. 14When the priests go in, they’re not to go out to the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there the holy vestments that they minister in. They’ll put on other clothes so they can go to the parts of the building that’s open to the public.”</p>
<p>15When he’d finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out through the east gate, and measured all the way around the Temple: 165170&rsquo; 500 reeds on the east, 17north, 18south, and 19west sides. 20The Temple had a wall all the way around it, 5170&rsquo; 500 reeds long in both directions, to separate the holy from the common.	 Ezek 42:10-20</p>
<p>Yahveh’s Glory Returns to the Temple</p>
<p>43:1Then he led me to the east gate, 2and the glory of Israel’s God was shining through it. His voice sounded like crashing water, and the earth radiated with his glory. 3The vision I saw was like the one when he came to destroy the city, like the one by the Chebar River. I fell on my face. 4The glory of Yahveh came into the Temple through the east gate. 5The Spirit lifted me up and took me to the inner court, and the glory of Yahveh filled the Temple.  	Ezek 43:1-5</p>
<p>6While a man stood beside me, I heard someone talking to me from the Temple:</p>
<p>7“Son of man, this is the place for my throne and the soles of my feet, where I’ll live among the people of Israel permanently. Israel and its kings won’t defile my holy name anymore, either by their prostitution, by the dead bodies of their kings, 8or by setting their threshold by my threshold or their doorposts by my doorposts with only a wall between them and me. They’ve defiled my holy name with their disgusting deeds; so I’ve consumed them in my anger. 9Now they need to put their idolatry and their kings’ dead bodies far away from me so I can live among them from now on.	 Ezek 43:6-9</p>
<p>10“Son of man, describe to Israel what the Temple and its layout look like so they’ll regret their sins. 11If they regret everything they’ve done, then picture the Temple, its appearance, its exits and entrances, and its full layout. Show them its ordinances and laws. Write them down in their presence so they can observe them. 12This is the rule for the Temple: the whole area on top of the mountain will be most holy.</p>
<p>The Altar</p>
<p>13“These are the measurements of the altar: the base will be a 20.7&quot; 1 long cubit square with a 3.4&quot; 1 handbreadth border. This will be the height: 14from the base on the ground to the lower ledge is 3&rsquo; 5&quot; 2 cubits, with a width 20.7&quot; 1 cubit; from the smaller ledge to the large ledge is 6&rsquo; 11&quot; 4 cubits, with a width of 20.7&quot; 1 cubit. 15The altar hearth will be 6&rsquo; 11&quot; 4 cubits; from the altar hearth projecting upward will be 4 horns 20.7&quot; 1 cubit high. 16The altar hearth will be 20&rsquo; 8&quot; 12 cubits square. 17The ledge will be 24&rsquo; 1&quot; 14 cubits on four sides with a rim around it 10.3&quot; ½ cubit wide and a base 20.7&quot; 1 cubit wide all the way around. The altar’s steps will face east.”  					Ezek 43:10-17</p>
<p>18“He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahveh says, ‘These are the statutes at the time it’s built, to offer burnt offerings on it and sprinkle blood on it. 19For a sin offering, give a young bull to the Levitical priests that have descended from Zadok, who come near to me to minister. 20Put some of its blood on the altar’s four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border around it. Cleanse it and atone for it that way. 21Take the bull of the sin offering and burn it in the appointed place in the Temple outside the sanctuary. 22On the second day, offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering. They’re to cleanse the altar like they cleansed it for the bull. 23When you’ve finished cleansing it, present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock. 24Present them before Yahveh. The priests are to sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to Yahveh. 25For a week each day prepare a goat for a sin offering, a young bull, and a ram from the flock without blemish. 26For a week atone for the altar and purify it to consecrate it. 27From the eighth day on, the priests are to offer your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings; and I’ll accept you.’” 		    Ezek 43:18-27</p>
<p>The Prince, Levites, and Priests</p>
<p>44:1Then he brought me back through the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; it was shut. 2Yahveh told me,</p>
<p>“Keep this gate shut. Nobody is to go in through it because I’veY gone in through it. 3The prince will sit in it to eat bread in myY presence. He’ll go in by the vestibule of the gate and go out the same way.	Ezek 44:1-3</p>
<p>4Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. I looked and watched the glory of Yahveh fill the Temple; I fell on my face. 5Yahveh said,</p>
<p>“Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears everything I tell you about the statutes and laws of Yahveh’s Temple. Mark well the ones who can and can’t be admitted to the sanctuary. 6Tell the rebellious people in Israel, ‘Enough of your abominations! 7Enough bringing foreigners—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—into my sanctuary to profane my Temple, when you offered me my food, the fat and blood. You made my covenant void—besides all your abominations. 8You’ve not taken care of my holy things yourselves; you’ve set foreigners to take care of my sanctuary.”	Ezek 44:4-8</p>
<p>9“No foreigner living among the Israelites—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—can enter my sanctuary. 10The Levites that left me when Israel went astray after their idols will be punished. 11Yet they will minister in my sanctuary and oversee the gates to the Temple: they’ll slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and minister to them. 12Because they ministered to them in front of their idols and Israel stumbled over them, I’ve sworn that they’ll be punished: 13they won’t come near to serve as priests to me or approach any of my things most holy; they’ll bear their disgrace and the abominations they’ve committed. 14Yet I’ll give them responsibility for the Temple, its service, and everything done in it.	Ezek 44:9-14</p>
<p>15“But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept charge of my sanctuary when Israel left me, will come near to minister to me. They’ll serve me to offer the fat and blood. 16They’ll go into my sanctuary; they’ll come near to my table to minister to me and keep my charge. 17When they go in at the gates of the inner court, they’ll wear linen vestments, not wool, while they’re ministering at the gates of the inner court and in the Temple. 18They’ll wear linen turbans and underclothes around their waist, nothing that will make them sweat. 19When they go to the people in the outer court, they’ll take off those vestments, lay them in the holy rooms, and put on other clothes so they won’t transmit holiness to the people. 20They’re not to shave their heads or let their hair grow long; they’ll trim it. 21They are not to drink wine when they go into the inner court.</p>
<p>22Priests are not to marry a widow or divorced woman, only a virgin from Israel or a priest’s widow. 23They’ll teach my people the difference between holy and profane, clean and unclean. 24In disputes, they’ll act as judges and judge by my ordinances. They’ll keep my laws and statutes at my stated festivals and set aside my Sabbaths. 25They’re not to defile themselves by going near a dead person except for father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or virgin sister. 26After he’s defiled, he’ll wait a week and then be clean. 27The day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister, he’s to offer a sin offering for himself.”</p>
<p>Ezek 44:15-27</p>
<p>28“Don’t give them an inheritance in Israel; I’m their possession. 29They’ll eat the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering. Every devoted thing in Israel will belong to them. 30First part of the harvest of every kind and every kind of contribution will be for the priests. Give the priest the first of your dough to bring a blessing on your house. 31Priests aren’t to eat any bird or animal that’s died naturally or been torn to pieces by animals.  	Ezek 44:28-31</p>
<p>Division of the Land</p>
<p>45:1“When you divide the land by lot for inheritance, allot to Yahveh, a holy district 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits; it will be holy throughout. 2Inside it will be a holy place 861&rsquo; 500 cubits square with 86&rsquo; 3&quot; 50 cubits open all the way around it. 3Inside the district, set aside a section 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits for the sanctuary, the most holy place, 4the holy portion of the land. It will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary who come near to minister to Yahveh, a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 5Another section 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits will be for the Levites, the ministers of the Temple, and as their possession for towns to live in. 6Alongside the section designated as the holy district, assign for the possession of the city an area 1.63 x 8.2 miles 5,000 x 25,000 cubits. It will be for the whole House of Israel. 	Ezek 45:1-6</p>
<p>7“The prince will have land on both sides, alongside the holy district and the property for the city, on the west side and on the east side. Its length will correspond to one of the tribal portions and extend from the east to the west boundary of the land. 8He’ll own it so my officials won’t any longer oppress my people, but they’ll give the rest of the land to the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>Warnings for the Princes</p>
<p>9“Stop it, officials of Israel! Stop evicting my people!  Stop violence and destruction. Practice justice and goodness.</p>
<p>10“Use accurate balances, ephahs, and baths. 11An ephah and a bath will be the same amount: .1 homer (4½ pecks/1.1 bushels). 12A shekel will equal 20 gerahs; 60 shekels will equal 1 mina. 	Ezek 45:7-12</p>
<p>Offerings and Festivals</p>
<p>13“This is the offering you’re to provide: .18 bushel ⅙ ephah from 11 bushels 1 homer of wheat, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah from 11 bushels 1 homer of barley; 14and the prescribed portion of oil (that is, bath  of oil), .9 gallon  .1 bath from each 90 gallons 1 cor (which is 10 baths, or a homer, because 10 baths equal 1 homer); 15and one sheep from each flock of 200 from the watering places of Israel—for a grain offering, a burnt offering, and a peace offering, to make atonement for them,” the Lord Yahveh says. 16“All the general populace will give this offering for the prince. 17He will provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and liquid offerings for the festivals, new moons, and Sabbaths—at the stated festivals. He’ll provide the sin offering, grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, to atone for Israel.				 Ezek 45:13-17</p>
<p>18“On the first day of the first month. take a young bull without blemish and purify the sanctuary. 19The priests will take blood from the sin offering and put it on the door posts of the Temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court. 20He’s to do that on the seventh of the month for everybody that goes astray or sins in ignorance to make atonement for the Temple.</p>
<p>21“On the fourteenth day of the first month, observe the Passover festival for a week; eat bread without yeast. 22On that day the prince will provide a bull for a sin offering for himself and the people. 23Each day of the festival he’ll provide a burnt offering to Yahveh: 7 bulls and 7 rams without blemish, and 1 male goat for a sin offering. 24He’ll provide a grain offering: 4½ pecks 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of oil with each 4½ pecks l ephah. 25On the fifteenth day, seventh month, for the week of the festival, he’ll provide sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.” 	Ezek 45:18-25</p>
<p>46:1‘The Lord Yahveh says, “The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. 2The prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He’ll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won’t be shut till that evening. 3The people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before Yahveh on Sabbaths and new moons. 4The prince’s burnt offering on the Sabbath will be 6 lambs and 1 ram without blemish. 5The grain offering will be 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah.  6On the new moon, he’ll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. 7He’ll provide a grain offering 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil for each 4½ pecks bushels 1 ephah. 8The prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way.</p>
<p>Ezek 46:1-8</p>
<p>9“When the people present themselves to Yahveh at the stated festivals, the one that goes in through the north gate to worship will leave through the south gate. The one that goes in through the south gate will leave through the north gate. Nobody will leave through the same gate they entered. 10When they go in, the prince will go in with them; when they go out, he’ll go out. 11At the feasts and stated festivals, the grain offering will be 4½ pecks 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and with the lambs as much as a person can give, together with 1½ gallons   1 hin of oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 12When the prince provides a freewill offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He’ll provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he’ll go out, and the gate will be shut behind him.   	Ezek 46:9-12</p>
<p>13“Each morning, provide a year-old lamb without blemish for a burnt offering to Yahveh. 14Provide a grain offering with it, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah and ½ gallon ⅓ hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to Yahveh continually by ongoing ordinance. 15So a lamb and a grain offering with the olive oil will be provided every morning.</p>
<p>16‘The Lord Yahveh says, “If the prince gives a son a gift out of his inheritance, it will be a permanent possession. 17But if he gives a servant a gift from his inheritance, it will go back to the prince at the Year of Jubilee. His inheritance will belong only to his sons. 18The prince won’t confiscate people’s inheritance or chase them off their land. He’ll give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so my people won’t be separated from their possessions.”’”</p>
<p>Ezek 46:13-18</p>
<p>19Then he took me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy rooms for the priests, which faced north. There was a place at the far back toward the west. 20He said, “This is where the priests will boil the guilt offerings and sin offerings, and bake the grain offering so they won’t bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.” 21Then he took me to the four corners of the outer court. There was a small court in each corner, 22four enclosed corner courts, all the same size—69&rsquo; x 51&rsquo; 8&quot; 40 x 30 cubits. 23There was a row of masonry around them, and boiling places were made under the rows all the way around. 24He told me, “These places are where the ministers of the Temple will boil the nations’ sacrifices.” 	Ezek 46:19-24</p>
<p>A River of Healing from the Temple</p>
<p>47:1Then he took me back to the Temple door. Water was running east from under the threshold of the Temple, which faced east. It was running down from under the right side of the Temple, from south of the altar. 2He brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. Water was trickling from the south side.</p>
<p>3When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through the water, which was up to my ankles. 4Again he measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my knees. He measured another 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my waist. 5He measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits again, a river I couldn’t cross because it was too deep to ford; it was deep enough to swim in. 6He said, “Do you see that?”</p>
<p>Ezek 47:1-6a</p>
<p>He took me back to the riverbank. 7Lots of trees were growing on both sides of the river now. 8He said,</p>
<p>“This water runs east down to the Arabah, to the sea and makes it fresh. 9Wherever the water goes, everything that forms schools will live. There’ll be lots of fish because the water will be fresh. 10Fishermen will spread their nets from En-gedi to En-eglaim. There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 11But its swamps and marshes will stay salty. 12On both riverbanks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves won’t wither, and their fruit won’t fail. They’ll bear year around because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will provide food and their leaves will provide healing.”</p>
<p>Ezek 47:6b-12</p>
<p>The Boundaries of the Land</p>
<p>13The Lord Yahveh says,</p>
<p>‘When you divide up the land among the 12 tribes, give Joseph two portions 14and dividepl the inheritance equally like I swore to your ancestors.</p>
<p>15“These will be the boundaries for the land. The north boundary will run from the Mediterranean Sea past Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad; 16Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, (on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazerhatticon by the border of Hauran. 17So the boundary will run from the Sea to Hazarenan on the north border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. 18The east boundary will run from Hazarenan between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel. From the north border to the Dead Sea as far as Tamar. 19The south boundary will extend from Tamar as far as the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. 20The west boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea from the southern boundary to a point across from Lebo-hamath.</p>
<p>21-22“So divide the land by lots as an inheritance for the tribes and the foreigners that live among you; and have sons. Treat foreigners like native-born Israelites. Allot them an inheritance 23in the tribe where each one lives,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says.	Ezek 47:13-23</p>
<p>Division of the Land</p>
<p>48:1“These are the names of the tribes. Beginning on the northern boundary, from the sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enon (on the northern boundary of Damascus beside Hamath) running from the east side to the west: one portion each for Dan, 2Asher, 3Naphtali, 4Manasseh, 5Ephraim, 6Reuben, 7and Judah.	 Ezek 48:1-7</p>
<p>8“Adjoining Judah from east to west will be the allotment set aside from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits wide and equal to one of the portions. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it. 9-10The allotment set aside to Yahveh will be 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits, running east and west. The allotment will be for the priests 11that are sanctified from the descendants of Zadok, who kept my charge and didn’t go astray when Israel went astray—like the Levites did. 12It will be an allotment to them from the land, a most holy place beside the Levites’ portion. 13Alongside the boundary of the priests, the Levites will have a portion 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits. 14They won’t sell or temporarily exchange any of it or pass the first part of its harvest to anyone else, because it’s holy to Yahveh.</p>
<p>Ezek 48:8-14</p>
<p>15“The remainder, 1.63 x 8.2 miles 5,000 x 25,000 cubits, will be for common use by the city, for houses and open spaces. The city will lie in the middle of it. 16It will be square, measuring 1.47 miles on a side. 17The city will have an open space 430&rsquo; 7&quot; 250 cubits wide all the way around it. 18The rest of the length alongside the holy allotment will be 3¼ miles 10,000 cubits wide running east and west. Its crops and produce will feed the workmen in the city. 19The workmen in the city—from all the tribes—will cultivate it. 20The whole allotment will be 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits square. Set it aside with the city’s property.</p>
<p>21“What’s left on both sides of the holy portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince, extending from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits parallel to the holy portion. The holy portion with the Temple in the middle, 22the property of the Levites, and the property of the city will be inside the prince’s portion, which will lie between Judah and Benjamin. 	Ezek 48:15-22</p>
<p>23“For the rest of the tribes from east to west: Benjamin, one portion; 24then Simeon, one portion; 25then Issachar, one portion; 26then Zebulun, one portion; 27then Gad, one portion. 28Joining Gad at the south side, the boundary will be from Tamar to the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. 29That’s the land you’ll divide by lot to the tribes of Israel,”</p>
<p>the Lord Yahveh says. 	Ezek 48:23-29</p>
<p>The Gates of the City</p>
<p>30“The city, which is 1¼ mile on a side, 31will have gates that bear the names of the tribes:</p>
<p>three gates on the north side: Reuben, Judah, and Levi;</p>
<p>32three on the east: Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan;</p>
<p>33three on the south: Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; and</p>
<p>34three on the west: Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.</p>
<p>35The city will be 5.9 miles 18,000 cubits around and named Yahveh Is There [Yahveh Shammah].”   	Ezek 48:30-35</p>
