        <p>January 14, 2017</p>
<p>Bill,</p>
<p>A note about an idea that came to my mind the other day.  Several years ago my father was in the hospital with triple by-pass surgery.  My Mom asked him whether they shouldn’t just sell the cows they had on the farm.  They had always kept about a dozen or fifteen.  After I left the farm for college, they switched the herd over to more beef-type cattle via artificial insemination.  My dad’s response to her question was a curious one in a way: “If we sell the cows, I won’t have anything to go home to do,” or something to that effect.</p>
<p>I’m wondering whether that comment could have voiced a sense of things that is present also in your brother Tim.  He is an intelligent person, enough so that he surely knows that the pattern of operation at the pig farm cannot go on indefinitely.  It might seem odd that he does not sell the pigs when they could bring enough maybe to make the operation go—or at least keep it from going under.  The kernel notion here is that what goes on at the farm and with the swine, cats, and the like give him something to do.  Getting rid of them—in my father’s words—would give Tim nothing to occupy himself with, nothing for him to bestow himself on—no outlet.  They are also kind of his family; you don’t sell “family,” so to speak.  You mentioned in one of our conversations that he treated those little pigs as if they were his pets, his little toys.  The psychology of this behavior may be somewhat related to the hoarder syndrome as well.</p>
<p>So far I don’t think I’ve said anything that has not already crossed your mind several times.  The new element, though, in this picture for me was the point you made this last trip to Vermillion that the land was worth quite a bit; whether it’s shared with you or is his outright, I do not know.  I’m wondering whether his reasoning runs something like this:</p>
<p>“The way I’m doing this can go on for a while, depending on how much brother Bill helps out along the way and bails out the system as we go along.  When he comes back to the farm, he provides me some companionship, and there is something to do together as well as something for me to do when he leaves.  The process is the only thing that needs much attention (existential aspect of life); there is no goal or outcome I need to, or can, achieve here (eschatological aspect of life).  If things get to the point where the operation shuts down and we have to sell out, there is enough value in the land, equipment, and livestock to pay off the bills and provide for my modesty needs the rest of my life.  So, it does not matter whether we stay afloat or not.  The longer we do, the longer I have something to do.  But in the end it does not matter because I’m stuck, and there is no way to come out on top.  Besides, I’m not that goal-oriented anyway.  I’ll hold on as long as things do not collapse and then have to sell and ride it out the rest of the way as best I can on the remainder of the liquid assets. I don’t have anybody to pass things on to.”</p>
<p>These thoughts are not profound, and probably not new to you, but they form a picture for me that makes sense out of the features of the situation that I heard you talk about:  not selling the animals, not keeping things up around the farm, not trying to make a go of it.  It is the picture of a man that has “given up.”  He is just riding out the process for whatever stimulation it can give him.</p>
<p>I hope the weather is tolerable for you and that the kids continue to be so respectful and nice to you every day.  We are muttering through here, evidently missing the worst of the scary ice storm the weathermen have been talking about for several days.  East of here—and maybe north—has been getting the brunt of the system that is passing through.  One of these days it will warm up again and you can come back and cut down some more cedar saplings and we can talk some more about it and matters of our faith as well.  How about that!</p>
<p>Till then the best to you, and I look forward to you next visit.</p>
