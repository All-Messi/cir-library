        <p>NEHEMIAH</p>
<p>Conversational Yahveh Covenant</p>
<p>1;1The Memoirs of Nehemiah Ben-Hacaliah</p>
<p>Report from Jerusalem</p>
<p>In the month Chislev, the twentieth year, I was in Susa, the capital. 2Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men came from Judah. I asked them about the Jews that had survived the captivity and about Jerusalem. 3They told me, “The remnant in the province is in dire straits and dishonor. The wall around Jerusalem has been torn down and its gates burned.”</p>
<p>Nehemiah’s Prayer</p>
<p>4When I heard it, I sat down and cried and mourned for days. I fasted and prayed,</p>
<p>5“Yahveh God of heaven, great awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love for those who love you and keep your commandments, 6let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to my praying day and night for the Israelites your servants, and for confessing our sins against you. Even I and my father’s family have sinned. 7We’ve acted corruptly and not kept the commandments, statutes, or ordinances you gave Moses. 8Remember your promise to him, ‘If you’re not faithful, I’ll scatter you among the nations. 9But if you come back to me and keep my commandments—though scattered beyond the horizons—I’ll gather you up and bring you to the place where I’ve put my name.’ 10They’re the people you’ve redeemed by your power and strength. 11Please listen to my prayer and the prayer of your servants who delight in honoring you. Make me successful today; grant me mercy from this man.”</p>
<p>I was the king’s cupbearer.		    Neh 1:1-11</p>
<p>Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem</p>
<p>2:1In the month Nisan, twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, wine was present, and I took it up to him. I hadn’t been sad in his presence before. 2So he asked me, “Why do you look sad, but you’re not sick? This is nothing but sadness in you.”</p>
<p>I was apprehensive. 3“Long live the King! Why wouldn’t I look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates are burned?”</p>
<p>4“What would you ask?”</p>
<p>I prayed to the God of heaven 5and told the king, “If it pleases you, if I am pleasing to you, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ tombs so I can rebuild it.”</p>
<p>6(The queen was sitting beside him.) He asked me, “How long will it take? When will you be back?”</p>
<p>I set a time, and he agreed to send me.</p>
<p>7“If it pleases you, give me letters to the governors of Beyond the River to let me travel through to Judah. 8Also, give me a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress that’s by the Temple, for the city wall and a house for myself.”</p>
<p>He granted them because my God’s good hand was on me.	   Neh 2:1-8</p>
<p>Nehemiah Inspects the Walls of Jerusalem</p>
<p>9I delivered the king’s letters to the governors of Beyond the River. He’d sent officers of the army and cavalry for my protection. 10When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, they didn’t like it that someone had come to help the Israelites.</p>
<p>11I arrived at Jerusalem and was there three days. 12Then I and a few men got up during the night without telling anybody what God had put in my mind to do for Jerusalem. The only animal with us was the one I was riding. 13I went out by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls that were torn down and the gates that were burned up. 14I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there wasn’t any way for the animal I was riding to get past. 15I went up the valley and inspected the wall. Then I went in the Valley Gate again and came back. 16The officials didn’t know where I’d gone or what I’d done. I hadn’t told the Jews, the priests, nobles, officials, or anyone that would be doing the work.</p>
<p>17Then I told them, “You can see the bad situation we’re in. Jerusalem lies in ruins; its gates are burned. Let’s rebuild the wall so we can put an end to this disgrace.” 18I told them how God had helped me, and what the king had told me. They said, “Let’s build”; so they started on the good work. 19But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and despised us, “What are you doing? Revolting against the king?” 20I answered them, “The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will do the building; you don’t have any part, any legal or historical claim in Jerusalem.”	  Neh 2:9-20</p>
<p>Rebuilding the Walls</p>
<p>3:1Then Eliashib the high priest with his relatives the priests built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and hung its doors and consecrated the wall to the Tower of a Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.</p>

<p>13Hanun and the people from Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it, hung its doors with its bolts and bars, and 1500ft of the wall to the Refuse Gate.</p>
<p>14Malchijah Ben-Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccerem, repaired the Refuse Gate. He built it, covered it, and hung its doors with its bolts and bars. 	    Neh 3:7-14</p>
<p>15Shallum Ben-Col-hozeh, the official of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, covered it, and hung its doors with its bolts and bars. He repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah at the King’s Garden as far as the steps that go down from The City of David.</p>

<p>32Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants did repairs.		Neh 3:27-32</p>
<p>Opposition to the Work</p>
<p>4:1When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and ridiculed the Jews. 2In front of his relatives and wealthy men in Samaria, he asked,</p>
<p>“What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can they remake something out of the charred stones from dusty rubble?”</p>
<p>3Tobiah the Ammonite was close by and said, “Even a fox could jump on that stone wall they’re building and break it down!”</p>
<p>4“Listen how they despise us, God! Turn their mockery back on their heads and give them up for plunder in a land that takes them captive. 5Don’t forgive them; don’t blot out their sin. They’ve tried to demoralize the builders.”</p>
<p>6We were able to join the whole wall together to half its original height because the people were willing to work. 		   Neh 4:1-6</p>
<p>7Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that repairing the walls was continuing and that we were closing up the breaks in it. They were really mad. 8They conspired to fight Jerusalem and create confusion in it, 9but we prayed to God and set up a guard day and night. 10The people from Judah were saying, “The laborers were getting worn out, but there’s still a lot of rubble to move. We can’t rebuild the wall ourselves.”</p>
<p>11Our enemies said, “They won’t know it till we attack them, kill them, and stop the work.” 12When the Jews that lived close to them came and told us ten times, “They’ll come up against us from every direction,” 13I stationed men behind the wall in the lowest parts, the exposed places. I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows. 14When I saw how afraid they were, I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “You don’t have to be afraid of them. Remember our great awesome Lord. Fight for your brothers, your children, your wives and houses.” 		   Neh 4:7-14</p>
<p>15When our enemies heard that we knew about their plans and that God had frustrated it, each of us went back to work on the wall. 16From then on, half of my men worked while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the people of Judah. 17The ones that were rebuilding the wall and carrying burdens did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other. 18Each one attached his sword to his side as he built while the bugler stood close to me. 19I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,</p>
<p>“The work is important and extensive, and we’re a long way apart on the wall. 20Wherever you hear the bugle, rally there. Our God will fight for us.”</p>
<p>21We carried out the work with half of them holding spears from dawn till the stars came out. 22I told the people then, “Each man and his servant, spend the night inside Jerusalem so you can be guards at night and workmen during the day.” 23I, my brothers, servants, and guards didn’t change clothes. Everybody kept a weapon on them.      	Neh 4:15-23</p>
<p>Nehemiah Stops the Oppression of the Poor</p>
<p>5:1There was a loud outcry by husbands and wives against their fellow Jews. 2Some were saying, “There are a lot of us along with our sons and daughters. We need more food to survive.” 3Others said, “We’re mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and houses for grain because of the famine.” 4Yet others were saying,</p>
<p>“We’ve borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. 5Our flesh is like our brothers’ flesh, our children like their children; yet we’re forcing our children to be slaves. Some of our daughters have already been forced into slavery. We’re helpless because we’ve mortgaged our fields and vineyards to other people.”</p>
<p>6I was irate when I heard their outcries. 7I thought it over and contended with the nobles and rulers, “You’re charging your fellow Jews interest?!” I convened a large assembly against them 8and said, “As far as we were able, we’ve redeemed our Jewish brothers that were sold to Gentiles. Would you even sell your fellow Jews so they can be sold to us?”</p>
<p>They couldn’t think of anything to say. 		  Neh 5:1-8</p>
<p>9Again I said,</p>
<p>“What you’re doing is not right. Shouldn’t you fear God over the mockery by other nations, our enemies? 10I, my brothers, and servants are also lending them money and grain. Quit charging interest! 11Right now, give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves, houses, the hundredth part of the money and grain, new wine, and olive oil that you’ve been taxing them.”</p>
<p>12They said they’d do it. I called the priests and made them swear to it. 13I shook out the front of my garment, “May God shake out every man’s house and possessions who doesn’t fulfill that oath. May he shake him out this way and empty him.”</p>
<p>The assembly said, “Amen!” and praised Yahveh.</p>
<p>The offenders did what they vowed.		 Neh 5:9-13</p>
<p>Nehemiah’s Generosity</p>
<p>14From the day the king appointed me governor of Judah, my kinsmen and I had never eaten the governor’s food allowance—from the twentieth to thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes (12 years). 15The former governors had laid burdens on the people and took bread and wine from them besides 1 lb 40 shekels of silver. Even their assistants lorded it over the people. I didn’t do that because I respected God. 16I applied myself to the work on the wall. We didn’t buy any land; my servants gathered there to work. 17There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides those who came from nations around. 18I had an ox and six choice sheep prepared each day as well as birds; every 10 days I provided wine in abundance. But I still didn’t demand the governor’s food allowance; the people were in heavy servitude. 19God, remember me for the good I’ve done for them.	      	  Neh 5:14-19</p>
<p>Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</p>
<p>6:1Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out I’d rebuilt the wall so there wasn’t any break in it—although I hadn’t set up the doors in the gates yet. 2Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, “Meet us at Chephirim in the Plain of Ono.” They were planning to harm me. 3I sent messengers, “I’m in an extensive project. Why should the work stop while I’m with you?” 4They sent me four messages like that; I answered them the same way. 5Then Sanballat sent his servant a fifth time with an open letter in hand. 6He’d written,</p>
<p>“It’s reported among the countries—and Gashmu tells me it’s true—that you and the Jews plan to revolt; that’s why you’re rebuilding the wall. Those reports say you’ll be their king. 7You’ve also appointed prophets to make a declaration in Jerusalem about you, ‘There’s a king in Judah!’ Those reports will be passed on to the king. Come; let’s talk about it.” 	          	 Neh 6:1-7</p>
<p>8I sent him a message, “We haven’t done things like what you’re saying. You’ve made them up.” 9They were trying to scare us so we’d get discouraged and quit. But now, God, give me courage.</p>
<p>10When I went into the house of Shemaiah Ben-Delaiah Ben-Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let’s meet in God’s Temple and close the doors; they’re going to come during the night to kill you.” 11I said, “Should a man like me run to the Temple to save my life? I won’t do that.” 12I sensed that God hadn’t sent him. He gave me that warning because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him 13to scare me so I’d act accordingly and sin. They’d have a bad report to accuse me of. 14God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they’ve done, as well as Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets that were trying to scare me. 	   Neh 6:8-14</p>
<p>15The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul (in 52 days). 16When our enemies heard it and the nations around us saw it, they lost their confidence. They recognized that our God had helped accomplish the work. . 17During that time lots of letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles in Judah. 18Many in Judah were bound to him under oath because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 19In addition, they kept telling me about the good things he&rsquo;d done and reporting to him what I said. Tobiah kept sending letters to scare me.     		  Neh 6:15-19</p>
<p>The Walls Are Finished</p>
<p>7:1The wall had been rebuilt, and I’d set up the doors and appointed gatekeepers, singers, and Levites. 2I put Hanani my brother—along with Hananiah commander of the fortress—in charge of Jerusalem because he was a reliable man that respected God more than most. 3I told them,</p>
<p>“Don’t open the gates till the sun is hot. While they’re standing guard, shut and bolt the doors. Appoint guards from the people that live inside Jerusalem, each at his post by his own house.”</p>
<p>4The city was big and open, but there weren’t many people in it, and houses hadn’t been built.</p>
<p>5Then God put it in my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. I found the scroll with the genealogies for the ones that came up first; it read as follows:			  Neh 7:1-5</p>
<p>Lists of Returning Exiles</p>
<p>6-7the number of Israelites that came back to Jerusalem and Judah with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah:</p>

<p>61These were the ones that came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but couldn’t show that their ancestors’ houses or their descendants were from Israel: 62the sons of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 	642.</p>
<p>63from the priests: the families of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (This Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and had taken his family name.) 64They searched the genealogical records but couldn’t find their names. So they were considered unqualified and excluded from the priesthood. 65The governor told them not to eat the priests’ portion of the sacrifices till a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.</p>
<p>Totals of People and Gifts</p>
<p>66The whole assembly numbered 	42,360,</p>
<p>67plus the male and female servants   (7,337)</p>
<p>and male and female singers 	(245).</p>
<p>68They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 69435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.</p>
<p>70The governor donated to the treasury 19 lbs 1,000 drachmas of gold, 50 basins, and 530 priests’ vestments.</p>
<p>71For the work, some leaders of families donated to the treasury 375 lbs 20,000 darics of gold and 2,750 lbs 2,200 minas of silver. 		  Neh 7:61-71</p>
<p>72The rest of the people gave 375 lbs 20,000 drachmas of gold, 2,500 lbs 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests’ vestments.</p>
<p>73The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some of the people, the Temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.</p>
<p>By the seventh month, the Israelites were in their towns.	  Neh 7:72-73</p>
<p>Ezra Reads the Law</p>
<p>8:1The people congregated in the square by the Water Gate, and asked Ezra to bring The Book of the Law of Moses Yahveh had given Israel. 2On the first day, seventh month, he brought it to the assembly of men and women—anybody that could understand. 3He read from early morning till noon, and the people listened. 4He stood on a wooden podium built for that purpose. Beside him stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left; and Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. 5He unrolled the scroll where everybody could see it, because he was standing above them. When he unrolled it, they stood up. 6He blessed Yahveh the great God, and the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” and raised their hands. Then they bowed low in worship with their faces toward the ground. 7Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites explained the Law while they stood in their places. 8As they read the Law, they translated it so the people could understand it. 	  Neh 8:1-8</p>
<p>A Holy Day Declared</p>
<p>9Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said, “Today is set aside to Yahveh your God. Don’t mourn or cry.” (The people had been crying when they heard what the Law said.) 10He told them,</p>
<p>“Go eat the tasty food, drink the sweet things, and share with anyone that doesn’t have anything fixed. Don’t grieve; the joy of Yahveh makes you strong.”</p>
<p>11The Levites calmed the people, 12and they went away to eat, drink, share, and celebrate a great feast because they understood what had been explained to them.	         Neh 8:9-12</p>
<p>Festival of Booths Celebrated</p>
<p>13The next day the heads of families, the priests, and the Levites gathered to Ezra to gain greater insight into the Law. 14They found how Yahveh had commanded the Israelites to camp in booths during the festival of the seventh month. 15So they circulated a proclamation in their towns and in Jerusalem, “Go out to the hills, get olive branches, wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches from leafy trees to make booths, like it’s written.” 16So the people went out and brought them in to make booths on their roofs, in their courts, in the courts of God’s Temple, in the square by the Water Gate and the square by the Ephraim Gate. 17The whole assembly that had come back from the captivity made booths and camped in them. Israelites hadn’t done that since Joshua’s time. There was a lot of celebrating. 18Ezra read from God’s Law every day first to last. They celebrated the festival for a week, and on the eighth day held a solemn assembly as required by the Law. 		Neh 8:13-18</p>
<p>The People Confess Their Sin</p>
<p>9:1On the twenty-fourth of that month, the Israelites gathered with fasting in burlap and doused with dust. 2They separated from foreigners and confessed their and their ancestors’ sins. 3While they stood in their place, they read from the Law for a fourth of the day. For another fourth they confessed and worshiped Yahveh their God. 4On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and appealed to Yahveh their God.		Neh 9:1-4</p>
<p>5Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said,</p>
<p>“Bless Yahveh your God forevermore!</p>
<p>“May your glorious name be blessed</p>
<p>and regarded above all blessing and praise!</p>
<p>6You alone are Yahveh.</p>
<p>You made earth and sky,</p>
<p>the highest heavens with all their host,</p>
<p>the earth and everything on it,</p>
<p>the oceans and what’s in them.</p>
<p>The heavenly host bows to you.</p>
<p>7You’re Yahveh God</p>
<p>who chose Abram</p>
<p>and brought him from Ur of the Chaldees,</p>
<p>and named him Abraham.</p>
<p>8You found him faithful</p>
<p>and made a covenant with him</p>
<p>to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites,</p>
<p>Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites.</p>
<p>You fulfilled your promise</p>
<p>because you’re good.		 Neh 9:5-8</p>
<p>9“You saw our ancestors’ suffering in Egypt</p>
<p>and heard their outcry by the Red Sea.</p>
<p>10You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,</p>
<p>his officials, and his people.</p>
<p>You knew they acted arrogantly toward them</p>
<p>and made a name for yourself till now.</p>
<p>11You separated the sea</p>
<p>so they went through it on dry seabed;</p>
<p>but you threw their pursuers into the depths</p>
<p>like stones into raging water.</p>
<p>12You led them during the day with a pillar of cloud</p>
<p>and at night with a pillar of fire to light the way.	Neh 9:9-12</p>
<p>13Then you came down on Mount Sinai</p>
<p>and spoke to them from heaven;</p>
<p>you gave them just ordinances and true laws,</p>
<p>good statutes and commandments.</p>
<p>14You told them about your holy Sabbath</p>
<p>and laid down commandments, statutes, and law</p>
<p>through your servant Moses.</p>
<p>15You gave them bread from the sky for their hunger</p>
<p>and brought water out of rock for their thirst.</p>
<p>You told them to go in and take possession of</p>
<p>the land you swore to give them.		Neh 9:13-15</p>
<p>16“But our ancestors acted arrogantly;</p>
<p>they became stubborn</p>
<p>and ignored your commandments.</p>
<p>17They didn’t remember the awesome deeds</p>
<p>you did among them.</p>
<p>They became stubborn and appointed a leader</p>
<p>to take them back to slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>But you’re a forgiving God,</p>
<p>gracious and merciful,</p>
<p>slow to get angry and full of enduring love:</p>
<p>you didn’t abandon them.</p>
<p>18Even when they made a calf out of molten metal</p>
<p>and said, ‘This is your God</p>
<p>that brought you up from Egypt,’</p>
<p>and committed extreme blasphemies,</p>
<p>19in your great mercy</p>
<p>you didn’t abandon them in the desert.</p>
<p>The pillar of cloud didn’t leave them during the day</p>
<p>to guide them on their way;</p>
<p>the pillar of fire didn’t leave them at night</p>
<p>to light the way.		Neh 9:16-19</p>
<p>20You gave them your good Spirit to teach them;</p>
<p>you didn’t withhold your manna from them;</p>
<p>you gave them water for their thirst.</p>
<p>21For 40 years you provided for them in the desert,</p>
<p>and they had what they needed.</p>
<p>Their clothes didn’t wear out,</p>
<p>and their feet didn’t swell.</p>
<p>22You delivered kingdoms and nations to them</p>
<p>and allotted every corner to them.</p>
<p>They took the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon,</p>
<p>and the land of Og, king of Bashan.</p>
<p>23You made their descendants as numerous as the stars</p>
<p>and took them into the land</p>
<p>you told their ancestors to possess.</p>
<p>24So their descendants went in and took possession of it;</p>
<p>you subdued its people, the Canaanites;</p>
<p>you delivered them to your people along with their kings</p>
<p>to do with them whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>25They captured fortified towns and a fertile land;</p>
<p>they took possession of houses full of every good thing:</p>
<p>hewn cisterns, vineyards,</p>
<p>olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance.</p>
<p>They ate their fill, got fat,</p>
<p>and reveled in your great goodness.			Neh 9:20-25</p>
<p>26“But they became disobedient,</p>
<p>rebelled against you,</p>
<p>tossed your Law aside,</p>
<p>and killed the prophets that admonished them</p>
<p>to come back to you;</p>
<p>they committed great blasphemies.</p>
<p>27So you delivered them to their oppressors;</p>
<p>but when they appealed to you in their distress,</p>
<p>you heard them from heaven, and with your great mercy,</p>
<p>gave them deliverers to rescue them.			Neh 9:26-27</p>
<p>28But as soon as they got comfortable,</p>
<p>they sinned again;</p>
<p>so you abandoned them to their enemies,</p>
<p>and they ruled over them.</p>
<p>When they appealed to you again, you heard from heaven,</p>
<p>and rescued them many times in your great mercy;</p>
<p>29and admonished them to return to your Law.</p>
<p>But they acted arrogantly,</p>
<p>ignored your commandments,</p>
<p>sinned against your ordinances</p>
<p>that if people observe, they’ll live.</p>
<p>They turned a stubborn shoulder,</p>
<p>and stiffened their neck,</p>
<p>and wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p>30But you bore with them for many years</p>
<p>and admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets;</p>
<p>yet they wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p>So you delivered them to the nations that lived in the lands.</p>
<p>31But in your great mercy</p>
<p>you didn’t make an end to them or abandon them,</p>
<p>because you’re a gracious and merciful God. 	Neh 9:28-31</p>
<p>32“Now, great, powerful, awesome God</p>
<p>that keeps covenant and enduring love,</p>
<p>don’t consider the hardship insignificant</p>
<p>that has come on us, our kings, officials, and priests,</p>
<p>our prophets, ancestors, and all your people</p>
<p>from the time of the kings of Assyria till now.</p>
<p>33You’re justified in everything that’s happened to us,</p>
<p>because you’ve dealt faithfully;</p>
<p>but we’ve acted sinfully.</p>
<p>34Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors</p>
<p>haven’t kept your Law</p>
<p>or paid attention to your commandments and admonitions.</p>
<p>35But they, in their own kingdom,</p>
<p>with your great goodness that you gave them,</p>
<p>with the wide, rich land you set in front of them,</p>
<p>did not serve you or turn from their sins.			Neh 9:32-35</p>
<p>36We’re slaves today</p>
<p>in the land you gave our ancestors to eat its fruit and bounty.</p>
<p>37Its abundant produce is for the kings</p>
<p>that you set over us because of our sins.</p>
<p>They rule our bodies and our livestock as they please;</p>
<p>we’re in great distress.</p>
<p>38Because of that, we’re signing a covenant;</p>
<p>and our officials, Levites, and priests have set their seal to it.”	Neh 9:36-38</p>
<p>People That Sealed the Covenant</p>
<p>10:1-8The sealed document showed the names of these priests: Nehemiah the governor,</p>
<p>Ben-Hacaliah; Zedekiah, Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah;</p>
<p>9the Levites: Jeshua Ben-Azaniah, Binnui of the family of Henadad, Kadmiel; 10and their brothers Shebanaih, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 11Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 12Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 13Hodiah, Bani, Beninu;</p>
<p>14the leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 15Bunni Azgad, Bebai, 16Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 17Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 18Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 19Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 20Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 21Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 22Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 23Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 24Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 25Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 26Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 27Malluch, Harim, Baanah;	Neh 10:1-27</p>
<p>Obligations of the Covenant</p>
<p>28The rest of the people—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, Temple servants, everybody that separated from the people in the land, their wives, their sons and daughters, everybody that had knowledge and understanding—29are joining their kinsmen and nobles in taking a curse and an oath. They swear to follow God’s Law through Moses, to observe his commandments, 30and not to intermarry with the people in the territory. 31If any people in the land bring wares or grain to sell on the Sabbath or a holy day, we won’t buy them. We won’t plant crops in the seventh year or exact any debt that year.</p>
<p>32We’ve obligated ourselves to contribute yearly .13 oz ⅓ of a shekel of silver for the service in God’s Temple: 33for the showbread, the continual grain offering and burnt offering; the Sabbaths, new moon, and appointed times; for the holy things, the sin offerings to atone for Israel, and the work on God’s Temple.		Neh 10:28-33</p>
<p>34Likewise, we cast lots for supplying wood to the priests, Levites, and the people so they could bring it to God’s Temple by families at set times each year. It was for burning on the altar as the Law requires. 35We committed to bringing the first part of the harvest from our ground and trees to Yahveh’s Temple every year; 36to bringing our male firstborns, cattle, herds, and flocks as the Law requires, especially in written form, for the priests that minister in God’s Temple. 37We’ll also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the olive oil to the priests at the rooms of God’s Temple. We’ll bring a tenth from our ground to the Levites, because they’re the ones that receive the tithes in the rural towns. 38The priest, the descendant of Aaron, will be with the Levites when they receive the tithes. The Levites will bring up a tenth of the tithes to the storerooms in God’s Temple. 39The people of Israel and the Levites will bring the contribution of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the chambers.  There are the utensils for the sanctuary, the priests that are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers.  That way we won’t neglect the Temple of our God.	      	  Neh 10:34-39</p>
<p>The Leaders in Jerusalem</p>
<p>11:1The people’s leaders already lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one in ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths stayed in the other towns. 2The people commended those who volunteered to move to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem, but in the towns of Judah each lived on his own property: the Israelites, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants. 4Some of the people of Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>From Judah was Athaiah Ben-Uzziah (Ben-Zechariah Ben-Amariah Ben-Shephatiah) Ben-Mahalalel.</p>
<p>From Perez was 5Maaseiah Ben-Baruch (Ben-Col-hozeh Ben-Hazaiah Ben-Adaiah Ben-Joiarib) Ben-Zechariah son of the Shilonite. 6The descendants of Perez that lived in Jerusalem were 468 capable men.</p>
<p>7These are the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu Ben-Meshullam (Ben-Joed Ben-Pedaiah Ben-Kolaiah Ben-Maaseiah Ben-Ithiel) Ben-Jeshaiah; 8and after him Gabbai and Sallai: 928. 9Joel Ben-Zichri was their overseer. Judah Ben-Hassenuah was second in command in the city. 	    Neh 11:1-9</p>
<p>10From the priests:</p>
<p>Jedaiah Ben-Joiarib, Jachin, 11Seraiah Ben-Hilkiah (Ben-Meshullam Ben-Zadok Ben-Meraioth Ben-Ahitub), supervisor of God’s Temple, 12and their relatives that did the work on the Temple, 822;</p>
<p>Adaiah Ben-Jeroham (Ben-Pelaliah Ben-Amzi Ben-Zechariah Ben-Pashhur Ben-Malchijah), 13and his associates, leaders of families: 242,</p>
<p>Amashsai (Ben-Azarel Ben-Ahzai Ben-Meshillemoth Ben-Immer,) 14and their brothers, trained soldiers: 128.</p>
<p>Zabdiel Ben-Haggedolim was their officer.</p>
<p>15From the Levites:</p>
<p>Shemaiah Ben-Hasshub Ben-Azrikam Ben-Hashabiah Ben-Bunni;</p>
<p>16Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who supervised the outside work on God’s Temple;</p>
<p>17Mattaniah Ben-Mica Ben-Zabdi Ben-Asaph, who led in thanksgiving;</p>
<p>Bakbukiah, the second among his relatives;</p>
<p>Abda Ben-Shammua Ben-Galal Ben-Jeduthun.</p>
<p>18The Levites in the holy city numbered 284.	  Neh 11:10-18</p>
<p>19The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their relatives, who guarded the gates, were 172. 20The rest of Israel, the priests, and Levites lived in towns in Judah on their own inheritances, 21but the Temple servants lived in Ophel. Ziha and Gishpa supervised them.</p>
<p>22The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani (son of Hashabiah son of Mattaniah son of Mica) from the descendants of Asaph, singers for the service of God’s Temple. 23The king laid out the daily responsibilities for the song leaders. 24Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s advisor in everything that had to do with public administration.		Neh 11:19-24</p>
<p>Villages Outside Jerusalem</p>
<p>25The villages with their fields: some people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba, Dibon, Jekabzeel; 26in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth-pelet 27in Hazar-shual, Beersheba, 28in Ziklag, Meconah, 29Enrimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, 30Zanoah, Adullam, Lachis, Azekah, each with their fields, settlements, and villages. They camped from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom. 31Some people of Benjamin lived at Geba, Michmash and Aija, Bethel and its settlements, 32at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 36Some divisions of Levites that lived in Judah moved to live in Benjamin. 		Neh 11:25-36</p>
<p>Priests and Levites</p>
<p>12:1These are the priests and Levites that came up with Zerubbabel Ben-Shealtiel, the king, and Jeshua the high priest: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 2Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 3Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 4Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 5Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 6Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 7Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their relatives at the time of Jeshua.</p>
<p>8The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brothers was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 9Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood across from them in their service divisions. 10Jeshua was Avi-Joiakim (Avi-Eliashib Avi-Joiada 11Avi-Jonathan Avi-Jaddua).		Neh 12:1-11</p>
<p>12At the time of Joiakim the priests, the family leaders were:</p>
<p>of Seraiah, Meraiah;</p>
<p>of Jeremiah, Hananiah;</p>
<p>13of Ezra, Meshullam;</p>
<p>of Amariah, Jehohanan;</p>
<p>14of Malluchi, Jonathan;</p>
<p>of Shebaniah, Joseph;</p>
<p>15of Harim, Adna;</p>
<p>of Meraioth, Helkai;</p>
<p>16of Iddo, Zechariah;</p>
<p>of Ginnethon, Meshullam;</p>
<p>17of Abijah, Zichri;</p>
<p>of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 		Neh 12:12-17</p>
<p>18of Bilgah, Shammua;</p>
<p>of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;</p>
<p>19of Joiarib, Mattenai;</p>
<p>of Jedaiah, Uzzi;</p>
<p>20of Sallai, Kallai;</p>
<p>of Amok, Eber;</p>
<p>21of Hilkiah, Hashabiah;</p>
<p>of Jedaiah, Nethanel.		Neh 12:18-21</p>
<p>22The heads of the Levites’ families were registered at the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua; so were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian. 23The Levites, heads of families, were registered in The Book of Chronicles up to the time of Johanan Ben-Eliashib. 24The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua Ben-Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite to them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division. 25Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub watched over the storehouses by the gates. 26These served at the time of Joiakim Ben-Jeshua Ben-Jozadak, Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe.</p>
<p>Dedication of the Walls</p>
<p>27At the dedication of the wall at Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from wherever they were living, to bring them to Jerusalem so they could celebrate the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 28The singers gathered from the district around Jerusalem and the villages around Netophah, 29from Beth-gilgal and their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, because the singers had built villages around Jerusalem. 30The priests and Levites purified themselves, the people, the gates, and the wall.	  Neh 12:22-30</p>
<p>31Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on the wall, and I appointed two large choirs. The first choir went right on the wall toward the Refuse Gate. 32Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, 33with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 35some of the priests with trumpets; Zechariah Ben-Jonathan (Ben-Shemaiah Ben-Mattaniah Ben-Micaiah Ben-Zaccur Ben-Asaph, 36and his relatives), Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe went ahead of them. 37At the Fountain Gate they went up the steps of The City of David by the stairway of the wall above David’s palace to the Water Gate on the east.</p>
<p>38The second choir went left, while I followed them with half the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the broad wall, 39and above the Ephraim Gate, by the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Guard Gate. 40Then the two choirs took their place in God’s Temple. So did I and half of the officials with me; 41and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with the trumpets; 42and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang with Jezrahiah their leader, 43and on that day they offered a great number of sacrifices and celebrated because God had made them happy. The women and children celebrated too; the joy in Jerusalem was heard a long way off.</p>
<p>Neh 12:31-43</p>
<p>Provisions for Temple Worship</p>
<p>44On that day, men were also appointed to oversee the rooms for storing contributions, firstfruits, and tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites; because Judah celebrated over the priests and Levites that served. 45They performed the worship of God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers according to the command of David and Solomon. 46In the time of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers, and there were songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. 47Israel at the time of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and gatekeepers as each day required. They set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the descendants of Aaron.</p>
<p>Neh 12:44-47</p>
<p>Nehemiah’s Final Reforms</p>
<p>13:1That day they read out loud from the Book of Moses so the people could hear it. There they found that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter God’s assembly. 2That was because they didn’t provide the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam to curse them. But our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3When they heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.</p>
<p>4Before this, Eliashib the priest—who was responsible for the rooms of God’s Temple and related to Tobiah—5had provided him a large room where they used to put the grain offerings, frankincense, utensils; the tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers; and the contributions for the priests. 6During that time I wasn’t in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I’d gone back to the king and after some time asked leave from him. 7I returned to Jerusalem and learned what evil Eliashib had done by providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the Temple. 8I threw out his belongings 9and ordered the rooms purified. I put back in there the utensils for God’s Temple, the grain offerings, and the frankincense.		       Neh 13:1-9</p>
<p>10I also discovered that the Levites hadn’t been receiving their portions, so they and the singers that performed service had gone to their fields. 11I reprimanded the officials, “Why is God’s Temple abandoned?” I gathered them together and restored them to their posts. 12Then Judah brought a tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil to the storehouses. 13I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Hanan Ben-Zaccur Ben-Mattaniah, and Pedaiah from the Levites to oversee the storehouses because I considered them reliable. They were responsible for distributing to their fellow Levites. 14Remember me for this, God. Don’t blot out my loyal efforts for your Temple and its services.</p>
<p>15At that time, I saw some people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath. They were bringing into Jerusalem sacks of grain loaded on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs—all kinds of merchandise on the Sabbath. I admonished them the day they sold the food. 16Men from Tyre were living there too. They were importing fish and other merchandise, and selling them to Judah on the Sabbath, right in Jerusalem. 17I reprimanded the nobles of Judah,</p>
<p>“What’s this sin you’re committing, profaning the Sabbath? 18Didn’t your ancestors do the same thing, and our God brought this trouble on us and this city? You’re adding to his wrath on Israel.”	     	Neh 13:10-18</p>
<p>19I commanded that the gates be shut the day before Sabbath at dusk and not opened till after Sabbath. I stationed some of my guards at the gates so no merchandise would come in on the Sabbath. 20Once or twice the traders and merchants spent the night just outside Jerusalem. 21I warned them, “Why are you spending the night by the wall? Do it again, and I’ll use force on you.” From then on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath. 22I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the Sabbath. Remember me for this too, God. Have mercy on me in keeping with your great enduring love.</p>
<p>23At that time, I saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 24Half of their children spoke in the language of Ashdod and couldn’t speak the language of Judah. 25I contended with them, cursed them, struck some of them, pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God,</p>
<p>“Don’t intermarry with them. 26Didn’t Solomon sin in this matter? Among the nations there wasn’t a king like him. God loved him and made him king over all Israel, but foreign women caused even him to sin. 27Do we then hear that you’ve acted unfaithfully against our God?”</p>
<p>28Even one of the sons of Joiada Ben-Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat; so I banished him. 29Remember them, God, for defiling the priesthood and the covenant between the priesthood and the Levites.</p>
<p>30I purified them from everything foreign and appointed specific duties for the priests and the Levites. 31I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the firstfruits of harvest to be brought in at the appointed times. Remember me, God, for the good I’ve done.</p>
<p>Neh 13:19-31</p>
