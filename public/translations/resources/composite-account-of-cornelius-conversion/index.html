        <p>COMPOSITE ACCOUNT OF CORNELIUS’ CONVERSION</p>
<p>Acts 10:1-24 (Caesarea/Joppa); 10:25-48 (Caesarea); 11:1-18 (Jerusalem)</p>
<p>(wording found in more than one segment)</p>
<p>[generalization] [italics viewpoint adjustment]</p>
<p>(presented as from Peter’s defense in Jerusalem)</p>
<p>11:1The apostles and brothers in Judaea heard that Gentiles had received God’s message. 2When Peter went up to Jerusalem, members of the Circumcision took issue with him, 3“You went in and ate with uncircumcised men.”</p>
<p>Peter explained step by step. 10:1“A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius, from the Italian cohort, 2is a devout God-fearer along with his whole house. 30He gave considerable charitable gifts to the people and prayed to God constantly. He was keeping three p.m. prayer in his house. 3In a vision he saw clearly an angel of God coming and standing in front of him, ‘Cornelius.’</p>
<p>4“Cornelius looked at him and was afraid, ‘Yes, Sir?’</p>
<p>31“God has heard your prayers and remembered your charitable gifts. 32Send men to Joppa and summon Simon, called Peter. He’s staying with Simon, a tanner, whose house is next to the sea. 11:14He’ll tell you what will save you and your household. 10:7When the angel left, right away he called two household servants—his personal assistants, and a devout soldier. 8He went through everything with them and sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p>9“The next day, while they were getting close to the town, I went up on the housetop about noon to pray. 10I was getting hungry. While they were fixing lunch, I saw a vision in a trance. I watched the sky open and a container like a big sheet was lowered to the earth by four corners. 11:5It came to me. I stared into it, and saw four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds in it.</p>
<p>“I heard a voice, ‘Kill and eat them, Peter.’</p>
<p>“‘No, Sir, I’ve never eaten anything unclean.’</p>
<p>“The voice spoke out of heaven a second time, ‘Don’t you consider unclean what God has cleansed.’</p>
<p>“That happened three times, and the container went back up into the sky.</p>
<p>10:17“While I was wondering what the vision could possibly mean, right then Cornelius’ three men from Caesarea were standing at the gate of the house where we were. 18They called out, asking if Simon, called Peter, was staying there. 19The Spirit said, ‘Three men are looking for you. 20Go down and go with them, without scruples. I’ve sent them.’</p>
<p>21“I went down and said to them, ‘I’m the one you’re looking for. Why are you here?’</p>
<p>22“They said, ‘Cornelius is a centurion, a good God-fearer, with a good reputation in the Jewish nation. A holy angel directed him to invite you to his house to hear what you have to say.’ 23So I invited them in and put them up for the night.</p>
<p>“The next day I went with them, 12and these six brothers from Joppa went along. 24On the second day at about three o’clock we came into Caesarea 12and went into the man’s house.</p>
<p>24“Cornelius was expecting us and had called his relatives and close friends. 25When I came in, he met me and fell down and worshiped me. 26I raised him up, ‘Please stand up; I’m just a man too.’ 27As we talked, I went on in and found a large group gathered.</p>
<p>28“I told them, ‘You know a Jew’s not supposed to associate in a home with a foreigner.’ But God has shown me not to consider anybody unclean. 29So without objecting, I came when you called. Why did you send for me?’</p>
<p>“Cornelius said, ‘Four days ago . . . a man in bright clothes told me to summon you. 33Thank you for coming. We’re here now in front of God to hear what the Lord’s commanded you.’ 34I said,</p>
<p>‘I perceive that God doesn’t play favorites with people. 35But, in every nation he accepts the ones that respect him and live the way he wants them to. 36He sent the message to the sons of Israel, preaching good news about peace through Jesus the Messiah, who is Lord over everybody. 37You know what took place all over Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism John preached. 38God anointed Jesus the Nazarene with the Holy Spirit and power. He went around doing good and healing people the devil oppressed, because God was with him. 39We’re witnesses of what he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. The One they killed on a tree 40God raised up the third day and presented him clearly, 41not to everybody, but to witnesses he previously handpicked—to us who ate with him after his resurrection. 42He sent us to testify to the People that he’s the One God appointed to judge the living and the dead. 43The prophets testify that through him everybody who trusts in him receives forgiveness of sins.’</p>
<p>44“While I was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on 10:15them as on us in the beginning. 45The believers from the Circumcision who came with me were surprised that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Gentiles too. 46They heard them speak in languages and praise God. 16I remembered what the Lord said, ‘John immersed in water, but you’ll be “immersed” in the Holy Spirit.’ 17If God gave them the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus the Messiah [Christ], who was I to oppose God?</p>
<p>“I responded, 46‘Nobody can forbid water, can they, for baptizing these who have received the Holy Spirit like we did?’ I 48commanded to baptize them into Jesus the Messiah. They asked me to stay for several days.”</p>
<p>11:18When the apostles and brothers heard this, they backed off and glorified God. “Then to Gentiles too God has offered repentance to life.”</p>
