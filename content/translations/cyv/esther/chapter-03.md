## Esther Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman Ben-Hammedatha the Agagite, and made his authority secure over his fellow officials. 2The king's aides at the king's gate bowed in homage to Haman because that's what the king commanded. But Mordecai didn't bow. 3The king's aides at the king's gate said, "Why aren't you obeying the king?" 4When they'd spoken every day to him and he ignored them they told Haman to see if he would tolerate Mordecai's reason for not bowing to him: he'd told them he was a Jew. 5When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow in homage, it made him mad. 6But he thought it was beneath his station to arrest only Mordecai. Since they'd told him who Mordecai's nationality was, he made an effort to destroy all the Jews in the kingdom.	      	Esther 3:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In the first month (Nisan), twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (the lot) in front of Haman daily and from month to month, till the twelfth month (Adar). 8Then Haman told King Ahasuerus, "There's a nation scattered around the provinces whose laws are different from other people's laws. They don't observe your laws; so it's not in your interest to let them stay. 9If it pleases you, issue a decree to destroy them. I'll pay 377½ tons 10,000 talents of silver to the ones that carry out your business, and I'll put it in your treasuries." 		Esther 3:7-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The king took off his signet ring and gave it to Haman, enemy of the Jews. 11He told him, "The silver is yours, and the people too. Do what you want to with them." 12Then the king's scribes were summoned the thirteenth day, first month. They wrote what Haman told the king's satraps, the governors in each province, the rulers of each people group—each province in its script, each people in its language—in the king's name, sealed with his signet ring. 13Letters went out by couriers to the king's provinces to destroy, kill, and annihilate the Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day, twelfth month (Adar), and to confiscate their possessions. 14A copy of the edict was issued in every province and published to all the people so they'd be ready on that day. 15The couriers went out, urged by the king's command, while the decree was issued in Susa. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, Susa was in confusion.           		Esther 3:10-15 Mordecai Persuades Esther to Help</span>
