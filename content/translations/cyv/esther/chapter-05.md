## Esther Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On the third day, Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace by his rooms. He was sitting on his throne across from the entrance to the palace. 2When he saw her, he was pleased and extended the gold scepter that was in his hand. She came and touched the top of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He asked her, "What's troubling you, Queen Esther? What's your request? I'll give it to you up to half the kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> She said, "If it pleases you, may you and Haman come to the banquet I've prepared for yousg today."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He said, "Bring Haman right away so we can do what Esther wants." The king and Haman went to the banquet she'd prepared. 6As they drank their wine, the king asked her, "What's your petition; I'll grant it. What's your request? I'll do it up to half the kingdom." 	  Esther 5:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Esther answered, "My petition is: 8if I've found favor with you, if it pleases you to grant my petition, may you and Haman come to the banquet I'll prepare for you, and tomorrow I'll do like you ask." Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Haman went out happy and pleased. But when he saw Mordecai in the king's gate not standing up or nervous in his presence, it made him mad. 10He controlled himself, though, went home and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 11He recounted his glorious wealth, how many sons he had, every instance where the king had honored him and promoted him above the king's other nobles and officials. 12He added, "Even Queen Esther didn't have anybody but me come with the king to the banquet she'd prepared. She's also invited me with him tomorrow. 13Yet none of this satisfies me whenever I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Zeresh and his friends said, "Have gallows built 75ft high. In the morning, ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go happy with him to the banquet." Haman liked that, so he had them built.		 Esther 5:7-14 The King Honors Mordecai</span>
