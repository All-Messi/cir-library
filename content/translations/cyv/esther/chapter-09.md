## Esther Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The <strong>thirteenth day, twelfth month</strong>, when the king’s edict was about to be carried out and the Jews’ enemies hoped to gain mastery over them, fortunes reversed. The Jews gained mastery over those who hated them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They gathered in their towns throughout the provinces to seize the ones that tried to harm them. Nobody could stand up against them, because the dread of the Jews had fallen on the people. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Even the rulers of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the ones that were doing the king’s business helped the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He became greater and greater in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Jews struck their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying, and doing what they pleased to the ones that hated them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Mordecdai recorded those events and sent letters to all the Jews in the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near and far. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He obliged them to celebrate the <strong>fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar</strong> each year, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>the days the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies. It was a month for them that turned sorrow into happiness, mourning into a holiday. They were to make them days of feasting and celebrating and sending dishes <em>o</em><em>f </em><em>food</em> to one another and gifts to the poor. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The Jews undertook to do what Mordecai had written. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong>Haman</strong> Ben-Hammedatha the Agagite, <strong>enemy of the Jews</strong>, had schemed to destroy them. He’d cast Pur (the lot) to disturb them and destroy them. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But when it came to the king’s attention, he commanded by letter that <em>Haman’s</em> scheme should come back on his own head; he and his sons would be hanged on the gallows. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They called those days Purim after the Pur. Because of the instruction in this letter—what they’d seen in this regard and what had happened to them—<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>the Jews established a custom for themselves, their descendants, and their allies: to celebrate those two days according to their regulation at the appointed time each year. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Those days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, family, province, and city. The days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews or their memory from their descendants.<strong>	</strong><strong>	   </strong><strong>E</span>
