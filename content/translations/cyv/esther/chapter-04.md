## Esther Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Mordecai found out what had happened, he tore his clothes, put on burlap and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He went as far as the king’s gate, because nobody was supposed to enter the king’s gate dressed in burlap. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In every province where the decree had gone, the Jews were mourning greatly with fasting, crying, wailing. Many were lying on burlap and ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and she writhed in anguish. She sent clothes to Mordecai so he’d take off his burlap, but he didn’t accept them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then she summoned Hathach from the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and told him to go to Mordecai and find out why he was in mourning. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Mordecai told him what had happened, and the amount of money Haman promised to pay the king’s treasuries for destroying the Jews. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He gave Hathach a copy of the edict issued in Susa for their destruction. That way he could show Esther and have her go in to the king and implore his help and plead with him for her people.<strong> </strong><strong>Esther 4:1-8</strong><strong>  </strong></span>
