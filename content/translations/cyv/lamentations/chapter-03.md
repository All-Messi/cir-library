## Lamentations Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I have seen suffering under the rod <em>God</em> used in his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He made my skin and body waste away, and broke my bones.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He made me live in dark places like the dead from long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He walled me in so I couldn’t escape and put heavy chains on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Even when I call for help, he shuts out my prayer.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He has blocked my road with hewn stones and made my paths crooked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He’s like a bear lying in wait for me, like a lion in unexpected places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces; and made me desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:9-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I’m a laughingstock to my people, mocked in musical ditties all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He filled me with bitterness and made me drink wormwood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He cracked my teeth with gravel and made me grovel in the dust.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I’ve been set apart from peace and forget what happiness is like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So I say, <em>“My strength is gone, </em> <em>	</em><em>	and so is my hope in Yahveh.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Remember my suffering and homelessness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><u>I</u> certainly remember and am humbled within.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:17-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I recall this and have hope <em>from it</em>:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Yahveh love never stops <em>coming</em>; his mercies don’t end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>His faithfulness is great; it’s renewed every morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>I say to myself, <em>“Yahveh is my </em><em>portion;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>so</em><em> I have hope in him.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:21-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Yahveh is good to those who depend on him, people that look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They do well to wait silently for his salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>It’s good for people to bear the yoke when they’re young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>to sit alone in silence, since <em>God</em> has laid it on them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>29</sup></strong>to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there’s hope,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong>to turn their cheek to their abuser, to be filled with disgrace;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>31</sup></strong>because Yahveh won’t reject forever.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:25-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>32</sup></strong>If he causes grief, he’ll have mercy according to his enduring love;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>because he doesn’t willingly hurt people or grieve them. <strong><sup>34-</sup></strong><strong><sup>36</sup></strong>God doesn’t approve of crushing every prisoner in the land under his feet, of depriving people of justice in the presence of the Most High, of defrauding people in his lawsuit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Who is there that speaks and it happens unless the Lord has commanded it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Don’t both good and bad come from the Most High?<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:32-38</p>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Why should we complain in light of our sins?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Let’s examine our ways and return to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Let’s lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>42</sup></strong>we’ve sinned and rebelled; you haven’t pardoned us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’ve covered yourself with anger and chased us; you’ve slain without pity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You’ve wrapped yourself in a cloud so no prayer can get to you.<strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:39-44</p>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You’ve made us residue and refuse among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Our enemies rail out against us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>My eyes run with streams of tears because my people are being destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>My eyes will keep pouring out</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>50</sup></strong>till Yahveh looks down from heaven and sees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>My eyes bring pain to my soul because of all the residents in my city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><strong><sup>53</sup></strong>they’ve silenced me in the pit, and put a stone over me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><strong><sup>54</sup></strong>water closed over my head; I said, <em>“I’m lost.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><strong><sup>55</sup></strong>I called to you, Yahveh, from down in the pit.<strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lam 3:45-55</p>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><strong><sup>56</sup></strong>You heard my plea, and didn’t hide from my prayer for relief, my call for help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>You came and said, <em>“Don’t be afraid!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Yahveh, you’ve seen my oppression; judge my case.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>You’ve seen their revenge, their schemes against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>You’ve heard their taunts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>My assailants’ whispers aim at me all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Look at their sitting and rising; I’m what they mock in their song.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v64"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Pay them back, Yahveh, according to what they’ve done;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><strong><sup>65</sup></strong>harden their heart so your curse will fall on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky!<strong> </strong></span>
