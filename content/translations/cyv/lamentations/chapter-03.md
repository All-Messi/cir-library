## Lamentations Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I have seen suffering under the rod God used in his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He made my skin and body waste away, and broke my bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He made me live in dark places like the dead from long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He walled me in so I couldn't escape and put heavy chains on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Even when I call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He has blocked my road with hewn stones and made my paths crooked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He's like a bear lying in wait for me, like a lion in unexpected places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces; and made me desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'm a laughingstock to my people, mocked in musical ditties all day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He filled me with bitterness and made me drink wormwood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He cracked my teeth with gravel and made me grovel in the dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I've been set apart from peace and forget what happiness is like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So I say, "My strength is gone, and so is my hope in Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Remember my suffering and homelessness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I certainly remember and am humbled within.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I recall this and have hope from it:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh love never stops coming; his mercies don't end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> His faithfulness is great; it's renewed every morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I say to myself, "Yahveh is my portion; so I have hope in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh is good to those who depend on him, people that look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They do well to wait silently for his salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> It's good for people to bear the yoke when they're young,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> to sit alone in silence, since God has laid it on them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there's hope,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> to turn their cheek to their abuser, to be filled with disgrace;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> because Yahveh won't reject forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> If he causes grief, he'll have mercy according to his enduring love;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> because he doesn't willingly hurt people or grieve them. 34-36God doesn't approve of crushing every prisoner in the land under his feet, of depriving people of justice in the presence of the Most High, of defrauding people in his lawsuit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Who is there that speaks and it happens unless the Lord has commanded it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Don't both good and bad come from the Most High?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Why should we complain in light of our sins?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Let's examine our ways and return to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Let's lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> we've sinned and rebelled; you haven't pardoned us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> You've covered yourself with anger and chased us; you've slain without pity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> You've wrapped yourself in a cloud so no prayer can get to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> You've made us residue and refuse among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Our enemies rail out against us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> My eyes run with streams of tears because my people are being destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> My eyes will keep pouring out</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> till Yahveh looks down from heaven and sees. 51My eyes bring pain to my soul because of all the residents in my city. 52For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird; 53they've silenced me in the pit, and put a stone over me; 54water closed over my head; I said, "I'm lost." 55I called to you, Yahveh, from down in the pit. 56You heard my plea, and didn't hide from my prayer for relief, my call for help. 57You came and said, "Don't be afraid!" 58Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life. 59Yahveh, you've seen my oppression; judge my case. 60You've seen their revenge, their schemes against me. 61You've heard their taunts. 62My assailants' whispers aim at me all day. 63Look at their sitting and rising; I'm what they mock in their song. 64Pay them back, Yahveh, according to what they've done; 65harden their heart so your curse will fall on them. 66Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky! Yahveh's Anger Satisfied</span>
