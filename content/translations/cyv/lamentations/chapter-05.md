## Lamentations Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, remember what's happened to us; look at our disgrace!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to foreigners, and our houses belong to aliens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> We've become orphans without fathers; our mothers are like widows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We have to pay for drinking water and buy wood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Our drivers put yokes on our necks; we're worn out; we can't get any rest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Our fathers sinned, and they're gone; but we have to suffer for their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Slaves rule us; nobody can deliver us from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> We risk our lives just getting bread because of the sword in the open country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Our skin is hot like an oven, because of the burning heat of famine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They rape the women in Zion, and the virgins in the towns in Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They hang up officials by their hands, and show no respect for old men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Young men work at the grinding mill; and stagger under loads of wood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Elders are gone from the city gate, young men have quit their music.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The joy in our hearts is gone; our dancing has turned into mourning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head; misfortune awaits us because we've sinned!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Our heart is faint because of it; our eyes are weak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jackals prowl in desolate Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh, you rule forever; your throne goes on for endless generations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Why don't you keep us in mind forever? Why abandon us so long?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Restore us to yourself, Yahveh, so we can be restored; renew our days as of old,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> unless you've completely rejected us, and are really angry with us.</span>
