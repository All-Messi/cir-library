## Lamentations Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people! She's like a widow that was once great among the nations! The princess among the provinces has become a slave!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks. Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her. Her friends have betrayed her and become her enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Judah has gone into exile in affliction and hard servitude; she's spread out among the nations now with no resting place. Her pursuers have caught up with her in the middle of her distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The roads to Zion are in mourning, because nobody attends the appointed festivals. Her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her virgins suffer, and she suffers bitterly herself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper. Yahveh has made her suffer for her many sins. Her children have gone away captive to the foe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The majesty is gone from Zion; her officials are like bucks that can't find pasture; they've fled away weak before their pursuers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In her time of suffering and homelessness, Jerusalem remembers her treasured things from before; when her people fell to her adversaries and nobody helped her, the enemies gloated over her and mocked her downfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she's become filthy. Everybody that honored her before despises her now, because they've seen her nakedness. She groans and turns away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she didn't give any thought for her doom; so she's fallen terribly with no comforter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The foe has reached out for her treasured things; she has watched the nations invade her sanctuary, people you commanded not to enter your community.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The people are groaning as they look for bread; they've given their treasured things for food to stay alive; "Look, Yahveh, I'm despised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Is it nothing to you that go by? Look and see if there's any pain like my pain that was severely dealt out to me, that Yahveh inflicted in his fierce anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He sent fire from on high into my bones, and it descended on them. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back; he left me desolate and faint all day long.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He has tied my sins together into a yoke around my neck; he has made my strength fail, and turned me over to those I can't withstand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord has rejected the strong men that are with me; he has called an appointed time against me to crush my young men; like a winepress he has trodden down the young virgin Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I weep for those things; my eyes run down with tears, because there's no comforter near to restore my soul. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Zion holds out her hands, but there's no one to comfort her; Yahveh has commanded against Jacob that his neighbors would be his enemies; Jerusalem has become something filthy in their minds. 18"Yahveh is good; I've rebelled against his command; listen now, all you nations, and look at my pain; my virgins and young men have gone into captivity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I called to my lovers, but they deceived me; my priests and elders perished in the city as they looked for food to stay alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Look, Yahveh, because I'm in distress; my soul is in turmoil. My heart's upset because I've been rebellious. The sword bereaves in the street; it's like death in the house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They've heard that I'm groaning with nobody to comfort me. My enemies have heard about my trouble; they're glad you've done it. Bring the time you've promised and let them be like me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Pay attention to their sinfulness, and deal with them like you've dealt with me for my sins. I groan a lot, and my heart is faint." Destruction for Sin</span>
