## Daniel Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, Michael, the great prince that guards your people, will rise up. There'll be a distressful time like nothing since nations began. Everyone among your people who are written in the scroll will be rescued. 2Many asleep in their graves will wake up, some to eternal life, some to disgrace and eternal contempt. 3The wise will shine as bright as the sky, including those who lead many to goodness—like the stars forever. 4Close up this message, Daniel, and seal the scroll till the time of the end. People will travel everywhere and spread knowledge."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then I saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river. 6One asked the man dressed in linen, who was above the river, "How long will it be till those distressful events end?" 7The man raised his hands toward the sky and swore by the One that lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. And as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, those things will come to an end. 8I heard it, but I couldn't understand it. So I asked, "How will those things end up?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, "Go on with your life, Daniel. Those things are secret, sealed up till the time of the end. 10Many will purify themselves, make themselves white, and be refined. The wicked won't understand, but the wise will. 11There will be 1,290 days between the time the daily sacrifice stops and the abomination that makes desolate is set up. 12How fortunate they are who persevere to the end of the 1,335 days! 13Live out the rest of your life. You'll enter into rest and rise again for your reward at the end of the age."</span>
