### ft tall and 18ft wide, and set it up on the Plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 2Then he sent word to gather the satraps, prefects, governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image. 3They came and stood in front of it. 4The herald declared loudly, “Every people, nation, and language group, 5when you hear the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, pipes, and other instruments, fall down and worship the gold image the king has set up. 6Whoever doesn’t will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace.”


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>So when the people heard the instruments, they all fell down to the image in worship.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### The Blazing Furnace


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Some astrologers came and accused the Jews. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Long</em><em> live the </em><em>Kin</em><em>g</em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>decree</em><em>d</em><em> that when everybody hears the music, </em><em>they’re</em><em> to </em><em>fall down</em><em> and worship the gold image.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> doesn’t, will be thrown in the blazing furnace.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>ome</em><em> Jews you appointed to administer the province of Babylon—Shadr</em><em>ach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—</em><em>have disregarded you.</em><em> </em><em>They don’t</em><em> serve your gods or worship </em><em>your gold image.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>In a rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring them in.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:8-13</p>

### 14“Is it true you won’t serve my gods or worship the gold image I set up? 15If you’re ready, when you hear the instruments, fall down in worship to the image I’ve made. If you don’t, you’ll be thrown directly into the blazing furnace. What god can deliver you from me?”


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered him, <em>“We don</em><em>’t need to answer you about that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> </em><em>that happens</em><em>, the God we serve can deliver us from the blazing furnace and from you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>E</em><em>ven</em><em> if he doesn’t, </em><em>we’re not going to serve your gods o</em><em>r worship the image you set up.  </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:14-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He was irate and changed his attitude toward them. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than normal, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and commanded some brave soldiers from his army to tie them up and throw them in. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They tied them up in their cloaks, tunics, turbans, and <em>other</em> clothes to throw them in. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Since the king’s command was strict and the furnace was extremely hot, the fire killed the soldiers that carried them. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They fell into the blazing furnace still tied up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Nebuchadnezzar was astounded. He jumped up and exclaimed to his advisers, <em>“</em><em>Didn’t we throw three men in the fire</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>He answered, <em>“Look!</em><em> </em><em>I see four men </em><em>not tied up, </em><em>walking around in the </em><em>fire unharmed. T</em><em>he fourth looks like a god!”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:19-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>He went up to the door of the blazing furnace and said, <em>“Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, come out</em><em> </em>of<em> </em>there<em>, you servants of the </em><em>Most High</em><em> God</em><em>. C</em><em>ome here!”</em> They came out of the fire. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The satraps, prefects, governors, and king’s high officials gathered around and saw that the fire hadn’t burned their bodies, singed their hair, or scorched their clothes; and there wasn’t any burnt smell on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Nebuchaznezzar said, <em>“Bless</em><em> Shadrach,</em><em> Meshach, and Abed-nego’s God. He</em><em> sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him</em><em>. They </em><em>set aside </em><em>my </em><em>command</em><em> and yielded up their bodies </em><em>not</em><em> to</em><em> serve or worship any god </em><em>but</em><em> their own.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I decree that any people, nation, or language</em><em> group</em><em> that says anything offensive </em><em>about</em><em> their God will be torn limb from lim</em><em>b and their houses reduced to trash</em><em> pile</em><em>s. N</em><em>o other god that can deliver </em><em>like that</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>The king advanced them even more in the province of Babylon.<strong>	</strong></span>
