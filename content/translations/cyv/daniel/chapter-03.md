### Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nebucharnezzar made a gold image 90ft tall and 18ft wide, and set it up on the Plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then he sent word to gather the satraps, prefects, governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They came and stood in front of it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The herald declared loudly, <em>“</em><em>Every</em><em> people, nation, and language</em><em> </em>group<em>, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>w</em><em>hen</em><em> you hear the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, pipe</em><em>s</em><em>, and </em><em>other instruments</em><em>, </em><em>fall down</em><em> and worship the gold image the king has set up.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> doesn’t</em><em> will immediately be thrown in</em><em>to</em><em> the blazing furnace.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So when the people heard the instruments, they all fell down to the image in worship.<strong></span>

### The Blazing Furnace


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Some astrologers came and accused the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“Long</em><em> live the </em><em>Kin</em><em>g</em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>decree</em><em>d</em><em> that when everybody hears the music, </em><em>they’re</em><em> to </em><em>fall down</em><em> and worship the gold image.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> doesn’t, will be thrown in the blazing furnace.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>ome</em><em> Jews you appointed to administer the province of Babylon—Shadr</em><em>ach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—</em><em>have disregarded you.</em><em> </em><em>They don’t</em><em> serve your gods or worship </em><em>your gold image.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In a rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring them in.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:8-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“</em><em>Is</em><em> it true </em><em>you </em><em>w</em><em>on’t serve my gods or worship the gold image I set up?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you’re ready, </em><em>when</em><em> you</em><em> hear </em><em>the instruments, </em><em>fall down</em><em> </em><em>in</em><em> worship </em><em>to </em><em>the image I’ve made.</em><em> </em><em>If you don’t, you’ll be thrown </em><em>directly </em><em>into the blazing furnace.</em><em> </em><em>What god can deliver you from me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered him, <em>“We don</em><em>’t need to answer you about that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> </em><em>that happens</em><em>, the God we serve can deliver us from the blazing furnace and from you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>E</em><em>ven</em><em> if he doesn’t, </em><em>we’re not going to serve your gods o</em><em>r worship the image you set up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:14-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He was irate and changed his attitude toward them. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than normal, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and commanded some brave soldiers from his army to tie them up and throw them in. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They tied them up in their cloaks, tunics, turbans, and <em>other</em> clothes to throw them in. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Since the king’s command was strict and the furnace was extremely hot, the fire killed the soldiers that carried them. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They fell into the blazing furnace still tied up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Nebuchadnezzar was astounded. He jumped up and exclaimed to his advisers, <em>“</em><em>Didn’t we throw three men in the fire</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He answered, <em>“Look!</em><em> </em><em>I see four men </em><em>not tied up, </em><em>walking around in the </em><em>fire unharmed. T</em><em>he fourth looks like a god!”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 3:19-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He went up to the door of the blazing furnace and said, <em>“Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, come out</em><em> </em>of<em> </em>there<em>, you servants of the </em><em>Most High</em><em> God</em><em>. C</em><em>ome here!”</em> They came out of the fire. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The satraps, prefects, governors, and king’s high officials gathered around and saw that the fire hadn’t burned their bodies, singed their hair, or scorched their clothes; and there wasn’t any burnt smell on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Nebuchaznezzar said, <em>“Bless</em><em> Shadrach,</em><em> Meshach, and Abed-nego’s God. He</em><em> sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him</em><em>. They </em><em>set aside </em><em>my </em><em>command</em><em> and yielded up their bodies </em><em>not</em><em> to</em><em> serve or worship any god </em><em>but</em><em> their own.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I decree that any people, nation, or language</em><em> group</em><em> that says anything offensive </em><em>about</em><em> their God will be torn limb from lim</em><em>b and their houses reduced to trash</em><em> pile</em><em>s. N</em><em>o other god that can deliver </em><em>like that</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The king advanced them even more in the province of Babylon.</span>
