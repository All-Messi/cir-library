## Daniel Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to encourage and protect him. 	Dan 10:19-11:1 Kings of the North and South 2"Three more kings will come to power in Persia. A fourth will gain far more wealth than the others. As soon as he gains power by his wealth, he'll stir up the empire against Greece. 3A strong king will come to power there and rule as he pleases. 4But not long after he ascends to power, his kingdom will break up into the four points of the compass. It won't pass on to heirs or continue with the authority he exercised. His sovereignty will cease and pass on to others than descendants. 5"Then the king of the South will grow strong along with one of his commanders. But his commander will gain more power than he has and obtain a large kingdom of his own.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> After some years they'll form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will be given to the king of the North to make a marriage alliance. But she won't retain her influence there. She and her father won't last, and they'll be given up along with her attendants and supporters. 7"In those times, one of her relatives in the South will come to power in her place, attack the king of the North, enter his fortress, and defeat him. 8He'll carry off their idols to Egypt, their molten images, their precious gold and silver items. For some years he'll refrain from attacking the king of the North. 9Then the latter will invade the realm of the king of the South, but he'll soon go back to his own land. 10"But the sons of the king of the North will gather a group of large forces and wage war. They'll keep on coming, overrun, pass through, and carry the war as far as his fortress. 11Then the king of the South will be angry and go to fight the king of the North. The latter will raise a large army, but he'll fall to the other. 12When the enemy army is defeated, the king of the South will get proud and execute thousands, but he won't prevail for long. 13The king of the North will raise a bigger army than before; and after some years, he'll press on with that large army and lots of equipment. 14"In those times, there'll be an uprising against the king of the South. Violent men among your people will also lift themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they'll fall. 15Then the king of the North will come, throw up a siege mound, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South won't have the strength to stand their ground, not even their best troops. 16The one that comes against him will do as he pleases, and nobody will be able to withstand him. He'll stay for a time in the Glorious Land and control it. 17He'll be determined to come with the power of his whole kingdom and to bring a proposal for peace that he'll put into effect. He'll give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow the kingdom from within, but she won't take a stand for him. 18Then he'll turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many cities. But a commander will put a stop to his insolence and repay him for it. 19So he'll take refuge in the fortresses in his own land, but he'll stumble and fall and fall out of the picture. 20"Then in his place one will rise up and send a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. Yet within a short time he'll die, though not in anger or in battle. 21In his place a despicable man will come to power who isn't in line for royal succession. He'll come in peace time and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 22He'll sweep away armies, including the prince of the covenant. 23After he makes various alliances, he'll act deceitfully and seize power with a small force. 24Without warning he'll enter the richest parts of the realm and accomplish what his predecessors had never done. He'll distribute plunder, booty, and possessions among them. He'll plot against fortresses, but only for a while. 25He'll stir up his courage against the king of the South with a large army. So the king of the South will mobilize a very big army, but he won't stand because there'll be plots against him. 26The members of his own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be slain. 27Both kings will be intent on evil and lie to each other at the conference table; but to no avail because the end will come at the appointed time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The king of the South will head for home with considerable substance. On the way, he'll set himself against the people of the holy covenant, and do a lot of damage before going on back to his own land. 29"At the appointed time, he'll invade the South again, but this time it won't turn out like before. 30Ships from Kittim will attack him. He'll retreat and take his out anger on the people of the holy covenant. So he'll come and listen to the ones that forsake the holy covenant. 31His army will defile the Temple fortress, forbid the daily burnt offerings, and set up the abomination that makes desolate. 32By flattery he'll turn to godlessness those who've violated the covenant, but the people that know their God will stay strong and resist him. 33Wise leaders among the people will instruct many, though they'll fall by flame and sword, be captured and robbed. 34They'll receive little help, and many who do join them won't be sincere. 35Some of the wise will fall victim to persecution as a means of refining and cleansing them, making them pure till the time of the end, because the appointed time is still to come. 36"The king will do as he pleases, put himself above every god, and blaspheme the God of gods. He'll succeed till the time of wrath is over because what's been decreed will happen. 37He won't show any regard for the gods of his ancestors, for any god women favor, or for any other god. He'll exalt himself above them all. 38Instead, he'll honor the god of fortresses, a god his ancestors never knew. He'll honor him with gold, silver, costly gems, and costly gifts. 39He'll attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god, and greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He'll make them rulers over many people and parcel out land among them as their reward. 40"Toward the end of Israel's time, the king of the South will attack him, and the king of the North will storm out against him like a tornado with chariots, cavalry, and a large navy. He'll invade various lands and overrun them. 41He'll enter the Glorious Land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and most of Ammon will escape. 42Then he'll attack still other countries, including Egypt. 43He'll gain control of Egypt's precious treasures, its gold and silver. Libyans and Nubians will become his subjects. 44But alarming news will come from the east and north, and he'll go out with great fury to exterminate many. 45He'll pitch his royal pavilion between the sea and the beautiful Holy Mountain. Yet he'll come to his end, and nobody will help him. The Time of the End</span>
