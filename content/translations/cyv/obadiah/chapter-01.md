## Obadiah Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Vision of Obadiah Edom's Judgment Foretold The Lord Yahveh says this about Edom; we've heard the report; an ambassador has gone out to the nations to say, "To arms, attack Edom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> "I'll make you a minor player among the nations and utterly despised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your arrogance has deceived you, you that live high in caves and tell yourselves that nobody can bring you down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Though you've built high like an eagle and put your nest among the stars, I'll bring you down.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Obad 1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> "If thieves came to you at night— what disaster awaits you!— wouldn't they steal only till they had enough? If grape pickers came, wouldn't they leave some gleanings?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But how you'll be pillaged, Esau, and your hidden treasures found!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your allies will force you out of your borders; the people at peace with you will turn on you and overpower you; the ones you eat with will set up an ambush for you. (You won't suspect it.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> At that time," Yahveh says, "won't I destroy the wise men out of Edom and those with understanding from Esau's mountain?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Your strong troops will be afraid, Teman; so everybody from Esau's mountains will be cut down in the slaughter.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Obad 5-9</p>

### Edom's Violence Against Israel


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> "Because of your violence against Jacob your brother, you'll be covered with disgrace and permanently eliminated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You stood aloof while foreigners cast lots for Jerusalem and strangers entered its gates to carry off its wealth. You even joined them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You shouldn't have gloated over your brother's misfortune; you shouldn't have celebrated over Judah's destruction or boasted about his distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You shouldn't have entered my people's gate at the time of their disaster or looted their goods during their catastrophe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You shouldn't have stood at the fork in the road to cut down their refugees or have betrayed the survivors in their misfortune.</span>

### Edom's Destruction, Israel's Restoration


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> "Yahveh's judgment is coming on all the nations. What you've done to Israel will be done to you; your dealings will come back on your own head.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You and those nations will drink the same punishment you swallowed on my holy mountain. You'll all drink till you drown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But on Mount Zion some will escape, and it'll be holy; Jacob's house will return to reclaim its possession.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jacob's house will become a fire, Joseph's house a flame, Esau's house the stubble. They'll set him on fire and burn him up; there'll be no survivors in Edom." Yahveh has said it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Obad 15-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then my people in the Negev will take over Esau's mountains; the ones in the western foothills will occupy the Philistine plain. They'll take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria; The people of Benjamin will occupy Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Exiles from Israel will replace the Phoenicians as far north as Zarephath; the captives from Jerusalem that are in Sepharad [north] will resettle their towns in the Negev [south].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> All those who were rescuedLXX will go up to Mount Zion and extend its dominion over Esau's mountains. The kingdom will belong to Yahveh.</span>
