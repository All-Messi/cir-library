## Deuteronomy Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen, Israel, to the statutes and case laws I'm teaching you so you can take over the land. 2Don't add to or take away from what I'm telling you. 3You've seen what Yahveh did to you at Baal-peor: he destroyed everyone that followed Baal-peor. 4But every one of you is alive today that held onto Yahveh your God. 5I've taught you statutes and case laws like Yahveh commanded me so you'd do them in the land you're entering. 6Keep them; that's your wisdom and understanding in front of the nations that will hear those statues and say, 'This great nation has wisdom and understanding.' 7What great nation has a god as near it as Yahveh is when we call on him? 8What great nation has statutes and case laws as good as this Law I'm setting in front of you today? 9"Be careful not to forget what you've seen or let those memories ever leave your heart. Tell your sons and grandsons about them. 10Think back to when you stood in front of Yahveh at Horeb/Sinai. He told me to gather you so you could hear what he was saying and learn to respect him all your lives and teach your children. 11You stood at the foot of the mountain, and it burned as high as the sky—black clouds and dense darkness. 12You heard him speak to you out of the fire, but you didn't see any shape. 13He declared the covenant to you, the Ten Commandments he wrote on two stone tablets. 14He told me then to teach you statutes and case laws so you'd do them in the land. Idolatry Forbidden 15"Watch carefully 16not to do something corrupt by making a carved image of anything male or female, 17animal on land, bird in the sky, 18fish in the water, or what crawls on the ground. 19Don't gaze at the sun, moon, and countless stars, and get drawn away into worshiping and serving what Yahveh your God has allotted to everyone under the sky. 20He brought you out of the iron furnace (Egypt) to be his own people like you are now. [21] 22I'll die here, but you'll cross over and take possession of the land. 23Watch that you don't forget his covenant and make a carved image of anything. He forbids it. 24He's a consuming fire, an exclusive God. 25"Later on, if your descendants make an idol and anger Yahveh, 26you'll soon perish. I call earth and sky to witness against you today. You won't live there very long. 27He'll scatter you among the nations, and there won't be many of you where he drives you. 28You'll serve gods there made out of wood and stone, gods that can't see, hear, eat, or smell. 29But you'll look to Yahveh your God from there, and you'll find him if you look with all your heart and soul. 30When you're in distress and those things come on you later, you'll come back to him. 31He's a merciful God. He won't fail you, destroy you, or forget the covenant he swore with your ancestors. Only the LORD Is God 32"Indeed, ask about any earlier time since God created people. Ask about any other place from one end of the sky to the other. Has anything like this ever happened? Has anything like this ever been heard of? 33Has any people heard God speak out of fire like you have, and lived? 34Has any god taken a nation from inside another nation by trials, signs, and wonders; by warfare, a strong hand and outstretched arm; by great terrifying displays like Yahveh did for you in Egypt right in front of you? 35Those things happened so you could know Yahveh is God. There's no god but him. 36From the sky he let you hear his voice to discipline you. On the earth he let you see his great fire and hear him speak out of it. 37Because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants and brought you out of Egypt by his great power. 38He's driving out nations bigger and stronger than you, and giving you their land. 39Take it to heart then that Yahveh is God in heaven above and on earth below. There isn't any other. 40Keep his statutes and commandments that I'm giving you. Then things will go well for you and your descendants, and you'll live a long time in the land he's giving you permanently." Cities of Refuge</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> That's the Law Moses set in front of Israel—45the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances he gave them when they left Egypt. 46He did that beyond the Jordan in the valley near Beth-peor in the land of 47the two kings that ruled the Amorites east of the Jordan. 48Their land stretched from Aroer on the edge of Arnon valley to Mount Sion (Hermon). 49Their territories went all along the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan south to the Sea of Arabah at the foot of Pisgah.
