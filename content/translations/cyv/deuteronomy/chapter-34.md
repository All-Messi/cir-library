## Deuteronomy Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah across from Jericho. Yahveh showed him the land, Gilead to Dan; 2Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh; the land of Judah to the Mediterranean Sea; 3the Negev and the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms as far as Zoar. 4He told him, "This is the land I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 'I'll give it to your descendants.' I've let you see it, but not enter it." 5So Moses died in Moab. 6Yahveh buried him in an unknown place in a valley in Moab across from Beth-peor. 7Although he was 120 when he died, his sight was still clear, and his energy was good. 8Israel mourned him for 30 days in the plains of Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Joshua was wise because Moses had laid his hands on him. The Israelites listened to him and did what Yahveh told Moses. 10Since then no prophet has risen in Israel that Yahveh related to directly. 11There was nobody like him for the signs and wonders Yahveh sent him to do in Egypt against Pharaoh, his officials, and his country, 12and for the great power and terrifying deeds he performed for Israel to see.</span>
