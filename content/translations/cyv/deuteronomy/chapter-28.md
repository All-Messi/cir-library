## Deuteronomy Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you diligently obey Yahveh your God, he'll set you high above every nation on earth. 2These blessings will come on you: 3"Blessed you'll be in the city and the country. 4"Blessed will be your offspring, the produce of your ground, the offspring of your animals, the increase of your herd, the young of your flock. 5"Blessed will be your basket and kneading bowl. 6"Blessed you'll be when you come and go. 7"Yahveh will defeat your enemies. They'll attack you from one direction and flee in seven. 8"Yahveh will direct his blessing on you in your barns and endeavors, and bless you in the land he's giving you. 9"Yahveh will establish you as a people reserved for himself. 10"The nations will see that you're called by Yahveh's name and be afraid of you. 11"Yahveh will make you prosperous in your offspring and your animals' offspring, and in the produce from your ground. 12"Yahveh will open his storehouse in the sky, send you rain in its season, and bless what you do. You'll lend to many nations, but you can't borrow from them. 13"Yahveh will make you the head, not the tail. You'll be above, not below 14if you don't stray from my commandments and serve other gods. Curses for Disobedience 15"If you don't obey Yahveh, these curses will come on you: 16"Accursed you'll be in the city and the country. 17"Accursed will be your basket and kneading bowl. 18"Accursed will be your offspring, the produce of your ground, the increase of your herd, the young in your flock. 19"Accursed you'll be as you come and go. 20"Yahveh will send curses, confusion, and rebuke on everything you try to do, till you soon perish because you've done sinful things and left him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yahveh will send disease on you till none of you are left in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh will strike you with consumption, fever, inflammation, scorching heat, sword, blight, and mildew. They'll dog you till you die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The sky above you will be bronze, and the ground under you will be iron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Yahveh will turn rain into dust. It'll come down on you till you suffocate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The LORD will let your enemies defeat you. You'll go out against them one way and flee from them seven ways. You'll be an example of panic for the kingdoms. 26Your corpses will feed the birds and wild animals. There won't be anybody to scare them off. 27"Yahveh will strike you with the boils you saw in Egypt, with hemorrhoids, scab, and itch that won't heal. 28"Yahveh will strike you with madness, blindness, and faintheartedness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You'll grope at noon like a blind man in the dark; you won't prosper. You'll be oppressed and robbed continually, and nobody will be there to save you. 30"You'll be engaged to a wife, but another man will rape her. You'll build a house, but not live in it. You'll plant a vineyard, but not eat its fruit. 31"Your ox will be butchered in front of you, and you won't eat any of it. Your donkey will be torn away from you and not returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and nobody will save you. 32"Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation while you watch and yearn for them. But you won't be able to do anything about it. 33"A people you don't know will eat the produce you've labored on. You'll be oppressed and crushed all the time. 34"You'll be driven mad by what you see. 35"Yahveh will strike your knees and legs with sore boils that won't heal from the crown of your head to the sole of your feet. 36"You and the king you'll appoint, God will take to a nation you and your ancestors never heard of. You'll serve wooden and stone gods there. 37You'll become something to abhor, a proverb, a taunt in the nation where Yahveh drives you. 38"You'll take lots of seed to the field, but bring little in. Locusts will eat it. 39"You'll cultivate vineyards, but you won't drink any wine or gather any grapes. Worms will eat them. 40"You'll have olive trees everywhere, but you won't anoint yourself with the oil. Your olives will fall off. 41"You'll have sons and daughters, but they won't be yours. They'll go into captivity. 42"Locusts will overtake your trees and produce. 43"Foreigners among you will rise higher and higher above you, and you'll sink lower and lower. 44He'll lend to you, but you won't lend to him. He'll be the head; you'll be the tail. 45"These curses will come on you till they destroy you, because you wouldn't obey Yahveh. 46They'll become a sign and a wonder on you and your descendants forever. 47Since you didn't serve him with joy and happiness for the abundance of everything, 48you'll serve the enemies he sends against you, and you'll do so in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and the lack of everything. He'll put an iron yoke on your neck till he's destroyed you. 49"Yahveh will bring a nation against you from the end of the earth like a swooping eagle, a nation whose language you can't understand. 50It'll be a nation that doesn't respect the old or favor the young. 51It'll eat the offspring of your herd and the produce from your ground. It won't leave you any grain, new wine, olive oil, increase in your herd, or the young in your flock till its people wipe you out. 52It will besiege you in your towns till your high, fortified walls you trusted come down all over your land. 53In the sieges you'll be so oppressed you'll eat the offspring of your own body, the sons and daughters Yahveh gave you. 54Your refined, cultured gentleman will be hostile toward his brother, the wife he cherishes, his children that remain. 55He won't give a one of them any of his children's flesh he's eating, because he won't have anything left during the oppressive siege. 56Your refined, cultured lady that wouldn't walk on the ground barefoot, will be hostile toward the husband she cherishes, her son and daughter, 57the afterbirth from between her legs, the children she bears. She'll eat them secretly for lack of anything else during the oppressive siege. 58"If you don't observe the laws in this scroll and respect this honored and awesome name, 'Yahveh Your God' [Yahveh-Elohekha], 59he'll bring severe plagues, miserable chronic diseases on you and your descendants. 60He'll bring on you Egypt's diseases that you feared and still cling to you. 61He'll even bring on you sicknesses and plagues that aren't in this scroll. 62"Although you were like stars in the sky, you'll end up being few. 63As Yahveh delighted in prospering you, he'll delight in destroying you. He'll tear you from the land you're entering 64and scatter you among the nations from one end of the world to the other. You'll serve wooden and stone gods there. 65You won't find anywhere to rest your feet. He'll give you a cringing heart, failing eyes, despairing souls. 66Your life will hang uncertain in front of you, and you'll dread night and day with no assurance that you'll live. 67In the morning you'll say, 'Oh that it was evening!' In the evening you'll say, 'Oh that it was morning!' 68Yahveh will take you back to Egypt in ships. You'll never see your country again. You'll try to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but nobody will buy you." Renewal of the Covenant</span>
