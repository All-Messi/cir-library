## Deuteronomy Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At the end of every seven years, cancel debts. 2Creditors are to let go of what they've loaned to their fellow Hebrews. Don't exact it from them; Yahveh has canceled the debt. 3You can exact it from a foreigner, but not from fellow citizens. 4There won't be any poor among you because Yahveh will bless you like he promised 5if you obey this commandment. 6Lend to other nations, but don't borrow from them. You'll rule other nations; they won't rule you. 7"If there are poor fellow citizens in your town, be sensitive. 8Be willing to lend them what they need. 9Don't harbor the selfish thought, 'The seventh year is coming, the year of debt cancelation,' and not help them. They may call out to Yahveh, and it'll be a sin on you. 10Give generously without regret so Yahveh will bless what you undertake. 11You'll always have poor people in your land. Be willing to open your hand to your kin, the needy, the poor. Release of Hebrew Slaves 12"If you buy Hebrew men or women, they'll serve you six years and go free the seventh. 13When you set them free, don't send them away with nothing. 14Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, your wine vat. Give to them in proportion to how Yahveh has blessed you. 15Remember, you were a slave in Egypt, and he redeemed you. 16If a servant says he doesn't want to leave, because he loves you and your household and gets along well with you, 17pierce his ear with an awl. He'll be your servant permanently. Do the same thing with a maidservant. 18Don't let it bother you to set servants free. They've given you six years with twice the service a hired hand gives. That way Yahveh will bless you in whatever you do. Sacrifice of Firstborn Male Animals 19"Consecrate to Yahveh the male firstborn in your herd and flock. Don't work the firstborn in your herd or shear the firstborn in your flock. 20You and your family will eat it every year with Yahveh where he designates. 21Don't sacrifice it if it has any serious defect like lameness or blindness. 22Eat it at home; ceremonially clean and unclean alike can eat it—like a gazelle or deer. 23Only don't eat its blood. Drain it out on the ground. Passover Festival</span>
