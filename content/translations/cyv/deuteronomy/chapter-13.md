## Deuteronomy Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“If</em><em> a prophet or dreamer arises and gives you a sign or wonder </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>that</em><em> comes true, and uses it to say, ‘Let’s serve other gods,’ </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>ignore</em><em> him. Yahveh’s testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Follow</em><em> him, respect him, keep his commandments, listen to him, serve him, hold onto him. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Execute</em><em> that prophet or dreamer. He has advocated rebellion against Yahveh who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. </em>He’s<em> seducing you to leave Yahveh. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you. </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>If</em><em> your brother, your son or</em><em> daughter, the wife you love, your close friend tempts you privately to serve other gods—</em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>of</em><em> people near or far, from one end of the earth to the other</em><em>—</em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>don’t</em><em> yield to them. Don’t show mercy or cover it up. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Execute</em><em> them. Be the first to strike against them, then the other people will join in. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Stone</em><em> them to death, because they have tried to tempt you away from Yahveh your God that brought you out of slavery in Egypt. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Israel</em><em> will hear </em>about it<em> and show respect, and not do such a sinful thing again.</em><strong>	</strong></span>

### 12-13“If you hear that some worthless individuals have tempted the people in their city to serve other gods, 14investigate the matter thoroughly. If it’s true, 15strike them with the sword. Destroy the city, its people, and their livestock. 16Gather its spoil in its open square and burn it as a whole burnt offering to Yahveh. Make the city a permanent ruin; don’t rebuild it. 17Get rid of any plunder marked for destruction so Yahveh will turn his furious anger away, have mercy on you, and make a big nation out of you—like he swore to your ancestors.
