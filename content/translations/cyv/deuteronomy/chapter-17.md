## Deuteronomy Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Don't sacrifice an ox or sheep that has a blemish. Yahveh detests that. 2-4"In any of your towns, if you hear about a man or woman that breaks the covenant by serving other gods or worshiping the sun, moon, or stars, verify that detestable thing thoroughly. 5Then take the person to your city gates and stone that man or woman to death. 6You need the testimony of two or three witnesses to execute anyone. Don't execute anybody on the word of one witness. 7The accuser needs to throw the first stone. Then the people will join in. That's how you're to purge evil from among you. 8"If a case is too hard for you to decide in your courts—between one kind of homicide and another, between one kind of lawsuit and another, between one kind of assault and another—go to where Yahveh designates. 9Go to the Levitical priest or judge that's in office and lay the case in front of him. He'll render a verdict. 10Carry out all its terms. 11Follow the law he teaches you in the verdict he gives. 12The person will die that ignores the priest or judge. That's how you're to purge evil from Israel. 13The other people will hear about it and show respect, and not act presumptuously again. The King 14"When you're in the land, you'll want to install a king like the nations around you. 15Install a fellow citizen that Yahveh chooses. 16He must not multiply horses for himself or send people to Egypt to multiply them. Yahveh has said never to go back there. 17He must not multiply wives; they'll turn his heart away. He must not amass silver and gold for himself. 18"When he sits on the throne, he's to write a copy of this Law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. 19It'll be with him to read all his life so he'll learn to respect Yahveh by doing what it says,</span>
