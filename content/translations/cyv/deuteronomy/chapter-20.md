## Deuteronomy Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When you go to battle and see horses, chariots, and people more numerous than you, don't be afraid. Yahveh your God, who brought you out of Egypt, is with you. 2When you're getting ready for battle, the priests will come to remind you, 3'Don't be fainthearted, Israel. Don't panic or tremble. 4Yahveh is with you to fight for you and save you.' 5The officers will also say, 'Who has built a house and not dedicated it? He can go home so he won't die in battle and somebody else dedicate it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Who has planted a vineyard and not used its fruit? He can go home so he won't die in battle and somebody else use it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is engaged to a woman and not married her? He can go home so he won't die in battle and somebody else marry her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who's afraid? He can go home so he won't make his companions' hearts melt like his.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When the officers have finished speaking, they'll appoint commanders to lead the people. 10"When you approach a city beyond your promised territory, offer it terms of peace. 11If it makes peace, its people will serve you as forced laborers. 12But, if it doesn't make peace with you, besiege it. 13When Yahveh gives it to you, strike the men with the sword. 14Only the women, children, animals, and everything in the city take as spoil and use. 15Do that to all distant towns. 16In towns Yahveh's giving you as an inheritance, don't leave anything that breathes. 17Destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 18That way they won't teach you the disgusting things they do for their gods, so you won't sin against Yahveh your God. 19"When you besiege a city, don't cut down its fruit trees. You can eat from them later. Is a tree a person, that you should besiege it? 20Only what aren't fruit trees can you cut down to build siege works. Ceremonial Cleansing for Unsolved Murder</span>
