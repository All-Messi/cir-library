### times at most. More than that would be despising him.  4“Don’t muzzle an ox while it’s threshing.  5“When brothers live together and one dies with no son, the wife of the deceased can’t remarry outside the family. Her brother-in-law will take her as his wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law. 6Her first son will carry on her dead husband’s lineage so it won’t disappear from Israel. 7If the brother-in-law doesn’t want to take his brother’s wife, she’s to go to the elders at the gate and say, ‘My brother-in-law refuses to carry on my husband’s name in Israel. He doesn’t want to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to me.’ 8The elders will send for him and talk to him about it. If he persists and says, ‘I don’t want to take her,’ 9she’s to take his sandal off, spit in his face, and declare, ‘That’s what’s done to the man who doesn’t build up his brother’s house.’ 10His name in Israel will be ‘The house of the man whose sandal’s off [Bet-chaluts-hanna‘al].’  	Deut 25:1-10 11“If two men are fighting and one of the wives comes to help her husband by grabbing his attacker’s testicles, 12cut her hand off. Don’t show mercy.  13“Don’t have different-sized weights in your bags, 14and don’t have different-sized measures in your houses. 15Use full-sized, exact weights and measures so you’ll live long in the land. 16Yahveh detests whoever cheats with weights and measures.   17“Don’t forget what Amalek did when you came out of Egypt. 18He attacked the stragglers in the rear when you were faint and tired. He didn’t fear God. 19When Yahveh your God has given you peace from all your other enemies, remember to totally erase the memory of Amalek.	 Deut 25:11-19 Firstfruits and Tithes
