## Deuteronomy Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Moses the man of God gave this blessing to Israel before he died: 2"Yahveh came from Sinai and dawned from Seir; he shined out from Mount Paran. He came with ten thousand holy ones with flashing lightning at his right hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He loved his people; all the ones consecrated to him were in his hand; so they followed in his steps and received direction from him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> when Moses commanded us a law as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh became king in Jeshurun, when the leaders of the people gathered all the tribes of Israel." 6"Let Reuben live, let his people not be few."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He said about Judah, "Listen, Yahveh, to Judah and bring him to his people. With your hands, contend for him and help him against his enemies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said about Levi, "You've given Levi your Thummin and your Urim to that godly man that you tested at Massah and strove with at Meribah;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> who said of his parents, 'I don't care about them'; who disowned his relatives and ignored his children in preference to observing your word and keeping your covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He'll teach Jacob your ordinances and Israel your Law. He'll put incense in front of you and whole burnt offering on your altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh, bless his substance and accept his ministry. Crush the loins of his adversaries, the ones who hate him, so they won't get up again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He said about Benjamin, "Yahveh's beloved lives in safety beside him. He surrounds him all day long and makes his home between his shoulders." `	13He said about Joseph, "May Yahveh bless his land with the best gifts from the sky above and the deep below,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> with the best fruits of the sun and the rich yield of the months,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> with the finest produce of the ancient mountains and the abundance of the everlasting hills,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> with the best gifts of the soil and its bounty, and the favor of him that appeared in the bush. May these come on Joseph's head and on the crown of the one that's chief among his brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He has the majesty of a young bull and the horns of the wild ox. He'll gore the nations away, to the ends of the earth. Such are the thousands of Manasseh and the ten thousands of Ephraim."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said about Zebulun and Issachar, "Celebrate, Zebulun, in your travels, and Issachar, in your tents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Call the people to the mountain to offer proper sacrifices. Draw wealth from the sea and hidden treasures from the sand."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He said about Gad, "Blessed is the one that enlarges Gad's territory. Gad crouches like a lion to tear off an arm and the crown from the head.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He chose the best land for himself, because a commander's portion was reserved there. He came to the heads of the people; with Israel he carried out Yahveh' commands and just decrees."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He said about Dan, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out from Bashan."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He said about Naphtali, "Naphtali, satisfied by being favored and full of Yahveh's blessing, possess the lake and the south."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He said about Asher, "May Asher be more blessed than other sons; let him be his brothers' favorite, and let him dip his foot in olive oil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Your bars will be iron and bronze; your strength will be like your days." 26"There's none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to help you, who rides through the sky in his majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The eternal God is where you live; his everlasting arms undergird you. He thrust out your enemy in front of you and said, 'Destroy them.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So Israel lives in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of grain and wine; his sky drops dew.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You're blessed, Israel. Who is like you, a people Yahveh has saved, Yahveh, the shield that protected you, the sword that gave you triumph? Your enemies will come cringing before you; you'll walk on their backs." The Death of Moses</span>
