## Deuteronomy Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen, sky; let me speak; earth, hear what I say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Let my teaching fall like rain; let my speech distill like dew, like drops on fresh grass, like showers on plants;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> because I'm proclaiming Yahveh. Credit greatness to our God, the Rock!		Deut 31:30-32:1-3</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> His work is perfect; his ways are just, a faithful and just God, good and upright.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> His people have acted corruptly toward him; they're not his children because of their defect; they're a perverse, crooked generation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Is that the way you repay Yahveh, you foolish people? Isn't he your Father who bought you, who made you and made you secure?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Remember the old days; consider the years of past history. Ask your father, he'll inform you; ask your elders, they'll tell you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided up the human race, he set people's boundaries in comparison to the numbers in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> For Yahveh's people are his portion; Jacob is his allotted inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He found them a desert land; in the howling wasteland of a desert he surrounded them, cared for them, guarded them like the pupil of his eye.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that hovers over its young, he spread his wings and caught them; he carried them on his pinions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh alone guided them; no foreign god was among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He made them ride above the high places of the earth; they ate the crops in the field. He enabled them to suck honey from rock and olive oil from flint stone,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> curds from cows, milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs and rams—the breed from Bashan—and goats, with the finest wheat, They drank wine made from grape juice. 15"But Jeshurun soon got fat and rebelled; they grew fat, thick, and sleek. They forsook the God that made them and scorned the Rock that saved them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They made him jealous with foreign gods and provoked him with disgusting deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They sacrificed to demons that aren't God, to gods they hadn't known, to new gods that came lately, that their ancestors didn't dread.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They neglected the Rock that begot them and forgot the God that bore them. 19"Yahveh saw that and spurned them because his sons and daughters provoked him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He said, 'I'll hide from them and see what their end will be; they're a perverse generation of unfaithful offspring.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They made me jealous with what's not God; they provoked me with their idols. So I'll make them jealous with those who aren't a people; I'll provoke them with a foolish nation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A fire has kindled my anger, one that burns to the bottom of Sheol; it consumes the ground along with its yield and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. 23"I'll pile misfortunes on them and shoot my arrows at them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They'll be wasted by famine and consumed by scorching heat and bitter destruction; I'll sic the animals on them and the venom of snakes that slither in the dirt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A sword will bereave them outside, and panic inside— young man and virgin, nursing baby and graying grandpa.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I would've said, 'I'll cut them in pieces and erase their memory from people's minds,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> if I hadn't feared provocation by enemies or adversaries that would misjudge and say, 'We won! Yahveh hasn't done all that.' 28"They're a nation without counsel, bereft of understanding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Oh that they'd be wise and understand so they'd discern their own future!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> How could one chase 1,000 and two put 10,000 to flight unless their Rock had sold them out, unless Yahveh had given them up?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Their rock is certainly not like our Rock; even our enemies can see that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Their grapevine grows from Sodom's vines from Gomorrah's vineyards. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters are bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Their wine is snake venom, cobras' deadly poison. 34"Yahveh says, 'Isn't that stored up with me and sealed in my treasuries?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Vengeance and retribution belong to me; in due time their foot will slip. Their time for catastrophe is coming; impending things are rushing at them,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> because Yahveh will vindicate his people and show mercy to his servants. When he sees their strength is gone and nobody remains, bond or free,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> he'll say, 'Where are their gods, the rock they looked to for refuge?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their liquid offerings? Let their gods rise up and help them; let them be their hiding place!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> See now that I'm the One; there's no god but me. I'm the One that puts to death and gives life. I've wounded, and I'm the One that heals. Nobody can deliver them from me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Indeed, I lift up my hand to the sky and say, 'as I live forever.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> When I sharpen my flashing sword and begin to render justice, I'll carry out vengeance on my enemies and pay back the ones that hate me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> I'll make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword will devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives from the heads of the enemy's leaders.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Celebrate, Gentiles, with his people; for he'll avenge his servants' blood. He'll carry out vengeance on his adversaries and atone for his land and his people." Moses to Die on Mount Nebo</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Then Moses came with Joshua and presented the song to the people. 45When he'd finished, 46he told them, "Take my warnings to heart. Tell your sons to observe them carefully. 47It's not an idle message; it's your life. It affects how long you'll live in the land you're crossing Jordan to take over."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Yahveh told Moses that same day, 49"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, in Moab across from Jericho, and look across at Canaan. 50Then die on the mountain and pass on to your people, like Aaron your brother did on Mount Hor. 51You broke faith with me among the Israelites at the water of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. You didn't honor me as holy among them. 52You'll see the land at a distance, but you can't go in." Moses Blesses the Tribes</span>
