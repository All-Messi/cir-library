## Deuteronomy Chapter **23**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“Nobody</em><em> that’s been castrated or has his penis cut off, can go into Yahveh’s assembly. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>No</em><em> illegitimate person or his descendant can go into Yahveh’s assembly for ten generations. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>No</em><em> Ammonite, Moabite, or their descendant can go into Yahveh’s assembly for ten generations. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> didn’t meet you with food and water when you came out of Egypt. They hired Balaam Ben-Beor from Mesopotamia to curse you, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> Yahveh wouldn’t listen to him. He turned the curse into a blessing because he loves you. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Never</em><em> seek peace or prosperity with them.</em> <strong><em><sup>7</sup></em></strong><em>“Don’t</em><em> detest Edomite</em><em>s</em><em>; </em><em>they’re</em><em> </em><em>kin</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t detest Egypt</em><em>ians; you lived as foreigners</em><em> in his land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> third generation </em><em>can</em><em> enter </em><em>Yahveh’s </em><em>assembly</em><em>. </em> <strong>Uncleanness in Camp</strong> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“When</em><em> you go out as an army, keep yourselves away from anything impure. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> a man is ceremonially unclean from night emissions, he must leave the camp the rest of the day</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> the evening, he can take a bath and come back. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> a place outside the camp to go</em><em> </em><em>to. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Keep</em><em> a spade among your tools. When you defecate, dig </em>a hole<em> and cover up your feces. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Since</em><em> Yahveh lives in your camp to deliver you from your enemies, your camp must be holy. He must not see anything detestable among you, or he’ll turn away from you.</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Miscellaneous Laws 15“Don’t hand over to their master any slaves that escape to you. 16Let them live among you where they choose. Don’t mistreat them.  17“No son or daughter will be a cult prostitute. 18Don’t take the hire of a female or male prostitute* to Yahveh’s house for an offering to fulfill a vow. They’re detestable to your God.  19“Don’t charge your fellow citizens interest on money, food, or anything that can be loaned at interest, 20so Yahveh can bless what you undertake. You can charge a foreigner interest. 21“When you vow to Yahveh, don’t delay paying it. That would be a sin, and he’ll certainly hold you to it. (22Not taking any vow isn’t a sin.) 23You have to do what you voluntarily promise your God.  24“You can go into someone else’s vineyard and eat as many grapes as you want, but you can’t put any in a container. 25You can go into someone’s standing grain and pick off heads, but you can’t use a sickle on it.
