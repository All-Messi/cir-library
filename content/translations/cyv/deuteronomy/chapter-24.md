## Deuteronomy Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“When</em><em> a man gets married and his wife becomes displeasing to him because he finds something wrong with her, he’s to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she marries another man </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> he divorces her or dies, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>her</em><em> first husband can’t marry her again because she’s been defiled. That would be detestable to Yahveh. Don’t bring sin on the land he’s giving you. </em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“When</em><em> a man gets married, he won’t be charged with any military duty for a year. He’ll be free at home to make his wife happy. </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“Don’t</em><em> take a hand mill or upper millstone as a pledge. You’d be taking a livelihood as a pledge. </em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“If</em><em> someone kidnaps and enslaves or sells a fellow citizen, execute the kidnapper. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Keep</em><em> an eye on a spot of leprosy and follow the priests’ instructions. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Remember</em><em> what Yahveh did to Miriam on the way from Egypt.  </em><em>	</em></span>

### 10“When you loan somebody something, don’t go into his house to get it. 11Let him bring it out to you. 12If he’s poor, don’t keep his pledge overnight. 13Give it back at sundown so he can sleep in his cloak and have a good attitude toward you. Yahveh will consider you good.   14“Don’t oppress hired hands that’ are poor, citizen or foreigner. 15Pay them each day before sundown. They’re poor and their life depends on it. That way they won’t call out to Yahveh, and it becomes sin in you.    16“Don’t execute parents for children or vice versa. Execute each person for that person’s sin.  17“Don’t pervert justice with a foreigner or orphan, or take a widow’s cloak as a pledge. 18Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and Yahveh freed you. That’s why I’m telling you this.  19“When you harvest your field and overlook a bundle, don’t go back to get it. Leave it for foreigners, orphans, or widows. Yahveh your God will bless you in your work. 20When you beat the limbs on your olive tree, don’t go back over them. Leave them for foreigners, orphans, and widows. 21When you gather grapes from your vineyard, don’t pick back over them. Leave them for foreigners, orphans, and widows. 22Remember that you were a slave in Egypt. That’s why I’m telling you this.	    Deut 24:10-22
