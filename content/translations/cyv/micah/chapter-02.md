## Micah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits those who devise sin, Who lie awake plotting schemes in bed! In the morning they do them because they can.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They covet fields and seize them; they desire horses and take them. They rob people and confiscate the property they've inherited.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So Yahveh says, "I'm devising a catastrophe for this family; you won't get your necks out of the noose. You won't keep carrying on arrogantly; it'll be a terrible time for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your enemies will taunt you with a proverb and wail a bitter dirge in mockery, 'We're ruined! God is reapportioning our things. He's taking them away from us and giving our fields to apostates!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So you won't have anyone stretching out a surveying line for you by lot in Yahveh's assembly. 6"'Don't preach about such things,' they say; 'disgrace won't catch up with us.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Are you really saying such a thing, House of Jacob? Isn't Yahveh's Spirit patient? Does he do such things? Don't his words do good for those who do right?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> My people rise up against my people; they strip robes off the peaceful, off of people that go along innocently with no thought of fighting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They evict my people's women from their pleasant homes and forever strip away from their children the splendor I would give them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Get up and get out of here! this is no longer a place to rest; there's sinfulness here that brings painful destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If a liar full of hot air tells you he'll preach about the fun of wine and alcohol, he'll certainly get a hearing from you! 12"I'll assemble you, Jacob, remnant of Israel, and put you together like sheep in a fold; like a flock in its pasture, you'll be a noisy crowd in your land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The One that opens the gate will lead you out; you'll break out of exile through it. Your King will go out ahead of you, Yahveh at the lead." Judgment Against Israel's Leaders</span>
