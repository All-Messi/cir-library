## Micah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Muster your troops, Jerusalem; they're laying siege against you; they'll hit Israel's leader in the face with a rod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you're small among Judah's clans, you'll have a ruler come out of you on my behalf in Israel. His origins are from long ago, from ancient times."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel will be abandoned till the one that's in labor has the child; then the rest of his relatives will come back from exile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He'll stand up and shepherd his flock with the power and majesty of Yahveh his God; they'll be able to remain secure because at that time he'll be great everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He'll give us peace.	Mic 5:1-5a When the Assyrians invade our land and overrun our fortresses, we'll fight back with seven shepherds, eight princes leading us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They'll shepherd Assyria with the sword, Nimrod's land with swords drawn. Yahveh will deliver us from them when they attack our land and try to tramp all over our territory. A Remnant to Be Delivered</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then the remnant of Jacob left in the land will live among many nations like dew from Yahveh, like showers on grass that mortals can't restrain, that no one can delay. 	Mic 5:5b-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The remnant left in Jacob will live among many nations like a young lion in a flock of sheep. He mauls and mangles as he goes; no one can stop him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He'll raise his hand against his enemies and wipe them out. 10"At that time," Yahveh says, "I'll get rid of your horses and destroy your chariots.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll demolish your towns and tear down your defenses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll abolish sorcery; you won't have fortunetellers anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll get rid of your carved images and sacred pillars so you won't worship what you've made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll pull up your Asherah poles and destroy your pagan cities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll carry out angry revenge on nations that refuse to obey." Yahveh's Case Against Israel</span>
