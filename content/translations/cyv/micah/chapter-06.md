## Micah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to what Yahveh says: "Present to the mountains your case against me; let the hills hear your complaint.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But then listen, mountains, to Yahveh's complaint, you enduring foundations of the world. He has a suit against his people; he'll bring charges against Israel. 3"What have I done to you, my people? How have I wearied you? Answer me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I brought you out of Egypt and ransomed you from slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My people, remember now the curse that Balak, king of Moab, proposed, the blessing that Balaam Ben-Beor answered with, the laws that led you from Shittim to Gilgal, so you could learn about myY faithfulness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> What should I bring to Yahveh? What should I bow with before God on high? Should I come to him with burnt offerings and yearling calves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Does Yahveh delight in thousands of rams, in 10,000 rivers of olive oil? Am I to present my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> No, he's told you what's good: what does Yahveh require from you but to do good, love kindness, and walk humbly with him? Israel's Guilt and Punishment</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh will call out to the city— it's wise to respect him— "Listen, tribe and city council.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Can I overlook the wealth gained from cheating that's in sinners' houses and the short measure that's accursed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Can I acquit a businessman that uses dishonest scales and a bag of false weights?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The rich in the city extort; its residents lie and deceive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So I'll send diseases to strike you down, and bring you to ruin for your sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You'll eat, but you won't be satisfied; there'll be hunger among you. You'll store up for safe keeping, but I'll deliver most of it to the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You'll plant, but not harvest; you'll tread olives, but not anoint yourself with the oil; you'll tread grapes, but not drink the wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You've followed the statutes of sinful Omri and the example of Ahab; you've taken their advice. So I'll deliver you to destruction and your people to ridicule; you'll endure the nations' scorn." Israel's Misery Turned to Hope</span>
