## Micah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I said, "Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel. Aren't you supposed to know what's good,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> you that hate good and love evil, who skin my people alive, pull the meat off their bones,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> eat their flesh, break up their bones in pieces, and chop them up for the pot like meat in a kettle?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll call out to Yahveh, but he won't answer you; he'll turn away from you because of all your sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh says this about you prophets that mislead my people: "When you have something to eat, you prophesy peace; But you declare holy war against anyone that doesn't feed you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Consequently, you'll have nights without visions, darkness without fortunetelling. The sun will set on you prophets; the day will get dark over you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You seers will be put to shame; you fortunetellers will be disgraced. You'll have to cover your mouths in humiliation because I won't answer you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But I'm filled with power— with the Spirit of Yahveh— with justice and courage to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel, who abhor justice and twist the truth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You leaders render verdicts for a bribe; you priests teach for hire; you prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet you want to rely on Yahveh and say, "Yahveh's with us, right? Catastrophe won't happen to us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, because of you, they'll plow Zion like a field; Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins; the Temple mount will be a full-grown forest. The Mountain of Yahveh</span>
