## Micah Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune is waiting for me! I feel like people that pick fruit and gather grapes but have no clusters to eat or first-ripe figs to satisfy their hunger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Godly people have disappeared; there aren’t any good ones left. They all premeditate murder; each hunts the other with a net.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Both hands do evil well, officials and judges both demand bribes, influential people vie for preferential treatment; together they weave injustice.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The best of them are like briars; the most godly <em>are</em> like a thorn hedge. They can post a watchman, but their punishment will still come; their confusion is at hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Don’t trust your neighbor, don’t confide in a friend, be careful what you tell your wise</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Son treats father with contempt; daughter defies mother, daughter-in-law defies mother-in-law; people have enemies in their own families.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:4-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But <u>I</u> will look to Yahveh; I’ll wait for God, who keeps me safe. He’ll listen to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don’t gloat over me, adversary. Though I fall, I’ll get up; though I live in the dark, Yahveh’s my light.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:7-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I’ll bear Yahveh’s indignation because <em>admittedly </em>I’ve sinned against him; then he’ll give me justice <em>against my enemy</em>. He’ll bring me out to the light, and I’ll <em>be able to</em> see his goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As a result, my enemy will see <em>it too</em> and be put to shame who said, <em>“Where’s </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> your God?”</em> I’ll watch while he’s tramped on like dirt on a road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> It’ll be a time, <em>Israel</em>, for rebuilding your walls and extending your boundaries,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>a day when people come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt— from Egypt to the Euphrates, from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But <em>first </em>the land will become desolate because of what its people have done.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:9-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Shepherd your people with your staff, your flock that lives alone in a woods surrounded by productive fields. Let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead like they did in the old days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Nations will see <em>them</em> and be embarrassed at their own weakness. They’ll put their hand over their mouth <em>in awe</em>, and their ears will pop.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They’ll lick dust like a snake, like a reptile in the dirt. They’ll come cringing out of their fortresses and turn to Yahveh our God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:14-17</p>

### Yahveh’s Compassion for Israel


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> What God is like you, that pardons sin and passes over the rebellious acts the remnant of his permanent possession has done?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You’ll show us mercy again, tread our iniquities underfoot, throw our sins in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You’ll show <em>covenant </em>faithfulness to Jacob, <em>	</em>enduring love to Abraham like you swore to our ancestors so long ago.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mic 7:18-20</p>
