## Micah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the last days, the mountain Yahveh's Temple's on will be the tallest mountain. It will loom above the hills, and the people from many nations will stream to it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They'll say, "Let's go up to Yahveh's mountain, to the Temple of Jacob's God, so he can teach us his ways, and we can follow in his paths." The Law will go out from Zion, Yahveh's message from Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He'll mediate between many nations and settle disputes between powerful countries far away. They'll hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation won't attack nation or train for war anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree, and nobody will make them afraid; the LORDY has said so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The nations conduct themselves in the name of their gods; we will follow Yahveh our God forever. Israel's Future Rescue from Exile 6"At that time," Yahveh says,								"I'll assemble the lame and gather the exiles that I've oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll make the lame a remnant and the outcasts a powerful nation. I'll reign over them on Mount Zion permanently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Your former dominion will revert to you, tower of the flock, hill of Zion, kingdom of Jerusalem. 9"Now why are you crying out? Don't you have a king? Has your advisor perished and agony seized you as in childbirth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Writhe and groan, inhabitant of Zion, like a woman in labor, because you'll leave the city to live in open country, and go to Babylon. But I'll rescue you and redeem you from your enemies there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now many nations have gathered against you, saying, 'Let's desecrate it; let's take pride in destroying Zion.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But they don't know what I'm thinking or understand my purpose, because I'm going to gather them up like bundles for a threshing floor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Get up and thresh, Zion. I'll give you iron horns and bronze hoofs so you can pulverize many nations and the wealth of their unjust gain you can devote to me, the Lord of the whole world. A Promised Ruler from Bethlehem</span>
