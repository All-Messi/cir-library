## 1 Kings Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In <strong>the third year</strong>, a message from Yahveh came to Elijah, <em>“Present yourself to Ahab, and I’ll send rain.” </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So he went to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Ahab called Obadiah, who managed the palace. (Obadiah respected Yahveh greatly. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Jezebel was destroying Yahveh’s prophets, he</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>They divided up the land to survey it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Elijah met Obadiah on the road. He recognized him and fell on his face, <em>“Is that you, Elijah?” </em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“It’s me. Go tell your master I’m here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He said, <em>“How have I sinned that you’re turning me over to Ahab to execute me? </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>As Yahveh your God lives, he’s searched for you in every nation and kingdom. When they said you weren’t there, he’d make the kingdom or nation swear they couldn’t find you. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Now you’re telling me to go tell him you’re here. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>When I leave, the Spirit of Yahveh will carry you where I don’t know. When I tell Ahab and he can’t find you, he’ll kill me even though I’ve respected Yahveh my whole life. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Haven’t you heard what I did when Jezebel was killing his prophets?

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Obadiah went and told Ahab, and he came to meet Elijah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When Ahab saw him, he said, <em>“Is that you, you troubler of Israel?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I haven’t brought trouble on Israel. You and your father’s family have done that. You’ve abandoned Yahveh’s commandments and worshipped the images of Baal. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Now then, gather Israel to me at Mount Carmel, along with</span>

### Baal prophets and 400 Asherah prophets that eat at Jezebel’s table.” The Contest on Mount Carmel


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Ahab sent a message among the Israelites and brought the prophets to Mount Carmel. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Elijah faced the people and said, <em>“How long will you waver between two sides? If Yahveh is God, follow him. If Baal is god, follow him.”</em> The people didn’t say anything. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Then Elijah told them, <em>“I’m the only prophet Yahveh has left; Baal</span>

### of them. 23Let us have two oxen. They can choose one, cut it up, lay it on the wood, but not put any fire under it. I’ll prepare the other, lay it on the wood, and not put a fire under it. 24Then you call on your god, and I’ll call on Yahveh. The one that answers by fire, is God.” The people answered, “That’s good.”


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Elijah told the Baal prophets, <em>“Choose an ox and prepare it first; there are lots of you. Call on your god, but don’t put fire under it.” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They prepared their ox and called on Baal from morning till noon, <em>“Baal, answer us.”</em> There was no answer. They leaped around the altar they’d made. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>At about noon Elijah mocked them, <em>“Shout, because he’s a god. Either he’s occupied or has wandered off. Maybe he’s traveling or asleep and needs to be woke up.” </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>As was their custom, they shouted and cut themselves with swords and lances till blood gushed out on them. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>When noon had passed, they raved till the time for evening sacrifice. But there wasn’t any voice, nobody answered, nobody paid attention. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then Elijah told the crowd to come closer. He repaired Yahveh’s altar that had been torn down. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He</span>

### stones corresponding to the 12 tribes of Jacob, whose name Yahveh had changed to ‘Israel.’ 32With the stones, he rebuilt the altar in Yahveh’s name and dug a trench around it big enough to hold more than .73 of a bushel 2 seahs of seed. 33Then he arranged the wood, cut the ox in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He told them to fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood. 34“Do it again.” “Do it a third time.” 35The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 36Then at the time of evening sacrifice, he went up to the altar and said, “Yahveh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, show today that you’re God in Israel, that I’m your servant, that you’ve told me to do this. 37Answer me so the people can know you’re God and that you’ve brought them back to you.” 			 	1 Kg 18:30-37


<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>Fire came down from Yahveh and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and the water in the trench. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>The people they fell on their faces, <em>“Yahveh is God! Yahveh is God!” </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Elijah told them, <em>“Seize the Baal prophets. Don’t let a one of them get away.” </em>They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon River and killed them. <strong>Yahveh Sends Rain</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Elijah told Ahab,<em> “Go get something to eat; there’s the sound of heavy rain.” </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Ahab went to eat. Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel and crouched down with his head between his knees. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He told his servant to go look toward the sea<em>.</em> He went and looked, <em>“There’s nothing.”</em> He said, <em>“Go back,”</em> seven times. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The seventh time, <em>the servant</em> said, <em>“A cloud the size of a man’s hand is coming up from the horizon.”</em> He said, <em>“Go tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn’t stop him.”</em> <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a downpour came. Ahab rode to Jezreel. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Yahveh was with Elijah, and he girded up and outran Ahab to Jezreel.<strong>  </strong><strong></span>
