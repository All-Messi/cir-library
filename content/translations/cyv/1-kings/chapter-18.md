## 1 Kings Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 18:30-37</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They divided up the land to survey it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Elijah met Obadiah on the road. He recognized him and fell on his face, "Is that you, Elijah?" 8"It's me. Go tell your master I'm here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, "How have I sinned that you're turning me over to Ahab to execute me? 10As Yahveh your God lives, he's searched for you in every nation and kingdom. When they said you weren't there, he'd make the kingdom or nation swear they couldn't find you. 11Now you're telling me to go tell him you're here. 12When I leave, the Spirit of Yahveh will carry you where I don't know. When I tell Ahab and he can't find you, he'll kill me even though I've respected Yahveh my whole life. 13Haven't you heard what I did when Jezebel was killing his prophets? I hid 100 of them by 50s in a cave and provided them bread and water? 14Now you want me to tell my master you're here!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Elijah said, "As Yahveh of Hosts lives, I'll present myself to Ahab today."	1 Kg 18:1-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Obadiah went and told Ahab, and he came to meet Elijah. 17When Ahab saw him, he said, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said, "I haven't brought trouble on Israel. You and your father's family have done that. You've abandoned Yahveh's commandments and worshipped the images of Baal. 19Now then, gather Israel to me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 Baal prophets and 400 Asherah prophets that eat at Jezebel's table." The Contest on Mount Carmel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Ahab sent a message among the Israelites and brought the prophets to Mount Carmel. 21Elijah faced the people and said, "How long will you waver between two sides? If Yahveh is God, follow him. If Baal is god, follow him." The people didn't say anything. 	1 Kg 18:16-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then Elijah told them, "I'm the only prophet Yahveh has left; Baal has 450 of them. 23Let us have two oxen. They can choose one, cut it up, lay it on the wood, but not put any fire under it. I'll prepare the other, lay it on the wood, and not put a fire under it. 24Then you call on your god, and I'll call on Yahveh. The one that answers by fire, is God." The people answered, "That's good."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Elijah told the Baal prophets, "Choose an ox and prepare it first; there are lots of you. Call on your god, but don't put fire under it." 26They prepared their ox and called on Baal from morning till noon, "Baal, answer us." There was no answer. They leaped around the altar they'd made. 27At about noon Elijah mocked them, "Shout, because he's a god. Either he's occupied or has wandered off. Maybe he's traveling or asleep and needs to be woke up." 28As was their custom, they shouted and cut themselves with swords and lances till blood gushed out on them. 29When noon had passed, they raved till the time for evening sacrifice. But there wasn't any voice, nobody answered, nobody paid attention. 	1 Kg 18:22-29</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then Elijah told the crowd to come closer. He repaired Yahveh's altar that had been torn down. 31He took 12 stones corresponding to the 12 tribes of Jacob, whose name Yahveh had changed to 'Israel.' 32With the stones, he rebuilt the altar in Yahveh's name and dug a trench around it big enough to hold more than .73 of a bushel 2 seahs of seed. 33Then he arranged the wood, cut the ox in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He told them to fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood. 34"Do it again." "Do it a third time." 35The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 36Then at the time of evening sacrifice, he went up to the altar and said, "Yahveh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, show today that you're God in Israel, that I'm your servant, that you've told me to do this. 37Answer me so the people can know you're God and that you've brought them back to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Fire came down from Yahveh and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and the water in the trench. 39The people they fell on their faces, "Yahveh is God! Yahveh is God!" 40Elijah told them, "Seize the Baal prophets. Don't let a one of them get away." They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon River and killed them. Yahveh Sends Rain</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Elijah told Ahab, "Go get something to eat; there's the sound of heavy rain." 42Ahab went to eat. Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel and crouched down with his head between his knees. 43He told his servant to go look toward the sea. He went and looked, "There's nothing." He said, "Go back," seven times. 44The seventh time, the servant said, "A cloud the size of a man's hand is coming up from the horizon." He said, "Go tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn't stop him." 45In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a downpour came. Ahab rode to Jezreel. 46Yahveh was with Elijah, and he girded up and outran Ahab to Jezreel.  	1 Kg 18:38-46 Elijah Flees to Sinai</span>
