## 1 Kings Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had come there to make him king. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jeroboam heard about it in Egypt. (<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They sent and called him.) Jeroboam and all Israel came and told Rehoboam,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Your father made our yoke hard.</em><em> L</em><em>ighten </em><em>his</em><em> hard service and </em><em>his </em><em>heavy yoke, and we’ll serve you.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He said<em>, “Leave for three days, then come back.</em><em>”</em> So they left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>King Rehoboam consulted with the elders that had served Solomon, <em>“How </em><em>do you advise me to answer the</em><em> people?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They said, <em>“If you’ll </em><em>serve this nation today, </em><em>grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, they’ll </em><em>serve you permanently</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But he dismissed their advice and consulted with the young men he grew up with and served him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>your advice about </em><em>answer</em><em>ing</em><em> th</em><em>e</em><em> people, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The young men said, <em>“Tell them, ‘My little finger </em><em>is thicker than my father’s waist</em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>M</em><em>y fath</em><em>er loaded you with a heavy yoke;</em><em> I’ll add to </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>My father </em><em>disciplined you with whips; </em><em>I’ll discipline you with scorpions.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The king answered them harshly. He didn’t take the elders’ advice <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice, <em>“My father made your yoke heavy;</em><em> I’ll add to </em><em>it. M</em><em>y father</em><em> disciplined you with whips;</em><em> I’ll discipline you with scorpions.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He ignored the people, a turn of affairs Yahveh let happen to bring about what he’d told Jeroboam through Ahijah of Shiloh.<strong>	     </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When Israel saw that he didn’t listen, they answered him, <em>“What </em><em>part</em><em> do we have in David?</em> <em>	We have no inheritance in </em><em>Jesse’s</em><em> son;</em> <em>	</em><em>Go home</em><em>, Israel!</em> <em>	Look after your own house, David!”</em> Israel went home, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>but <strong>Rehoboam</strong> ruled the Israelites that lived in Judah. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He sent Adoram, supervisor over forced labor, and Israel stoned him to death. Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Israel has been in rebellion against David’s descendants ever since. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When all Israel heard that <u>Jeroboam</u> was back, they called him to the assembly and crowned him king of all Israel. No tribe but Judah stayed with David’s dynasty. <strong>	</strong></span>

### Shemaiah’s Prophecy


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>When Rehoboam got to Jerusalem, he gathered Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen soldiers, to fight Israel to restore the kingdom to himself. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But a message from God came to Shemaiah, the man of God, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Tell Rehoboam, the tribes</em><em> of Judah and Benjamin</em><em>,</em><em> and the rest of the people</em><em>,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Yahveh says not to</em><em> fight </em><em>thei</em><em>r relative</em><em>s</em><em> the Israel</em><em>ites: g</em><em>o home</em><em>;</em><em> this thing has </em><em>his approval</em><em>.”</em> They listened and went home.<strong>	    </strong></span>

### The Gold Calves at Bethel and Dan


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup><u>Jeroboam</u> built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He went out from there and built Penuel. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He said to himself, <em>“The kingdom will </em><em>revert</em><em> to </em><em>David’s</em><em> </em><em>descendants</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>If the people go up to offer sacrifices in </em><em>Yahveh’s Temple</em><em> at Jerusalem, their hearts will </em><em>go back</em><em> to Rehoboam, and they’ll kill me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>So he made two gold calves and said, <em>“It’</em><em>s too much </em><em>trouble </em><em>to go up to Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><em>Look, your gods, Israel,</em><em> that brought you up from Egypt!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He set one in Bethel and the other in Dan. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>That thing became a sin because the people went to worship at the one as far as Dan. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He made houses on high places and appointed priests from among the people that didn’t descend from Levi. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong><sup>-33</sup></strong>He instituted a festival in Bethel on the fifteenth day, eighth month like the festival in Judah. He went up to burn incense on the altar there and sacrificed to the calves he’d made. He stationed priests at the high places he’d made there.<strong> </strong></span>
