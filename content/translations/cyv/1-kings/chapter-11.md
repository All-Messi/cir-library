## 1 Kings Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 11:9-13 Solomon's Adversaries</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh was angry with him because he turned his heart away. The God of Israel had appeared to him twice, 10and commanded him not to go after other gods. But he didn't obey that command. 11God told him, "Because you've done this and haven't kept my covenant and statutes, I'll tear the kingdom from you and give it to one of your servants. 12But for David's sake, I won't do it in your lifetime. I'll tear it away from your son, 13but not all of it. I'll give him one tribe for the sake of David and Jerusalem that I've chosen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh raised up Hadad the Edomite against Solomon. He was from the royal line. 15When David was in Edom, Joab, commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain and strike down every male in Edom. (16Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he'd killed every male in Edom.) 17Hadad fled to Egypt with some of his father's officials when he was a boy. 18They left Midian and went to Paran. They took people with them from Paran and went on to Pharaoh. He gave him a house and land and assigned him food. 19He came to like Hadad so much that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 20She had Hadad's son Genubath and weaned him in Pharaoh's palace. Genubath was in Pharaoh's palace with his sons. 21But when Hadad heard that David had died and Joab was dead, he said to Pharaoh, "Let me leave so I can go to my own country." 22"What have you lacked with me?" "Nothing; but you need to let me go." 	1 Kg 11:14-22</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> God raised up another adversary, Rezon Ben-Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah. 24-25He gathered men and led a marauding band after David killed the people in Zobah. They went to Damascus and ruledpl Aram from there. He hated Israel and was its adversary all of Solomon's life like Hadad was. Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jeroboam Ben-Nebat rebelled against Solomon. He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, one of Solomon's officials, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow. 27He rebelled when Solomon was building the Millo and closing up the breach in The City of David. 28Jeroboam was a trained soldier. When Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over the forced labor of Joseph's house. 29During that time, when Jeroboam left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah had dressed in a new cloak, and both of them were alone in a field. 30Ahijah took his new cloak and tore it into 12 pieces. 31He told Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces. Yahveh says, 'I'll tear the kingdom away from Solomon and give you ten tribes (32but he'll have one tribe, for the sake of David and Jerusalem, the city I've chosen from the tribes). 33They've left me and worshiped Ashtoreth goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh god of Moab, and Milcom god of the Ammonites. They haven't done what I've considered right or observed my statutes and ordinances like David did. 34I won't take the whole kingdom away from Solomon. I'll let him rule all his life for David's sake, 35but I'll take ten tribes away from his son and give them to you. 36I'll give his son one tribe so David will always have a lamp in Jerusalem, the city I've chosen to identify with. 37I'll take you, and you'll reign over whatever you desire and be king of Israel. 38If you listen to everything I tell you like David did, I'll be with you and build you an enduring dynasty like I built for David. 39That's how I'll punish David's descendants for this, but not forever.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> The rest of what Solomon did and his wisdom are recorded in The Book of the Acts of Solomon. 42He ruled Israel in Jerusalem for 40 years. 43When he died, they buried him in The City of David.
