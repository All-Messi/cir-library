## 1 Kings Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A message from Yahveh came to Jehu Ben-Hanani against Baasha: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Since I lifted you up from the dust </em><em>to lead</em><em> </em><em>Israel, </em><em>you’ve done what Jeroboam did and </em><em>got</em><em> Israel </em><em>to </em><em>do and </em><em>made me angry by their sins. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll consume </em><em>you</em><em> and </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> and make </em><em>it</em><em> like </em><em>Jeroboam’s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><em>Dogs will eat any relat</em></strong><strong><em>ive</em></strong><strong><em> that dies in the city</em></strong><strong><em>; b</em></strong><strong><em>irds will eat any</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>that die in the field.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>The rest of the acts of Baasha and the strength of his rule are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in Tirzah. His son <u>Elah</u> became king. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>In addition, a message from Yahveh through the prophet Jehu came against Baasha and his dynasty. <em>It came against him</em> because of his sin that made Yahveh angry like Jeroboam’s dynasty did, and because he destroyed Jeroboam’s family.<strong>	</strong></span>

### years. 9 Zimri, commander of half his chariots, led a plot against him. Elah was at Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza, who managed the palace at Tirzah. 10Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa and became king. 11As soon as he became king, he killed Baasha’s family. He didn’t leave a single male among his relatives and friends. 12So Zimri destroyed Baasha’s family like Yahveh had said through the prophet Jehu.  13He delivered that message because of the sins Baasha and Elah did and got Israel to do with their idols and made Yahveh angry. 14The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.	 1 Kg 16:8-14 Zimri Rules in Israel

### days at Tirzah. The people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 16The people camped there heard that Zimri had struck down the king; so Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king of Israel that day in the camp. 17Then Omri and Israel went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. 18When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortress of the king’s palace and burned it down over himself and died. 19He did it because of his sins, following the way of Jeroboam and getting Israel to sin. 20The rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
