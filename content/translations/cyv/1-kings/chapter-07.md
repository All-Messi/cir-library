## 1 Kings Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It took 13 years to build Solomon's palace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon: 150 x 75 x 45ft high. It rested on 4 rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. 3It had cedar panels above the side-rooms that were on the 45 pillars, 15 to a row. 4There were 3 rows of window frames with window across from window in three ranks. 5All the doorways and doorposts had square frames.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He made the Hall of Pillars: 75 x 45ft with a porch in front and pillars, and a threshold in front of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He built the Hall of the Throne, where he would judge, the Hall of Judgment, paneled with cedar from floor to rafters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The palace where he'd live and the other court inward from the hall had the same workmanship. He made similar quarters for Pharaoh's daughter that he'd married. 9These were made out of expensive stones, cut to size with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and so on the outside to the great court.	1 Kg 7:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The foundation consisted of huge, expensive stones, some 12ft and 15ft long. 11Above were expensive stones cut to size—and cedar. 12The great court had 3 courses of cut stone all around capped by a layer of cedar beams like the inner court of Yahveh's Temple and its porch. The Temple Furnishings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> King Solomon sent for Hiram/Huram of Tyre, a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali. His father was from Tyre, a worker in bronze. 14He was filled with wisdom, insight, and skill for doing any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon to do his work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Hiram/Huram fashioned 2 pillars of bronze 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference. 16He made 2 capitals out of molten bronze to set on top of the pillars, each 7½ft tall. 17There were 7 sets of latticework and interwoven chains for the capitals. 18Hiram circled 200 pomegranates in 2 rows around the latticework on each capital, 19and each had a lily design 6ft tall. 20The capitals were close to the rounded projection that was beside the latticework. 21So he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave. The left pillar he named Boaz, and the right one, Jachin. 22The capitals on the pillars there were shaped like water lilies. That finished the work on the pillars. 	1 Kg 7:10-22</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Hiram/Huram made the sea out of cast metal 15ft from brim to brim. It was 7½ft tall and 45ft in circumference. 24Under its brim, gourds went all the way around it, 10 to each 1½ft. The gourds were in 2 rows, cast with the rest. 25The sea rested on 12 oxen, 3 each facing north, west, south, and east, and their hind quarters aimed inward. 26It was a handbreadth thick with a brim like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold 18,000 gallons.	 1 Kg 7:23-26</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then Hiram/Huram made 10 bronze stands, each 6 x 6 x 4½ft high. 28They had braces between the frames 29decorated with lions, oxen, and cherubs. On the frames there was a pedestal above with lions and oxen, and wreaths of hanging work below. 30Each stand had 4 bronze wheels with bronze axles. There were 4 supports under the basins with wreath decorations on each side. 31Its opening was within a crown that stuck up 18ins. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. 32The 4 wheels were under the panels, and their axels of one piece with the stands. The wheels were 27ins tall, 33made like chariot wheels with their axels, rims, spokes, and hubs cast in one piece from molten bronze. 34There were 4 supports at the 4 corners of each stand made of one piece with the stands. 35On top of the stand was a round band 18ins high with stays and borders of one piece with it. 36On the surfaces of its stays and borders, he carved cherubs, lions, and palm trees according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. 37He made 10 such stands, cast alike, the same size and shape.	 1 Kg 7:27-37</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He made 10 bronze basins, 1 for each stand. Each basin held 360 gallons and measured 6ft across. 39He set the stands 5 on the south side of the Temple and 5 on the north side, and set the sea at the southeast corner of the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Hiram/Huram also made pots, shovels, and basins. He finished everything for King Solomon on Yahveh's Temple: 41the 2 pillars, 2 bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars, 2 networks to cover the 2 bowls—42400 pomegranates for the 2 networks in 2 rows per network; 4310 stands and the 10 lavers on them, 44the sea and the 12 oxen under it.	1 Kg 7:38-44</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He made the pots, shovels, and basins out of burnished bronze. 46The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47Solomon didn't calculate the weight of the bronze or the items; there were too many.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Solomon made the furniture for Yahveh's Temple: the golden altar, golden table for the Bread of the Presence, 49lampstands of pure gold—5 on the south side and 5 on the north in front of the inner sanctuary. He made the flowers, lamps, and tongs out of gold; 50the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans out of pure gold; and the sockets for the doors of the Holy of Holies and for the nave of the Temple out of gold. 51Solomon finished the work on Yahveh's Temple. He brought in the silver, gold, and articles David had dedicated, and stored them in theY Temple treasuries. 	1 Kg 7:45-51 The Ark Brought to the Temple</span>
