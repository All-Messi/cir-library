### th year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, the second month (Ziv), he started building Yahveh’s Temple. 2It was 90 x 30 x 45ft high. 3The vestibule across the nave was 30ft long—equal to the Temple’s width—and 15ft deep. 4He made recessed frames for the windows. 5He also built a three-story structure against the walls of the Temple, going around the nave and inner sanctuary, and made side rooms around the outside. 6The first story was 7½ft wide, the middle one 9ft, and the third 10½ft; because on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the Temple all the way around so the beams didn’t insert into the Temple walls. 7While the Temple was being built, the stones were prepared at the quarry. There wasn’t any sound of hammer, axe, or iron tool on site. 8The entry for the lowest side room was on the right side of the Temple. People could go up winding stairs to the middle and third stories. 9He built the Temple and finished it with beams and cedar planks 10in addition to the three stories, each 7½ft high, resting against the Temple on cedar timbers.	1 Kg 6:1-10

### ft deep, the Holy of Holies. 17The nave in front of it was 60ft long. 18The cedar all over the inside of the temple was decorated with carved shapes of gourds and open flowers. No stone was showing. 19He prepared the inner sanctuary for the Ark of Yahveh’s Covenant, 2030 x 30 x 30ft high and overlaid with pure gold. He overlaid the altar with cedar. 21He drew gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid the rest of the interior with gold. 22He overlaid the whole Temple with gold as well as the altar by the inner sanctuary.	1 Kg 6:11-22 23-26In the inner sanctuary he made 2 identical cherubs out of olive wood, each 15ft tall 24with wings 7½ft long and their tips 15ft apart. 27He placed the cherubs in the middle of the inner room with their wings spread out so the wing of one touched one wall, the wing of the other touched the opposite wall, and their other wings touched in the center of the Temple. 28He overlaid them with gold.


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on the walls of the inner and outer sanctuaries, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>and overlaid both floors with gold. <strong><sup>31-32</sup></strong>The entrance to the inner sanctuary</span>

### doors out of olive wood with a lintel and 5-sided doorposts, with carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold. 33For the entrance to the nave, he made 4-sided doorposts out of olive wood 34and 2 doors of cypress wood. Both leaves of both doors folded in on pivots. 35He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 36He built the wall of the inner court with 3 courses of cut stone capped by a layer of cedar beams.
