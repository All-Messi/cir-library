### years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 3He did the sins his father did. His heart wasn’t wholly true to Yahveh like David’s was. 4But for David’s sake Yahveh gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, set up his descendant after him, and made Jerusalem secure. 5He did it because David did what was right and didn’t deviate from anything Yahveh commanded him his whole life—except in the matter about Uriah the Hittite. [6] 7The rest of the acts of Abijam are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 8He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Asa became king. Asa Rules in Judah

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>War went on between <strong>Asa</strong> and <u>Baasha</u>, king of Israel, their whole lives. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Baasha went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anybody from going out or coming to Asa. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Then Asa took the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of Yahveh’s Temple and delivered it to his officials. He sent them to Benhadad Ben-Tabrimmon Ben-Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“Let’s make a treaty like </em><em>y</em><em>our father</em><em> and my father did</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve sent you a </em><em>gift</em><em> of silver and gold.</em><em> B</em><em>reak your treaty with Baasha so he’ll withdraw from me.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Benhadad listened to Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the towns in Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and Chinneroth, besides the land of Naphtali. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When Baasha heard it, he stopped fortifying Ramah and stayed in Tirzah. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Then Asa made a proclamation to Judah—no one was exempt—to carry away the stones of Ramah and its timber and fortify Geba in Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The rest of the acts of Asa, the strength of his rule, the towns he built are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</em>. In his old age, he had a disease in his feet. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He died and they buried him with his ancestors in The City of David. His son Jehoshaphat reigned.<strong> </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

### years. 26He did evil like his father had done and got Israel to do. 27Then Baasha Ben-Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to it. 28Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa and began to reign. 29As soon as he became king, he killed everybody in Jeroboam’s family—like Yahveh had said by Ahijah of Shiloh. 30He did it because of the sins Jeroboam got Israel to do, and it made Yahveh God of Israel angry. 31The rest of the acts of Nadab are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 32There was war between Asa and Baasha their whole life.
