## 1 Kings Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 19:14-21 Ahab's War with Syria</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He came upon a cave and stayed there, and a message from Yahveh came to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, "I've been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence." Yahveh was passing by! A gale was tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in Yahveh's presence, but Yahveh wasn't in the wind. After the wind an earthquake came, but Yahveh wasn't in the earthquake. 12After the earthquake, fire came, but Yahveh wasn't in the fire. After the fire the sound of a gentle whisper came. 13When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" 	1 Kg 19:9-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, "I've been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh told him, "Go back on the road to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram, 16anoint Jehu Ben-Nimshi king of Israel, and anoint Elisha Ben-Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 17The one that escapes from Hazael's sword, Jehu will kill, and the one that escapes from Jehu's sword, Elisha will kill. 18I'll preserve 7,000 in Israel, who haven't bowed to Baal and haven't kissed him." The Call of Elisha</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He left and found Elisha plowing with 12 yokes of oxen; he was with the twelfth. Elijah went over and threw his mantle on him. 20He left the oxen and ran after Elijah, "Let me kiss my parents. Then I'll go with you." He told him, "Go on back, but think about what I've done for you." 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant.</span>
