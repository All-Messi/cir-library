<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence.”</em> Yahveh was passing by!

Then I’ll go with you.” He told him, “Go on back, but think about what I’ve done for you.” 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant. 	      	   1 Kg 19:14-21 Ahab’s War with Syria
