## 1 Kings Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After this, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel beside King Ahab’s palace. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ahab spoke to him about it, <em>“Give me your vineyard so I can use it for a vegetable garden; it’s close to my palace. I’ll trade you a better vineyard for it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But Naboth said, <em>“Yahveh forbid me from giving you my ancestors’ inheritance.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Ahab went home sullen and resentful. He lay down on his bed and turned away and wouldn’t eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>His wife Jezebel came in, <em>“Why are you so sullen you won’t eat?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“I asked Naboth to let me buy his vineyard or trade him for another one, but he wouldn’t do it.’” </em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 21:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Jezebel said, <em>“Do you rule Israel? Get up, eat something, and be happy. I’ll get you his vineyard.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>She wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles in Naboth’s town, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Declare a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Put two worthless fellows with him and have them accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The elders and nobles <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>declared a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The two worthless fellows came in and sat down with him, and started accusing him of cursing God and the king. They took him outside the city and stoned him, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and sent word to Jezebel. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>She told Ahab, <em>“Go take Naboth’s vineyard; he’s dead.” </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He got up to go down and take it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Kg 21:7-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Then a message from Yahveh came to Elijah, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Meet Ahab in Naboth’s vineyard. He’s gone down to confiscate it. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Tell him I’ve said, ‘Have you murdered and confiscated? Where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, they’ll lick up yours.’” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Ahab said, <em>“Have you found me, my enemy?”</em> <em> “I’ve found you because you’ve sold yourself to doing evil in Yahveh’s presence. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>‘I’ll bring evil on you and completely sweep you away. I’ll remove from you every male in Israel, bond or free, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>and make your dynasty like Jeroboam’s and Baasha’s; you’ve made me angry and got Israel to sin.’ </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Yahveh has also said dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong><em>Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Nobody had sold himself to doing evil like Ahab did, influenced by his wife. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He acted horribly in following idols like the Amorites had done that Yahveh originally drove out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>When Ahab heard that, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and fasted. He lay down in burlap and walked around in mourning. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Then a message came to Elijah, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“See how Ahab has</em><em> </em><em>humbled</em><em> himself? Since he’</em><em>s </em><em>done that</em><em>, I won’t </em><em>do what I’d promised</em><em> during his life</em><em>time.</em><em> I’ll bri</em><em>ng it</em><em> on his </em><em>family</em><em> during his son’s life.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
