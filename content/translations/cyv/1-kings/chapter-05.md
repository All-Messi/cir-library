## 1 Kings Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to Solomon when he heard they’d anointed him king in place of his father. He’d always been a friend to David. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Solomon sent him a message,<strong><sup> </sup></strong> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“You know my father couldn’t build a temple for Yahveh his God because he carried on warfare till Yahveh put down his enemies. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But now Yahveh has given me peace in every direction. There’s no adversary or misfortune. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I intend to build a temple for Yahveh like he said, ‘Your son that I’ll set on your throne will build me a temple.’ </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Have </em>your woodsmen<em> cut cedars from Lebanon, and my workmen will work with yours. I’ll pay them whatever wages you set. You know there’s nobody among us that knows how to cut timber like Sidonians.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>When<strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong>Hiram heard what Solomon said,<em> </em>he was happy, <em>“Bless Yahveh that’s given David a wise son over this great people.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He sent word to Solomon,<em> </em> <em>“I’ve heard your message. I’ll do what you want about the cedar and cypress timber. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>My workmen will bring it down from Lebanon to the sea, and tie it together in rafts to go by sea to where you designate. I’ll have them taken apart there for you to take away. Then you’ll satisfy me by feeding my household.”</em></span>
