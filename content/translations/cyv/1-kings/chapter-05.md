<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 5:1-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When Hiram heard what Solomon said, he was happy, "Bless Yahveh that's given David a wise son over this great people." 8He sent word to Solomon, "I've heard your message. I'll do what you want about the cedar and cypress timber. 9My workmen will bring it down from Lebanon to the sea, and tie it together in rafts to go by sea to where you designate. I'll have them taken apart there for you to take away. Then you'll satisfy me by feeding my household."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Hiram gave him as much cedar and cypress as he wanted. 11Each year Solomon gave him 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of wheat and 1800 gallons 20 kors of pressed olive oil for his household. 12Yahveh gave Solomon wisdom like he'd promised. Hiram and Solomon signed a peace treaty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> King Solomon conscripted 30,000 laborers from all over Israel, 14and sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 a month. They worked in Lebanon a month and were home two months. Adoniram oversaw them. 15Solomon had 70,000 transporters and 80,000 stone cutters in the mountains, 16besides the 3,300 foremen that oversaw the project and managed the workmen. 17He commissioned them to quarry huge, high-quality stones for the foundation of the Temple. 18His and Hiram's builders and workmen from the town of Gebal cut them and prepared the timbers and stones for the Temple.			     1 Kg 5:13-18 Solomon Builds the Temple</span>
