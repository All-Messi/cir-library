<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time, Abijah, Jeroboam’s<strong><sup>I</sup></strong> son, got sick. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jeroboam told his wife, <strong>	</strong><em>“Disguise yourself and go to Shiloh.</em><em> </em><em>Ahijah the prophet is the</em><em>re who</em><em> said I’d be king.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Take ten loaves of bread, some cakes</em><em>,</em><em> and a jar of honey.</em><em> </em><em>He’ll tell you what will happen to the boy.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>She went to Ahijah’s house at Shiloh. He couldn’t see because of his age. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Yahveh had told him, <em>“Jeroboam’s wife is coming to </em><em>ask</em><em> about her son </em><em>that’s</em><em> sick.</em><em> Tell her</em><em> such and such</em><em>;</em><em> when she gets here, she’ll pretend to be another woman.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>When Ahijah heard her footsteps coming in the door, he said, <em>“Come in, </em><em>Jeroboam’s wife</em><em>, why pretend to be another woman?</em><em> </em><em>I’m sent to you with a harsh message.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Tell Jeroboam that Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘</em><em>I </em><em>lifted </em><em>you </em><em>up </em><em>from among the people and made you </em><em>Israel’s </em><em>leader</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> tore the kingdom away from </em><em>David’s</em><em> </em><em>descendants</em><em> </em><em>and gave it to you. But</em><em> you’ve not been </em><em>like </em><em>David</em><em>. He </em><em>kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart</em><em> and did </em><em>only </em><em>what I said was right.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> </em><em>done more evil</em><em> than </em><em>anybody </em><em>before you</em><em>. You’ve</em><em> made other gods and molten images and </em><em>tossed</em><em> me</em><em> aside. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>So I’ll</em><em> bring </em><em>catastrophe</em><em> on you</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>family: </em><em>I’ll </em><em>eliminate</em><em> from </em><em>you every male, bo</em><em>nd </em><em>or free</em><em>, and </em><em>consume your</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> like a person </em><em>burns up</em><em> manure</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><strong><em>Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city</em></strong><strong><em>; b</em></strong><strong><em>irds will eat any that die in the field</em></strong><em>; I’ve </em><em>said so.</em><em>’  </em><strong>  </strong><strong>	    </strong> <strong>	 </strong></span>

### 12“Go home. When you enter the city, the child will die. 13Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He’s the only one in Jeroboam’s family they’ll put in a grave. This child was something good that Yahveh saw in Jeroboam’s family. 14Yahveh will raise up a king to get rid of Jeroboam’s dynasty. 15He’ll strike Israel like water washing over a reed and uproot Israel from this good land. He’ll scatter them beyond the Euphrates River because they’ve set up their Asherah poles and made him angry. 16He’ll give Israel up over the sins Jeroboam got Israel to do.”

### when he became king and ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city Yahveh chose from the tribes of Israel to identify with.
