<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> She went to Ahijah's house at Shiloh. He couldn't see because of his age. 5Yahveh had told him, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask about her son that's sick. Tell her such and such; when she gets here, she'll pretend to be another woman."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Ahijah heard her footsteps coming in the door, he said, "Come in, Jeroboam's wife, why pretend to be another woman? I'm sent to you with a harsh message. 7Tell Jeroboam that Yahveh God of Israel says, 'I lifted you up from among the people and made you Israel's leader. 8I tore the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you. But you've not been like David. He kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart and did only what I said was right. 9You've done more evil than anybody before you. You've made other gods and molten images and tossed me aside. 10So I'll bring catastrophe on your family: I'll eliminate from you every male, bond or free, and consume your family like a person burns up manure. 11Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field; I've said so.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Rehoboam ruled in Judah. He was 41 when he became king and ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city Yahveh chose from the tribes of Israel to identify with. His mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22Judah provoked Yahveh more than their ancestors did. 23They built high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree. 24There were male cult prostitutes in the land. They did all the disgusting things the nations did that Yahveh originally drove out for Israel.	    1 Kg 14:21-24</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, came up and attacked Jerusalem. 26He took away the treasures in Yahveh's Temple and the king's palace, and everything Solomon had made, including the gold shields. 27Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard for the king's palace. 28Whenever he went to the Temple, the guards would carry them and bring them back to the guardroom.</span>
