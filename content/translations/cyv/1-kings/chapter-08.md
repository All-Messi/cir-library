## 1 Kings Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Kg 8:12-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Solomon said, "You'veY said you'd be in the dark cloud.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I've built you a glorious temple, a permanent place to live."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then he faced the people and blessed the assembly standing there, 15"Bless Yahveh God of Israel who told my father David, 16'From the time I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I hadn't chosen a city to build a temple in so my name would be there, but I chose David to rule my people.' 17My father wanted to build him a temple, 18but Yahveh said he meant well, 19but he wouldn't build it; his son would. 20Yahveh has kept that promise; I've risen to Israel's throne and built him a temple. 21That's where I've set the Ark that holds the covenant he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then Solomon stood at the altar and spread out his hands toward heaven. 23"Yahveh God of Israel, there's no God like you in the sky or on earth because you keep covenant and show enduring love to your servants that follow you with all their heart. 24You've kept your promise to my father. 25Keep this one, too, 'You'll always have a descendant on your throne if they follow me like you have.' 26Confirm that promise now. 27"But will you live on earth? Sky and heaven can't contain you, much less this Temple I've built! 28Yet answer my prayer. Listen to my call 29so you'll be looking toward this Temple day and night where you've put your name. 30Listen when your people and I pray toward here. Listen from heaven, where you live, and forgive. 	1 Kg 8:22-30 31"When someone sins against another and comes here to take an oath at your altar, 32then listen from heaven and judge them. Punish sinners by bringing their way on their own head, and justify the good by rewarding them according to their goodness. 33"When an enemy defeats your people because they've sinned, if they repent, confess your name, and make petition in this Temple, 34then listen from heaven, forgive them, and bring them back to the country you've given their ancestors. 35"When there's no rain because they've sinned against you and they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you punish them, 36then listen from heaven and forgive your people. Teach them the good way to live and send rain on the land you've given them to inherit.	1 Kg 8:31-36 37"When there's a famine in the country; disease, blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper; if their enemies lay siege to their towns—whatever the plague or sickness, 38whatever petition any or all your people make, each knowing the suffering in their own heart and spreading their hands toward this Temple, 39then listen from where you live, forgive, and render to each as they've done—only you know everyone's heart—40so they'll respect you as long as they live in the country you've given our ancestors. 41"When a foreigner comes from a distant country 42because of your great name, your powerful hand, and outstretched arm, and prays toward this Temple, 43then listen from heaven where you live, and do everything he calls to you for so every nation will know you and respect you like your people do. They'll know that this Temple I've built wears your name.	 1 Kg 8:37-43 44"When your people go out to battle in whatever direction you send them, and they pray to you toward this city you've chosen and the Temple I've built, 45then listen from heaven and support their cause. 46"When they sin against you (everyone does), you're angry, and deliver them to an enemy that takes them captive near or far, 47if they take it to heart there, repent, and petition you, 'We've sinned, we've committed iniquity, we've acted perversely,' 48if they come back to you with all their heart and soul, and pray toward the land you've given their ancestors, the city you've chosen, the Temple I've built, 49then listen from heaven where you live, uphold their cause, 50and forgive them. Have their captors show them mercy (51because they're the inheritance you brought out of Egypt, the iron furnace). 52Open your eyes to my petition and to your people Israel, to listen whenever they call. 53You've separated them off from all the other nations as your inheritance, Lord Yahveh, like you said through Moses when you brought them out of Egypt."	1 Kg 8:44-53 54When Solomon had finished that prayer, he stood up from kneeling with his hands spread toward heaven 55and blessed Israel with a loud voice, 56"Blessed be Yahveh, who has given his people rest like he promised. Not a word of his promise through Moses has failed. 57May he be with us like he was with our ancestors, 58and incline our hearts toward him, to follow the statutes and ordinances he commanded them. 59May my petition come near him day and night so he'll support the cause of his servant and of Israel as each day requires. 60Then the whole world can know Yahveh is God and no other. 61Devote your hearts to him completely, follow his statutes, and keep his commandments like you're doing today." The Dedication of the Temple 62The king and all Israel offered sacrifices and peace offerings to Yahveh: 6322,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. That's how the king and Israel dedicated Yahveh's Temple. 64The same day, he consecrated the middle of the court in front of it, because he offered there the burnt offering, grain offering, and fat of the peace offerings. The bronze altar was too small to hold them. 65Solomon and all Israel observed the festival for 14 days, a huge assembly from Lebo-hamath to the River of Egypt, in the presence of Yahveh our God. 66The next day he dismissed the people, and they blessed the king. They went home happy for the goodness Yahveh had shown David his servant and Israel his people.	1 Kg 8:54-66 Yahveh Appears to Solomon</span>
