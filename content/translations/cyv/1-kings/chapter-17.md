<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He called out, <em>“Yahveh my God, have you brought misfortune on the widow I’ve been staying with by causing her son to die?”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He stretched out on the child three times and called out again, <em>“Please bring him back.” </em></span>
