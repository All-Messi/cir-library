## 1 Samuel Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed camps to fight Israel. Achish told David, "You can be sure that you and your men will go out with me in the camp." 2"All right, you'll find out what I can do." "I'll make you my bodyguard for life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Samuel was dead, and Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, his own town. Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. 4The Philistines gathered and camped in Shunem, and Saul gathered Israel and camped at Gilboa. 5When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 6When he asked Yahveh, he didn't answer him by dreams, Urim, or prophets. 7Saul told his advisors, "Find a medium so I can go ask through her." They told him, "There's a woman in En-dor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Saul disguised himself in different clothes and went to her with two men at night and said, "Conjure up for me and bring up the one I name." 9"Surely you know Saul has expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why lay a trap to get me killed?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Saul swore by Yahveh, "As sure as Yahveh lives, you won't be punished." 11"Who do you want me to bring up?" "Samuel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When she saw Samuel, she cried out, "Why have you misled me? You're Saul." 13"Don't be afraid; what do you see?" "A god coming out of the ground." 14"What's he look like?" "An old man, wearing a robe." Saul knew it was Samuel and bowed to the ground in homage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Samuel said, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I'm greatly distressed. The Philistines are waging war against me. God has left me and doesn't answer me anymore by prophets or dreams. I've called you to tell me what I should do." 16"Why ask me since Yahveh has become your adversary? 17He's done what he said through me: he's torn the kingdom from you and given it to David. 18As you didn't carry out his fierce anger on Amalek, so he has done this to you today. 19He'll deliver you and Israel's army to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Saul fell headlong on the floor terrified. There wasn't any strength in him; he hadn't eaten anything all day and all night. 21The woman came and saw he was terrified. She said, "I've done what you asked. I've taken my life in my hands and listened to you.  22Let me fix you some bread so you can have strength when you leave." 23"I'll don't want anything." But she and his advisors kept urging him, so he gave in, got up off the floor, and sat on the bed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The woman had a grain-fed calf in the house. She hurried and butchered it, kneaded flour, and baked bread without yeast. 25She brought it to Saul and his men to eat. He got up and left. The Philistines Reject David</span>
