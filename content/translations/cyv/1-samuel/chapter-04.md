## 1 Samuel Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Samuel's word went out to all Israel. [4:1]Israel had gone out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer. The Philistines camped in Aphek, 2and drew up in formation against Israel. When the battle spread, the Philistines defeated Israel and killed about 4,000. 3When the troops came to camp, Israel's elders said, "Why has Yahveh routed us in front of the Philistines? Let's bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh so he can come among us and save us from our enemies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The people sent to Shiloh and brought the Ark of the Covenant of Yahveh of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. Hophni and Phinehas were there with it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the Ark came into camp, Israel shouted so loud the earth shook. 6The Philistines heard it, "What does that loud shouting mean in the Hebrews' camp?" When they learned that the Ark of Yahveh had come into camp, 7they were afraid, "God has come into the camp. Nothing like this has ever happened before. 8Who can deliver us from these powerful gods? They're the ones that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues. 9Take courage, Philistines, so you won't become slaves to the Hebrews like they've been to you. Be men and fight!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They fought and defeated Israel, and every man fled home. There was a great massacre; 30,000 of Israel's foot soldiers fell. 11The Philistines captured God's Ark and killed Eli's two sons. 1 The Death of Eli</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A man from Benjamin ran to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 13Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching because he was nervous about the Ark. When the man came into the town with the news, the whole town cried out. 14Eli heard the outcry and asked what it was about. The man hurried over to tell him. 15He was 98 and couldn't see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The man told him, "I fled from the battle today." "How'd it go?" 17"Israel fled. The Philistines have slain a great number, including your two sons, and they've captured the Ark."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When he mentioned the Ark, Eli fell backward off his seat by the gate, broke his neck, and died. He was old and heavy. He'd judged Israel for 40 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> His daughter-in-law, Phinehas's wife, was pregnant. When she heard that the Ark had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor, kneeled, and gave birth. 20About the time she died, the women attending her said, "Don't be afraid; you've had a son." But she didn't respond. 21She named him Ichabod, "The 'glory is gone' from Israel because they've captured God's Ark," and because her father-in-law and husband had died.
