## 1 Samuel Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When David and his men got home to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev, attacked Ziklag, and burned it. 2They took the women captive and everybody in it, big and small, but didn't kill anybody. 3When David and his men got there, it had been burned, and their wives, sons, and daughters had been captured. 4They cried till they couldn't cry anymore. 5David's two wives had been taken, Ahinoam and Abigail. 6In addition, David was distressed because the people were talking about stoning him. They were bitter over losing their sons and daughters, but David took courage in Yahveh his God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He told Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, to bring him the ephod. 8He asked Yahveh, "Should I chase this band? Will I overtake them?" "Yes, you'll overtake them and rescue everyone."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He and his 600 men went to the Brook Besor, where the ones left behind remained. 10But David and 400 men pursued on. 200 stayed behind too exhausted to cross Brook Besor. 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David. They gave him bread and water, 12a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. He ate them and revived. He hadn't eaten or drunk for three days. 13David asked him, "Who do you belong to? Where are you from?" "I'm a young man from Egypt, an Amalekite's slave. My master left me behind when I got sick three days ago. 14We raided the Negev of the Cherethites that belongs to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> David said, "Will you bring me down to this band?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you won't kill me or turn me over to my master, and I'll take you down to them." David Defeats the Amalekites</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When he'd taken him down, they found them spread out all over the ground eating and drinking and dancing because of the large amount of spoil they'd taken from the Philistines and Judah. 17David slaughtered them from twilight till evening the next day. Not a man escaped, except for 400 young men that fled on camels. 18He recovered everything the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives. 19Nothing was missing, big or little, sons or daughters. He brought it all back. 20He'd captured the sheep and cattle the people drove ahead of the other livestock. They said, "This is David's spoil."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> David came to the 200 men at Brook Besor that were too exhausted to go with him. They went out to greet him and the people that were with him. 22Then some ruffians among David's men said, "They didn't go with us. We're not going to give them any of the spoil we've recovered. Every man can take his wife and children."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> David said, "Brothers, don't do that with what Yahveh's given us. He protected us and delivered to us the band that attacked us. 24Who'd listen to you on this? The one that guards the luggage gets the same share as the one that goes to battle."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He made that an ordinance in Israel ever since.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When David got to Ziklag, he sent some spoil to the elders in Judah, his friends, and said, "A gift from the spoils of Yahveh's enemies," 27and to the people in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, Jattir, 28Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 29Racal, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, Kenites, 30Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 31Hebron—everywhere he and his men circulated.
