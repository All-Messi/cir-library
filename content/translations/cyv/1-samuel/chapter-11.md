## 1 Samuel Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Nahash the Ammonite went up to lay siege to Jabesh-gilead. The men there said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we'll serve you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But he said, "I'll make one with you on this condition: I'll gouge out your right eyes so you'll be a disgrace in Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The elders at Jabesh said, "Give us a week so we can send messengers all over Israel. If there's nobody to deliver us, we'll come out to you." 4The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and gave that message for the people; they cried out loud.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen and wondered why the people were crying. When they told him what the men from Jabesh had said, 6the Spirit of God came on him powerfully, and he became angry. 7He cut the yoke of oxen in pieces and sent them all over Israel by messengers, "Whoever doesn't come out after Saul and Samuel will have this happen to his oxen." Dread from Yahveh fell on the people, and they came out united. 8He counted them in Bezek: 300,000 from Israel, 30,000 from Judah. 9They told the messengers, "Tell the people in Jabesh-gilead they'll be delivered by the time the sun's hot tomorrow." The messengers went to tell them; they were relieved. 10They told Nahash, "We'll come out to you tomorrow; you can do to us whatever you want to." 11The next morning Saul put the people in three companies. They attacked the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites till the heat of the day. The survivors scattered till no two were together. The Kingdom Is Renewed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the people said to Samuel, "Who said, 'Will Saul rule us?' Bring them here so we can execute them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Saul said, "We won't execute anybody today. Yahveh delivered Israel today."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Samuel told the people, "Let's go to Gilgal and set up the new kingdom." 15They went and made Saul king in Yahveh's presence. They offered peace offerings, and Saul celebrated with the people. Samuel's Farewell Address</span>
