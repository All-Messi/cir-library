## 1 Samuel Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Nahash the Ammonite went up to lay siege to Jabesh-gilead. The men there said to him, <em>“Make a </em><em>treaty </em><em>with us</em><em>,</em><em> and we’ll serve you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>But he said, <em>“</em><em>I’ll make one</em><em> with you on this condition</em><em>: </em><em>I’ll gouge out </em><em>your</em><em> right </em><em>eyes</em><em> so you’ll be</em><em> a </em><em>disgrace</em><em> </em><em>in</em><em> Israel.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>The elders at Jabesh said, <em>“Give</em><em> us </em><em>a week</em><em> so we can send messengers </em><em>all over</em><em> Israel.</em><em> I</em><em>f there’s nobody to deliver us, we’ll come out to you.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and gave that message for the people; they cried out loud.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen and wondered why<em> </em>the people were<em> </em>crying<em>. </em>When they told him what the men from Jabesh had said, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>the Spirit of God came on him powerfully, and he became angry. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He cut the yoke of oxen in pieces and sent them all over Israel by messengers, <em>“Whoever doesn’t</em><em> come out after Saul and Samuel will </em><em>have this happen to his</em><em> oxen.”</em> Dread from Yahveh fell on the people, and they came out united. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He counted them in Bezek: 300,000 from Israel, 30,000 from Judah. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They told the messengers, <em>“Tell the people in</em><em> Jabesh-gilead</em><em> they’ll be delivered by the time the sun’s hot tomorrow</em><em>.”</em> The messengers went to tell them; they were relieved. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They told<em> Nahash</em>, <em>“W</em><em>e’ll come out to you</em><em> tomorrow; you can do to us whatever you want to</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The next morning Saul put the people in three companies. They attacked the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites till the heat of the day. The survivors scattered till no two were together.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### The Kingdom Is Renewed


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then the people said to Samuel, <em>“Who </em><em>said, ‘Will Saul rule us?’ </em><em>Bring them here so we can </em><em>execute them</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>But Saul said, <em>“</em><em>We won’t execute anybody today. Yahveh</em><em> delivered Israel</em><em> today</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Samuel told the people, <em>“Let’s go to Gilgal and </em><em>set up</em><em> the</em><em> new</em><em> kingdom.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They went and made Saul king in Yahveh’s presence. They offered peace offerings, and Saul celebrated with the people.</span>
