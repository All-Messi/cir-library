## 1 Samuel Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Philistines carried the Ark from Ebenezer to Ashdod 2to Dagon's temple and set it up beside him. 3When people got up early the next morning, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of Yahveh. They put Dagon back in place. 4But when they got up early the next day, he'd fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of Yahveh, and his head and hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only his trunk was left. 5That's why Dagon's priests and everybody that goes in his temple still don't step on his threshold in Ashdod. 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh heavily oppressed the people in Ashdod and around. He terrified them by striking them with tumors. 7When the men in Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The Ark of Israel's God must not stay here. He's heavily oppressing us and our god Dagon." 8They gathered the Philistine lords, "What can we do with it?" "Take it to Gath." So they did, 9but Yahveh oppressed the city and caused a panic. He struck the people, young and old, with tumors. 10They sent it to Ekron. The people there cried out, "They've brought the Ark here to kill us." 11They gathered the lords of the Philistines, "Send it back where it belongs so it won't kill us." A deathly panic gripped the city. God heavily oppressed it. 12People that didn't die developed tumors, and the outcry from the city rose to the sky. 1 The Ark Returns to Israel</span>
