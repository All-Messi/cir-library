## 1 Samuel Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When he’d finished talking to Saul, Jonathan was drawn to David and loved him as himself. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Saul took him that day and didn’t let him go back home. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jonathan made a pact with him because he loved him as himself. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jonathan took off his robe and gave it to him, along with his armor, sword, bow, and belt. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>David went out wherever Saul sent him and was successful. Saul set him over the fighting men. The people and Saul liked that arrangement.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>When David came back from killing the Philistine, the women came out of the towns, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, celebration, and musical instruments. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They sang as they played, <strong>	</strong><em>“Saul has slain his thousands,</em> <em>	David his ten </em><em>thousands</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>It made Saul mad. <em>“They’ve </em><em>attribute</em><em>d</em><em> ten </em><em>thousands</em><em> to David, but </em><em>thousands to me</em><em>.</em><em> W</em><em>hat more can he have but the kingdom?”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He was suspicious of David after that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The next day a tormenting spirit from God came powerfully over Saul, and he raved in the house while David was playing the harp as usual. Saul had a spear in his hand <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and threw it, thinking he’d pin <em>David</em> to the wall, but David dodged him twice. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Saul was afraid of him, because Yahveh was with him, but he’d left Saul. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Saul put him out away from him and appointed him as commander of a thousand.  <em>David</em> came and went with the people. [<strong><sup>14-15</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>All Israel and Judah loved him. <strong>David Marries Saul’s Daughter</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Then Saul told David<em>, “Here is my older </em><em>daughter Merab. I’ll give her to you as a wife. J</em><em>ust be brave for me and fight </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>’s battles.”</em> Saul was thinking, <em>“</em><em>I</em><em> won’</em><em>t be against</em><em> him; the Philistines will.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>David said, <em>“Who am I and </em><em>what is my life or</em><em> my </em><em>father’s </em><em>family in Israel, </em><em>that I should be the king</em><em>’s son-in-law</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>At the time she would have been given to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David. They told Saul, and he liked that. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He thought, <em>“I’ll give her to him </em><em>as</em><em> a snare</em><em>. T</em><em>he Philistines will </em><em>oppose</em><em> him.”</em> Saul told David a second time, <em>“You</em><em> can</em><em> be my son-in-law</em><em> today</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He told his men, <em>“Tell David privately, ‘The king </em><em>likes you, and we do too. G</em><em>o ahead and become </em><em>his</em><em> son-in-law.’”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Saul’s men told David that privately, he said, <em>“Does it seem </em><em>trivial </em><em>to you to become the king’s son-in-law</em><em>?</em><em> I’m a poor man with no reputation</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Saul’s men reported what David said. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Saul said, <em>“Tell </em><em>him the only</em><em> </em><em>dowry I want</span>

### Philistine foreskins to avenge me of my enemies.” Saul thought he’d get David killed by the Philistines. 26When his men told David, he was glad to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline, 27David along with his men went and killed 200 Philistines and brought their foreskins to the king. So Saul gave him Michal. 28But when Saul saw that Yahveh was with him and all Israel loved him, 29he was more afraid of him and became his constant enemy.


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>The commanders of the Philistines kept attacking. As often as they did, David had more success than any other officer Saul had; so he was greatly respected.</span>
