### men on the outskirts of Gibeah around the pomegranate tree in Migron. 3Among Saul’s men was Ahijah wearing an ephod—Ben-Ahitub (Ichabod’s brother) Ben-Phinehas Ben-Eli, Yahveh’s priest at Shiloh. The people didn’t know Jonathan had gone. 4Between the passes Jonathan was planning to use to cross over to the Philistines outpost, there were steep cliffs on two sides named Bozez and Seneh. 5One went up to the north toward Michmash, the other one on the south toward Geba.   	1 Sam 14:1-5


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Jonathan said to his armor bearer, <em>“L</em><em>et’s </em><em>go over to tho</em><em>se uncircumcised</em><em> </em>Philistines<em>.</em><em> </em><em>M</em><em>aybe Yahveh will work for us. He’</em><em>s not </em><em>limited</em><em> to </em><em>saving</em><em> by man</em><em>y or </em><em>few.</em><em>” </em><sup> </sup> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Do</em><em> what</em><em> y</em><em>ou want</em><em>.</em><em> I’m </em><em>with you.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Jonathan said, <em>“We’ll </em><em>go</em><em> let them know we’re here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> they say, ‘Wait till we come to you,’ we’ll </em><em>stay put</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> they say, ‘Come</em><em> on</em><em> up,’ we’ll go up</em><em>. Yahveh will</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> them to us.</em><em> </em><em>That will be our sign.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>When they let the outpost know they were there, they said, <em>“The Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they’ve been hiding.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The men in the outpost shouted, <em>“Come </em><em>on </em><em>up</em><em>! W</em><em>e’ll </em><em>show you a thing or two!</em><em>”</em><em> </em>Jonathan told his armor bearer, <em>“Come </em><em>on; Yahveh will</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> them to Israel.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armor bearer behind him, and they fell to Jonathan. His armor bearer killed some behind him. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>That first slaughter was</span>

### men on a half-acre. 15There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among the people. Even the garrison and raiding parties trembled, and the ground shook.     	1 Sam 14:6-15


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah saw the camp scattering, running here and there. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Saul told the people with him, <em>“Count </em><em>and see who’</em><em>s not here.”</em> They counted, and Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Saul said to Ahijah, <em>“Bring </em><em>God’s A</em><em>rk here.”</em><em> </em>At that time, it was with the people in Israel. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>While he was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew, so Saul told the priest not to worry about it then<em>.</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Saul and his people rallied and joined the battle. The Philistines were killing one another in total chaos. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Hebrews that had been going around with the Philistine camp joined the people with Saul and Jonathan. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When people hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also chased them in the battle. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Yahveh delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread past Beth-aven.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Saul’s Rash Vow


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>The men in Israel were totally exhausted because Saul had put them under oath, <em>“Accursed is the man that eat</em><em>s before evening, until I’</em><em>ve avenged myself of my enemies.”</em> So nobody had eaten anything. <strong><sup>25-</sup></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When they went into the forest, they’d found honeycomb on the ground, but nobody put any in his mouth out of respect for the oath. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Jonathan hadn’t heard about his father’s oath. He dipped the end of his staff in the honeycomb, and put some in his mouth, and he was refreshed. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>One of the people said, <em>“Your father strictly put the people un</em><em>der oath, ‘T</em><em>he man that eat</em><em>s</em><em> today</em><em> is under a curse</em><em>.’”</em> The people were exhausted. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Jonathan said, <em>“My father has </em><em>created a problem. See</em><em> how </em><em>I’ve been refreshed</em><em> because I tasted a little of this honey.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>How</em><em> much more if the people had eaten freely from the spoil</em><em>s</em><em>!</em><em> As it is,</em><em> the s</em><em>laughter among the Philistines w</em><em>asn’t </em><em>that</em><em> great.”</em><em> </em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>	  </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 14:24-30</p>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were completely exhausted. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>After dark, they rushed ravenously on the spoil, butchered sheep, cattle, and calves on the ground, and ate them with the blood. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>People told Saul, “<em>They’re </em><em>sinning against </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> by eating </em>meat <em>with the blood.”</em> He said, <em>“You’ve acted deviously. R</em><em>oll a large rock to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> out among the people and tell them</em><em> to b</em><em>ring </em><em>thei</em><em>r ox or sheep</em><em>, butcher it here and eat. D</em><em>on’t sin by eating </em>the meat <em>with the blood.’” </em><em> </em> The people that night brought their cattle or sheep and butchered them there. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Saul built an altar to Yahveh, his first. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 14:31-35</p>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>Then Saul said, <em>“Let’s go down after the Philistines at night and take spoil </em><em>till daylight. Don’t </em><em>leave </em><em>one survivor</em><em>.”</em> They said, <em>“Do what </em><em>you like</em><em>.”</em> So the priests said, <em>“Let’s draw near to God here.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>Saul asked God, <em>“Should we</em><em> go down after the Philistines?</em><em> </em><em>Will you give </em><em>them </em><em>to Israel?”</em><em> </em>But he didn’t answer him that day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“</em><em>Come here</em><em>, you chiefs of th</em><em>e people, and find out</em><em> how this sin happened today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> </em><em>sure as Yahveh</em><em> lives who delivers Israel, even if it’s Jonathan, he’ll die.”</em> But none of the people answered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>Then he said to them, <em>“You’</em><em>re </em><em>on one side</em><em>; </em><em>Jonathan and I </em><em>are</em><em> on the other.”</em><em> </em> The people said, <em>“Do what </em><em>you like</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Saul told Yahveh, <em>“Give a </em><em>clear answer</em><em>.”</em> The lot fell on Jonathan and Saul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“Cast lots between me and Jonathan.”</em><em> </em>The lot fell on Jonathan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>He said to Jonathan, <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hat </em><em>did you do?</em><em>”</em> Jonathan told him, <em>“I tasted </em><em>some</em><em> honey with the end of my staff.</em><em> </em><em>So</em><em> kill me</em><em>!”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“God do this to</em><em> me and more also because you’ll surely</em><em> die, Jonathan.”</em><em> </em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>But the people said to Saul, <em>“</em><em>Does </em><em>Jonathan </em><em>have to </em><em>die who brought about this great deliverance?</em><em> </em><em>Far from it!</em><em> </em><em>As</em><em> sure as</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground</em><em>;</em><em> he’s worked with God today.”</em><em> </em> The people rescued him. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Saul quit chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went home.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
