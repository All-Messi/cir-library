### ,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. (3His wife Abigail was intelligent and beautiful, but he was harsh and rude in his dealings, a descendant of Caleb.) 2bWhile he was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 4David heard about it in the open country. 5He sent ten young men and told them, “Go to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name. 6Say, ‘Have a long life, peace to you, your household, and everybody you have. 7I’ve heard you have shearers. Your shepherds have been with us, and we’ve not insulted them or taken anything from them the whole time they were in Carmel. 8Ask your young men and they’ll tell you. So be gracious to my young men; we’ve come on a festive day. Please give Whatever you have on hand please give to them and to me.’” 	       	1 Sam 25:1-8


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>When David’s young men came, they told Nabal everything in David’s name and waited. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But Nabal answered, <em>“Who’s David?

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>One of the young men told Abigail, <em>“David sent messengers from the </em><em>countryside</em><em> to greet our master, and he scorned them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> the men were</em><em> good to us. They didn’t</em><em> insult</em><em> us or take</em><em> anything as we went a</em><em>round with them on the open range</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> </em><em>were a wall to us day and</em><em> night the whol</em><em>e time we tended</em><em> sheep</em><em> together</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Think</em><em> what you should do; </em>David<em>’s planning to do something bad</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>our master and his household.</em><em> Nabal is</em><em> such a worthless </em><em>fellow</em><em> nobody can talk to him.”</em><em>	             </em> <em>	 </em></span>

### loaves of bread, 2 wineskins of wine, 5 sheep already fixed, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. 19She told her young men, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow.” She didn’t tell her husband. 20As she was riding her donkey down under cover of the mountain, she met David and his men. 21David had said, “For nothing I’ve guarded everything this man has on the open range so that he hasn’t missed anything. He’s paid me bad for good. 22God do so to me and more if by morning I leave him one male alive.”	 1 Sam 25:18-22 23-24When Abigail saw him, she hurried and dismounted. She fell on her face at his feet, bowed to the ground, and said, “Put the blame on me, my lord. Please let me speak to you. 25Don’t pay any attention to this worthless fellow; he’s like his name Nabal, ‘a foolish man.’ I didn’t see the young men you sent. 26As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, since he’s restrained you from shedding blood to avenge yourself, may your enemies be like Nabal. 27Give this gift to the young men. 28Please forgive my sin. Yahveh will certainly make an enduring dynasty for you because you’re fighting his battles. There won’t be anything bad in you your whole life. 29If anybody attacks you, you’ll be in the bundle of the living with Yahveh your God. He’ll throw out the lives of your enemies as from the cup in a sling. 30When he keeps his promise and appoints you ruler over Israel, 31what’s happened won’t cause you grief for having shed blood unnecessarily to avenge yourself. When Yahveh deals well with you, remember me.”  	  1 Sam 25:23-31


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>David told Abigail, <em>“Bl</em><em>ess Yahveh God of Israel, </em><em>who sent you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Bless</em><em> </em><em>you for </em><em>your </em><em>discretion. You’</em><em>ve ke</em><em>pt me from shedding blood to avenge</em><em> myself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Nevertheless,<em> as</em><em> sure as</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh lives, who</em><em> </em><em>kept</em><em> me from harming you, </em><em>if</em><em> you</em><em> hadn’t</em><em> come </em><em>so soon</em><em>, </em><em>I wouldn’</em><em>t have </em><em>left Nabal one male</em><em> </em><em>by morning</em><em>.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>David accepted what she’d brought. <em>“Go </em><em>home</em><em> </em><em>on good terms</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve </em><em>done what you asked</em><em>.”</em><strong>	  </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 25:32-35</p>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>She went to Nabal. He was holding a feast in his house, celebrating like a king. He was half drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything till morning. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>When he’d sobered up, she told him everything. His heart died; he became like a stone. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Some ten days later, Yahveh struck him, and he died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>When David heard Nabal was dead, he said, <em>“Bless Yahveh, who</em><em> pleaded the cause of </em><em>his insult to me, and kept me</em><em> from </em><em>doing something bad</em><em>.</em><em> Yahveh</em><em> has </em><em>brought his</em><em> </em><em>wrong</em><em>doing </em><em>back </em><em>on hi</em><em>m</em><em>.”</em> Then David sent a proposal to Abigail to be his wife. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>When his servants came to her at Carmel, they said, <em>“David </em><em>has sent us to you to take you</em><em> as his wife.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong>She got up and bowed to the ground, <em>“</em><em>I’ll</em><em> wash </em><em>his servants’ feet</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>She got up quick and rode a donkey with her five maids attending her. She followed David’s messengers and became his wife. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel; they both became his wives. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti Ben-Laish from Gallim.</span>
