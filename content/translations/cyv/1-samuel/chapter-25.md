## 1 Samuel Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Samuel died and Israel gathered to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. David and Abigail David went down to the Wilderness of Paran. 2aA man named Nabal in Maon had a business in Carmel. He was really rich with 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. (3His wife Abigail was intelligent and beautiful, but he was harsh and rude in his dealings, a descendant of Caleb.) 2bWhile he was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 4David heard about it in the open country. 5He sent ten young men and told them, "Go to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name. 6Say, 'Have a long life, peace to you, your household, and everybody you have. 7I've heard you have shearers. Your shepherds have been with us, and we've not insulted them or taken anything from them the whole time they were in Carmel. 8Ask your young men and they'll tell you. So be gracious to my young men; we've come on a festive day. Please give Whatever you have on hand please give to them and to me.'" 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When David's young men came, they told Nabal everything in David's name and waited. 10But Nabal answered, "Who's David? Who's Jesse's son? Lots of servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 11Am I supposed to take my bread, water, and meat that I've butchered for my shearers, and give it to men I don't know?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> David's young men retraced their steps and told him what Nabal said. 13David told them to put on their swords. David put on his sword, and about 400 men went up behind him while 200 stayed with the baggage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> One of the young men told Abigail, "David sent messengers from the countryside to greet our master, and he scorned them. 15Yet the men were good to us. They didn't insult us or take anything as we went around with them on the open range. 16They were a wall to us day and night the whole time we tended sheep together. 17Think what you should do; David's planning to do something bad to our master and his household. Nabal is such a worthless fellow nobody can talk to him." 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Abigail hurried and loaded donkeys with 200 loaves of bread, 2 wineskins of wine, 5 sheep already fixed, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. 19She told her young men, "Go on ahead; I'll follow." She didn't tell her husband. 20As she was riding her donkey down under cover of the mountain, she met David and his men. 21David had said, "For nothing I've guarded everything this man has on the open range so that he hasn't missed anything. He's paid me bad for good. 22God do so to me and more if by morning I leave him one male alive." 23-24When Abigail saw him, she hurried and dismounted. She fell on her face at his feet, bowed to the ground, and said, "Put the blame on me, my lord. Please let me speak to you. 25Don't pay any attention to this worthless fellow; he's like his name Nabal, 'a foolish man.' I didn't see the young men you sent. 26As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, since he's restrained you from shedding blood to avenge yourself, may your enemies be like Nabal. 27Give this gift to the young men. 28Please forgive my sin. Yahveh will certainly make an enduring dynasty for you because you're fighting his battles. There won't be anything bad in you your whole life. 29If anybody attacks you, you'll be in the bundle of the living with Yahveh your God. He'll throw out the lives of your enemies as from the cup in a sling. 30When he keeps his promise and appoints you ruler over Israel, 31what's happened won't cause you grief for having shed blood unnecessarily to avenge yourself. When Yahveh deals well with you, remember me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> David told Abigail, "Bless Yahveh God of Israel, who sent you. 33Bless you for your discretion. You've kept me from shedding blood to avenge myself. 34Nevertheless, as sure as Yahveh lives, who kept me from harming you, if you hadn't come so soon, I wouldn't have left Nabal one male by morning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> David accepted what she'd brought. "Go home on good terms. I've done what you asked."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> She went to Nabal. He was holding a feast in his house, celebrating like a king. He was half drunk, so she didn't tell him anything till morning. 37When he'd sobered up, she told him everything. His heart died; he became like a stone. 38Some ten days later, Yahveh struck him, and he died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When David heard Nabal was dead, he said, "Bless Yahveh, who pleaded the cause of his insult to me, and kept me from doing something bad. Yahveh has brought his wrongdoing back on him." Then David sent a proposal to Abigail to be his wife. 40When his servants came to her at Carmel, they said, "David has sent us to you to take you as his wife." 41She got up and bowed to the ground, "I'll wash his servants' feet." 42She got up quick and rode a donkey with her five maids attending her. She followed David's messengers and became his wife. 43David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel; they both became his wives. 44Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti Ben-Laish from Gallim.
