### Saul Kills the Priests at Nob


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the hill with spear in hand and his officers standing about him. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“</em><em>Listen, you Benjam</em><em>ites.</em><em> </em><em>Will Jesse</em><em>’s son give </em><em>you fields and vineyards?</em><em> </em><em>Will he make you commanders of thou</em><em>sands and </em><em>hundreds </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>th</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>you’ve plotted</em><em> against me?</em><em> </em><em>Nobody lets me know when my son teams up with</em><em> </em><em>Jesse</em><em>’s son.
