## 1 Samuel Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The people of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah and said, <em>“Isn’t David hiding on the H</em><em>ill of Hachilah east of Jeshimon?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Saul went down to the Wilderness of Ziph</span>
<p class="section-ref">with 3</p>

### ,000 chosen men to look for him. 3He camped on the Hill of Hachilah beside the road east of Jeshimon. David was staying in the open country. When he saw that Saul had come after him, 4he sent out spies to make sure that Saul was coming. 5He went to where Saul and his men had camped and saw where he lay beside Abner Ben-Ner, his general. The army was asleep around him.


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai Ben-Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, <em>“Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?”</em><em> </em>Abishai said, <em>“I’ll go.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They went down at night. Saul was sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 26:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Abishai told David, <em>“God has delivered your enemy to you.</em><em> </em><em>Let me strike him with the spea</em><em>r to the ground with one stroke.</em><em> I won’t strike him a second time.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>But David said, <em>“Don’t destroy him. W</em><em>ho can </em><em>kill</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh’s anointed and not be guilty? </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> </em><em>sure as Yahveh</em><em> lives, he’ll strike him, or </em><em>he’ll</em><em> die, or he’ll go down in battle.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Yahveh</em><em> </em><em>forbid that I should </em><em>kill him. T</em><em>ake the spear by his head and the jug of water, and let’s go.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>David left with the spear and jug. Nobody saw or knew anything. Nobody woke up. A sound sleep from Yahveh had fallen on them all.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 26:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>David crossed back over to the other side and stood on top of the hill a good way off. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He shouted to the army and to Abner, <em>“Won’t</em><em> you answer, Abner?”</em> Abner said, <em>“Who are you</em><em>, shouting</em><em> to the king?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>David asked him<em>, </em> <em>“Aren’t you a man?</em><em> </em><em>Who is like you in Israel?</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>not</em><em> </em><em>protect</em><em> the king?</em><em> Someone</em><em> came </em><em>over </em><em>to d</em><em>estroy him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> you’ve done isn’t good. As sure as Yahveh lives, you all need to die; you didn’t protect Yahveh’s anointed. See the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head.”</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 26:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Saul recognized David’s voice, <em>“Is that you, my son?” </em> <em> </em>David said,<em> </em> <em>“It’s me, my lord the king. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Why</em><em> are you chasing me? What have I done? </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> Yahveh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it’s people, they’re accursed by Yahveh because they’ve driven me out from Yahveh’s inheritance and told me to go serve other gods. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> let my blood fall to the ground away from Yahveh’s presence. You’ve come out to look for a single flea, like somebody hunting a partridge in the hills.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“I’ve sinned.</em><em> </em><em>Go</em><em> on</em><em> </em>back home<em>.</em><em> I</em><em> won’t try to </em><em>harm you again because </em><em>you’ve valued </em><em>my life today.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve played the fool and </em><em>made</em><em> a serious </em><em>mistake</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>David answered, <em>“The </em><em>king’s </em><em>spear!</em><em> </em><em>Have one of the young men come and get it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Yahveh </em><em>will repay each man for his </em><em>goodness</em><em> </em><em>and faithfulness. He delivered you to me</em><em>, </em><em>and</em><em> I refused to </em><em>reach out against you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> </em><em>I highly valued </em><em>your life today, so </em><em>may Yahveh highly value </em><em>my life and deliver me from all distress.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Saul said, <em>“Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’re blessed, son. Y</em><em>ou’</em><em>ll accomplish a lot and certain</em><em>ly </em><em>end up winning</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> David went on his way, and Saul went home.<strong>	  </strong></span>
