## 1 Samuel Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Saul told Jonathan and his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan really delighted in David. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He told David, <em>“My father is trying to </em><em>get you killed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Be on guard in the morning</em><em>. Hide</em><em> in a private place.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> go out and stand beside </em><em>him</em><em> in the field where you are and </em><em>talk</em><em> about you.</em><em> </em><em>If I find </em><em>out </em><em>anything out, I’ll tell you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul, <em>“Don’t sin against </em><em>David. H</em><em>e hasn’t sinned against you</em><em>;</em><em> what he’</em><em>s done has</em><em> benefited you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> took his life in </em><em>his </em><em>hand</em><em>s</em><em> and struck the Philistine, and </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> brought about a great deliverance for Israel.</em><em> </em><em>You saw it and were happy.</em><em> </em><em>Why sin against innocen</em><em>t blood by putting him to death</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Saul listened and swore, <em>“As surely Yahveh lives, I won’</em><em>t </em><em>do it</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Then Jonathan called David and told him. He brought David to Saul, and he was with him like before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>When<strong> </strong>war arose again, David went out and massacred the Philistines. They fled from him. <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>A tormenting spirit from Yahveh came on Saul as he was sitting at home with his spear in hand. David was playing his harp. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he dodged, and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped that night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Saul sent troops to David’s house to watch him and put him to death in the morning. But David’s wife Michal told him, <em>“</em><em>If you don’t</em><em> save your life tonight, you’ll be </em><em>killed</em><em> </em><em>tomorrow.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>She let David down through the window, and he got away. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>She took the household idol and laid it on the bed; she put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head and covered it with blankets. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When Saul troops arrived, she said, <em>“He’s sick.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Saul sent troops back, saying, <em>“Bring him to me on his bed so I can put him to death.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When they went in, the household idol was on the bed with the pillow of goats’ hair under its head. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Saul asked Michal, <em>“Why </em><em>did you lie to</em><em> me and let my enemy escape?”</em><em> </em>Michal said, <em>“He </em><em>told</em><em> me, ‘Let me go!</em><em> </em><em>Why should I </em><em>kill </em><em>you?</em><em>’</em><em>”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>David escaped to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went to stay in Naioth. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Saul heard that David was at Naioth in Ramah. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He sent troops to take him, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on them and they prophesied too. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When Saul learned about it, he sent some other troops, and <u>they</u> prophesied. He sent troops a third time, and <u>they</u> prophesied. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Then Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big well in Secu and asked where Samuel and David were.<em> </em>One person said, <em>“They’re at Naioth in Ramah.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He went on to Naioth, and the Spirit of God came on him. As he went, <u>he</u> kept prophesying till he got to Naioth. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He, too, stripped off his clothes and prophesied in Samuel’s presence; he lay naked all day and all night. That’s why people say, <em>“Is Saul</em><em> among the prophets</em><em> too</em><em>?”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
