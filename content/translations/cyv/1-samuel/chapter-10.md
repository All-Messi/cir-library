## 1 Samuel Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Samuel took a vial of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, and kissed him, <em>“Has</em><em>n’</em><em>t </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> anointed you to </em><em>rule</em><em> his people?</em><em> </em><em>You’ll save </em><em>Israel</em><em> from t</em><em>heir enemies round about. T</em><em>his will be the sign that </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has anointed you</em><em> ruler over</em><em> his heritage.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> you leave me </em><em>today,</em><em> you’ll meet two men by Rachel’s tomb in Benjamin at Zelzah</em><em>. T</em><em>hey’ll say, ‘The donkeys you went to </em><em>look</em><em> </em><em>they’ve</em><em> found</em><em>.</em><em> N</em><em>ow your father has stopped </em><em>caring</em><em> about the</em><em>m</em><em> and is worrying about you, “What </em><em>am I going to</em><em> do about my son?”</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ll</em><em> go on </em><em>to the O</em><em>ak of Tabor.</em><em> Three</em><em> men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying </em><em>three</em><em> kids, another carrying </em><em>three</em><em> loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> greet you and give you </em><em>two</em><em> loaves of bread</em><em>; accept them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>After</em><em> that</em><em>,</em><em> you’ll come to Gibea</em><em>h-elohim, where the Philistine outpost is</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>As you come to the </em><em>town</em><em>, you’ll meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place</em><em>, prophesying</em><em> </em><em>behind</em><em> a </em><em>harp,</em><em> </em><em>tambourine, flute, and lyre</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>S</em><em>pirit of </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> will come on you powerfully, and y</em><em>ou’ll prophesy with them and become </em><em>another man.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>hen</em><em> these signs meet you, do whatever you find to do, because God is with you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> down to Gilgal ahead of me.</em><em> I’ll come</em><em> to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings.</em><em> </em><em>Wait </em><em>for a week</em><em> till I come and show you what to do.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>When he turned to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and those signs happened that day. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When they got to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God stirred him powerfully, and he prophesied with them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When everybody that knew him before saw how he prophesied with them, they said to one another, <em>“What has come over Kish</em><em>’s son</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Is Saul among the prophets</em><em> too</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>A man at that place answered, <em>“W</em><em>ho is their father?”</em><em> </em>It became a saying, <em>“Is Saul among the prophets</em><em> too</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, <em>“</em><em>Where’</em><em>d you go?”</em> <em>“To look for the donkeys.</em><em> </em><em>When we </em><em>couldn’t find them</em><em>, we went to Samuel.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>W</em><em>hat</em><em> </em><em>did he</em><em> </em><em>tell you?</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>T</em><em>hat</em><em> the</em><em>y’</em><em>d been found.”</em><em> </em>He didn’t tell him anything Samuel said about the kingdom.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Sam 10:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Samuel called the people to Yahveh at Mizpah <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and told them, <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>God of Israel, says,</em><em> ‘I brought you out of Egypt and</em><em> delivered you from the Egyptians and t</em><em>he kingdoms that oppressed</em><em> you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> today you’ve rejected </em><em>the</em><em> God who saved you from your calamities and distresses</em><em>. Y</em><em>ou’ve said, ‘No</em><em>, install</em><em> a king over us.’</em><em> P</em><em>resent yourselves </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> by tribes and by thousands.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Samuel brought the tribes forward, and Benjamin was taken by lot. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He brought Benjamin forward by families, and the Matrite family was taken by lot. Finally, he brought the Matrite family forward one by one, and Saul Ben-Kish was taken by lot. But they couldn’t find him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>They asked Yahveh again, <em>“Did the man come here?”</em> Yahveh said, <em>“He</em><em> hid </em><em>in</em><em> the </em><em>baggage.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They ran and got him. When he stood among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Samuel said to the people, <em>“</em><em>S</em><em>ee w</em><em>ho Yahveh has chosen? There’</em><em>s none like him among </em><em>you</em><em>.”</em> The people shouted, <em>“Long live the king!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Samuel told them the rights and duties of kings. He wrote them in a scroll and laid it up in Yahveh’s presence and sent everyone home. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Saul went to his home in Gibeah, and brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But some worthless fellows said, <em>“How can this fellow</em><em> save us?”</em><em> </em>They scorned him and wouldn’t bring him a gift, but he didn’t react to them.<strong>	  </strong></span>
