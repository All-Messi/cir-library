## 1 Samuel Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Saul came back from chasing the Philistines, he heard that David was in the Wilderness of En-gedi. 2Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all over Israel and went to look for him and his men at the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 3He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave, and went in to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 4David's men said, "This is the day Yahveh told you he'd deliver your enemy to you." David got up and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. 5Afterward, his conscience bothered him over it. 6He told his men, "Yahveh forbid that I should reach out against his anointed." 7He dissuaded them with that comment and didn't let them attack Saul. Saul got up and left the cave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Afterward David went out and yelled, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground and prostrated himself. 9He said, "Why listen to people that say I'm trying to harm you? 10You've seen that Yahveh delivered you to me today. Some said to kill you, but I took pity on you and wouldn't reach out against Yahveh's anointed. 11Now, father, look at the hem of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off its edge and didn't kill you, know that I'm not leading a rebellion. I haven't sinned against you even though you're lying in wait to kill me. 12Yahveh judge between us. May he avenge me on you, but I won't oppose you. 13As the ancient proverb says, 'Sinfulness comes from the sinful.' I won't oppose you. 14What did you come out against? A dead dog? A single flea? 15Let Yahveh decide between us. May he argue my case and deliver me from you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When David finished, Saul said, "Is that you, David my son? 17You're better than I am. You've been good to me while I've been bad to you. 18You've declared that you've done good to me, that Yahveh delivered me to you, but you didn't kill me. 19If someone finds his enemy, will he let him get away? May Yahveh reward you with good for what you've done today. 20I know you'll be king, and the kingdom will be firmly under your rule. 21Swear to me by Yahveh that you won't kill my descendants or destroy my name from my father's family."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> David swore to him, and he went home. David and his men went up to the stronghold. 1 The Death of Samuel</span>
