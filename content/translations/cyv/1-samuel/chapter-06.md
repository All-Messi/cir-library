## 1 Samuel Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh's Ark was in Philistine territory for seven months. 2They called for the priests and fortunetellers, "What should we do with it? Tell us how to send it back." 3"Send it back with a guilt offering to Israel's God. You'll be healed, and you'll find out why he keeps working against you." 4"What guilt offering should we send him?" "Five gold tumors and five gold mice, to match the number of Philistine lords. The same plague has struck you and your lords. 5So make images of your tumors and the mice that are ravaging the land and honor Israel's God. Maybe he'll lighten his oppression on you, your gods, and your land. 6Why harden your hearts like Pharaoh and the Egyptians did? After he'd mocked them, didn't they end up letting the people go? 7Build a new cart and take two milk cows that have never worn a yoke. Yoke them to the cart but take their calves away from them. 8Put the Ark on the cart. In a box beside it put the gold figurines you're returning to him as a guilt offering. Send it off, and 9watch it. If it goes on the road to Beth-shemesh in its own land, he's the one that has done us this great harm. If not, we'll know it happened by chance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They yoked two milk cows to the cart, shut up their calves at home, 11and put the Ark on the cart along with a box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors. 12The cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along one road without veering off, bawling as they went. The lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the outskirts of Beth-shemesh. 13The people there were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed. 14It came and stopped in a field that belonged to Joshua of Beth-shemesh. There was a large rock there. They split up the wood from the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Yahveh. 15Levites took down the Ark and the box and set them on the large rock. The men of Beth-shemesh offered sacrifices and burnt offerings that day. 16The five lords of the Philistines saw it and went back to Ekron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> As a guilt offering to Yahveh, the Philistines returned one gold tumor each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 18The gold mice matched the number of fortified towns and unwalled villages that belonged to the five Philistine lords. The large rock they set the Ark by is still a witness in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh killed 70 men from Beth-shemesh because they looked in the Ark. The people mourned because he'd killed so many. 20Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who can stand against this holy God? Who will go up when he leaves us?" 21They sent messengers to Kiriath-jearim, "The Philistines have brought back the Ark of Yahveh. Come down and get it."</span>
