## 1 Samuel Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan, "What have I done? What am I guilty of? What sin did I commit to make your father try to kill me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, "Far from it! You're not going to die. My father doesn't do anything big or small without letting me know. Why would he keep that from me? It's not so."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But David answered, "Your father knows we're friends and thinks, 'Don't let Jonathan find this out so it won't grieve him.' But as sure as Yahveh lives and you live, there's just a step between me and death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jonathan said, "I'll do for you whatever you say."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> David said, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should sit at table with the king, but let me go so I can hide in the field till the evening of the third day. 6If he misses me, say, 'David earnestly asked my permission to run to Bethlehem, his town; there's a yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.' 7If he says, 'Good!' it'll be well with me. But if he's angry, then know that he intends to do something bad. 8Deal graciously with me; you've brought me into a sacred pact with you. But if I've done anything wrong, kill me yourself. Why take me to your father?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jonathan said, "I'd never do that! If I knew that he's determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> David asked, "How will I know if your father is angry?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jonathan said, "Let's go out to the field."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jonathan told David, "Yahveh God of Israel is witness! When I've sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day, if he's well disposed toward you, won't I send and let you know? 13But if he wants to harm you, Yahveh do so to me and more if I don't let you know so you can get away. Yahveh be with you as he's been with my father. 14If I'm still alive, show me Yahveh's enduring love so I won't die. 15Don't remove your loyalty from my house permanently. When Yahveh gets rid of every enemy of yours, 16don't remove my name from your house. May Yahveh take vengeance on your enemies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jonathan told him, "Tomorrow is a new moon. He'll miss you because your seat will be empty. 19On the third day, he'll miss you for sure. Then go to where you hid when the matter was in hand and stay beside that rock pile over there. 20I'll shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I was shooting at a target. 21I'll send the boy and say, 'Go find the arrows.' If I tell him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then come because as sure as Yahveh lives, it's safe. 22But if I tell him, 'Look, the arrows are on past you,' then leave; Yahveh is sending you away. 23On the promises we've made, Yahveh stands with you and me permanently." 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat. 25He sat by the wall as usual. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David's place was empty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Saul didn't say anything that day because he thought, "Something's happened. He's not clean; surely that's it." 27But the second day, the day after the new moon, David's place was empty. Saul asked Jonathan, "Why hasn't Jesse's son come to the meal yesterday or today?" 1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jonathan answered him, "David earnestly asked me to let him go to Bethlehem. 29He said, 'Our family is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother insisted that I be there. If I'm pleasing to you, let me get away to see my brothers.' That's why he's not at the king's table."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Saul's anger flared at Jonathan, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, don't I know you've chosen Jesse's son to your own shame and the shame of your mother's nakedness? 31As long as he's alive, you and your kingdom will neither one be secure. Send and bring him to me. He has to die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then Jonathan answered Saul, "Why put him to death? What's he done?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Saul threw his spear at him. So Jonathan knew he was determined to kill David. 34Jonathan got up from the table mad and didn't eat anything the second day of the month because he grieved for David. His father had put him down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The next morning, Jonathan and a boy went out to the field to the appointment with David. 36He told the boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow past him. 37When the boy came to where Jonathan had shot the arrow, he called after the boy, "Isn't the arrow on past you?" 38Jonathan called after the boy, "Hurry." So he gathered up the arrows and came back to him. 39But he didn't know anything; only Jonathan and David knew. 40Jonathan gave the boy his weapons and told him to take them into town. 41As soon as he'd gone, David got up from beside the rock pile and fell on his face and bowed three times. They kissed one another and cried till David composed himself. 42Then Jonathan said, "Goodbye. we've sworn loyalty to one another in Yahveh's name, 'He will always be with you and me, with your descendants and mine.'" He got up and left, and Jonathan went into town. David and the Bread of the Presence</span>
