## Amos Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "For three sins of Moab and for four, I won't hold back its punishment: they burned the king of Edom's bones into lime.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> So I'll burn the fortresses in Kerioth; Moab will die amid turmoil, war cries, and bugle blasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll eliminate judges from him and slay his officials with him." God's Judgment on Judah and Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh says, "For three sins of Judah and for four, I won't hold back its punishment: they rejected the Law of Yahveh and didn't keep his statutes. The same lies have led them astray that their ancestors followed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So I'll send down fire on Judah and burn the fortresses in Jerusalem."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh says, "For three sins of Israel and for four, I won't hold back its punishment: they sell the good for money, the poor for a pair of shoes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They walk on the heads of the poor in the dust and abandon those who are suffering. A man and his father sleep with the same girl to profane my holy name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They lie down beside every altar on cloaks taken as pledges. In God's Temple they drink the wine of the people they've fined. 9"Yet I was the One that destroyed the Amorites for you, though they were as tall as cedars and strong as oaks. I destroyed their fruit above and their roots below.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I was the One that brought you up from Egypt, and led you in the desert for 40 years to take over the land of the Amorites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then I raised up some of your offspring to be prophets and some of your young men to be Nazirites. Isn't that so, Israel? 12"But you made Nazirites drink wine and told prophets not to prophesy!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll weigh you down like a wagon overloaded with bundles,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The swift won't be able to flee; the strong will lose their strength; the powerful won't save their lives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The archers won't stand their ground; the swift won't escape; the cavalry won't save themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The bravest among the troops will drop their weapons and run when that time comes." Witnesses Summoned Against Israel</span>
