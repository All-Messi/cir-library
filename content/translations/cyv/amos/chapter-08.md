## Amos Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Lord Yahveh showed me a basket of ripe fruit. 2"What do you see, Amos?" "A basket of ripe fruit." "My people Israel are also ripe—for punishment. I won't spare them any longer. 3The singing at the palace will turn into wailing. There'll be lots of corpses silently thrown out everywhere."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Listen to this, you that run over the needy and trample on the humble, 5saying, "When's the new moon going to be over so we can buy grain? When will the Sabbath be past so we can open the wheat market, make the bushel smaller, the shekel heavier, and cheat with dishonest scales;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> so we can buy the helpless for money and the poor for a pair of shoes, and sell the chaff with the wheat?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yahveh has sworn by Jacob's arrogance, "I'll never forget what they've done. 8"Because of it, won't the land quake and everybody in it mourn? It will swell up like the Nile, flood all over, and recede.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, I'll make the sun go down at noon and make the earth dark in broad daylight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll turn your festivals into mourning and your singing into funeral chants. I'll put burlap around everybody's waist and make every head bald, like the mourning for an only son; the end will be a bitter day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The Lord Yahveh says. "The time's coming when I'll send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread and water, but a famine of hearing from Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> People will stagger from sea to sea, from north to east, here to there, looking for a message from Yahveh, but not finding any.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> At that time, beautiful virgins and strong young men will faint from thirst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The ones that swear by the guilt of Samaria, who say, 'As your god lives, Dan,' 'As the way to Beersheba lives'— will fall and never get up." A Vision of the Lord by the Altar</span>
