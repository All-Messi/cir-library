## Amos Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits those of you at ease in Zion, who feel secure in Samaria, you notable leaders of that foremost nation that the House of Israel comes to.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Go over to Calneh and look at what happened there; go from there to Hamath the great city; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than those kingdoms? Is their territory bigger than yours?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Are you trying to push away the time of catastrophe? You're only bringing the violence nearer. 4"Misfortune awaits you that stretch out on ivory beds, that lounge on your couches, that eat lambs from the flock and calves from the stall,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> that sing idle songs to the sound of a lyre and invent musical instruments like David did,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> that drink wine by the bowlful and anoint yourselves with the finest oils, but don't grieve over Joseph's demise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You'll be at the front of the exiles; your partying on couches is over with."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The Lord Yahveh has sworn by himself, Yahveh God of Hosts has declared: "I abhor Jacob's pride; I detest his fortresses. So I'll deliver up to its enemies this city and everything in it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> It will be that, if ten die in one house 10and the relative that comes to dispose of their bodies says, "Is anyone else here?" any survivor may start to swear, "No, . . ." But the relative will interrupt, "Don't finish your oath. Don't even mention Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh is going to command to smash big houses to pieces and crush little ones to bits.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Do horses run on rocks? Do people plow the sea with oxen? Yet you've turned justice into poison and made the fruit of goodness bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> To you that celebrate in Lo-debar and say, "We've taken Karnaim by our own power."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh God of Hosts says, "I'm going to raise up a nation against you, Israel; "they'll oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Arabah Valley." A Vision of Locusts</span>
