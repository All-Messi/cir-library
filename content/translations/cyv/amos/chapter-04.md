## Amos Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to this, you cows of Bashan living in Samaria, you women that oppress the poor and crush the needy, that tell their husbands, "Bring the wine so we can get drunk!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The Lord Yahveh has sworn by his holiness, "The time's coming when they'll take you away with meat hooks, the last of you like fish on hooks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You'll leave through the breaches in the walls, each one straight ahead. You'll be thrown out into Harmon/Mt. Hermon." 4"Go sacrifice at Bethel and sin; multiply your disobedience in Gilgal! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Offer a thank offering with yeast in it; declare freewill offerings and brag about it. That's what you like to do, you people in Israel. 6"I brought hunger to all your towns, clean teeth everywhere you live; yet you haven't come back to me. 7"I kept it from raining when it was still three months till harvest. Then I'd let it rain on one city and not on another. One place would get rain; the place that didn't, would dry up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So two or three towns would stagger to another to get a drink, but they wouldn't get enough; yet you haven't come back to me. 9"I struck you with blight and mildew, and laid waste your orchards and vineyards. The locusts ate your fig trees and olives; yet you haven't come back to me." 10"I sent a plague among you like I did in Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword along with your captured horses. I made the stench in your camp fill your nostrils; yet you haven't come back to me. 11"I overthrew you like I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; your survivors were like charred stakes snatched from the fire; yet you haven't come back to me. 12"Because I'm going to do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The One that builds mountains and creates wind, and reveals to people what he's thinking, the One that turns dawn into darkness and walks on mountaintops— Yahveh God of Hosts. A Call to Repentance</span>
