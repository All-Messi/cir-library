## Amos Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to what Yahveh says against you, Israel, against the entire family he brought out of Egypt: 2"Of all the families in the world, only you have me; so I'll punish you for your sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Can two men walk together unless they've agreed on their route?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Does a lion roar in the woods before it's made a kill? Does a young lion growl in his den if he's taken nothing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if there's no bait in it? Does a trap snap shut if nothing trips it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If a bugle blows in the city, won't the people be afraid? If a catastrophe falls on a city, hasn't Yahveh planned it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> For certain Yahveh God doesn't do anything without revealing his secret counsel to his prophets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A lion has roared! Who's not afraid? The Lord Yahveh has spoken! Who can refuse to prophesy?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Declare on the fortresses in Ashdod and Egypt: "Gather in the mountains around Samaria and see the great turmoil and oppression in it. 10They don't know how to do what's right; they store up violence and devastation in their fortresses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So the Lord Yahveh says, "An enemy will surround the land, pull down your fortresses, and loot your strongholds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Like a shepherd snatches from a lion's mouth a couple legs or part of an ear, so I'll deliver the Israelites living in Samaria like the corner of a couch and the cover on a bed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Listen and testify against Jacob's house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When I punish Israel's sins, I'll punish Bethel's altars too. I'll cut off the horns of the altar, and they'll fall on the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll strike their winter palaces and summer homes; stately residences full of ivory will perish; the mansions will come to an end." Israel Does Not Learn</span>
