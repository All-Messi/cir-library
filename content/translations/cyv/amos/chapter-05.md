## Amos Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to the dirge I'm chanting for you, Israel: 2"She's fallen; virgin Israel won't get up again. She's abandoned on the ground; no one will help get her up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The city that goes out 1,000 strong will have 100 left; the one that goes out 100 strong will have 10."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh tells Israel, "Rely on me so you can live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Don't rely on Bethel or go to Gilgal or Beersheba; Gilgal is headed for captivity, and Bethel will cease to exist.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Rely on me so you can live, so I don't break out like fire, House of Joseph, and burn in Bethel with no one to quench it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> you that pervert justice into bitter oppression and toss goodness on the ground."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh is the One that made Pleiades and Orion, that changes deep darkness into morning and darkens day into night, that calls water out of the ocean and pours it out on land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He's the One that flashes destruction at the strong and demolishes their fortresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They hate the one that reproves in the gate; they abhor anyone that speaks with integrity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So, since you impose heavy rent on the poor and exact tribute on their grain, though you build houses out of well-hewn stone, you won't live in them; though you plant lush vineyards, you won't drink their wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I know about your many, serious sins, you that distress decent people, accept bribes, and deprive the poor of justice in court.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In such cases, prudent people keep quiet because it's an evil time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Do what's good so you can live, so Yahveh God of Hosts will be with you like you said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Hate evil, love good; establish justice in court! Maybe Yahveh God of Hosts will show grace to the remnant in Joseph.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So, Yahveh God of Hosts says, "What wailing there is in all the squares! What mourning in every street!' They're calling on farmers to moan and professional mourners to lament.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In all the vineyards there'll be wailing, because I'll pass through your midst." The Day of Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> What longing you have for the day of Yahveh! But what good will it do you? That day will be darkness for you, not light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It will be like a man that runs from a lion and meets a bear; or goes home, leans his hand on the wall, and gets bit by a snake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Won't the day of Yahveh be darkness instead of light, gloom without brightness? 21"I despise your festivals; I don't delight in your solemn assemblies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Though you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won't accept them. I won't even look at your peace offerings of grain-fed animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Take away your noisy songs; I don't want to listen to your lyres.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Instead, make justice run down like water and goodness like a constant-flowing stream. 25"Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings in the desert for 40 years, Israel? 26Well, you also carried along Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god, images you made for yourselves. 27So I'll send you into exile beyond Damascus," Yahveh says, whose name is The God of Hosts. Woe to the Complacent</span>
