## Amos Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Lord Yahveh showed me a vision. He formed a locust swarm after the spring crop sprouted and the king had mowed his share. 2The swarm had finished eating the vegetation, and I said, "Lord Yahveh, please pardon! How will Joseph make it? He's too small!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh changed his mind. "It won't happen." A Vision of Fire</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The Lord Yahveh showed me another vision: he had called for fire to punish them. It had burned up the depths of the sea and was beginning to burn up the landscape. 5I said, "Lord Yahveh, please stop! How can Joseph make it? He's too small!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh changed his mind. "This won't happen either." A Vision of a Plumb Line</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He showed me that he was standing by a wall with a plumb line in his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line." "I'm about to put a plumb line on my people Israel; I'm not going to spare them anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; I'll attack Jeroboam's dynasty with a sword." Amaziah Accuses Amos of Conspiracy</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Amaziah, priest at Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel, "Amos has plotted against you in Israel. The land can't endure what he keeps saying: 11'Jeroboam will die by the sword; Israel will go into exile.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So Amaziah told Amos, "Get out of here, you seer! Go to Judah and prophesy for food! 13Don't prophesy at Bethel anymore. It's a king's sanctuary and a national place of worship."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Amos answered him, "I wasn't a prophet or a prophet's son. I was a shepherd that tended fig trees. 15But Yahveh took me from following flocks and told me to prophesy to his people. 16Listen to what he says. You tell me not to prophesy against Israel or preach against Isaac. 17So Yahveh says, 'Your wife will be a prostitute in the city, your children will fall by the sword, your property will be parceled up, and you'll die in an unclean land. Israel will go into exile.'" A Vision of Ripe Fruit</span>
