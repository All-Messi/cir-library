<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Solomon finished the work on Yahveh's Temple, he brought in the silver, gold, and utensils David had dedicated, and put them in the treasuries in God's Temple. The Ark Brought to the Temple</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 5:11-14 Solomon Praises Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the priests came out of the Holy Place, they'd sanctified themselves without regard to divisions. 12The Levitical singers Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. They stood east of the altar with 120 priests blowing trumpets. 13The singers made themselves heard to Yahveh's praise and honor, and sang out accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments. When they praised Yahveh, and said, "He's good because his love endures forever," his Temple filled with such a cloud 14the priests couldn't carry out their service. Yahveh's glory filled his Temple.</span>
