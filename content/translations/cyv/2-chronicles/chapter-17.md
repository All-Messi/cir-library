## 2 Chronicles Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> His son Jehoshaphat became king and secured his position against Israel. 2He placed troops in Judah's fortified towns and set garrisons in Judah and the towns in Ephraim his father had captured. 3Yahveh was with him because he followed his ancestor David's earlier days and didn't look to the images of Baal. 4He sought his father's God, followed his commandments, and didn't do like Israel. 5Yahveh secured the kingdom under him, Judah brought tributes to him, and he had great wealth and honor. 6He took pride in the ways of Yahveh and removed again the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 17:10-19 Jehoshaphat and Ahab</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In his third year, he sent his officials Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the towns in Judah. 8He sent with them Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, who were Levites, and with them the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 9They taught the people throughout Judah, having the Book of the Law with them. 	2 Ch 17:1-9</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The kingdoms around Judah dreaded Yahveh; so they didn't start any wars with Jehoshaphat. 11Some Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute. The Arabians brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 12He grew greater and greater, and built fortresses and store towns in Judah. 13He had large supplies in the towns in Judah, and trained soldiers in Jerusalem. 14This was their muster according to their families: Judah had commanders of thousands; Adnah was the commander with 300,000 soldiers. 15Beside him was Johanan the commander with 280,000.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Beside him was Amasiah Ben-Zichri, who volunteered for Yahveh, with 200,000 trained soldiers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> In Benjamin, Eliada a fearless soldier, had 200,000 armed with bow and shield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Beside him was Jehozabad with 180,000 equipped for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Those served the king, not counting the ones he put in the fortified towns all around Judah.</span>
