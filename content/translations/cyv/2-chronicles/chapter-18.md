## 2 Chronicles Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and allied himself by marriage with Ahab. 2Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered lots of sheep and oxen for him and the people with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. 3He asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?" He told him, "I'm like you, my people like yours. We'll go with you into the battle."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In addition, he said, "First let's ask for a message from Yahveh." 5He gathered the prophets, 400 men, and asked, "Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?" They said, "Go up. God will deliver it to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there still a Yahveh prophet here that we can ask?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Ahab told him, "There's one, Micaiah Ben-Imla, but I despise the guy; he never prophesies anything good about me." But Jehoshaphat said, "Don't say that." 	2 Ch 18:1-7 Micaiah's Prophecy Against Ahab</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The king of Israel called an officer and said, "Quick, bring Micaiah Ben-Imla." 9The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, and the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 10Zedekiah Ben-Chenaanah made iron horns and said, "Yahveh says you'll gore the Arameans with these till they're consumed." 11The prophets kept prophesying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prevail. Yahveh will deliver it to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The messenger that went to summon Micaiah told him, "The prophets are all speaking favorably for the king; so please say what they're saying." 13"As sure as Yahveh lives, I'll say what my God says." 	2 Ch 18:8-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When he came, the king said, "Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?" "Go right on up there! Prevail! Yahveh is going to deliver it to you for sure!!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The king said, "How many times do I have to demand that you not tell me anything but the truth in Yahveh's name?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So he said, "I saw Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. Yahveh said, 'These don't have a master; they need to go home in peace.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Ahab said, "Didn't I tell you he wouldn't prophesy anything good about me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Micaiah said, "Listen to Yahveh's message. I saw him sitting on his throne, and the host of heaven was standing on his right and left. 19He said, 'Who will lure Ahab into going up and falling at Ramoth-gilead?' "One said one thing, another said another. 20"Then a spirit came forward and said, 'I'll do it.' 'How?' 21'I'll be a deceiving spirit in his prophets.' 'Go do it.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh has put a deceiving spirit in your prophets and declared disaster on you."	2 Ch 18:14-22</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Then Zedekiah Ben-Chenaanah came and hit Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of Yahveh leave me to speak to you?" 24"You'll see when you go hide in an inner room."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The king said, "Take Micaiah back to Amon, governor of the city, and to my son Joash. 26Tell them to put him in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I come back safely."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Micaiah said, "If you come back safely, Yahveh hasn't spoken by me. You all need to listen."	2 Ch 18:23-27 The Death of Ahab</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat went on up against Ramoth-gilead. 29Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "I'll disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes." The king disguised himself, and they went into battle. 30The king of Aram had told the captains of his chariots, "Don't fight anybody great or small, just the king of Israel." 31When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, "It's the king of Israel!" They turned aside to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahveh helped him by diverting them away. 32When the captains saw it wasn't Ahab, they quit chasing him. 33A man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, "Turn around, and get me out of the fight. I'm seriously wounded." 34The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans till evening. He died at sundown.	2 Ch 18:28-34 Jehoshaphat Appoints Judges</span>
