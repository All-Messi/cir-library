## 2 Chronicles Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then the people in Jerusalem made <strong>Ahaziah</strong>/<em>Jehoahaz</em>, his youngest son, king. The band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp had killed the older sons. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ahaziah</span>
<p class="section-ref">was 22</p>

### and ruled for 1 year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri. 3To his destruction, he also followed Ahab’s practices because his mother gave him bad counsel. 4He sinned in 5going with Jehoram Ben-Ahab to fight Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram/Jehoram. 6He came back to heal in Jezreel from his wounds at Ramah. Ahaziah Ben-Joram/Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram/Jehoram in Jezreel because he was wounded.	2 Ch 22:1-6


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The destruction of Ahaziah was from God for going to Joram/<em>Jehoram</em>. He went out with Jehoram against Jehu Ben-Nimshi that Yahveh had anointed to eliminate Ahab’s family. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When Jehu was executing judgment on that house, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers serving Ahaziah and killed them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>His men also looked for Ahaziah and caught him hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, put him to death, and buried him; because they said, <em>“He</em><em> </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> the </em><em>son of </em><em>Jehoshaphat, who sought </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> with all his heart.”</em> There wasn’t anybody from Ahaziah’s family capable of ruling the kingdom. <strong>Queen Athaliah Rules Judah</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>When his mother Athaliah saw he was dead, she killed the royal offspring in Judah. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But Jehoshabeath, King <em>Joram</em>/Jehoram’s daughter, stole Joash Ben-Ahaziah from among the king’s sons—who were being murdered—and placed him and his nurse in a bedroom. Jehoshabeath, wife of Jehoiada the priest and Ahaziah’s sister, hid him so Athaliah couldn’t kill him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They hid him in God’s Temple</span>
<p class="section-ref">for 6</p>

### years while Athaliah ruled the country.	 2 Ch 22:7-12 Revolt Against Athaliah
