## 2 Chronicles Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2When Jeroboam heard about it, he came back. (He was in Egypt where he'd fled from Solomon.) 3They sent for him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they said to Rehoboam, 4"Your father made our yoke heavy. Lighten his hard service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we'll serve you." 5"Come back in three days." The people left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He consulted the elders that had served his father Solomon, "How do you advise me to answer the people?" 7"If you'll be kind to them, please them, and speak good words to them, they'll serve you permanently."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But he disregarded their advice and consulted the young men he grew up with and served him. 9He asked them, "What's your advice?" 10"Tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs! 11He loaded you with a heavy yoke; I'll make it heavier. He disciplined you with whips; I'll discipline you with scorpions.'"	2 Ch 10:1-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day like he'd directed them. 13The king answered them harshly and didn't take the elders' advice. 14"My father made your yoke heavy; I'll make it heavier. My father disciplined you with whips; I'll discipline you with scorpions." 15He didn't listen to the people, a turn of events Yahveh allowed with the result that he would bring about his message through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them, they answered, "What part do we have with David? What inheritance do we have in Jesse's son? Everybody, go home, Israel! Look after your own house, David!" Israel left and went home. 17But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites in the towns in Judah. 18He sent Hadoram, who oversaw forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. 19Israel has been in rebellion against David's dynasty ever since.	 2 Ch 10:12-19 Shemaiah's Prophecy</span>
