## 2 Chronicles Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Rehoboam got to Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 soldiers from Judah and Benjamin to fight Israel to restore the kingdom to himself. 2But a message from Yahveh came to Shemaiah, the man of God, 3"Tell Rehoboam and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 4'Yahveh says, "Don't fight your kin. Go back home. I'm going to let this happen."'" They listened to himY and went back from attacking Jeroboam. 5-10Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified towns for defense in Judah and Benjamin: 6Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 7Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 8Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 9Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 10Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. 11He reinforced the fortresses and put officers in them along with stores of food, oil, and wine. 12He put shields and spears in every city and reinforced them greatly. He held onto Judah and Benjamin. 	2 Ch 11:1-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The priests and Levites throughout Israel stood with him from all their districts. 14The Levites abandoned their pastures and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to Yahveh. 15He set up his own priests for the high places, satyrs, and calves he'd made. 16People from all the tribes that set their hearts on looking to Yahveh God of Israel, followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahveh God of their ancestors. 17They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam for three years; they followed the way of David and Solomon.

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Rehoboam married Mahalath Bat-Jerimoth Ben-David and Abihail Bat-Eliab Ben-Jesse. 19She bore him Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 20After her, he married Maacah Bat-Absalom. She bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 21Rehoboam loved Maacah more than his other wives and concubines. He'd married 18 wives and 60 concubines and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters. 22He appointed Abijah as leader among his brothers because he intended to make him king. 23He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified towns, and gave them food in abundance, and sought many wives for them.  	    2 Ch 11:13-23 Shishak [Shoshenq I] Invades Judah</span>
