## 2 Chronicles Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Solomon secured himself in his kingdom; Yahveh God was with him and made him great. 2He called together all Israel—the commanders of thousands and hundreds, the judges and every leader, the heads of families in Israel. 3He led the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon; God's Tent of Meeting was there that Moses had made in the countryside. 4But David had brought the Ark up from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he'd made for it in Jerusalem. 5The bronze altar that Bezalel Ben-Uri Ben-Hur had made, was there in front of the Tabernacle. Solomon and the assembly went to it, 6and he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.   	2 Ch 1:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "You've dealt with my father David with great enduring love and made me king in his place. 9You've fulfilled your promise to him and made me king over a people as numerous as dust on the ground. 10Give me wisdom and knowledge so I can carry on my work for them. Who can rule such a great people as yours?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God said, "Since that was in your mind and you haven't asked for possessions, wealth, honor, a long life, or your enemies' lives, 12I'll give you wisdom and knowledge; and I'll give you possessions, wealth, and honor like no other king ever had or will have."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Solomon amassed 1,400 chariots and 12,000 cavalry and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 15He made silver and gold as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as sycamores in the western foothills. 16He imported horses from Egypt, and his traders bought them from Kue. 17They brought in chariots from Egypt for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver apiece and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver each. They also exported them to the kings of the Hittites and Aram. 	2 Ch 2:14-17 Preparations for Building the Temple</span>
