## 2 Chronicles Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jehoshaphat went back safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 2Jehu Ben-Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said, "Should you help the sinful, love the ones that hate Yahveh, and bring his wrath on you? 3But there's some good in you: you've removed the Asherah poles from the country and set your heart to look to God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, circulated again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahveh God of their ancestors. 5He appointed judges in each fortified city in Judah, 6"Consider what you're doing. You're not just judging for people but for Yahveh that's with you. 7Respect him; he won't take part in sin, partiality, or bribery."	2 Ch 19:1-7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and heads of families to judge disputes, 9"Do this in respect for Yahveh, faithfully and wholeheartedly. 10Whenever a dispute comes to you from your relatives that live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, warn them so they won't be guilty to Yahveh and wrath won't come on you or them. 11Amariah the chief priest will manage everything that has to do with Yahveh. Zebadiah Ben-Ishmael, ruler of Judah, will manage everything that has to do with the king. The Levites will be officers in your presence. Act resolutely; Yahveh be with the godly."	 2 Ch 19:8-11 Jehoshaphat Defeats Moab and Ammon</span>
