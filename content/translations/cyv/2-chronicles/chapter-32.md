## 2 Chronicles Chapter **32**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After those faithful acts, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invaded Judah, laid siege to fortified towns, and intended to break into them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Hezekiah saw he’d come and meant to attack Jerusalem, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he, his officers, and soldiers decided to cut off the water supply from the springs outside the city. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Many people came together and stopped up the springs feeding the stream that flowed through the region, <em>“Why should Assyria</em><em>’s kings</em><em> come and find abundant water?”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He took courage and rebuilt the wall that had been torn down, erected towers on it, built an outside wall, strengthened the Millo in The City of David, and made a great number of weapons and shields. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He appointed military officers over the people, and gathered them in the square at the city gate to encourage them, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“B</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>strong and courageous; d</em><em>on’</em><em>t be afraid or</em><em> </em><em>intimidat</em><em>ed </em><em>by</em><em> Assyria</em><em>’s king</em><em> or </em><em>his</em><em> host.</em><em> </em><em>The One that’s with us is greater than the one </em><em>that’s </em><em>with him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>All</em><em> he’s got is</em><em> a physical army, but </em><em>we have </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> our God to help us and fight our battles.”</em> The people trusted what he said.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>After that, Sennacherib sent officers to Jerusalem while he was laying siege to Lachish with his forces. <em>He sent them </em>against Hezekiah and all Judah that were in Jerusalem, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Sennacherib</em><em>,</em><em> king of Assyria</em><em>,</em><em> says,</em> <em>‘What are you trusting </em><em>in </em><em>that you stay in Jerusalem under siege?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Isn’t</em><em> Hezekiah misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and thirst, </em><em>and saying </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> </em><em>your God will deliver you from the king of Assyria</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Hasn’t</em><em> the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and altars, and </em><em>told Judah and Jerusalem to w</em><em>orship </em><em>at one altar</em><em> and </em><em>burn incense </em><em>on </em><em><u>it</u></em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Don’</em><em>t</em><em> you know w</em><em>hat </em><em>my predecessors</em><em> </em><em>and I </em><em>have done to all the </em><em>countries</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Were the</em><em>ir </em><em>gods able to deliver their land from me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Who</em><em> among them</em><em> that my </em><em>predecessors</em><em> destroyed</em><em>,</em><em> could deliver his people from me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>D</em><em>on’t</em><em> let Hezekiah mislead you</em><em>. N</em><em>o go</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>could</em><em> deliver his people from me and</em><em> the kings before me</em><em>.</em><em> How much less </em><em><u>your</u></em><em> God?’”</em><em>	     </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Ch 32:9-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>His officers spoke against Yahveh God and Hezekiah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He wrote letters to insult Yahveh God of Israel: <em>“None of</em><em> the </em><em>nations’ </em><em>gods </em><em>have</em><em> deliv</em><em>ered their people from me.</em><em> Hezekiah</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>god won’t</em><em> deliver his people </em>either<em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They shouted it out in the language of Judah to the people on the wall to terrify them so they could take the city. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They talked about the God of Jerusalem like the other people’s hand-made gods.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah Ben-Amoz, prayed about that and appealed to Heaven. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Yahveh sent an angel that destroyed every powerful soldier, commander, and officer in the camp. <em>Sennacherib</em> went back to his own land humiliated. When he entered the temple of his god, <em>two</em> of his own sons killed him with a sword. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Yahveh saved Hezekiah, the people in Jerusalem, and the rest and guided them on every side. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Many people started bringing gifts to Yahveh at Jerusalem and special presents to Hezekiah so that all the nations regarded him highly after that.</span>

### Hezekiah’s Sickness and Recovery


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>At that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to Yahveh, and he answered him and gave him a sign. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem humbled themselves, so Yahveh’s wrath didn’t come on them during his lifetime.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Hezekiah had immense wealth and honor. He made treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles; <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>as well as storehouses for grain, wine, and olive oil; pens for all kinds of livestock, and shepherds for the flocks. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>He built towns for himself and acquired flocks and herds in abundance. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Hezekiah was the one that stopped the upper outlet of Gihon and diverted the water to the west side of The City of David. He succeeded at everything. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Even in regard to envoys from Babylon who asked about the wonder that had happened, God left him alone to test him, to know what was in his heart. <strong>Summary of Hezekiah’s Reign</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>The rest of his acts and his deeds of devotion are recorded in <em>The Vision of the Prophet</em> <em>Isaiah </em><em>Ben-</em><em>Amoz</em> and <em>The </em><em>Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel</em>. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of David’s descendants. The people in Judah and Jerusalem honored him when he died. His son Manasseh became king.<strong> </strong><strong>     </strong><strong>	     </strong></span>
