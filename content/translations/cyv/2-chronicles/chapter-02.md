## 2 Chronicles Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Solomon decided to build a temple for Yahveh's name and a royal palace for himself. 2He assigned 70,000 to transport materials, 80,000 to quarry stone in the mountains, and 3,600 to supervise them. 3He sent word to Hiram, king of Tyre, "As you sent my father David cedars for his palace, do for me. 4I'm getting ready to build a temple for Yahveh my God and dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense and offering burnt offerings morning and evening on Sabbaths, new moons, and Yahveh's appointed festivals—items of worship required permanently in Israel. 5The temple I'm going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. 6But who can build him a temple? The sky, the highest heavens, can't contain him; who am I to build him a temple, except for burning incense to him? 7Send me a man skilled at working in gold, silver, brass, and iron; in purple, crimson, and violet fabrics; a man that knows how to engrave and work with the skilled men I have in Judah and Jerusalem that my father provided. 8Send me cedar, cypress, and algum wood from Lebanon; your woodsmen know how to cut timber in Lebanon. My men will work with yours 9to prepare an abundance of it for the great, wonderful temple I'm going to build. 10I'll give your woodsmen that cut the logs 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of crushed wheat, 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of barley, 180,000 gallons 20,000 baths of wine, and 180,000 gallons 20,000 baths of oil."	 2 Ch 2:1-10</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Hiram wrote back, "Since Yahveh loves his people, he's made you their king. 12Bless Yahveh God of Israel that made earth and sky and gave King David a wise son endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for Yahveh and a royal palace for himself. 13I'm sending Huram-abi, an intelligent master craftsman, 14the son of a woman from Dan and a father from Tyre. He knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, as well as in purple, violet, linen, and crimson fabrics. He knows how to do all kinds of engravings and carry out any design you assign him. He can work with your skilled men and those of my lord David. 15 Send us the wheat and barley, oil and wine you've offered. 16We'll cut whatever timber you need and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa so you can transport it up to Jerusalem."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Solomon counted the foreigners in Israel according to David's census and found there were 153,600 of them. 18He appointed 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, 70,000 to transport materials, and 3,600 to supervise the workers.	2 Ch 2:11-18 Solomon Builds the Temple</span>
