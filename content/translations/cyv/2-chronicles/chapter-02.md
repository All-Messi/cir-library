The sky, the highest heavens, can’t contain him; who am I to build him a temple, except for burning incense to him? 7Send me a man skilled at working in gold, silver, brass, and iron; in purple, crimson, and violet fabrics; a man that knows how to engrave and work with the skilled men I have in Judah and Jerusalem that my father provided. 8Send me cedar, cypress, and algum wood from Lebanon; your woodsmen know how to cut timber in Lebanon. My men will work with yours 9to prepare an abundance of it for the great, wonderful temple I’m going to build. 10I’ll give your woodsmen that cut the logs 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of crushed wheat, 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of barley, 180,000 gallons 20,000 baths of wine, and 180,000 gallons 20,000 baths of oil.”	 2 Ch 2:1-10
