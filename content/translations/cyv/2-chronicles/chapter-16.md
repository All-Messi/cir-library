## 2 Chronicles Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In <strong>the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign</strong>, Baasha, king of Israel, came up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of Yahveh’s Temple and the king’s palace, and sent them to Benhadad, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, and said, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Let’s</em><em> make a treaty between us, like the one between our fathers. I’ve sent you silver and gold; go break your treaty with Baasha so he’ll withdraw from me.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Benhadad listened and sent his armies against the towns in Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and the store towns in Naphtali. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Baasha heard about it, he stopped fortifying Ramah. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then King Asa brought Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber from Ramah that Baasha had been using, and with them <em>Asa</em> fortified Geba and Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>At that time, Hanani the seer came to Asa, <em>“Because you’ve relied on the king of Aram instead of me, his army has escaped. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Weren’t</em><em> the Nubians and Lybians an immense army with lots of chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on Yahveh, he delivered them to you. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>His</em><em><sup>Y</sup></em><em> eyes scan over the world so he can strongly support the ones whose hearts are completely his. You’ve acted foolishly in this. From now on you’ll have wars.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Asa was mad at the seer for saying that and put him in stocks in prison. At the same time, he perpetrated cruelties on some of the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The acts of Asa, first to last, are recorded in <em>The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>In the <strong>thirty-ninth year of his reign</strong>, Asa got a serious infection in his feet; yet even in his disease he didn’t look to Yahveh but to doctors. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He died in the <strong>forty-first year</strong> of his reign. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They buried him in a tomb he’d hewn out for himself in The City of David. They laid him on a bier he’d filled with various spices prepared by incense makers. They built a big fire in his honor.</span>
