## 2 Chronicles Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Josiah celebrated Passover to Yahveh in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover animals on the fourteenth of the first month. 2He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service for the Temple. 3He told the Levites that taught Israel and were holy to Yahveh, "Put the holy Ark in the Temple Solomon built. It won't be a burden on your shoulder anymore. Serve Yahveh your God and his people Israel. 4Prepare yourselves by divisions within families like David and Solomon wrote. 5Stand in the Holy Place by those divisions of your relatives the lay people. With the Levites make divisions within families. 6Slaughter the Passover animals, sanctify yourselves, and be ready to do for your relatives what Yahveh said by Moses."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 35:1-6</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> For Passover offerings, Josiah contributed out of his own stock 30,000 lambs and kids for the lay people that were present plus 3,000 bulls. 8His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people, priests, and Levites. For the Passover, Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials of God's Temple, gave the priests 2,600 from flocks and 300 bulls. 9For the Passover, Conaniah—and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel—and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites 5,000 from the flocks and 500 bulls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So the service was ready, and the priests and Levites stood at their stations by their divisions. 11They killed the Passover animals. While the priests sprinkled the blood, the Levites skinned them. 12Then they removed the burnt offerings so they could give them to the divisions of families in the lay people to present to Yahveh the way the Book of Moses says. They did the same thing with the bulls. 13They roasted the Passover animals on the fire as required by the Law, boiled the holy things in pots, kettles, and pans; and carried them quickly away to the people. 14Afterward they prepared for themselves and the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and fat till dark. So the Levites prepared for themselves and the priests. 15The singers, descendants of Asaph, were also at their stations like David commanded: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer. The gatekeepers didn't have to step aside from serving at each gate, because their relatives, the Levites, prepared for them. 	2 Ch 35:7-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So the service of Yahveh was ready that day to celebrate Passover and to offer burnt offerings on Yahveh's altar like King Josiah commanded. 17The Israelites that were present celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week. 18Israelites hadn't celebrated Passover like that since Samuel the prophet. No king in Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, Levites, Judah, and Israel present with the people in Jerusalem. 19They celebrated it in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign. 	2 Ch 35:16-19 Josiah Dies in Battle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> After Josiah had set the Temple in order, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him. 21But Neco sent ambassadors to him, "What do we have to do with each other, King of Judah? I'm not coming against you; I'm fighting another nation, and God has ordered me to hurry. For your own sake, stop interfering with God, who is with me, so he doesn't destroy you." 	2 Ch 35:20-21</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But Josiah wouldn't turn away; he disguised himself. He ignored what God said from Neco and went ahead to fight him on the plain of Megiddo. 23The archers shot him, and he told his officers, "Take me away; I'm badly wounded." 24They took him out of the chariot, put him in a second one he had, and took him to Jerusalem, where he died. They buried him in the tombs of his ancestors. Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. 25Jeremiah chanted a lament for him. The male and female singers still speak about him in The Lamentations. They made them an ordinance in Israel; they're written in The Lamentations. 26The rest of the deeds and devotions of Josiah are written in The Law of Yahveh. 27His acts, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.	2 Ch 35:22-27 Jehoahaz Rules Judah</span>
