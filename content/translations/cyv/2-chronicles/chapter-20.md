## 2 Chronicles Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some Meunites came to attack Jehoshaphat. 2Some people brought him a report, "A large army is coming out of Edom from the other side of the sea. They're in Hazazon-tamar (En-gedi)." 3He was afraid, set himself to look to Yahveh, and declared a fast throughout Judah. 4Judah gathered from all the towns to look to Yahveh for help.	2 Ch 20:1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Ch 20:20-30 Summary of Jehoshaphat's Reign</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in Yahveh's Temple in front of the new court, 6"Yahveh our ancestors' God, aren't you God in the sky? Don't you rule every nation? You have such power and strength that nobody can stand against you. 7Didn't you drive out the people in this land, and give it to the descendants of Abraham your friend forever? 8They've lived in it, built a sanctuary there for your name, and said, 9'Should misfortune come on us—the sword, judgment, disease, or famine—we'll present ourselves at this Temple (because your name is here), and call out to you in our distress. You'll hear us and deliver us. 10You didn't let Israel invade the Ammonites, Moabites, or Mount Seir when they came out of Egypt. (They turned aside and didn't destroy them.) 11Now they're rewarding us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us. 12Our God, won't you judge them? We're powerless in the face of such a big army. We don't know what to do but look to you for help."  	2 Ch 20:5-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> All Judah was standing before Yahveh with their infants, wives, and children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then in the assembly, the Spirit of Yahveh came on Jahaziel Ben-Zechariah (Ben-Benaiah Ben-Jeiel Ben-Mattaniah the Levite, descendant of Asaph), 15 "Listen, Judah, people in Jerusalem, King Jehoshaphat. Yahveh says, 'Don't be afraid or intimidated by that big army. The battle is not yours but mine. 16Go down against them tomorrow. They'll come up by the ascent of Ziz. You'll find them at the end of the valley east of the Wilderness of Jeruel. 17You won't need to fight in this battle. Take your positions. Stand and watch myY salvation for you.' Don't be afraid or intimidated. Go out to face them tomorrow; Yahveh's with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jehoshaphat bowed to the ground, and Judah and the people in Jerusalem fell down in worship to Yahveh. 19The Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to give loud praise toY God of Israel.	2 Ch 20:13-19</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They got up early the next morning and went out to the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they went, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Judah and Jerusalem, trust Yahveh and you'll be safe. Trust his prophets and you'll succeed." 21When he'd advised the people, he appointed the ones that sang and praised Yahveh in holy attire to go out ahead of the army, "Thank Yahveh because his love endures forever." 22When they began singing and praising, heY set ambushes against the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mount Seir; and they were routed. 23The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the people from Mount Seir and destroyed them completely. When they'd finished that, they helped destroy one another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When Judah came to the watchtower over the countryside, they looked toward the army. Corpses were lying everywhere; nobody had escaped. 25When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found lots of equipment, clothes, and valuable things, more than they could carry. They took spoil for three days, there was so much of it. 26On the fourth day, they met in the Valley of Beracah to "bless" Yahveh. That's still its name. 27Everyone in Judah and Jerusalem came back happy with Jehoshaphat in the lead, because Yahveh made them celebrate over their enemies. 28They came to Jerusalem to theY Temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets. 29All the kingdoms dreaded God when they heard that heY had fought Israel's enemies. 30Jehoshaphat's kingdom had peace because his God gave him rest in every direction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jehoshaphat was 35 when he became king and ruled Judah in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah Bat-Shilhi. 32He followed the way of his father Asa. He did what was good, 33but he didn't take away the high places. The people hadn't yet directed their hearts to their ancestors' God. 34The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Jehu Ben-Hanani and The Book of the Kings of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> After that, Jehoshaphat allied himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel. That was a bad decision. 36He did it to build ships in Ezion-geber for going to Tarshish. 37Then Eliezer Ben-Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against him, "Because you've allied yourself with Ahaziah, Yahveh has destroyed what you've built." 	2 Ch 20:31-37 Jehoram Rules Judah</span>
