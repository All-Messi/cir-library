## 2 Chronicles Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Rehoboam's kingdom got secure and strong, he and Israel turned away from the Law of Yahveh. 2In his fifth year, because they weren't faithful to Yahveh, Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem 3with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. The Lybians, Sukkiim, and Nubians came with him without number. 4He captured the fortified towns in Judah and advanced to Jerusalem. 5Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and Judah's officials that had fled to Jerusalem to escape Shishak, "Yahveh says you've left him, so he's left you to Shishak." 6The officials of Israel and the king humbled themselves, "Yahveh is good."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When Yahveh saw that, he told Shemaiah, "They've humbled themselves, so I won't destroy them. I'll grant them some measure of deliverance and not pour out my anger on Jerusalem by Shishak. 8But they'll become his slaves so they'll learn the difference between serving me and serving other countries." 	2 Ch 12:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Shishak [Shoshenq I] came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures out of Yahveh's Temple and the king's palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 10King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the commanders of the guard that guarded the king's palace. 11As often as the king went into Yahveh's Temple, the guards would carry them and then bring them back to the guard room. 12When he humbled himself, Yahveh turned his anger away, so he didn't destroy him completely. Conditions in Judah were tolerable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem. He was 41 when he began to rule, and he ruled for 17 years in the city where Yahveh had chosen to identify with. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 14He did evil because he didn't set his heart to look to Yahveh. 15The acts of Rehoboam, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and The Chronicles of Iddo the Seer by genealogical enrollment. There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam constantly. 16Rehoboam died and they buried him in The City of David, and his son Abijah became king.	2 Ch 12:9-16 Abijah Rules Judah</span>
