## 2 Chronicles Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At the end of the 20 years it took Solomon to build Yahveh's Temple and his own palace, 2he rebuilt the towns Hiram had given him and settled Israelites in them. 3Then he captured Hamath-zobah 4and built Tadmor in the open country and storage cities in Hamath. 5He built Upper and Lower Beth-horon, fortified towns with walls, gates, and bars. 6He built Baalath, the storage cities he had, towns for his chariots and cavalry, and everything he delighted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and the rest of the territory he ruled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The people left over from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who weren't Israelites 8the Israelites hadn't destroyed, Solomon has made forced laborers ever since. 9He didn't make slaves out of Israelites for his work. They were soldiers, chief captains, and commanders of his chariots and cavalry. 10Solomon had 250 chief officers that oversaw the people. 11Then he brought Pharaoh's daughter up from The City of David to the house he'd built for her, because he said, "My wife won't live in David's palace, because the places are holy where Yahveh's Ark has been."	 2 Ch 8:1-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Solomon offered burnt offerings on the altar he'd built in front of the vestibule. 13He followed the daily rule, offering them according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, new moons, and the three annual festivals: The Festival of Unleavened Bread, The Festival of Weeks, and The Festival of Booths.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He followed David's ordinance and appointed the priestly divisions for their service: the Levites for their duties of praise and serving in the presence of the priests by the daily rule; the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate. 15They kept his commandments to the priests and Levites about the treasuries.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Solomon carried out his work from the day he laid the foundation of Yahveh's Temple till he finished it. 17Then he went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore in Edom. 18By his own officers, Hiram sent him ships and sailors that knew the sea. They went with Solomon's servants to Ophir and brought back 17 tons 450 talents of gold.	2 Ch 8:12-18 The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon</span>
