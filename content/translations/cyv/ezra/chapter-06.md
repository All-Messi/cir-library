<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Tattenai, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates carried out the decree diligently. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The elders of the Jews succeeded in the construction by the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah.

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Israel, the priests, Levites, and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of God’s Temple. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for Israel 12 male goats corresponding to the 12 tribes in Israel. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God as written in the Book of Moses. <strong>Passover Celebrated</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The exiles observed Passover on the <strong>fourteenth of the first month</strong>. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The priests and Levites had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The Israelites from the exile and the ones that had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations in the land, joined them in reaching out to Yahveh God of Israel by eating <em>the Passover</em>. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week with joy because Yahveh had given them reason to celebrate. He had inclined the heart of the Assyrian king to encourage them in the work on his Temple.</span>
