## Ezra Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While Ezra was praying and confessing, crying and prostrating himself in front of God's Temple, a big crowd of men, women, and children gathered around him, sobbing with him. 2Shecaniah Ben-Jehiel, one of Elam's sons, told him, "We've been unfaithful to our God and married foreign women from the land. But there's still hope for Israel. 3Let's make a covenant with God to put away the wives and their children as you've advised and do it according to the Law. 4Get up! This is your responsibility. We'll be with you. Have the courage to do it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel swear that they'd adopt that proposal. They took the oath. 6Then he went from in front of God's Temple to the room of Jehohanan Ben-Eliashib. He didn't eat or drink; he was mourning over the exiles' unfaithfulness. 7They issued a proclamation for the exiles throughout Judah and Jerusalem to assemble at Jerusalem. 8Whoever wouldn't come within three days like the leaders and elders said, would forfeit his possessions and be excluded from the community of exiles. 	   Ezra 10:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in the three days. It was the twentieth day, ninth month, and the people sat down in the open square in front of God's Temple. They were shivering because of this matter and the heavy rain. 10Ezra stood up and said, "You've been unfaithful in marrying foreign wives and adding to Israel's guilt. 11Confess to Yahveh God of your ancestors, do his will, and separate from the native people and your foreign wives."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The whole assembly answered out loud, "That's true! We have to do that. 13But there are lots of people here, it's raining, and we can't stand outside. We can't take care of this problem in a day or two; a lot of us have sinned in this. 14Have leaders represent the assembly and have the ones in our towns that have foreign wives meet at scheduled times with the elders and judges in each city till God's fierce anger turns away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Only Jonathan Ben-Asahel and Jahzeiah Ben-Tikvah opposed it. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported it.		   Ezra 10:9-15 Men Guilty of Intermarriage</span>
