<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>I assembled them at the canal that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. When I looked over the people and the priests, I didn’t find any Levites. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam (leaders), and for Joiarib and Elnathan (teachers). <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I sent them to Iddo, leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to tell him and his brothers (the Temple servants at that place) to bring ministers to us for God’s Temple. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>By God’s good hand on us, they brought Sherebiah (an insightful Ben-Mahli, descendant of Levi) as well as his sons and brothers, 18 men;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>220 Temple servants that David and the officials had given to assist the Levites—all identified by name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Then I declared a fast at the Ahava Canal, to humble ourselves toward God and look to him for a safe journey for us, our little ones, and our possessions. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and cavalry to protect us, because we’d told him, <em>“God</em><em> </em><em>favors</em><em> </em><em>those who</em><em> </em><em>look to</em><em> him</em><em>. H</em><em>is power and anger </em><em>oppose</em><em> </em><em>those who</em><em> </em><em>leave</em><em> him.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>We fasted and looked to God on the matter, and he listened to our plea. <strong>	</strong><strong>	   </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Then I set</span>
<p class="section-ref">apart 12</p>

### leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 others. 25I weighed out to them the silver and gold, the utensils, and the offering for God’s Temple that the king, his advisors, officials, and all Israel present there had offered: 2624½ tons 650 talents of silver, utensils worth 7,550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 7,550 lbs 100 talents of gold, 2720 bowls worth 19 lbs 1,000 darics of gold; and 2 utensils of fine, shiny bronze, precious as gold. 28Then I said, “You’re holy to Yahveh; the utensils are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahveh God of your ancestors. 29Keep them till you weigh them in the presence of the leading priests, Levites, and heads of families at Jerusalem, in the rooms in Yahveh’s Temple.”


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>The priests and Levites received the silver, gold, and utensils, to take to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Then we left the Ahava River on the <strong>twelfth day, first month </strong>to go to Jerusalem. God watched over us and delivered us from enemies and ambushes along the way. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We arrived at Jerusalem and rested three days. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>On the fourth day, we weighed out in God’s Temple the silver, gold, and utensils to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, Eleazar son of Phinehas, and the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>We numbered and weighed everything, and recorded the total.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>The exiles offered burnt offerings to God: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Then they delivered the king’s edicts to his satraps and the governors of Beyond the River [Ever-hannahar, Hebrew], and they supported the people and God’s Temple.<strong> </strong><strong>        </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
