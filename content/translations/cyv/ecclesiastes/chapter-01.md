## Ecclesiastes Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Words of the Preacher, Ben-David, King in Jerusalem 2"Completely pointless," the Preacher says; "Completely pointless! It's all pointless."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What do people get out of their work under the sun?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> One generation passes away and another comes along, but the earth just goes on and on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The sun comes up, the sun goes down, and hurries back to where it comes up again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The wind blows south, the wind blows north; it just keeps circulating around and around.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The rivers flow to the ocean; yet the ocean doesn't run over; they flow again to where they flowed before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Everything is too tiresome to talk about; eyes aren't satisfied by seeing; ears aren't fulfilled by hearing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What has been is what will be; what's been done is what'll be done; there's nothing new under the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Is there anything you can say, "Look, that's new"?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> People don't remember the past; later, they won't remember the future either. The ones that come after you won't remember you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13I decided to examine with wisdom everything people do under the sky. It's a grievous job God has stricken them with. 14I've looked at everything they do under the sun. It's all pointless, like chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What's crooked you can't straighten; what's missing you can't get back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I said to myself, "I'm wiser than anybody that's ruled Jerusalem before; I've gained a wealth of knowledge."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I determined to experience everything from wisdom to madness and pointless behavior. I came to realize that it's all like chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> There's much grief in much wisdom; increasing knowledge increases pain.</span>
