## Ecclesiastes Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Remember your Creator when you're young, before the difficult days come, before the years close in and you say, "I don't enjoy them anymore";</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> before the sun, moon, and stars grow faint and clouds remain after rain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> when the watchmen [arms and hands?] of the house [body] are palsied and strong men [shoulders?] hunch over; when grinders [teeth?] stand idle because they're few and those looking out of windows [eyes?] can't see much;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> when the doors to the street [lips?] are shut and the sound of grinding [chewing?] is muffled, when you arise at the time of a bird's chirping and young women sing faintly;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> when you're afraid of falling* and scared to walk around; when your hair turns white like almond-tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along; when your appetite's gone* and you go to your eternal home while wailers walk the streets;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> before the silver cord snaps, the golden bowl breaks, the pitcher by the well shatters, the pulley at the cistern doesn't work anymore;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> when the dust returns to the earth where it was and the spirit returns to the God who gave it. 8"Completely pointless," the Preacher says; "it's all pointless."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Besides being a wise man, the Preacher taught the people. He weighed, studied, and classified lots of proverbs. 10He endeavored to write true things and searched for expressive words.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The words of the wise are like goads. Collections of them are like nails tightly driven; they come from one Shepherd. 12My child, beware of anything more: there's no end to writing books, and too much study wears you out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You've heard every view. Here's the conclusion: respect God and do his will; that's your role. 14God will judge every act, everything secret, good or bad.</span>
