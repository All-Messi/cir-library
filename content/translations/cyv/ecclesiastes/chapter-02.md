## Ecclesiastes Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I said to myself, "Try pleasure; enjoy yourself." That turned out to have no purpose either. 2Laughing's silly and pleasure's pointless. 3I cast about in my mind how to cheer myself up with wine and embrace foolishness while thinking wisely. I tried to find out what's worth doing under the sky during the few years we're alive. 4I undertook big projects: I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I made gardens and parks for myself, planted all kinds of fruit trees in them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> and built ponds to irrigate the trees;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I bought male and female slaves and had home-born slaves; I owned bigger flocks and herds than anyone before me in Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I collected silver and gold and the treasure from kings and provinces; I provided for myself male and female singers and lots of concubines—men's pleasure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So I became great and surpassed everybody before me in Jerusalem, as my wisdom stayed with me. 10I took whatever I saw that I wanted. I didn't deprive myself of any pleasure because I was pleased with my work and pleasure was my reward for it. 11Then I looked at what I'd done and the effort I'd put into doing it. It was pointless, like chasing the wind. I hadn't gained anything under the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I compared wisdom to madness and fun; who can have more of that than a king? 13I saw that wisdom excels fun as much as light excels darkness. 14The wise can see where they're going, but the foolish walk around in the dark; yet both share the same fate. 15I said, "The fate of a fool will come to me too; so what's the point of being wise?" 16There's no more lasting memory of the wise than of the foolish. Later on, everybody will fade from memory. The wise and the foolish both die! 17So I despised life because my work under the sun brought me grief. Everything's pointless, like chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So I despised everything I'd worked for under the sun because I'll have to leave it to other people. 19Who knows if they'll be wise or foolish? Yet they'll control everything I worked for in wisdom under the sun. It's pointless. 20So I let myself despair over everything I worked for under the sun. 21After people labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, they have to leave it to somebody that didn't work for it. It's pointless, a great misfortune. 22What do people get out of their hard work and striving under the sun? 23Their whole life is painful and grievous. Even at night their mind doesn't rest. It's all so pointless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> There's nothing better than to eat and drink and get satisfaction out of your work. I've seen even that comes from God; 25apart from him, who can eat and enjoy anything? 26He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to the ones he considers good. He gives sinners the job of accumulating wealth to give to the ones he considers good. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind.</span>
