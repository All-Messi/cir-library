## Ecclesiastes Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Dead flies even make perfume stink; likewise, a little foolishness can spoil wisdom and honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A foolish heart pulls to the left; a wise one pulls to the right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You can recognize fools just by the way they walk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> If a ruler's anger flares at you, don't react, because composure smooths over big offenses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> There's a problem I've seen under the sun, an error that originates in rulers 6who appoint foolish people to high positions while putting successful people in lower ones. 7I've seen slaves ride horses beside princes that walk on the ground like slaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If you dig a pit, you may fall in it; if you break through a wall, you may get bit by a snake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If you quarry stones, you may be injured by them; if you split logs, you may hurt yourself doing it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> If you don't sharpen your axe, you have to work harder; wisdom aids success.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If a snake bites before it's charmed, the charmer hasn't accomplished anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Words from the wise are gracious; the thoughts of fools destroy them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They begin with foolish talk, and foolish talk leads to foolish deeds;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> but fools just keep talking. Nobody knows what's going to happen; who can tell people what will come after them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Fools' toil wears them out so much they can't find their way home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Misfortune awaits the land whose king is a kid, whose princes feast in the morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You're a fortunate land if its king is noble and its princes eat at normal times— for energy, not for gluttony.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Through laziness, rafters sag; through idleness, the roof leaks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People fix a meal for enjoyment; wine makes life happy; money solves everything;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don't curse the king in your bedroom or the rich where you sleep. A bird in the sky may hear what you say and spread it around.</span>
