## Ecclesiastes Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Toss your bread on the water; it'll come back around a long time later.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Diversify your investments seven or eight ways; you don't know what risks lie ahead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Heavy clouds drop rain; a tree stays where it falls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> If you keep worrying about the weather, you won't sow; if you keep watching the clouds, you won't reap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Just like you don't know where the wind will blow or how bones form in a womb, you don't understand what God's doing who makes everything happen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Plant your seed in the morning; don't be idle in the afternoon; you don't know if planting in the morning or afternoon is best, or if one's as good as the other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Light is pleasing; sunrise is pleasant to behold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If you live a long time, enjoy all your years; just remember, there'll be lots of dark days, and nothing will seem important in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Young people, enjoy life while you're young; stay pleasant. Go ahead and follow your impulses and desires; just remember, God will judge you for all of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So don't worry; take care of your health, because childhood and the prime of life soon pass.</span>
