## Ecclesiastes Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There's a time for everything under the sky:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot what's planted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to build and a time to tear down;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> a time to laugh and a time to cry; a time to dance and a time to mourn;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> a time to gather stones and a time to throw them away; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> a time to search and a time to quit searching; a time to keep and a time to throw away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> a time to rip apart and a time to sew together; a time to speak and a time to be quiet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> a time to love and a time not to love; a time for peace and a time for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What do workers get out of work? 10I've seen the job God has given people to occupy themselves. 11He's set an appropriate time for everything and planted eternity in their hearts, but in a way that they can't see his work beginning to end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I realize there's nothing better for people than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. 13There's nothing better than eating and drinking and taking pleasure in their work—that's God's gift. 14Everything God does is final. There's nothing to add or take away, because he has worked in such a way that people should respect him. 15What will be has already been, because God does again what he's done before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Besides, I've seen that in place of justice and goodness there's wickedness under the sun. 17I said to myself, "God will judge the good and the bad because he's appointed a time for everything. 18He tests them so they can see they're no better than animals."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People and animals have the same fate: one dies like the other; they both have to breathe. People don't have any advantage. 20They both came from dust, and they'll go back to it. 21Who knows if a person's spirit goes up and an animal's spirit goes down into the ground? 22I've seen that there's nothing better for people than to be happy in what they do; that's their lot. Who can make them see what'll happen when they're gone?</span>
