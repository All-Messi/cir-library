## Ecclesiastes Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>There’s a time for everything under the sky:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot what’s planted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to build and a time to tear down;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>a time to laugh and a time to cry; a time to dance and a time to mourn;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>a time to gather stones and a time to throw them away; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>a time to search and a time to quit searching; a time to keep and a time to throw away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>a time to rip apart and a time to sew together; a time to speak and a time to be quiet;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>a time to love and a time not to love; a time for peace and a time for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>What do workers get out of work? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I’ve seen the job God has given people to occupy themselves. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He’s set an appropriate time for everything and planted eternity in their hearts, but in a way that they can’t see his work beginning to end.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 3:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>I realize there’s nothing better for people than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>There’s nothing better than eating and drinking and taking pleasure in their work—that’s God’s gift. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Everything God does is final. There’s nothing to add or take away, because he has worked in such a way that people should respect him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>What will be has already been, because God does again what he’s done before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Besides, I’ve seen that in place of justice and goodness there’s wickedness under the sun. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I said to myself, <em>	</em><em>“</em><em>God will judge the good </em><em>and </em><em>the bad</em><em> because he’s appointed a time for everything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> tests them</em><em> so they can see they’re </em><em>no better than </em><em>animals.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>People and animals have the same fate: one dies like the other; they both have to breathe. People don’t have any advantage. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They both came from dust, and they’ll go back to it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Who knows if a person’s spirit goes up and an animal’s spirit goes down into the ground? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I’ve seen that there’s nothing better for people than to be happy in what they do; that’s their lot. Who can make them see what’ll happen when they’re gone?<strong>  </strong></span>
