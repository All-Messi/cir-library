## Ecclesiastes Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A good reputation is better than expensive ointment; the day you die is better than the day you're born.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It's better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting; because that's the end of everyone, and the living should take it to heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect: when the face is sad, the heart can be happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The heart of the wise remembers there's mourning, but the heart of a fool just thinks about having fun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It's better to listen to a rebuke from the wise than be regaled by the songs of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A fool's laughter doesn't last long; it's like thorns crackling under a heating pot: it's pointless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Oppression can turn the wise into fools; bribes corrupt their heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Finishing is better than starting; patience is better than pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't get mad quick, because anger thrives in the chest of fools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don't say, "Why were the old days better than now?" You don't ask that because you're wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Wisdom plus inheritance is good; it's an advantage to those who see the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Protecting knowledge is like protecting money, but only knowledge can save your life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Think about what God does; who can straighten out what he bends?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Be happy in prosperous times, but in hard times think about this: God has made the one as well as the other; so you can't be sure what will happen when you're gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I've seen all kinds of things in my pointless life, including good people that die young and bad people that die old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Don't overestimate your "goodness" or "wisdom." Why ruin what you really are?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don't be excessively bad or foolish. Why die early? 18Avoid extremes. A humble person that respects God ends up with both wise goodness and long life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Nobody's always good; 21so don't take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, 22and you know how often you've cursed people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I determined I'd be wise about everything, but I couldn't do it. 24No one can figure out what's distant and deep. 25I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. 26I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains. 27"Here's something I've discovered," the Preacher says, "combining one thing with another to reach a conclusion, 28something I'm still looking for and haven't found. I've found a man among a thousand, but I haven't found a woman among them. 29I've found only this: God made people godly, but they've sought out their own ways."</span>
