## Ecclesiastes Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A good reputation is better than expensive ointment; the day you die is better than the day you’re born.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>It’s better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting; because that’s the end of everyone, and the living should take it to heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect: when the face is sad, the heart can be happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The heart of the wise remembers there’s mourning, but the heart of a fool just thinks about having fun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>It’s better to listen to a rebuke from the wise than be regaled by the songs of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>A fool’s laughter doesn’t last long; it’s like thorns crackling under a <em>heating </em>pot: it’s pointless.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 7:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Oppression can turn the wise into fools; bribes corrupt their heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Finishing is better than starting; patience is better than pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Don’t get mad quick, because anger thrives in the chest of fools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Don’t say, <em>“Why were the old days better than now?”</em> You don’t ask that because you’re wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Wisdom plus inheritance is good; it’s an advantage to those who see the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Protecting knowledge is like protecting money, but only knowledge can save your life.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 7:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Think about what God does; who can straighten out what he bends?<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Be happy in prosperous times, but in hard times think about <em>this</em>: God has made the one as well as the other; so you can’t be sure what will happen when you’re gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>I’ve seen all kinds of things in my pointless life, including good people that die young and bad people that die old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Don’t overestimate your “goodness” or “wisdom.” Why ruin what you really are?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Don’t be excessively bad or foolish. Why die early? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Avoid extremes. A <em>humble </em>person that respects God ends up with both <em>wise goodness</em><em> and long life</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Nobody’s <em>always</em> good; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>so don’t take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and you know how often <u>you</u>’ve cursed people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Eccl 7:13-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>I determined I’d be wise about everything, but I couldn’t do it. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>No one can figure out what’s distant and deep. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Here’s</em><em> something </em><em>I’</em><em>ve discovered</em><em>,”</em> the Preacher says, <em>“combining one thing with another to </em><em>reach a conclusion</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>something</em><em> I’m still looking for and haven’t found.</em><em> </em><em>I’ve found </em><em>a</em><em> man among </em><em>a thousand</em><em>, but I haven’t found a woman among them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> fou</em><em>nd only this: God made people</em><em> </em><em>godly</em><em>, but they’ve sought out </em>their own<em> ways</em><em>.”</em><strong>    </strong><strong>	   </strong></span>
