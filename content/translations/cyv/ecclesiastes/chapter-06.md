## Ecclesiastes Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There's a common tragedy I've seen under the sun: 2people that God has given wealth and honor so they have everything they could want, but he hasn't given them a chance to enjoy them; a foreigner is enjoying them. That's a pointless tragedy. 3If a man fathers 100 children and lives for however many years, but isn't satisfied with good things and doesn't even get a proper burial, then I say, "A miscarriage is better off 4because he would have come in pointless and gone out in the dark. 5A miscarriage never sees the sun or knows anything. 6Even if someone lives 1,000 years twice and isn't content, what's the point? Everybody ends up in the same place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> All our labor is for our mouth; yet our appetite isn't satisfied. 8What advantage do the wise have over the foolish? What advantage do the poor have that know how to conduct themselves with other people? 9What the eyes see is better than what the soul wants. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> God has already decided what's going to happen, including what each of us will be. We can't argue with him about it; he's stronger than we are. 11The more we say the less it means; so what's the point of talking? 12Who knows what's good for us anyway during the few years of our pointless life? They'll go by like a shadow, and who can tell us what will happen under the sun when they're done?</span>
