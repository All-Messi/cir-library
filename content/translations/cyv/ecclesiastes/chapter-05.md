## Ecclesiastes Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When you go to God's Temple, go there to listen rather than offer mindless sacrifice and not realize you're sinning. 2Don't think impulsively or speak rashly in God's presence. He's in heaven, you're on earth; so don't say too much. 3Working too much fosters false dreams, and talking too much makes you a fool. 4When you make a vow to God, don't delay paying it. He doesn't delight in fools; pay what you vow. 5It'd be better not to vow than not to pay it. 6Don't sin in what you say; don't say in God's presence that you misspoke. Why have him angry with what you say and destroy your work? 7When daydreams grow and words multiply, emptiness comes. Respect God, instead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't be shocked if you see the poor oppressed and justice denied in the realm. One official oversees another official, higher officials oversee them, 9and the king that cultivates the land to his own advantage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> People that love money aren't satisfied with money; those who love wealth aren't satisfied with wealth. That's pointless too. 11The more you make, the more people there are that want to get you to spend it. So what's the advantage of being an owner except to have something to look at? 12Working people's sleep is pleasant, whether they eat a little or a lot. But the full stomach of the rich doesn't let them sleep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> There's a grievous problem I've seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the hoarder's hurt. 14When he lost that wealth in a bad venture and had fathered a son, he couldn't support him. 15He came naked from his mother's womb; he'll go like he came. He won't take anything with him from his labor. 16That's a grievous thing: people die like they're born; so what do they get out of working for the wind? 17Their whole life they eat in the dark, oppressed, sick, and angry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've seen something that's fitting and good: to eat, drink, and enjoy your work under the sun for the few years God gives you; that's your reward. 19It's also God's gift to all he's given wealth. He's enabled them to eat from it, receive their reward, and enjoy what they do. 20They won't dwell on how long they're going to live, because God keeps them occupied with happiness.</span>
