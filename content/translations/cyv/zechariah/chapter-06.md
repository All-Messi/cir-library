## Zechariah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I looked again and saw four chariots coming out from between two bronze mountains. 2Chestnut horses were pulling the first chariot, black horses the second, 3white horses the third, and powerful dappled-gray horses the fourth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I asked the angel, "What are they, Sir?" 5"They're the four spirits of heaven going out from the Lord of the whole world. 6One chariot is going north with the black horses; after them the white horses are going west. The dappled-gray horses are going south. 7Those powerful horses went out, chomping at the bit to patrol the world." He said, "Go on and patrol it." So they did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then he shouted to me, "Look, the ones going north have appeased my anger there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Me The Crowning of Joshua 10"Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring an offering of silver and gold from the exiles in Babylon. The same day, go to the house of Josiah Ben-Zephaniah to meet them. 11Make a crown out of the silver and gold, and put it on Joshua/Jeshua Ben-Jehozadak, the high priest. 12Tell him, 'Yahveh of Hosts says a man named Branch will "branch out" from where he is and build the Temple, 13bear the honor, and rule from his throne. He'll also be a priest on his throne, and his combined roles will work together.' 14The crown will serve as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah in Yahveh's Temple. 15People from a long way off will come to rebuild the Temple." When these things come about, they'll assure you that Yahveh of Hosts has sent me. They will all happen if you faithfully obey him.</span>
