## Zechariah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then I looked up and saw a flying scroll.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, "What do you see?" "A flying scroll, 15 by 30ft."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He told me, "It contains the words of the curse that's over the whole world. Everyone that steals will be erased from one side. Everyone that swears falsely will be erased from the other. 4Yahveh of Hosts will send the curse out to the thief's house and to the house of the one that swears falsely by his name. The curse will remain there all night till it consumes its timbers and stones.'" A Woman in a Basket</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The angel came forward and said, "Look at what's coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I said, "What is it?" "A basket ephah for measuring grain. It's filled with the sins of everybody in the land 7[a lead cover was lifted off of it], and that's a woman sitting inside it 8named Wickedness!" He shoved her down into the ephah and put the lead lid back on it. 9I saw two women flying toward us with wings like a stork. They took the ephah up in the air.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I asked the angel where they were taking it. 11"To Shinar to build a temple for it. When it's ready, they'll set the ephah there on its own pedestal." Four Chariots</span>
