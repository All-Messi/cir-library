## Zechariah Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then a fountain will spring up for David's house and the people in Jerusalem, a fountain for cleansing sin and impurity. 2I'll get rid of the idols in Israel; they'll fade from memory. I'll remove false prophets and unclean spirits. 3If anybody still tries to make up their own prophecy, their own parents will say, 'You've lied in Yahveh's name!' and they'll run them through. 4People will be averse to claiming they've had visions; they won't put on a prophet's hairy robe to create impressions. 5They'll say, 'I'm not a prophet; I plow ground because a man sold me as a slave when I was a kid.' 6If somebody asks him, 'Where did those scars come from around your wrists?' he'll say, 'From wounds at "a friend's" house!' The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Wake up, sword, against my shepherd, my associate; strike the shepherd, scatter the sheep, and turn against the lambs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In the whole land, two parts will perish, but the third will survive;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll bring that third part through the fire, refine them like silver, purify them like gold. They'll call on me, and I'll answer. I'll say, 'They're my people'; they'll say, 'Yahveh's our God.'" Yahveh Will Rule the World</span>
