## Zechariah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then I saw a man holding a measuring line, and 2asked him where he was going. "To measure how wide and long Jerusalem is."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The angel that was talking to me was leaving, and another angel met him 4and said, "Run and tell that young man, 'Jerusalem will be lived in like open country because of the number of people and livestock that's in it. 5I'll be a fire wall around it and the glory in it. 6"Flee from up north where I've scattered you to the four winds.  7Zion! Escape, you exiles in Babylon.' 8"'It's for glory that he has sent me against the nations that plundered you, because whoever touches you will be poking themselves in the eye. 9I'll raise my fist over them so their slaves will plunder them. You'll know Yahveh of Hosts has sent me. 10"Sing and be happy, Zion, because I'm coming to live among you. 11Many nations will join Yahveh then and become my people. I'll live among you, and you'll know Yahveh of Hosts has sent me to you. 12He'll own Judah as his portion in the holy land and choose Jerusalem again.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Be silent in his presence, all you nations; he has risen up to take action from the holy place where he lives. The Cleansing of Joshua the High Priest</span>
