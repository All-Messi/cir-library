## Zechariah Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ask Yahveh for showers in the spring; the One that forms the storm clouds will give each farmer crops in his field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Household gods speak nonsense; fortunetellers see false dreams and give empty consolation. So people wander in danger like lost sheep because they don't have a shepherd. 3"My anger flares at the shepherds; I'll punish the male goats, because I care about my flock, the House of Judah; I'll make them like my majestic steed in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The cornerstone will come from Judah, the tent peg, the bow in battle, and every ruler.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Together they'll become great warriors and walk all over their enemies like dirt on a road; they'll fight because Yahveh will be on their side; they'll outfight enemies that ride horses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He'll strengthen Judah and save Joseph, and bring them back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Ephraim will become a powerful man and be happy as if from wine. His children will see it and be happy too, and celebrate in Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll whistle for them to gather because I've redeemed them; there'll be as many of them as before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Though I scattered them among the nations, they'll remember me in far countries, survive with their children, and return.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll bring them back from Egypt and Assyria and settle them in Gilead and Lebanon till they take up the whole area.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll escort them through the distressing Red Sea and hold back its waves; I'll completely dry up the Nile, crush Assyria's pride, and end Egypt's rule.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll make my people strong, and they'll follow me." Good and Bad Shepherds</span>
