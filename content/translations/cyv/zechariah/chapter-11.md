## Zechariah Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Open your doors, Lebanon, so fire can consume your cedar forests.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Wail, cypress trees, for the fallen cedars; The stately trees have burned up. Wail, oaks of Bashan; the thick woodland has been cut down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The shepherds wail because their good pasture's gone. The young lions roar because the jungle by the Jordan is decimated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh my God says, "Pasture the flock that's doomed to slaughter. 5The buyers butcher them without remorse. The sellers say, 'Praise Yahveh, I'm rich!' Their own shepherds don't care about them! 6I won't have mercy on people like that. I'll let them fall into each other's hands and the hands of their king. They'll ruin the land, and I won't protect it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So I began pasturing the flock that was doomed to slaughter by the ones that trafficked in sheep. I took two staffs; I called one Favor and the other Unity, and I tended the flock with them. 8I fired three worthless shepherds in one month. I also lost patience with the sheep, and they lost interest in me. 9I told them, "I won't pasture you anymore. What's to die will die; what's to be destroyed will be destroyed. The rest will eat one another."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The staff I called Favor I cut in pieces to demonstrate that I was breaking the covenant I'd made with all the nations. 11That day, the ones that trafficked in sheep realized Yahveh was acting out a message through me. 12I told them, "If you want, pay me; if not, keep it!" So they weighed out 12 oz 30 shekels of silver to pay me. 13Yahveh told me, "Throw them to the potter, that grand value they put on me!" So I threw them to the potter in Yahveh's Temple. 14Then I cut in pieces the staff I called Unity to demonstrate that I was breaking the alliance between Judah and Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh told me, "Again, dress up like a worthless shepherd. 16I'm going to show the land a picture of a shepherd that won't take care of the dying, look for the strays, heal the injured, or feed the healthy. He'll eat the healthy ones and tear off their hoofs. 17"Misfortune awaits the worthless shepherd that deserts the flock! A sword will cut his arm and poke out his right eye! His arm will wither, and his right eye will go blind."</span>
