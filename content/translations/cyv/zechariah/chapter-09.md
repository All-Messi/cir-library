## Zechariah Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh Against the Land of Hadrach [<em>Aram</em>] The message from Yahveh is against Damascus—for the eyes of all people, including the tribes of Israel, are on Yahveh—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>against Hamath, which borders it, and against Tyre and Sidon, though they’re so very wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Tyre built a fortress, piled up silver like dust, and gold like dirt on the streets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Yahveh will confiscate its possessions, throw its wealth into the sea; and burn it down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza will writhe in anguish; Ekron, too, because it’s lost hope; Gaza won’t have a king; Ashkelon will be empty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Ashdod will house a mongrel race; I’ll destroy the Philistines’ pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I’ll remove the blood from their mouths and the disgusting things from between their teeth. They’ll be a remnant for our God, like a clan in Judah; Ekron will be like Jebusites.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Zech 9:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>I’ll camp around my Temple to protect it so <em>armies</em> can’t walk all over my people; oppressors won’t run over them anymore because I’m watching. <strong>Zion’s Coming King</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Celebrate, Zion! Shout, Jerusalem! Your king is coming to you, just and able to save, humble and riding on a donkey, <em>on </em>a colt, a donkey’s foal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>I’ll get rid of chariots in Ephraim, warhorses in Jerusalem, and the bow used in battle. I’ll offer peace to the nations and rule from sea to sea, from the <em>Euphrates </em>River to the ends of the earth.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Zech 9:8-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Because of my covenant with you, sealed with blood, I’ve freed your prisoners from the dry cistern.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Come back to the fortress, all you prisoners that still have hope; I promise to restore you double today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>I’ll bend Judah like my bow; Ephraim will be my arrow. I’ll stir up Zion against Greece and wield you like a sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Yahveh will appear above them; his arrows will shoot like lightning. He’ll blow the bugle and march in the windstorm from the south.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Zech 9:11-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Yahveh of Hosts will defend <em>his </em><em>people</em>; they’ll trample the stone slingers. They’ll drink <em>their</em><em> </em><em>blood</em><sup>lxx</sup><sup> </sup>and be boisterous as with wine, filled like a <em>sacrificial</em> basin, <em>d</em><em>renched</em> like the horns on the altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Yahveh their God will save them then like a flock of his sheep, like jewels in a crown, sparkling in his land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>How nice things will be! Grain will make the young men thrive; new wine <em>will </em><em>make</em><em> </em>the maidens <em>flourish</em>.<strong>	</strong></span>
