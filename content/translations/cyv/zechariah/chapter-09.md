## Zechariah Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh Against the Land of Hadrach [Aram] The message from Yahveh is against Damascus—for the eyes of all people, including the tribes of Israel, are on Yahveh—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> against Hamath, which borders it, and against Tyre and Sidon, though they're so very wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tyre built a fortress, piled up silver like dust, and gold like dirt on the streets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh will confiscate its possessions, throw its wealth into the sea; and burn it down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza will writhe in anguish; Ekron, too, because it's lost hope; Gaza won't have a king; Ashkelon will be empty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Ashdod will house a mongrel race; I'll destroy the Philistines' pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll remove the blood from their mouths and the disgusting things from between their teeth. They'll be a remnant for our God, like a clan in Judah; Ekron will be like Jebusites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll camp around my Temple to protect it so armies can't walk all over my people; oppressors won't run over them anymore because I'm watching. Zion's Coming King</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Celebrate, Zion! Shout, Jerusalem! Your king is coming to you, just and able to save, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, a donkey's foal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll get rid of chariots in Ephraim, warhorses in Jerusalem, and the bow used in battle. I'll offer peace to the nations and rule from sea to sea, from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Because of my covenant with you, sealed with blood, I've freed your prisoners from the dry cistern.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Come back to the fortress, all you prisoners that still have hope; I promise to restore you double today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll bend Judah like my bow; Ephraim will be my arrow. I'll stir up Zion against Greece and wield you like a sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh will appear above them; his arrows will shoot like lightning. He'll blow the bugle and march in the windstorm from the south.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh of Hosts will defend his people; they'll trample the stone slingers. They'll drink their bloodlxx and be boisterous as with wine, filled like a sacrificial basin, drenched like the horns on the altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh their God will save them then like a flock of his sheep, like jewels in a crown, sparkling in his land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> How nice things will be! Grain will make the young men thrive; new wine will make the maidens flourish. Yahveh Will Restore His People</span>
