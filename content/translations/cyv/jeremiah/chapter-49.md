## Jeremiah Chapter 49

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About Ammon Yahveh says, "Doesn't Israel have any descendants? Doesn't he have an heir? Why then has Malcam/Milcom taken possession of Gad, and his people settled in its towns?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The time's coming when I'll raise the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It'll be a desolate mound; its towns will be burned, Then Israel will expel the ones that expelled him. 3"Wail, Heshbon, because Ai is destroyed! Cry out, young women of Rabbah; put on burlap and lament; run back and forth inside the walls. Malcam/Milcom will go into exile along with his priests and officials.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Why do you brag about your fertile valleys? Your valleys are flowing away, unfaithful daughter that trusts in her treasures and says, 'Who's going to attack me?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'm going to bring terror on you from every direction. Every one of you will be driven out headlong with nobody to round up the refugees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yet later I'll restore Ammon's fortunes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> About Edom Yahveh of hosts says, "Is there no wisdom in Teman? Has good advice disappeared from the prudent? Has its wisdom declined?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Turn around, run away, live deep in the deserts, people in Dedan, because I'll bring disaster on Esau when I punish him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If grape-gatherers come to you, wouldn't they leave some gleanings? If thieves came at night, wouldn't they destroy only enough for themselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But I'll strip bare Esau's land and expose its hiding places so its people can't hide. Its inhabitants will be killed, relatives and friends; its land won't be alive anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But leave its orphans behind; I'll keep them alive; its widows will need to depend on me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh says, "If the ones that didn't deserve the cup have to drink it, will you be let off? You will drink it! 13I've sworn by myself that Bozrah will be something to abhor, a disgrace, a ruin, a curse. Its towns will lie in permanent ruins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I've heard a message from Yahveh; a messenger is going among the nations and says, "Gather together and attack it; rise up for battle!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll make you small among the nations; people will despise you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The terror you inspired has deceived you into an arrogant attitude, you that live in the clefts of the rock, that occupy the height of a hill. Though you make your nest high like an eagle's, I'll bring you down from there. 17"Edom will be something to abhor. Everybody that goes past it will be horrified and hiss at its wounds. 18Like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, and its neighbors, nobody will live there. 19Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I'll chase everybody away from it. I'll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me.  20So listen to Yahveh's plan for Edom, his intentions for Teman. They'll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 21The ground will shake at their downfall. The outcry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea. 22It's enemy will soar high and swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom's mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> About Damascus "Hamath and Arpad are in panic; they've heard bad news. They're disheartened; their anxiety rages like a sea that can't be quieted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Damascus is helpless; Its people have fled. Panic, anguish, and pain have gripped it like a woman in labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> How that famous city has been deserted, the city of my joy!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Its young men will fall in its streets; its soldiers will go silent that day," Yahveh of Hosts says. 27"I'll set fire to the walls of Damascus that will burn down Benhadad's fortified towers."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> About Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor That Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon Defeated "Attack Kedar; destroy the people from the east.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They'll take away their tents and flocks, their ornate tent curtains, goods, and camels. They'll cry out, 'There's terror everywhere!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Run! Flee! Live in deep caves, people in Hazor," 			Yahveh says.		Jer 49:28-30a "Nebuchadnezzar has devised a plan against you and plotted a scheme:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> to attack a nation that's at ease, that lives securely, that doesn't have gates or bars, that lives apart by itself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Their camels will be plunder; their livestock will be spoil. I'll scatter to the winds those who clip the hair on their temples and bring catastrophe from every direction," Yahveh says. 33"Hazor will be a haunt for jackals, a permanent wasteland. Nobody will live there."					Jer 49:30b-33</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About Elam at the Beginning of the Reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah 35"Yahveh of Hosts says, 'I'm going to break the bow of Elam, the main weapon of their power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> I'm going to bring on Elam the four winds from the four ends of the sky. I'll scatter them to all those winds; there won't be any nation the refugees from Elam can flee to.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> I'll scatter Elam ahead the enemies that want to kill them. I'll bring catastrophe on them, my fierce anger. I'll send out the sword after them till I've consumed them all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then I'll set my throne in Elam and destroy its king and officials.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Yet later I'll restore Elam's fortunes.'"</span>
