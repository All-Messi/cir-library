## Jeremiah Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah at the <strong>Time of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</strong> 	<strong>The Obedience of the Racabites</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“Go</em><em> bring the Rechabites to a room in Yahveh’s Temple and offer them wine.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I took Jaazaniah Ben-Jeremiah Ben-Habazziniah, his brothers and sons—the whole family of Rechabites—<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>to Yahveh’s Temple to the office for the sons of Hanan Ben-Igdaliah, the man of God. It was close to the officials’ quarters, above the room for Maaseiah Ben-Shallum, the doorkeeper. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I put pitchers of wine and cups in front of the Rechabites, <em>“Have a drink!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But they said, <em>“We won’t drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab/</em>Jehonadab<em> Ben-Rechab told us, ‘Never drink wine, you or your descendants, forever</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> build houses, sow </em><em>seed</em><em>, plant vineyards, or own them. Live in tents so you’ll live a long time in the land.’ </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>We</em><em>, our wives, sons, and daughters have obeyed him. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> don’t build houses or own vineyards, fields, or seed. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> live in tents. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the land, we came to Jerusalem before the Babylonian and Syrian armies got here. </em><em>So</em><em> we’ve been living in Jerusalem.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 35:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to Jeremiah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,<em> </em> <em>“Tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Won’t you receive instruction and listen to me? </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> descendants of Jonadab still observe his command not to drink wine. I’ve spoken to you time and again, but you’ve ignored me. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> sent you prophets time and again and said, “Turn from your sinful way, correct your deeds, stop worshiping other gods so you can live in the land I’ve given you and your ancestors.” But you’ve ignored me. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Jonadab’s</em><em> descendants have observed their ancestor’s command, but you’ve ignored me. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>So</em><em>, I’m bringing on Judah and Jerusalem the disaster I’ve threatened. </em> <em>	I spoke to them, but they ignored </em><em>me;</em><em> </em> <em>	I called out to them, but they didn’t answer.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jeremiah told the Rechabites, <em>“Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘Because you’ve obeyed Jonadab, </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>he’ll</em><em> always have descendants to serve me.’”</em> <strong>	  35:12-19</strong></span>
