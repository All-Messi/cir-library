## Jeremiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wander back and forth in the streets in Jerusalem; search all around in it. Look in its open squares: if you can find one honest person, one that looks for the truth, I'll pardon it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Although they swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives,' they don't mean it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh, aren't you looking for honesty?						You've struck them, but they didn't feel anything; you've consumed them, but they've refused to be corrected; they've set their faces like stone and refused to repent."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then I said, "They're poor and foolish,							because they don't know the way of Yahveh							or the ordinance of their God.							5I'll go to their leaders and speak to them;								surely they know the way of Yahveh, what their God requires. As a group, their leaders have broken his yoke off and kicked his traces.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So a lion from the woods will kill them; a wolf from the desert will destroy them; a leopard is watching their towns, ready to maul anyone that ventures out, because their sins are many, their apostasies. numerous. 7"Why should I pardon you? Your offspring have left me and sworn by what aren't gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to houses of prostitution.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each one neighing for his neighbor's mare.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Won't I punish them and avenge myself on a nation like that?" Yahveh says. 10"Go through its rows of grapevines and cut down all but a few; strip away their branches because they don't belong to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Israel and Judah have dealt deviously with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They've misjudged me and said,							'He won't do anything;									misfortune won't fall on us;								we won't see sword or famine.							13His prophets are windbags;								they don't have any message from him.'						Indeed, those things will happen to them!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So Yahveh God of hosts says. "Since they've claimed that, I'll make my word fire in your mouth, make these people kindling, and burn them up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll bring a distant nation against you, Israel, an ancient, enduring one whose language you don't know, whose speech you can't understand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Their quiver is like an open grave; they're all powerful men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They'll eat your harvest and your food, kill your children, eat your flocks and herds, eat the fruit on your grapevines and fig trees, and destroy with the sword the fortified towns you rely on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yet even at that time," Yahveh says, "I won't destroy you completely. 19When they say, 'Why has Yahveh our God done this to us?' tell them, 'As you've left me and served foreign gods in your country, so you'll serve foreigners in someone else's country.' 20"Tell Jacob, announce it in Judah, 						21'Foolish, senseless people, listen to this,							you that have eyes, but don't see,									and ears, but don't hear,						22You're not going to respect me?								You're not going to tremble in my presence?'"								Yahveh says.        		  Jer 5:20-22a "I've made sand a boundary for the ocean,							an eternal decree it can't cross;				though the waves toss and roar, they can't wash over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But my people have a stubborn, rebellious heart;						they've turned aside and left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They don't say in their hearts, 'Let's respect Yahveh our God, who sends rain in its season, autumn and spring, who keeps for us the set weeks for harvest.'	Jer 5:22b-24</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Your iniquities have deprived you of those things; your sins have robbed you of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Sinners among my people lie in wait like fowlers in a blind; they set traps to catch people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; that's how they've become important and rich.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They're healthy and sleek, excelling in sinful things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Won't I punish them? won't I avenge myself on a nation like that?" Yahveh says. 30"A shocking, horrible thing is happening in the land;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> the prophets prophesy falsely, the priests rule on their own authority, and my people like it that way! But how will this end for you? Jerusalem Under Siege</span>
