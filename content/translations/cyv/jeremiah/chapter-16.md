## Jeremiah Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, That Came to Me Day of Disaster 2"Don't get married or have children here." 3This is what Yahveh says about children born here and their parents, 4"They'll die from disease, not mourned or buried. They'll come to an end by sword and famine, and lie like manure on the ground. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and the scavengers on the ground. 5"Don't go in a house to mourn with people, cry, or console them. From this nation I've withdrawn my peace, my enduring love, my mercy. 6From least to greatest will die in the land. There won't be any friends to bury them, mourn for them, cut themselves, or shave their head for them. 7People won't offer them a meal to comfort them in mourning or give them a cup to drink to console them for their father or mother.  8Don't go to sit and eat with them. 9I'm going to eliminate celebration and happiness here, the happy voices of bride and groom. 10"When you tell people that, they'll say, 'Why has Yahveh our God declared so much catastrophe on us? What did we do to him?' 11Tell them, 'Your ancestors abandoned me for other gods, bowed to them, served them, and didn't keep my Law. 12You've done worse than they did, following your own stubborn hearts and ignoring me. 13So I'm going to expel you from this land to one where you and your ancestors have never been. You'll serve other gods there because I won't help you. Hope Despite Disaster 14"The time's coming when people won't swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.' 15They'll swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites back from the countries up north where he'd banished them.' I will return them to the land I gave their ancestors. 16"I'll send lots of fishermen to fish for them, lots of hunters to hunt for them in every mountain, hill, and cave. 17I see what they're doing; their sin's not hid from me. 18But first I'll doubly repay their sin because they've polluted my permanent possession with the carcasses of their detestable idols and carved images." Jeremiah's Praye</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh, my strength and fortress my refuge in troubled times, nations around the world will come to you and say, "We didn't inherit anything but lies from our ancestors, foolish idols that can't do anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Can mortals make gods? Things like that aren't gods!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So Yahveh says, "Now I'll show them my strength and power; at last they'll learn that I'm Yahveh." Judah's Sin</span>
