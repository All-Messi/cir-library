## Jeremiah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God says, "If a husband divorces his wife and she marries another man, will he take her back? Wouldn't that pollute the land? But you're a prostitute with lots of lovers; yet you turn back to me to get help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Look up at the barren hills; where haven't you committed adultery? You sit by the roads waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. You pollute the land with your sinful prostitution.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So I've withheld showers; spring rain hasn't come; yet you're a brazen prostitute that refuses to be ashamed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Haven't you called out to me just now, 'Father, you're the friend I had when I was young'? 5'Are you going to stay angry forever? Are you always going to be offended?'" Judah Follows Unfaithful Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At the time of King Josiah, Yahveh said to me: "Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She's gone up on every tall hill and carried on her prostitution under every green tree. 7I thought that after she'd done that, she'd come back to me. But she didn't, and her unfaithful sister saw it. 8I gave Israel divorce papers and sent her away for her adultery, but her unfaithful sister Judah wasn't afraid. She left and became a prostitute too. 9Because prostitution was a small matter to her, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. 10Despite all this, her unfaithful sister Judah didn't come back to me with all her heart, only in pretense." Hope Even for Unfaithful Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh told me: "Unfaithful Israel has proved to be more upright than unfaithful Judah. 12Go deliver this message toward the north, 'Come back, unfaithful Israel; I won't stay angry forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Just own up to your unfaithfulness to me; you scattered your favors to foreigners under every green tree, and you haven't obeyed me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Come back, unfaithful children, because I'm your master. I'll bring back to Zion one from this town and two from that family.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you knowledge and insight. 16When you've multiplied in the land, they won't say anymore 'The Ark of Yahveh's covenant.' It won't be remembered or missed or remade. 17At that time, they'll call Jerusalem The Throne of Yahveh. All the nations will gather there to be in his presence. They'll stop following their stubborn, sinful hearts. 18Judah will follow Israel; together they'll come back from exile in the north to the land I gave their ancestors. 19"Then I said how I'd include you among my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance in the world! I said, 'Call me "Father" and not turn aside from following me.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But like an unfaithful wife that leaves her husband, you've been unfaithful to me, Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> On the barren hills is the sound of Israel's people crying and pleading because they've perverted their way and forgotten their God. 22"Come back, unfaithful children; I'll heal your unfaithfulness." "We're coming back to you because you're our God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The hills are a delusion, the orgies on them as well. Truly, in Yahveh our God lies Israel's salvation. 24"But from the time we were young, shameful things have consumed our ancestors' labors, flocks and herds, sons and daughters. 25Let's lie down in our shame and cover ourselves with our humiliation. We and our ancestors have sinned against Yahveh our God. We haven't obeyed him."</span>
