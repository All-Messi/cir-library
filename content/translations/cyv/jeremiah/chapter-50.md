## Jeremiah Chapter 50

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message Yahveh Spoke About Babylon, the Land of the Babylonians, Through the Prophet Jeremiah: 2"Announce it among the nations; hoist a standard everyone can see: 'Babylon has been captured, Bel humbled, Marduk shattered, its images disgraced, its idols smashed.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A nation has come down against it from the north. It will make the land something to abhor; nobody will live there. People and animals will wander off. 4"At that time, Israel and Judah will return home. They'll go along weeping, looking for Yahveh their God. 5They'll ask how to get to Zion and turn in that direction to join Yahveh in an everlasting covenant they won't forget. 6"My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds had led them astray and abandoned them on the mountains. They've gone along from mountain to hill and lost track of their resting place. 7Everyone that came at them has devoured them. Their enemies have said, 'We didn't do anything wrong; they'd sinned against Yahveh, where goodness lives, who was their ancestors' hope.' 8"Wander away from Babylon and leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like male goats at the head of the flock. 9I'm going to bring against Babylon a horde of great nations from farther north. They'll draw up their battle lines and capture it. Their arrows will fly from skilled soldiers that won't come back empty-handed. 10Babylonia will become plunder. Those who plunder it will gather as much as they want," 	Yahveh says. 11"Though you're happy and jubilant now, you that plundered my permanent possession, though you run around like a heifer on grass and neigh like a stallion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> your mother will be ashamed; she that bore you will be humiliated. She'll be the least of the nations, a parched wilderness, a desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Because of Yahveh's anger, Babylon will be empty, completely desolate. Everybody that goes past it will be appalled and gasp at its wounds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Draw up your battle lines on every side of Babylon, you that bend the bow. Shoot at it; don't spare your arrows because it's sinned against Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Raise your battle cry at it everywhere! It has given up; its pillars have fallen; its walls have been torn down. This is Yahveh's revenge: carry out that revenge on it; do to it what it's done to others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Eliminate the sower from Babylon and the one that swings the sickle at harvest time. Each one will retreat from the sword back to their own people; they'll flee to their own land. 17"Israel is like a flock driven away and scattered by lions. The king of Assyria devoured it first. Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, broke its bones. 18So Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 'I'm going to punish Babylon like I punished Assyria. 19I'll bring Israel back to his pasture so he can graze on Carmel and Bashan. He'll eat as much as he wants in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 20At that time, they'll search for Israel's iniquity and Judah's sin, but they won't find any. That's because I'll pardon the ones I'm leaving as a remnant.' 21"Go up against the land of Merathaim and the people in Pekod. Slay and destroy them," Yahveh says. "Do everything I've commanded you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The noise of battle is in the land and great destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> How the sledgehammer of the whole world has been cut off and broken! How Babylon has become something to abhor among the countries!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I set a snare for you and caught you, Babylon, while you weren't watching. You've been found and captured because you've engaged Yahveh in conflict."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahvehhas opened his armory and brought out his weapons of wrath. This is his work against the Babylonians.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Attack it from the farthest border; open your arms, pile it in heaps, destroy it. Don't leave anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Kill its young bulls with the sword; let them go down to slaughter! Misfortune awaits them because their time has come, the time for their punishment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> There's the sound of fugitives from Babylon; it speaks of Yahveh's revenge for his Temple. 29"Summon many nations against Babylon, every one that bends the bow; camp against it all the way around; don't let anyone escape. Repay it according to its work; do to it everything it has done, because it's been arrogant against Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> So its young men will fall in its streets; its fighting men will fall silent then.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> I'm against you, arrogant one; it's time for me to punish you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall with nobody to help him up. I'll set fire to his towns and consume his surroundings."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Yahveh of hosts says, "Israel is oppressed, Judah as well. All who have taken them captive have held onto them fast and won't let go.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Their redeemer is strong; his name is Yahveh of Hosts. He'll certainly argue their case and give rest to their land; he'll bring unrest to the people in Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> A sword against them, their officials and wise men!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> A sword against their fortunetellers so they'll become fools! A sword against their fighting men so they'll be shattered!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> A sword against their horses and chariots, against the foreigners in it so they'll become women! A sword against its treasures so they'll be plundered!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> A drought to dry up its water because it's a land of idols, and they're crazy about their idols 39"So the desert animals will live there along with jackals and owls. Nobody will ever live in it again 40as when I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors. 41"People are coming from the north; a big empire with many kings will rise up from the remote parts of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They take hold of bow and javelin; they're cruel with no mercy. They roar like the sea; they ride on horses, arrayed against you like soldiers for battle, Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> The king of Babylon has heard the reports about them, and his hands hang limp; anguish has seized him, agony like a woman in childbirth. 44"Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I'll chase everyone away from it in an instant. I'll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> So listen to what Yahveh has planned for Babylon and the Babylonians. They'll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 46At the shout, "Babylon's been captured!" the ground will shake. The nations will hear the shout.</span>
