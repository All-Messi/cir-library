<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message Yahveh Spoke About Babylon, the Land of the Babylonians, Through the Prophet Jeremiah: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Announce</em><em> </em><em>it </em><em>among the </em><em>nations</em><em>;</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>hoist</em><em> a standard</em><em> everyone can see</em><em>:</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	‘Babylon has been captured,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	 Bel humbled,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>Marduk shattered</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em> </em><em>	i</em><em>ts images </em><em>disgraced,</em> <em>	</em><em>	  </em><em>	</em><em>	 </em><em>its idols </em><em>smashed</em><em>.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup><em>A</em><em> nation has come down against it from the north.</em><em> </em><em>It will make the land </em><em>something to abhor</em><em>; nobody will live there.</em><em> People</em><em> and animal</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>will wander off</em><em>.</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“At</em><em> that time, Israel and Judah will return home. They’ll go along weeping, looking for Yahveh their God. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> ask how to get to Zion and turn in that direction to join Yahveh in an everlasting covenant they won’t forget.</em><strong>  </strong><strong>	</strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

### 6“My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds had led them astray and abandoned them on the mountains. They’ve gone along from mountain to hill and lost track of their resting place. 7Everyone that came at them has devoured them. Their enemies have said, ‘We didn’t do anything wrong; they’d sinned against Yahveh, where goodness lives, who was their ancestors’ hope.’ 8“Wander away from Babylon and leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like male goats at the head of the flock. 9I’m going to bring against Babylon a horde of great nations from farther north. They’ll draw up their battle lines and capture it. Their arrows will fly from skilled soldiers that won’t come back empty-handed. 10Babylonia will become plunder. Those who plunder it will gather as much as they want,” 	Yahveh says. 	Jer 50:6-10 11“Though you’re happy and jubilant now, 		you that plundered my permanent possession, 	though you run around like a heifer on grass 		and neigh like a stallion,


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>your</em><em> mother will be </em><em>ashamed;</em> <em>	she that bore you will be humiliated.</em> <em>	She’ll be the least of the nations, </em> <em>	</em><em>	a parched wilderness, a desert.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>Because</em><em> of Yahveh’s anger,</em> <em>	</em>Babylon<em> will be empty,</em> <em>	completely desolate.</em> <em>Everybody that goes past it will be appalled</em> <em>	and gasp at its wounds.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>Draw</em><em> up your battle lines on every side of Babylon,</em> <em>	you that bend the bow.</em> <em>Shoot at it; don’t spare your arrows</em> <em>	because it’s sinned against Yahveh.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 50:11-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup><em>Raise</em><em> your battle cry at it everywhere!</em> <em>	It has given up; its pillars have </em><em>fallen;</em> <em>	its walls have been torn down.</em> <em>This is Yahveh’s revenge:</em> <em>	carry out that revenge on </em><em>it;</em> <em>	</em><em>do</em><em> to it what it’s done to others.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>Eliminate</em><em> the </em><em>sower</em><em> from Babylon</em> <em>	and the one that swings the sickle at harvest time.</em> <em>	</em><em>	Each one will retreat from the sword</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	back to their own </em><em>people;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	they’ll flee to their own land.</em><strong>	</strong></span>

### 17“Israel is like a flock driven away and scattered by lions. The king of Assyria devoured it first. Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, broke its bones. 18So Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m going to punish Babylon like I punished Assyria. 19I’ll bring Israel back to his pasture so he can graze on Carmel and Bashan. He’ll eat as much as he wants in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 20At that time, they’ll search for Israel’s iniquity and Judah’s sin, but they won’t find any. That’s because I’ll pardon the ones I’m leaving as a remnant.’          		  Jer 50:17-20 21“Go up against the land of Merathaim 	and the people in Pekod. Slay and destroy them,” Yahveh says. 	“Do everything I’ve commanded you.


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> noise of battle is in the land</em> <em>	and great destruction.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>How</em><em> the sledgehammer of the whole world</em> <em>	has been cut off and broken!</em> <em>How Babylon has become</em> <em>	something to abhor among the countries!</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 50:21-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> set a snare for you and caught you, Babylon,</em> <em>	while you weren’t watching.</em> <em>You’ve been found and captured</em> <em>	because you’ve engaged Yahveh in conflict.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Yahvehhas opened his armory and brought out his weapons of wrath. This is his work against the Babylonians.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Attack it from the farthest border; open your arms, pile it in heaps, destroy it. Don’t leave anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Kill its young bulls with the sword; let them go down to slaughter! Misfortune awaits them because their time has come, the time for their punishment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>There’s the sound of fugitives from Babylon; it speaks of Yahveh’s revenge for his Temple.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 50:24-28</p>

### 29“Summon many nations against Babylon, 	every one that bends the bow; camp against it all the way around; 	don’t let anyone escape. Repay it according to its work; 	do to it everything it has done, 	because it’s been arrogant against Yahveh, 		the Holy One of Israel.


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> its young men will fall in its </em><em>streets;</em> <em>	its fighting men will fall silent then.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup><em>I’m</em><em> against you, arrogant </em><em>one;</em> <em>	it’s time for me to punish you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> arrogant one will stumble and fall</em> <em>	with nobody to help him up.</em> <em>I’ll set fire to his towns</em> <em>	and consume his surroundings.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>Yahveh of hosts says, <em>	“Israel is oppressed,</em> <em>	</em><em>	Judah as well.</em> <em>	All who have taken them captive</em> <em>	</em><em>	have held onto them fast</em> <em>	</em><em>	and won’t let go.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup><em>Their</em><em> redeemer is </em><em>strong;</em> <em>	</em><em><u>his name is </u></em><em><u>Yahveh of Hosts</u></em>. <em>	He’ll certainly argue their case</em> <em>	</em><em>	and give rest to their </em><em>land;</em> <em>	he’ll bring unrest to the </em><em>people in Babylon</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup><em>A</em><em> sword against their </em><em><u>fortunetellers</u></em> so <em>they’ll become fools!</em> <em>A sword against their </em><em><u>fighting men</u></em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>so</em><em> they’ll be shattered!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup><em>A</em><em> sword against their </em><em><u>horses and chariots</u></em><em>,</em> <em>	against the </em><em><u>foreigners in it</u></em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>so</em><em> they’ll become women!</em> <em>	A sword against its </em><em><u>treasures </u></em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>so</em><em> they’ll be plundered!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup><em>A</em><em> drought to dry up its </em><em><u>water</u></em><em> </em> <em>	because it’s a land of idols,</em> <em>	and they’re crazy about their idols</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>So</em><em> the desert animals will live there along with jackals and owls.

### 41“People are coming from the north; 	a big empire with many kings 	will rise up from the remote parts of the earth.


<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> take hold of bow and </em><em>javelin;</em> <em>	they’re cruel with no mercy.</em> <em>They roar like the sea; they ride on horses,</em> <em>	arrayed against you like soldiers for battle, Babylon.</em></span>

### 44“Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I’ll chase everyone away from it in an instant. I’ll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me?”


<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup><strong>So</strong><strong> listen to what </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong> has planned </strong>for Babylon and the Babylonians. <strong>They’ll drag off the little ones in the flock</strong><strong> and empty</strong><strong> the pasture</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong>At the shout, <em>“Babylon</em><em>’</em><em>s been </em><em>captured</em><em>!”</em> the ground will shake.
