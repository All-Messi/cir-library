## Jeremiah Chapter 51

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "I'm going to stir up the spirit of the destroyer against Babylon and the people in Leb-kamai.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll send foreign winnowers to Babylon to devastate its land. On every side they'll oppose it at the time of its catastrophe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let the defending archer not bend his bow or stand in his coat of mail. Don't spare the young men; devote the whole army to destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They'll fall down dead in the land of the Babylonians, pierced through in their streets."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God, Yahveh of Hosts, has not abandoned Israel and Judah even though their land is full of guilt in front of the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Escape from Babylon; save yourselves! Don't get destroyed in its punishment; this is Yahveh's revenge; he's going to render retribution to it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Babylon has been a gold cup in Yahveh's hand, intoxicating the whole region. The nations have drunk its wine; so they're acting crazy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> All of a sudden Babylon has fallen! Wail for it! Bring salve to heal its pain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> We tried to heal Babylon, but it didn't heal; so abandon it and get to your own country. Its judgment has reached heaven; it towers as high as the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yahveh has brought about our vindication; let's recount in Zion the work of Yahveh our God!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Sharpen the arrows, fill the quills! Yahveh has stirred up the kings of the Medes to destroy Babylon. It's Yahveh's revenge for his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Raise up a standard against the walls of Babylon; post a strong guard, station sentries, set men in ambush! It's Yahveh's revenge for his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You that live by lots of water, abundant in treasures, your end has come; your life cord's been cut.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh of Hosts has sworn by himself: "I'll fill you with soldiers like locusts; they'll raise shouts of victory over you." A Hymn of Praise to Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He's the One that made the earth by his power, that established the world by his wisdom, that stretched out the sky with his intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When he speaks, there's thunder in the rain above; he makes clouds rise up from the horizon, makes lightning for the rain, and brings wind out of his storehouses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Every mortal is stupid and ignorant; goldsmiths are disgraced by their idols because their molten images misrepresent; they can't even breathe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They're worthless objects to ridicule; when they're punished, they perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jacob's portion is not like theirs. His God has made everything; Israel is his inheritance; his name is Yahveh of Hosts. Babylon's Destruction 20"You're my battle-ax and weapon; I'll shatter nations with you; I'll destroy kingdoms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'll break horse and rider in pieces,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> chariot and occupant, man and woman, young and old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> With you I'll destroy shepherd and flock, farmer and ox team, governors and prefects. 24"I'll repay Babylon and the Babylonians for the devastation they've brought on Zion right in my presence," 	Yahveh says. 25"I'm against you, destroying mountain that destroys the world. I'll reach out against you and roll you down from the crags and make you a burned-out ruble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They won't reuse from you a cornerstone or foundation stone. You'll be as permanent wasteland."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Set up a standard in the land; blow the bugle among the nations. Consecrate the nations against it; summon Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against it; bring on horses like bristling locusts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Prepare the nations against it, the kings of the Medes, their governors and officials, and every land they control.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> So the ground shakes because Yahveh's intention against Babylon stands: to make it an uninhabited wasteland.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they're staying in the barracks. They've used up their strength and become like women. Their houses are on fire; the bars of its gates are broken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> One courier runs to another, one ambassador runs to another to tell the king of Babylon his city's been captured from end to end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They've seized the fords; they've burned the fortifications; the army is in panic.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "Babylon is like a threshing floor tamped firm; in a little while threshing will begin on it. 34"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has devoured me and crushed me. He has set me down like an empty cup, swallowed me like a monster, filled his stomach with my delicacies, and rinsed me out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Zion will say, "May the violence done to us be done to Babylon." Jerusalem will say, "May my blood be on the people in Babylon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> So Yahveh says, "I'll argue your case and take full revenge for you; I'll dry up its River and dry up its oasis.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Babylon will be a pile of rubble, a den for jackals, something to abhor and gasp at; nobody will live there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> They'll roar together like young lions; they'll growl like lion cubs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When they get hungry, I'll serve them their banquet. I'll make them drunk till they pass out and put them to sleep forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> I'll bring them down like lambs to slaughter, like rams and male goats for sacrifice. 41"How Sheshak has been captured! What the whole world praised has been seized! How Babylon has become something to abhor among the nations!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The River has flooded Babylon, swamped it in crashing waves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Its towns have become something to abhor, a parched land, a desert, a land where nobody lives and nobody visits.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> I'll punish Bel in Babylon and make him vomit what he's swallowed. The nations won't stream to him anymore; even Babylon's walls have fallen down! 45"Get out of there, my people! save yourselves from myY fury!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Don't let your heart faint; don't be afraid at the report in the land when a report comes one year, another one comes a year later, and violence is in the land with ruler against ruler.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> So the time's coming when I'll punish the idols in Babylon. Its whole land will be disgraced; its slain will fall inside it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Earth and sky and everything in them will shout for joy over Babylon, because its destroyers will come from the north," Yahveh says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Babylon will fall in payment for the slain in Israel and the whole region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> You that have escaped the sword, leave! Don't stay! Remember Yahveh from afar and keep Jerusalem in your mind. 51We're ashamed because we've heard reproof; disgrace shows on our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places in Yahveh's Temple. 52"So the time's coming when I'll punish its idols, and the mortally wounded will groan throughout its land. 53Even if Babylon ascends to the sky and fortifies its lofty fortress, destroyers will come to it from me," Yahveh says. 54There's an outcry from Babylon, great destruction in the land of the Babylonians! 55Yahveh is going to destroy it and quiet its loud noise. The waves of enemies will roar, and the noise from their uproar will increase. 56The destroyer is coming against Babylon; he'll capture its strong men. Yahveh is a God that exacts recompense; he'll fully repay. 57"I'll make its officials and wise men drunk, its governors, officers, and strong men too; they'll sleep forever," the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts. 58"Babylon's thick walls will be completely torn down, its massive gates set on fire; so the nations will have worked for nothing; the builders will have worn themselves out only to get their work burned." 59The Message Jeremiah Gave to Seraiah Ben-Neriah, Grandson of Mahseiah, When He Went with Zedekiah, King of Judah, to Babylon in the Fourth Year of His Reign (Seraiah Was Quartermaster.) 60Jeremiah wrote in one scroll the catastrophe to come on Babylon. 61He told Seraiah, "As soon as you get to Babylon, read this message out loud: 62'Yahveh, you've promised to cut this place off so nothing will live in it, people or animals, so it'll be a permanent desolation.' 63As soon as you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. 64Say, 'In the same way, Babylon will sink and not float back up because of the catastrophe I'm going to bring on it. The workers will have worn themselves out for nothing.'" Jeremiah's message ends here. The Fall of Jerusalem</span>
