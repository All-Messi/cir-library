## Jeremiah Chapter 38

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Shephatiah Ben-Mattan, Gedaliah Ben-Pashhur, Jucal Ben-Shelemiah, and Pashhur Ben-Malchijah heard what Jeremiah was telling the people:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The officials told the king, <em>“Execute him. He’s discouraging the fighting men in the city and the people by telling them things like that. He’s not looking out for their welfare, but their harm.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> King Zedekiah said, <em>“Do with him whatever you want.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They put Jeremiah in a cistern that belonged to Malchijah the king’s son in the court of the guardhouse. They let him down with ropes. There wasn’t any water in it, but he sank in the mud. <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jer 38:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But Ebed-melech the Nubian, a eunuch in the king’s palace, heard they’d put him in the cistern. The king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Ebed-melech left the palace to speak to him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The king said, <em>“Take 30 men from here under your authority and get him out before he dies.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So Ebed-melech took them to a place under the storeroom in the king’s palace. They took worn-out clothes and rags, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Put</em><em> these under your arms over the ropes.” </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They pulled him up out of the cistern, and he remained in the court of the guardhouse.<strong>	    </strong><strong> Jer 38:7-13</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought to the third entrance of Yahveh’s Temple, <em>“I’m going to ask you something. Don’t keep back anything from me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jeremiah said, <em>“If I tell you, won’t you put me to death? If I give you advice, you won’t take it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But King Zedekiah swore to him privately, <em>“As sure as Yahveh lives who made this life for us, I won’t put you to death or turn you over to the ones who want to kill you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So Jeremiah said, <em>“Yahveh God of hosts says, ‘You’ll live if you go out to the officials of Babylon. The city won’t be burned, and you and your household will survive. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you don’t </em>surrender<em>, the city will fall, they’ll burn it, and you won’t escape.’”</em><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>Jer 38:14-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> King Zedekiah said, <em>“I’m afraid the Jews that have deserted to the Babylonians may turn me over to them, and they’ll torture me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> <em>They’ll</em><em> bring out your wives and sons to the Babylonians, and you won’t escape. The king of Babylon will capture you and burn the city</em>.<em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Zedekiah told Jeremiah, <em>“Don’t tell anybody what you’ve said, and you won’t die. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> the officials hear that I’ve talked to you, ‘Tell us what you and the king talked about; don’t keep back any of it from us, and we won’t put you to death’; </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> tell them, ‘I pleaded with the king not to put me back in Jonathan’s house to die.’” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then the officials came to question Jeremiah. So he told them what the king commanded him, and they dropped the issue since nobody had heard the conversation. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse till Jerusalem fell.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
