## Jeremiah Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah A Promise to Restore Israel 2"Yahveh God of Israel says, 'Write in a scroll everything I've told you, 3because the time's coming when I'll restore the fortunes of Israel and Judah. I'll bring my people back to take over the land I gave their ancestors.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> This is what Yahveh said about Israel and Judah: 5"I've heard the sound of terror and dread; there's no peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Ask and see if a man can have a baby. Why do I see every man with his hands on his crotch like a woman in childbirth? Why have their faces turned pale?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> That day will be like no other, a time of Jacob's distress, but I'll deliver him from it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll break the yoke off his neck and tear off its straps. Foreigners won't enslave him anymore. 9He'll serve Yahveh his God and David his king that I'll raise up for him." 10"Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant; don't be distressed, Israel. From a long way off, I'll save you and your offspring from the land where you're captive. Jacob will come back and be at ease; nobody will terrorize him. 11'I'm with you to save you, to destroy the nations where I've scattered you. You're the one I won't destroy completely. I'll discipline you justly and certainly not let you go unpunished. 12"Your wound can't heal; you're too seriously injured.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> There's nobody to argue your case, no healing for your sore, no recovery for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> All your lovers have forgotten about you; they're not looking for you. I've wounded you like a cruel enemy would because your sins were severe and numerous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Why cry out because of your injury? Your pain can't be relieved. I've done that to you because of your great iniquity, your many sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So everybody that devours you will be devoured; your captors will go into captivity. Your plunderers will become plunder; those who prey on you I'll make prey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll restore you to health and heal your wounds, because they've called you an outcast and said, 'That's Zion; nobody cares about it.' 18"Yahveh says, 'I'll restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have mercy on where he's living. The city will be rebuilt on its ruins; the palace will stand in its rightful place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Thanksgiving will go out from them, and the sound of people having fun. I'll multiply them, not decrease them; I'll honor them; they'll be significant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They'll have children like before; their community will be safe with me; I'll punish their oppressors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> One of their own will lead them; their ruler will come from among themselves. I'll bring him near, and he'll approach me; who would dare risking his life to approach me on his own?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You'll be my people, and I'll be your God.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh's storm! His anger has gone out like a tornado; it will burst down on the heads of sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Yahveh's fierce anger won't relent till he's accomplished his purpose. Later you'll understand.</span>
