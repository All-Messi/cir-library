## Jeremiah Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah The Potter's Shop 2"Go down to the potter's shop. I'll give you my message there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I got down to his shop, he was there, working at his wheel. 4But the jar he was making with his hands didn't come out the way he wanted; so he made another one out of it that he was satisfied with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then Yahveh's message came to me: 6"Israel, can't I deal with you like this potter did? You're like clay in my hands. 7At one time I might talk about uprooting, tearing down, or destroying a nation. 8If it turns from its sin, I'll relent. 9At another time I might talk about planting it or building it up. 10If it doesn't obey, I'll change my mind about the good I was going to do for it. 11So tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, 'I'm preparing a catastrophe for you. Turn back from your sinful lives, every one of you. Reform your ways and deeds.' 12"But they say, 'We're not going to do that! We're going to make our own plans and do what we want to!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So Yahveh says, 'Ask around the nations; who ever heard of anything like that? The virgin Israel has done something terrible.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave the rocky mountaintops out in the open country? Does the cold, flowing mountain water ever dry up?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My people have forgotten me and burn incense to foreign gods; they stumble off their ancient ways to walk on footpaths instead of a good road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They end up making their land desolate, something for other people to mock; everybody that goes by just shake their heads at.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll scatter them ahead of their enemies like an east wind and turn my back on them when disaster comes.'" A Plot Against Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then they said, "Let's lay a plot to stop Jeremiah. We'll still have the Law through our priests; we can get our advice from other advisors; the message can come from other prophets! Let's spread rumors about him and ignore what he says." 19"Listen, Yahveh; do you hear what my opponents are saying!?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Should people repay good with bad? They've dug a pit to put me in. Remember how I stood in your presence to speak good on their behalf and turn your anger away from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So let their children starve; deliver them to the sword. Have their wives become childless widows; let their husbands be struck down and their young men die in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> May they scream in their houses when raiders suddenly break into them, because they've dug a pit to capture me and hidden snares for me to step in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh, you know about their deadly designs against me. Don't forgive their iniquity; don't blot out their sin; overthrow them in anger!" Jeremiah's Broken Flask</span>
