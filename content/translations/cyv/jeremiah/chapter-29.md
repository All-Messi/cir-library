<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Letter Jeremiah Sent from Jerusalem to the Rest of the Elders, Priests, Prophets, and People Nebuchadnezzar Had Taken from Jerusalem to Babylon <strong>Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles</strong> (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>This was after King Jeconiah/<em>Jehoiachin</em>, the queen mother, the court officials, the other officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and smiths were deported from Jerusalem.) <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jeremiah sent the letter by Elasah Ben-Shaphan and Gemariah Ben-Hilkiah, ambassadors Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon:<strong>	         </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>Jer</strong><strong> 29:1-3</strong> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Yahveh</em><em> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to the exiles he’s sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>‘Build</em><em> houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they grow. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em> married and have sons and daughters.

### years in Babylon, I’ll fulfill my promise to bring you back here. 11I know my plans for giving you hope and a future. 12Then you’ll pray, and I’ll listen. 13You’ll look for me and find me when you search with all your heart. 14I’ll restore your fortunes and gather you back to the place I exiled you from.	       	       	  Jer 29:4-14 15“Because you’ve said, ‘Yahveh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ 16this is what I say about the king on David’s throne and about your brothers in this city who didn’t go into exile with you: 17-18I’ll chase them with sword, famine, and disease. They’ll be like burst-open figs no one can eat because they’re rotten. I’ll make them a terror, a curse, something abhorred, to gasp at, a disgrace among the nations where I’ve banished them. 19They didn’t listen when I sent them my prophets time and again. 20So, you exiles that I’ve sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to what I’m telling you. 21“This is what Yahveh says about Ahab Ben-Kolaiah and Zedekiah Ben-Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in my name: ‘I’ll deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar; he’ll execute them in your presence. 22The exiles from Judah in Babylon will use this curse, “Yahveh make you like Zedekiah and Ahab that the king of Babylon roasted in fire.” 23They acted foolishly in Israel and committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives. They lied in my name. I’m the One who knows; I see everything that happens.’” 	  Jer 29:15-23 A Message for Shemaiah
