<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Message Jeremiah Spoke to Baruch When He'd Written It in a Scroll at Jeremiah's Dictation in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah A Message for Baruch 2"This is what Yahveh God of Israel says to you, Baruch: 3'You said, "Misfortune awaits me! Yahveh has added sorrow to pain. I'm exhausted from groaning. I can't sleep."' 4Tell him Yahveh says, 'What I've built up I'm about to tear down. What I've planted I'm about to uproot—the whole land. 5Are you anticipating great things for yourself? Don't. I'm going to bring disaster on everybody, but I'll give you your life as a reward of war wherever you go.'"</span>
