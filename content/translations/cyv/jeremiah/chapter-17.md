## Jeremiah Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Judah's sin is recorded with an iron stylus; with a diamond point it's engraved on their heart and the horns on their altars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> As well as they remember their children, they remember their pagan altars and Asherah poles beside every green tree on the tall hills.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My mountain in the open country, I'll give your wealth and treasures for spoil as the price for your sin throughout your territory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll voluntarily let go of the inheritance I gave you; I'll make you serve your enemies	in a foreign land because you've sparked my anger that will keep burning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh says, "People are under a curse who trust in other people, who rely on physical strength, who turn their hearts away from me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They're like a tamarisk shrub in the desert that won't flourish; they'll live in stony wastes, in a salted land with no inhabitants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Fortunate are the people that trust in Yahveh, that put their faith in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They're like a tree planted by water that sends down its roots and doesn't worry when hot weather comes. Its leaves stay green; it doesn't worry about a year-long drought; it keeps bearing fruit. 9"The heart is more deceitful than anything; it's desperately corrupt. Who can make sense of it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I, Yahveh, search hearts and test minds to repay everyone according to their deeds as measured by consequences. Jeremiah's Trust in God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> People that make a fortune unjustly are like a partridge that gathers a brood she didn't hatch; in midlife they'll lose their wealth and in the end be fools."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From the beginning, our sanctuary has been a glorious throne on high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh, hope of Israel, everybody that leaves you ends up disgraced; a record will be kept of those who turn away on earth because they've left Yahveh, the spring of fresh water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh, I'll be healed if you heal me; I'll be saved if you save me; you're the only one I praise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They keep asking to me, "Where's a message from Yahveh? Let it come now!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But I haven't hurried away from serving as your shepherd; I haven't desired a time for disaster, as you know. Whatever I said, I said to your face.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don't be a terror to me; you're my refuge in disaster.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Disgrace those who harass me; don't let me be the one disgraced. Bring disaster on them; crush them with double disaster! Observing the Sabbath</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh told me, "Go stand in the gate that Judah's kings use, and in the other gates around Jerusalem. 20Say, 'Listen to Yahveh's message, Judah, kings of Judah, people living in Jerusalem who use these gates: 21For your own good, don't carry any load on the Sabbath or bring anything in through these gates. 22Don't carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or work. Set the Sabbath aside like I told your ancestors. 23But they stiffened their necks and wouldn't follow directions. 24"'Listen carefully and don't carry any load through this city's gates on the Sabbath. Set it aside by resting on it. 25Then through these gates will come kings and officials who sit on David's throne, who ride in chariots and on horses, people of Judah and Jerusalem. People will live in this city permanently. 26They'll come in from the towns in Judah and places around Jerusalem, from Benjamin, the western foothills, the hill country, and the Negev. They'll bring thanksgiving sacrifices to Yahveh's Temple. 27If you don't set the Sabbath aside, I'll light a fire in Jerusalem's gates. It will spread to the palaces in Jerusalem, and it won't be put out.'"</span>
