## Jeremiah Chapter 37

### Jeremiah Imprisoned

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zedekiah Ben-Josiah, that Nebuchadnezzar had appointed king in Judah, ruled in place of Coniah Ben-Jehoiakim. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But he, his attendants, and the people that were left ignored what Yahveh said through Jeremiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal Ben-Shelemiah and Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah to say, <em>“Pray to Yahveh our God on our behalf.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people because they hadn’t put him in prison yet. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Meantime, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt. When the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard about that, they lifted the siege.<strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“Tell</em><em> the king that sent you to inquire from me, ‘Pharaoh’s army </em><em>that‘</em><em>s come out to help you will go back to Egypt. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Babylonians will come back and attack this city, capture and burn it. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> deceive yourselves into thinking they’ll leave. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Even</em><em> if you’d defeated the whole Babylonian army and only the wounded were left in their tents, they’d get up and burn the city.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the Babylonian army lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Jeremiah left Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to take over some property there. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At the Benjamin Gate, a sentry named Irijah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Hananiah) arrested him, claiming he was deserting to the Babylonians!<em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Jeremiah denied it,<em> </em>but he wouldn’t listen. He arrested him and took him to the officials. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They were mad at Jeremiah, and beat him and put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they’d converted into a prison.</span>
