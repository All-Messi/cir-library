## Jeremiah Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zedekiah Ben-Josiah, that Nebuchadnezzar had appointed king in Judah, ruled in place of Coniah Ben-Jehoiakim. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But he, his attendants, and the people that were left ignored what Yahveh said through Jeremiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal Ben-Shelemiah and Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah to say, <em>“Pray to Yahveh our God on our behalf.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people because they hadn’t put him in prison yet. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Meantime, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt. When the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard about that, they lifted the siege.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When the Babylonian army lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Jeremiah left Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to take over some property there. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At the Benjamin Gate, a sentry named Irijah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Hananiah) arrested him, claiming he was deserting to the Babylonians!<em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Jeremiah denied it,<em> </em>but he wouldn’t listen. He arrested him and took him to the officials. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They were mad at Jeremiah, and beat him and put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they’d converted into a prison. <strong>	</strong><strong>Jer 37:6-15</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Put in a Cistern</strong></span>
