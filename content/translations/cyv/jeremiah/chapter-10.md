## Jeremiah Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to the message Yahveh's giving you, Israel: 2"Don't pick up the ways other nations live; don't let the signs in the sky terrify you that terrify them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Their customs are delusions. They cut down a tree in the woods, and their craftsmen carve it with a tool;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> they decorate it with silver and gold and fasten it down with hammer and nails so it won't shift.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber patch. They can't talk; they can't walk, so they have to be carried! Don't be afraid of them; they can't do any good or harm."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There's none like you, Yahveh; you're great and powerful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who wouldn't respect you, King of nations? It's your due! There's no one like you among the wise in any kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But their instruction is completely foolish; they're nothing but wood!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> People bring beaten silver from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz; craftsmen and goldsmiths make the idols; they dress them in violet and purple, artisans' work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But Yahveh is a real God, a living God and everlasting King. The ground shakes at his anger; the nations can't endure his indignation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Tell them this: "The gods that didn't make earth and sky will perish from it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He's the One that made the earth by his power, that built the world by his wisdom, that stretched out the sky by his intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he speaks, there's thunder in the rain above; he makes clouds come up from the horizon, makes lightning for the rain, and sends wind out of his storehouses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Every mortal is stupid and ignorant; idols disgrace their goldsmiths, because molten images misrepresent; they can't even breathe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They're worthless objects to ridicule; when they're punished, they perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jacob's portion is not like them; his God has made everything; Israel is his inheritance; his name is Yahveh of Hosts. The Looming Destruction</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Pick up your baggage, you that live under siege!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yahveh says, "I'm tossing out the people that live here and causing them distress so no one can find them later."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I'm hurt and my wound can't heal; it's pain I have to bear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> My tent's destroyed; its guy ropes have snapped. My children are gone; they don't exist anymore. There's nobody to set up my tent again or hang my curtains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The shepherds don't use any sense; they don't look to Yahveh; so they haven't prospered, and their flock has scattered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> There's a loud uproar in the north that's headed for the towns in Judah to make them desolate, dens for jackals. Jeremiah's Prayer</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I know, Yahveh, that we don't set our own way; when we walk, we don't set the direction of our steps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Correct me, but in due measure, not with your anger, or you'd destroy me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Pour out your anger on nations that don't know you, on families that don't call on you; because they've devastated Jacob and laid waste his homeland.</span>
