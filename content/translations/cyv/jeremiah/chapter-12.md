## Jeremiah Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You render justice, Yahveh, so I'll argue my case to you. Why do the wicked prosper, and the devious live in ease?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You planted them and they took root; they grew and bore fruit. You're near their lips but far from their mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But, Yahveh, you know me; you see me. You examine my attitude toward you. Drag them off like sheep for slaughter; set them apart to be butchered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How long will the land mourn and the pastures wither? The animals and birds have disappeared because the people there are sinners that say, "He doesn't see what's in store for us." God's Reply 5"If racing against men wears yousg out, how can you compete with horses? If you fall down on cleared ground, how will you fair in the jungle by the Jordan?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Even the members of your own family have turned against you and yelled at you; don't trust them even if they say nice things to you. 7"I've abandoned my Temple, forsaken my permanent possession, and delivered my loved ones to their enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> My permanent possession has roared at me like a lion in the woods, and I've detested them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Is my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me? Are birds of prey swooping at it from every direction? Round up the wild animals; bring them to gorge!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard; they've tramped down my field and made it barren.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They've made it desolate; it mourns to me. The whole country has become a wasteland because nobody's taking care of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Destroying armies have come on all the barren hills. The sword of Yahveh is devouring from one end of the land to another; there's no peace for anybody.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They've sown wheat and reaped thorns; they've worn themselves out for nothing. Be ashamed of your harvest because of Yahveh's fierce anger." A Message for Israel's Neighbors</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is what Yahveh says about neighboring nations that strike at my people's inheritance: "I'm about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. 15But afterward I'll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. 16Then, if they'll learn to swear by me, 'As sure as the Lord lives,' like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I'll let them live among my people. 17But any nation that won't listen, I'll uproot and destroy." The Ruined Linen Loincloth</span>
