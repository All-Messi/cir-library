## Jeremiah Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>You render justice, Yahveh, so I’ll argue my case to you. Why do the wicked prosper, and the devious live in ease?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You planted them and they took root; they grew and bore fruit. You’re near their lips but far from their mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But, Yahveh, you know <u>me</u>; you see me. You examine my attitude toward you. Drag them off like sheep for slaughter; set them apart to be butchered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>How long will the land mourn and the pastures wither? The animals and birds have disappeared because the people there are sinners that say,<em> “He doesn’t see what’s in store for us.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:1-4</p>

### God’s Reply 5“If racing against men wears yousg out, 	how can you compete with horses? If you fall down on cleared ground, 	how will you fair in the jungle by the Jordan?


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>Even</em><em> the members of your own family</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>have turned against you and yelled at </em><em>you;</em> <em>	don’t trust them even if they say nice things to you.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:5-6</p>

### 7“I’ve abandoned my Temple, 	forsaken my permanent possession, 	and delivered my loved ones to their enemies.


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><em>My</em><em> permanent possession has roared at me</em> <em>	like a lion in the woods,</em> <em>	and I’ve detested them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em>Is</em><em> my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?</em> <em>	Are birds of prey swooping at it from every direction?</em> <em>Round up the wild </em><em>animals;</em> <em>	bring them to gorge!</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:7-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><em>Many</em><em> shepherds have ruined my </em><em>vineyard;</em> <em>	they’ve tramped down my field</em> <em>	and made it barren.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup><em>They’ve</em><em> made it </em><em>desolate;</em> <em>	it </em><em>mourns to</em><em> me.</em> <em>The whole country has become a wasteland</em> <em>	because nobody’s taking care of it.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>Destroying</em><em> armies have come </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>on all the barren hills.</em> <em>The sword of Yahveh is devouring</em> <em>	from one end of the land to </em><em>another;</em> <em>	there’s no peace for anybody.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>They’ve</em><em> sown wheat and reaped </em><em>thorns;</em> <em>	they’ve worn themselves out for nothing.</em> <em>Be ashamed of your harvest</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because of Yahveh’s fierce anger.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>

### A Message for Israel’s Neighbors


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>This is what Yahveh says about neighboring nations that strike at my people’s inheritance:<em> </em> <em>“I’m about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> afterward I’ll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em>, if they’ll learn to swear by me, ‘As sure as the Lord lives,’ like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I’ll let them live among my people. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em>any nation<em> </em>that <em>won’t listen, I’ll uproot and destroy.” </em><em>	  </em></span>
