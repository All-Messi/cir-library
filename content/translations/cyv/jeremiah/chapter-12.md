## Jeremiah Chapter 12

### Jeremiah’s Complaint

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You render justice, Yahveh, so I’ll argue my case to you. Why do the wicked prosper, and the devious live in ease?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You planted them and they took root; they grew and bore fruit. You’re near their lips but far from their mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But, Yahveh, you know <u>me</u>; you see me. You examine my attitude toward you. Drag them off like sheep for slaughter; set them apart to be butchered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How long will the land mourn and the pastures wither? The animals and birds have disappeared because the people there are sinners that say,<em> “He doesn’t see what’s in store for us.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:1-4</p>

### God’s Reply


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“If</em><em> racing against men wears you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> out,</em> <em>	how can you compete with horses?</em> <em>If you </em><em>fall down</em><em> on </em><em>cleared</em><em> ground,</em> <em>	how will you fair in the jungle by the Jordan?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>Even</em><em> the members of your own family</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>have turned against you and yelled at </em><em>you;</em> <em>	don’t trust them even if they say nice things to you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:5-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>“I’ve</em><em> abandoned my Temple,</em> <em>	forsaken my permanent possession,</em> <em>	and delivered my loved ones to their enemies.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>My</em><em> permanent possession has roared at me</em> <em>	like a lion in the woods,</em> <em>	and I’ve detested them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>Is</em><em> my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?</em> <em>	Are birds of prey swooping at it from every direction?</em> <em>Round up the wild </em><em>animals;</em> <em>	bring them to gorge!</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:7-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>Many</em><em> shepherds have ruined my </em><em>vineyard;</em> <em>	they’ve tramped down my field</em> <em>	and made it barren.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <em>They’ve</em><em> made it </em><em>desolate;</em> <em>	it </em><em>mourns to</em><em> me.</em> <em>The whole country has become a wasteland</em> <em>	because nobody’s taking care of it.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>Destroying</em><em> armies have come </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>on all the barren hills.</em> <em>The sword of Yahveh is devouring</em> <em>	from one end of the land to </em><em>another;</em> <em>	there’s no peace for anybody.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <em>They’ve</em><em> sown wheat and reaped </em><em>thorns;</em> <em>	they’ve worn themselves out for nothing.</em> <em>Be ashamed of your harvest</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because of Yahveh’s fierce anger.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 12:10-13</p>

### A Message for Israel’s Neighbors


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is what Yahveh says about neighboring nations that strike at my people’s inheritance:<em> </em> <em>“I’m about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> afterward I’ll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em>, if they’ll learn to swear by me, ‘As sure as the Lord lives,’ like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I’ll let them live among my people. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em>any nation<em> </em>that <em>won’t listen, I’ll uproot and destroy.”</span>
