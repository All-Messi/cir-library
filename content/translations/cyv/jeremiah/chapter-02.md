## Jeremiah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh came to Me: 2"Go proclaim in Jerusalem that Yahveh says, 'I remember your devotion when you were young, your love as my betrothed, your following me in the open country through uncultivated land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel was holy to me, the first fruits of my harvest. Everybody that tried to eat some of it became guilty, and disaster fell on them.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A Message from Yahveh to the House of Jacob and the Families of Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh says, "What did your ancestors find wrong with me that they left me and followed emptiness and became empty themselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They didn't say, 'Where's Yahveh that brought us out of Egypt and led us through the wilderness, through deserts and pits, drought and deep darkness, through land nobody crossed, where nobody lived?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I brought you to a productive land to eat the good things it produced, but you defiled it and made my inheritance detestable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The priests didn't say, 'Where's Yahveh?' Those who administered the Law didn't know me; the rulers sinned against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal and followed things that didn't profit. 9"So I'll contend with you and your grandsons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Sail to Cyprus and see; send to Kedar and look carefully to see if there's anything like this!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Has any nation ever changed gods to what weren't gods? But my people have exchanged their honor for what are worthless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Be appalled at that, sky; shudder and be dismayed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> My people have committed two sins: they've left me, the fountain of living water, and hewed out cracked cisterns that can't hold water. 14"Is Israel a slave or a home-born servant? Why has he become prey?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Young lions have roared at him loudly; they've made his country a wasteland and destroyed his towns without residents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Egyptians from Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown on his head.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Haven't you done this to yourself by leaving Yahveh your God, when he was leading you along his way?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> What are you doing on the road to Egypt to drink the water in the Nile? Why go to Assyria to drink the water of the Euphrates?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Your own sins will correct you; your apostasies will rebuke you. Know then that it's a sinful, bitter thing to leave Yahveh your God; you don't respect me at all," the Lord Yahveh of hosts says. 20"Long ago I broke your yoke and tore off your slave chains; but you said, 'I won't serve!' On every tall hill under every green tree, you've lain down like a prostitute.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yet I planted you as a choice stock, as faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself into the degenerate sprouts of a wild vine?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Though you wash yourself with lye and lots of soap, I can still see the stain from your sin," the Lord Yahveh says. Israel an Unfaithful Wife 23"How can you keep saying, 'I'm not defiled; I haven't gone after the images of Baal'? Look at your way in the valleys! Acknowledge what you've done! You're a restless young camel, pacing back and forth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, in her heat sniffing the wind. Who can control her? They don't need to waste energy looking for her; she'll come to them in her month.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't run after them till your feet are sore and your throat's dry. But you said, 'Don't try to change me! I love those foreign gods; I'll keep living their way.' 26"Like a thief embarrassed at getting caught, the House of Israel is embarrassed— they, their kings and officials, priests and prophets,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> who say to a tree, 'You're my father,' to a stone, 'You're my mother.' They turn their backs on me; but when trouble comes, they'll call out, 'Get up and save us.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Where are the gods you made for yourselves? Have them save you if they can. Judah, you have as many gods as you have towns. 29"Why complain to me? You've all sinned against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I've disciplined you for nothing; you didn't respond to it. Your sword has killed your prophets like a ravenous lion kills prey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Generation, listen to Yahveh's message. Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of deep darkness? Why do my people say, 'We're free to roam; we won't come to you anymore'?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Can a young woman forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding dress? Yet my people have forgotten me time and again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> You scheme so well to find love! You've even taught immoral women how to do it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The blood of the innocent poor you've spattered on your clothes though you didn't catch them breaking in; but despite that</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> you say, 'I haven't done anything wrong; surely he's not mad at me!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> How lightly you gad around from one way to another; Egypt will humble you like Assyria did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> You'll leave here with your hands on your head, because Yahveh has rejected the ones you depend on; you won't prosper by them."</span>
