## Jeremiah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> People of Benjamin, get out of Jerusalem! Blow a bugle in Tekoa, sound the ram's horn over Beth-haccerem, because great destruction looms down from the north.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll destroy attractive, delicate Zion. 3'Shepherds' [commanders] will lead their companies there and pitch camps around it, each with his own area to subdue.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Get ready for war with it; get up! attack at noon! But misfortune would await us; it's getting late; shadows are getting longer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So get up! Let's attack at night and destroy its fortified towers."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says, "Cut down its trees; build a siege wall against it. Punish Jerusalem; there's nothing in it but oppression.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As a well keeps its water fresh, this city keeps its sinfulness fresh. I hear violence and destruction in it; its sickness and wounds are constantly evident to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jerusalem, pay attention to the warning, or I'll separate you from me and make you desolate and unoccupied."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says, "They'll thoroughly glean you like a remnant in Israel; they'll pass over you again like someone that gathers grapes picks over the branches one more time."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> How should I warn them? They've covered their ears and can't listen; any message from Yahveh offends them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But I'm full of Yahveh's anger; I'm tired of holding it in! "I'll pour it out on children in the streets, on groups of young men; husbands and wives will both be taken, the old and gray as well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Their houses will pass on to other people, their fields and wives too, because I'll reach out against the people in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That's because every one's greedy								from least to greatest; every one cheats										from prophet to priest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They try to bandage over my people's wounds by saying, 'Everything's all right,' when it's not.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Are they ashamed of their disgusting acts? Not at all. They can't even blush; so they'll fall with the falling. When I punish them, I'll cast them down," Yahveh says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh said, "Stand beside the road and ask where the ancient paths are; ask where the good road is and walk on it; you'll find some rest. But they say, 'We're not going to walk there.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I posted a watchman over you and said, 'Listen to the bugle!' But they said, 'We don't have to listen to it.' 18"So listen, nations; know, community, what's among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Listen, earth; I'm going to bring disaster on them,						a disaster that results from their intentions,							because they ignored me									and wouldn't accept my Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Why offer me frankincense from Sheba and calamus from some distant land? Your burnt offerings aren't acceptable; your sacrifices don't please me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yahveh says, "I'll lay obstacles in front of my people so they'll trip over them; Fathers and sons together, neighbors and friends will perish."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh says, "A big army will rise up from the remote parts of the world; a nation will come from a land up north.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They take up bow and spear; they're cruel with no mercy. They roar like the ocean and ride on horses, arrayed for battle against you, Zion."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> We've heard the report about them; our hands hang limp; birth pangs have seized us like a woman in labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't go out in the field or walk on the road, because the enemy has a sword; they terrorize everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Put on burlap, my people, and roll in ashes; mourn like you would for an only son— a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer will come at you suddenly. 27"Jeremiah, I've made you an assayer among my people so you can test them and know how they live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> They're stubborn and rebellious, and go around slandering. They're as hardened as bronze and iron— corrupt, every one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The bellows blow fiercely, but the refining doesn't purify; the sinfulness does not burn off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Assay them as 'rejected silver' because Yahveh has rejected them."</span>
