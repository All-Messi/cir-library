## Jeremiah Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh told me, "Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here, my heart wouldn't be with this nation. Send them away! 2If they ask you where to go, tell them Yahveh says, 'Those destined for death, go to death! Those destined for the sword, go to the sword! Those destined for famine, go to famine! Those destined for captivity, go to captivity!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll send four kinds of destruction on you: the sword to slay, dogs to drag away, buzzards to devour, and scavengers to consume. 4I'll see that the kingdoms abhor you because of what Manasseh Ben-Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem? Who's going to cry for you or come to ask how you're doing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You've left me and keep getting worse; so I'll go ahead and destroy you; I'm tired of holding back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll winnow you with a winnowing fork at the country's ports of entry. I'll bereave you of your children and destroy you as my people because you refuse to turn back from your ways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You'll have more widows than sand by the sea; I'll bring at you a destroyer at noon, mother of young men, and suddenly bring down anguish and dread on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> She that bore seven sons will pine away and gasp for breath. Her sun will set in the daytime; she'll be disgraced and humiliated. So I'll turn any survivors over to their enemies' sword," Yahveh says. Jeremiah's Complaint 10"Misfortune awaits me, mother that bore me to experience conflict in the world! I haven't lent or borrowed; yet everybody curses me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh said, "I'll set you free for good; I'll make your enemy appeal to you when disaster and distress come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Can anybody smash iron, the iron from the north, or bronze?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Because of your sins within your borders, I'll give away your wealth and treasures as plunder free of charge. 14Your enemies will take it to a country you don't know about, because my anger has been fired up. It'll burn you up." 15"Yahveh, you know me; remember me; notice me; take vengeance on my persecutors. In light of your patience, don't let me die young; remember that I'm dealing with disgrace to honor you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When I discovered your words, I devoured them; they became a delight to me because I wear your name, Yahveh God of hosts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I didn't sit with the revelers; because your hand was on me, I sat by myself, filled with indignation over their sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Why does my pain persist? Why don't my wounds heal? Are you going to be like a seasonal stream we can't depend on?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So Yahveh says, "If you'll come back, I'll restore you; you can stand in my presence. If you'll separate the precious from the worthless, you can become my spokesman. They may turn on you, but don't turn on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then for my people I'll make you into a fortified wall made out of bronze; though they fight you, they won't win because I'll save you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I'll keep you away from sinners and rescue you from cruel people."</span>
