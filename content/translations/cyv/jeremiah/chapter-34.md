## Jeremiah Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah When Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and His Army and the Kingdoms He Ruled Were Fighting Jerusalem and Surrounding Towns A Warning to Zedekiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Go tell Zedekiah, king of Judah, that Yahveh says, "I'm giving this city to the king of Babylon, and he'll burn it. 3You'll be captured and turned over to him. You'll see him in person, he'll speak to you directly, and you'll go to Babylon." 4But listen to Yahveh, Zedekiah! "You won't die by the sword; 5you'll die in peace. As they burned spices for the kings before you, they'll burn spices and lament, 'Ah, lord!' for you. I've spoken."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That's what Jeremiah told Zedekiah 7while Babylon's army was fighting Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah, the only fortified cities left in Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah After King Zedekiah Made an Agreement with the People in Jerusalem to Declare Liberty</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Each man was to free his Hebrew male and female slaves so nobody would enslave a fellow Jewish. 10The officials and the people obeyed and agreed not to hold them as slaves any longer. 11But afterward they went back on their word and brought their freed slaves back into subjection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to Jeremiah:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh God of Israel says, "I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of bondage in Egypt. 14At the end of seven years, set your fellow Hebrew free that's been sold to you. But your ancestors didn't obey me. 15Recently you changed and did what was right. You freed your fellow citizen and made a covenant in my presence. 16But you've gone back on your word and profaned my name. You've enslaved again the slaves you'd freed. 17"You haven't obeyed me by releasing your brother and fellow citizen; so I'm releasing you to sword, famine, and disease. I'll make you something other kingdoms abhor. 18-20The ones that didn't keep that covenant, I'll release to their enemies that want to kill them: officials in Judah and Jerusalem, court officers, priests, and common people who cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 21I'll deliver Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies, 22and direct them to attack this city again, burn it, and fill Judah with ghost towns."</span>
