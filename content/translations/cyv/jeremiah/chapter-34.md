## Jeremiah Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah 	<strong>When Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon,</strong> 	<strong>and His Army and the Kingdoms He Ruled Were</strong> 	<strong>Fighting Jerusalem and Surrounding Towns </strong> 	<strong>A Warning to Zedekiah</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Go tell Zedekiah, king of Judah, that Yahveh says, <em>“I’m giving this city to the king of Babylon, and he’ll burn it. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> be captured and turned over to him. You’ll see him in person, he’ll speak to you directly, and you’ll go to Babylon.” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But listen to Yahveh, Zedekiah! <em>“You won’t die by the sword; </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>you’ll</em><em> die in peace. As they burned spices for the kings before you, they’ll burn spices and lament, ‘Ah, lord!’ for you. I’ve spoken.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That’s what Jeremiah told Zedekiah <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>while Babylon’s army was fighting Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah, the only fortified cities left in Judah.<strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah 	<strong>After King Zedekiah Made an Agreement</strong> 	<strong>with the People in Jerusalem to Declare Liberty</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Each man was to free his Hebrew male and female slaves so nobody would enslave a fellow Jewish. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The officials and the people obeyed and agreed not to hold them as slaves any longer. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But afterward they went back on their word and brought their freed slaves back into subjection.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 34:8-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to Jeremiah:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh God of Israel says,<em> “I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of bondage in Egypt. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>At</em><em> the end of seven years, set your fellow Hebrew free that’s been sold to you. But your ancestors didn’t obey me. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Recently</em><em> you changed and did what was right. You freed your fellow citizen and made a covenant in my presence. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> you’ve gone back on your word and profaned my name. You’ve enslaved again the slaves you’d freed.</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 34:12-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“You</em><em> haven’t obeyed me by releasing your brother and fellow citizen; </em><em>so</em><em> I’m releasing you to sword, famine, and disease. I’ll make </em><em>you something </em>other<em> kingdoms abhor</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>18-20</sup></strong><em>The ones that didn’t keep that covenant, I’ll release to their enemies that want to kill them: officials in Judah and Jerusalem, court officers, priests, and common people who cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> deliver Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> direct them to attack this city again, burn it, and fill Judah with ghost towns.” </em><strong></span>
