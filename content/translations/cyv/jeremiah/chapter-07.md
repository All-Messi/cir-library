<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah 	<strong>Jeremiah Speaks at the Temple</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“Stan</em><em>d</em><em> in the entrance to Yahveh’s Temple</em><em> and </em><em>deliver</em><em> this </em><em>message, ‘</em><em>Listen to a</em><em> message from </em><em>Yahveh, all of you in Judah that go in these gates to worship him! </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you mend your ways, I’ll let you live here. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> trust in </em>these<em> deceptive words, “This is Yahveh’s Temple, Yahveh’s Temple, Yahveh’s Temple!” </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you mend your ways </em> <em>and practice goodness with one another, </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>if</em><em> you don’t oppress foreigners, orphans, or </em><em>widows;</em><em> </em> <em>and don’t shed innocent blood here</em> <em>	 or follow other gods to your own ruin—</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <em>then</em><em> I’ll let you keep living in this land that I gave your ancestors forever.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <em>“‘You’re</em><em> trusting in deceiving words to no avail. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Will</em><em> you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, sacrifice to Baal, and follow other gods you’ve not known? </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> </em>will you <em>come and try to depend on me in this Temple that wears my name, and think you’re safe—and go on doing those same detestable things? </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> you regard this Temple as a den of thieves? I’ve seen for myself what it is.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“‘Go</em><em> to Shiloh, </em><em>which I identified myself with first. See what I did to it because my people sinned. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>’ve done the same things. I spoke to you </em>about them<em>, getting up early and speaking to you, but you ignored me. I called you, but you wouldn’t answer. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>So</em><em>, what I did to Shiloh I’ll do to the Temple that wears my name—that you trust in—and to the place I gave you and your ancestors. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> throw you out of my sight like I did your relatives, Ephraim’s offspring.’</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>‘Go</em><em> to Shiloh, </em><em>which I identified myself with first.

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“Don’t</em><em> pray for </em><em>my</em><em> people, </em><em>Jeremiah</em><em>; don’t </em><em>lift up</em><em> a petition for them. Don’t intercede with me; I won’t listen. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> you see what they’re doing in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, the women knead dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven.  They pour out liquid offerings to other gods to spite me. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> they spite </em><em><u>me</u></em><em>? Aren’t they doing spite to </em><em><u>themselves</u></em><em> to their own disgrace? </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>So</em> <em>I’ll pour out my anger on people and animals here, trees in the field and produce from the ground. It will burn and not be put out.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> <em>“</em>Go on and<em> add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn’t speak to them about burnt offerings and sacrifices </em>so much as<em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> commanded them, ‘Obey me, and I’ll be your God, and you’ll be my people. Follow the way I command you so things will go well for you.’ </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Yet</em><em> they didn’t listen or obey. They followed their own ideas and conducted themselves according to their stubborn, sinful hearts. They went backward, not forward. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>From</em><em> that time till now, I’ve sent you my prophets, getting up early every day and sending them. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> you ignored me. You stiffened your neck and did </em><em>more evil</em><em> than your ancestors.</em><strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“Judah</em><em> has done what I’ve forbidden.
