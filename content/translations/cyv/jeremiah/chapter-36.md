## Jeremiah Chapter **36**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah in the <strong>Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</strong>, <strong>Baruch Reads Aloud Yahveh’s Messages</strong> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“On</em><em> a scroll, write down everything I’ve told you about Israel, Judah, and the nations from Josiah’s time till now. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> Judah will listen to the catastrophe I intend to bring on them to get them to repent. Then I’ll forgive their sin.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Jeremiah called for Baruch Ben-Neriah, and he wrote down Yahveh’s messages that Jeremiah dictated. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He told Baruch, <em>“I can’t go to Yahveh’s Temple. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> you go on a fast day and read to the people the messages you’ve written. Read them to the people in Judah who come from their towns. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> they’ll turn from their sinful ways and ask for his forgiveness. Yahveh has pronounced great anger against them.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 36:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>In the <strong>ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim/</strong><strong><em>Coniah</em></strong>, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to Yahveh. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah Ben-Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>When Micaiah Ben-Gemariah heard it, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>he went down to the scribe’s office in the king’s palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah Ben-Shemaiah, Elnathan Ben-Achbor, Gemariah Ben-Shaphan, Zedekiah Ben-Hananiah, and the others. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They sent Jehudi Ben-Nethaniah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Cushi) to Baruch and said, <em>“Bring the scroll you read to the people.”</em> So Baruch took it to them.</span>

### 15“Sit down and read it to us.”


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, <em>“We’ll have to report this to the king. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> us how you wrote this? Did </em>Jeremiah<em> dictate it?”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“He</em><em> dictated it to me, and I wrote it in ink on the scroll.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The officials said, <em>“Both of you, go hide. Don’t tell anybody where you are.”</em> <strong>King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>So they reported to the king what it said, but they’d deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them in the brazier till he’d burned up the whole scroll. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The king and his attendants weren’t afraid and didn’t tear their clothes. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He told Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah Ben-Azriel, and Shelemiah Ben-Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but Yahveh hid them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 36:15-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah <strong>After the King Burned the Scroll</strong> <strong>Baruch Had Written at Jeremiah’s Dictation</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll</strong> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“Take</em><em> another scroll and write down everything again</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>Say</em><em> to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, ‘You burned this scroll and said, “Why did you write that the king of Babylon will destroy this land and empty out its people and animals?” </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is Yahveh’s answer: ‘You won’t have any descendant to sit on </em><em>David’s throne. They’ll toss your dead body out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> punish you, your family, and your attendants for your sins. I’ll bring on you and the people in Jerusalem and Judah the catastrophe I’ve declared—but they didn’t listen.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
