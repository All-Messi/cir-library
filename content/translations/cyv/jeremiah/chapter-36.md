## Jeremiah Chapter 36

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah in the <strong>Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</strong>, <strong>Baruch Reads Aloud Yahveh’s Messages</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jeremiah called for Baruch Ben-Neriah, and he wrote down Yahveh’s messages that Jeremiah dictated. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He told Baruch, <em>“I can’t go to Yahveh’s Temple. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> you go on a fast day and read to the people the messages you’ve written. Read them to the people in Judah who come from their towns. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> they’ll turn from their sinful ways and ask for his forgiveness. Yahveh has pronounced great anger against them.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 36:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In the <strong>ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim/</strong><strong><em>Coniah</em></strong>, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to Yahveh. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah Ben-Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When Micaiah Ben-Gemariah heard it, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>he went down to the scribe’s office in the king’s palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah Ben-Shemaiah, Elnathan Ben-Achbor, Gemariah Ben-Shaphan, Zedekiah Ben-Hananiah, and the others. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They sent Jehudi Ben-Nethaniah (Ben-Shelemiah Ben-Cushi) to Baruch and said, <em>“Bring the scroll you read to the people.”</em> So Baruch took it to them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 36:9-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, <em>“We’ll have to report this to the king. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> us how you wrote this? Did </em>Jeremiah<em> dictate it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The officials said, <em>“Both of you, go hide. Don’t tell anybody where you are.”</em> <strong>King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> So they reported to the king what it said, but they’d deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them in the brazier till he’d burned up the whole scroll. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The king and his attendants weren’t afraid and didn’t tear their clothes. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He told Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah Ben-Azriel, and Shelemiah Ben-Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but Yahveh hid them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah <strong>After the King Burned the Scroll</strong> <strong>Baruch Had Written at Jeremiah’s Dictation</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Jer 36:27-32</strong> <strong>Jeremiah Imprisoned</strong></span>
