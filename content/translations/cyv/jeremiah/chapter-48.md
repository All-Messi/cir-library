## Jeremiah Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> About Moab Yahveh of hosts, the God of Israel, says, "Misfortune awaits Nebo—laid waste; Kiriathaim will be disgraced—taken; the fortress will be humiliated—torn down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> No more renown for Moab; disaster's in store for Heshbon to cease being a nation! Put Madmen to silence too; chase it with a sword. 3"An outcry from Horonaim, 'Devastation and destruction!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moab's to be destroyed; its little ones cry out in terror.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At the ascent to Luhith, Moab's refugees go up crying; at the descent to Horonaim they've heard the anguished cry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Run, save yourselves so you can be a juniper in the countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Because you trusted in your wealth and skill, you'll be captured too. Chemosh will go into exile with his priests and officials.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A destroyer will come on every city; no city will escape. The valley will perish; the plateau will be destroyed like Yahveh said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Give Moab wings so it can fly away; its towns will be desolate without residents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A curse on the one that does Yahveh's work halfheartedly; a curse on the one that restrains his sword from blood. 11"Moab hasn't been disturbed since it was founded; its dregs haven't been unsettled. It hasn't been poured from jug to jug— or carried into exile. So it still tastes clean; its aroma has body. 12"But the times coming," Yahveh says, "when I'll send it to the ones that upset jugs, and they'll turn it upside down. They'll empty its jugs and shatter its jars. 13Moab will be disillusioned with Chemosh like Israel lost confidence in Bethel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> How can you claim to be great soldiers, brave men in battle?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Moab will be destroyed; its towns will be under attack; its elite young men will go down in slaughter," the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts 16"Moab's disaster is on its way; its destruction will be swift.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Mourn for it, you that live near it, you that know its name. Say, 'How the powerful scepter has broken that splendid staff!' 18"Come down from your glory and sit on parched dirt, people in Dibon; the one that destroyed Moab is coming after you. He'll destroy your fortresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Stand by the road and watch, people in Aroer; ask him that's fleeing and her that's escaping, 'What's happened?' 20'Moab has been disgraced; it's shattered. Wail and cry out; declare by the Arnon, 'Moab's been destroyed.' 21"Judgment has also come on the plateau—on Holon and Jahzah, on Mephaath, 22Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 23on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 24on Kerioth, Bozrah, and the towns in Moab near and far. 25Moab's horn has been cut off and his arm broken," Yahveh says. 26"Get him drunk because he's gotten arrogant toward Yahveh. So Moab will wallow in his own vomit, something to be ridiculed. 27Wasn't Israel someone you ridiculed? Was he a thief caught stealing? Every time you spoke about him, you shook your head in scorn. 28"Leave the towns and live in caves, people in Moab; be like pigeons nesting in the cliffs along the gorge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> We've heard about Moab's great pride, his haughtiness, arrogance, and self-exaltation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I know his insolence," Yahveh says, "but it's pointless; his idle boasts are empty claims.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So I'll wail can cry out for Moab; I'll moan for the people of Kir-heres/hareseth. 32"More than for Jazer, I'll weep for you, vine of Sibmah! Your branches once reached the sea, the Sea of Jazer [Dead Sea]. The destroyer has destroyed your summer fruits and grape harvest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> So happiness and joy have been taken away from Moab's fertile fields. I've made wine quit flowing from the winepresses; nobody will tread them with shouts of joy; the shouts won't be shouts of joy. 34"From Heshbon, Elealeh, and Jahaz, from Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath-shelishiyah, they've raised their voice; because even the water in Nimrim will dry up. 35I'll put an end to Moab that offers sacrifice on the high place and burns incense to its god. 36So my heart wails like a flute for Moab and the people in Kir-heres. They've lost the abundance it produced. 37Every head's bald; every beard's shaved off. Everybody has gashes on their hands and burlap around their waists. 38There's mourning everywhere in Moab's streets and on its housetops, because I've broken it like a pot nobody cares about. 39How shattered it is! How they wail! How Moab has turned its back in humiliation. So it's something to laugh at, an object of terror to everyone around it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Yahveh says, "One will fly fast like an eagle and spread its wings against Moab.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Its towns will be taken, its fortresses seized. So the hearts of the strong men of Moab will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Moab will be destroyed from being a people because it's become arrogant toward Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Terror, pit, and snare are coming on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> The one that runs from the terror will fall into a pit. The one that climbs out of the pit will step in a snare. That's what I'll bring on Moab when I punish it. 45"Refugees will stand in the shadow of Heshbon with no strength to flee any farther; fire has erupted from Heshbon, a flame from Sihon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Misfortune awaits you, Moab! The people of Chemosh will perish; your sons will be taken captive, your daughters too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Yet later I'll restore Moab's fortunes." That's the judgment on Moab.</span>
