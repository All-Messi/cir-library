## Jeremiah Chapter 46

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About the Nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A Message to Egypt about Pharaoh Necho's Army That Was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, Which Nebuchadnezzar Defeated in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, King of Judah A Message About Egypt 3"Line up the shields and bucklers, and advance for battle!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Harness the horses, mount the steeds, take your positions, put your helmets on! Polish the spears; put on the coats of mail!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But what do I see? Egypt's army is panicking; they're retreating. Their soldiers are being defeated; they're fleeing without looking back. They're terrorized in every direction," Yahveh says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The fast can't flee; the strong can't escape. They've stumbled and fallen in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is this that's flooding like the Nile, like rivers out of their banks?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Egypt floods like the Nile, like rivers whose water surges. It has said, "I'll flood the land; I'll destroy city and residents."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Advance, horses; drive wildly, chariots, so the infantry can march forward: Nubia and Put, that wield the shield, Lybians, that bend the bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> That day belongs to the Lord Yahveh of hosts, a time of revenge on his enemies. The sword will devour till it's satisfied and drink its fill of their blood. There'll be a slaughter for the Lord Yahveh of hosts in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Go up to Gilead and buy salve, virgin daughter in Egypt! In vain do you use lots of medicines; they won't heal you up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The nations have heard about your humiliation; the whole world has heard your distress cry. One soldier stumbles over another, and they both fall together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Message Yahveh Spoke to Jeremiah About Nebuchadnezzar Coming to Strike Egypt 14"Declare it in Egypt, announce it in Migdol, tell it in Memphis and Tahpanhes; 'Be prepared and stand ready because the sword has taken everybody around you.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Why are your soldiers prostrate? Because Yahveh has beat them down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He made many stumble; they have fallen over one another. Then they said, 'Get up! Let's go back to our own people, to our native land, away from the oppressor's sword.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They cried out there, 'Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just a lot of noise; he's let the stated time pass by!' 18"As I live," the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts, "somebody is coming like Tabor among the mountains or like Carmel by the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Get your baggage ready for exile, daughter that lives in Egypt, because Memphis will be desolate, burned down, and uninhabited.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Egypt is a pretty heifer, but a horsefly is coming from the north!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Egypt's mercenaries are like grain-fed calves; even they have retreated and fled together. They didn't stand their ground; their catastrophe has descended on them; it's their time to be punished. 22"Egypt is as silent as a snake slithering away, because its enemies are moving in on it like an army, like woodsmen with axes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They'll cut down its forest; it certainly won't exist anymore, even though it's too numerous to count.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Egypt has been humbled, delivered to the powerful ones up north."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "I'm going to punish Amon of Thebes, Egypt along with its gods and kings, Pharaoh and those who put their trust in him. 26I'm going to deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar and his officers, who want to kill them. Afterwards people will live in Egypt like before. 27"But you, Jacob my servant, don't be afraid or intimidated! I'll rescue you from a long way off and your descendants from where they're captive. Israel will come back and be secure, with nobody to make him shudder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jacob,, don't be afraid; I'm with you. I'll make a complete end to the nations where I've driven you, but I won't make a complete end of you; I'll discipline you appropriately— (not leave you unpunished)."</span>
