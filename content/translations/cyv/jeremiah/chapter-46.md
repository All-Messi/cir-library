<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About the Nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A Message to Egypt about Pharaoh Necho’s Army That Was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, Which Nebuchadnezzar Defeated in the <strong>Fourth Year of Jehoiakim</strong> <strong>Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</strong> 	<strong>A Message About Egypt</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em>“Line</em><em> up the shields and bucklers,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and advance for battle!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>Harness</em><em> the horses, mount the steeds,</em> <em>	</em><em>	take your positions, put your helmets on!</em> <em>	Polish the </em><em>spears;</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	put on the coats of mail!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>But</em><em> what do I see?</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>Egypt’s army is<em> panicking; they’re retreating.</em> <em>	Their soldiers are being </em><em>defeated;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they’re fleeing without looking back.</em> <em>	They’re terrorized in every direction,”</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em>Yahveh says.                      <strong>Jer 46:1-5</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The fast can’t flee; the strong can’t escape. They’ve stumbled and fallen in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is this that’s flooding like the Nile, like rivers out of their banks?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Egypt floods like the Nile, like rivers whose water surges. It has said, <em>“I’ll flood the </em><em>land;</em> <em>	</em><em>	I’ll destroy city and residents.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Advance, horses; drive wildly, chariots, so the infantry can march forward: Nubia and Put, that wield the shield, Lybians, that bend the bow.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:6-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> That day belongs to the Lord Yahveh of hosts, a time of revenge on his enemies.<strong>	</strong> The sword will devour till it’s satisfied and drink its fill of their blood. There’ll be a slaughter for the Lord Yahveh of hosts in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Go up to Gilead and buy salve, virgin daughter in Egypt! In vain do you use lots of medicines; they won’t heal you up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The nations have heard about your humiliation; the whole world has heard your distress cry. One soldier stumbles over another, and they both fall together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>Why</em><em> are your soldiers prostrate?</em> <em>	Because Yahveh has </em><em>beat</em><em> them down.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>He</em><em> made many </em><em>stumble;</em> <em>	they have fallen over one another.</em> <em>Then they said, ‘Get up! Let’s go back</em> <em>	to our own people, to our native land,</em> <em>	away from the oppressor’s sword.’</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>They</em><em> cried out there, </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>‘Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just a lot of </em><em>noise;</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>he’s let the stated time pass by!’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“As</em><em> I live,” </em>the King says, <em>	</em>whose name is Yahveh of Hosts, <em>“somebody is coming like Tabor among the mountains</em> <em>	or like Carmel by the sea.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>Get</em><em> your baggage ready for exile,</em> <em>	</em><em>	daughter that lives in Egypt,</em> <em>	because Memphis will be desolate,</em> <em>	</em><em>	burned down, and uninhabited.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>Egypt</em><em> is a pretty heifer,</em> <em>	but a horsefly is coming from the north!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Egypt’s<em> mercenaries are like grain-fed </em><em>calves;</em> <em>	even they have retreated and fled together.</em> <em>They didn’t stand their </em><em>ground;</em> <em>	their catastrophe has descended on </em><em>them;</em> <em>	</em>it’s <em>their time to be punished.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:17-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>“</em>Egypt<em> is as silent as a snake slithering away,</em> <em>	because its enemies are moving in on it like an army,</em> <em>	</em><em>	like woodsmen with axes.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> <em>They’ll</em><em> cut down its </em><em>forest;</em> <em>	</em><em>	it certainly won’t exist anymore,</em> <em>	even though it’s too numerous to count.</em></span>

Afterwards people will live in Egypt like before.</span>
