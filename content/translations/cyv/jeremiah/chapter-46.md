<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About the Nations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>A Message to Egypt about Pharaoh Necho’s Army That Was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, Which Nebuchadnezzar Defeated in the <strong>Fourth Year of Jehoiakim</strong> <strong>Ben-Josiah, King of Judah</strong> <strong>A Message About Egypt</strong> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Line</em><em> up the shields and bucklers,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and advance for battle!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Harness</em><em> the horses, mount the steeds,</em> <em>	</em><em>	take your positions, put your helmets on!</em> <em>	Polish the </em><em>spears;</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	put on the coats of mail!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> what do I see?</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em>Egypt’s army is<em> panicking; they’re retreating.</em> <em>	Their soldiers are being </em><em>defeated;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they’re fleeing without looking back.</em> <em>	They’re terrorized in every direction,”</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em>Yahveh says.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The fast can’t flee; the strong can’t escape. They’ve stumbled and fallen in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Who is this that’s flooding like the Nile, like rivers out of their banks?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Egypt floods like the Nile, like rivers whose water surges. It has said, <em>“I’ll flood the </em><em>land;</em> <em>	</em><em>	I’ll destroy city and residents.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Advance, horses; drive wildly, chariots, so the infantry can march forward: Nubia and Put, that wield the shield, Lybians, that bend the bow.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:6-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>That day belongs to the Lord Yahveh of hosts, a time of revenge on his enemies.<strong>	</strong> The sword will devour till it’s satisfied and drink its fill of their blood. There’ll be a slaughter for the Lord Yahveh of hosts in the north by the Euphrates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Go up to Gilead and buy salve, virgin daughter in Egypt! In vain do you use lots of medicines; they won’t heal you up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>The nations have heard about your humiliation; the whole world has heard your distress cry. One soldier stumbles over another, and they both fall together.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:10-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The Message Yahveh Spoke to Jeremiah About Nebuchadnezzar Coming to Strike Egypt <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“Declare</em><em> it in Egypt, announce it in Migdol,</em> <em>	</em><em>	tell it in Memphis and </em><em>Tahpanhes;</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	 </em><em>	‘Be prepared </em><em>and stand</em><em> ready</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because the sword has taken everybody around you.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup><em>Why</em><em> are your soldiers prostrate?</em> <em>	Because Yahveh has </em><em>beat</em><em> them down.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>He</em><em> made many </em><em>stumble;</em> <em>	they have fallen over one another.</em> <em>Then they said, ‘Get up! Let’s go back</em> <em>	to our own people, to our native land,</em> <em>	away from the oppressor’s sword.’</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> cried out there, </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>‘Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just a lot of </em><em>noise;</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>he’s let the stated time pass by!’</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“As</em><em> I live,” </em>the King says, <em>	</em>whose name is Yahveh of Hosts, <em>“somebody is coming like Tabor among the mountains</em> <em>	or like Carmel by the sea.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>Get</em><em> your baggage ready for exile,</em> <em>	</em><em>	daughter that lives in Egypt,</em> <em>	because Memphis will be desolate,</em> <em>	</em><em>	burned down, and uninhabited.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>Egypt</em><em> is a pretty heifer,</em> <em>	but a horsefly is coming from the north!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Egypt’s<em> mercenaries are like grain-fed </em><em>calves;</em> <em>	even they have retreated and fled together.</em> <em>They didn’t stand their </em><em>ground;</em> <em>	their catastrophe has descended on </em><em>them;</em> <em>	</em>it’s <em>their time to be punished.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:17-21</p>

### 22“Egypt is as silent as a snake slithering away, 	because its enemies are moving in on it like an army, 		like woodsmen with axes.


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>They’ll</em><em> cut down its </em><em>forest;</em> <em>	</em><em>	it certainly won’t exist anymore,</em> <em>	even though it’s too numerous to count.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup><em>Egypt</em><em> has been humbled,</em> <em>	delivered to the powerful ones up north.”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:22-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, <em>“I’m going to punish Amon of Thebes, Egypt along with its gods and kings, Pharaoh and those who put their trust in him. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> going to deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar and his officers, who want to kill them. Afterwards people will live in Egypt like before. </em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 46:25-26</p>

### 27“But you, Jacob my servant, 	don’t be afraid or intimidated! I’ll rescue you from a long way off 	and your descendants from where they’re captive. Israel will come back and be secure, 	with nobody to make him shudder.


<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>Jacob</em><em>,,</em><em> don’t be </em><em>afraid;</em> <em>	I’m with you.</em> <em>I’ll make a complete end to the nations</em> <em>	where I’ve driven you,</em> <em>but I won’t make a complete end </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>;</em> <em>	I’ll discipline you appropriately—</em> <em>	</em><em>	(not leave you unpunished).”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
