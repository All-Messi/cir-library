## Jeremiah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If you want to come back, you can; get rid of your detestable idols and don't waver back and forth with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives,' honestly, justly, uprightly; then the nations will be blessed in him and glory in him." Coming Destruction from the North</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh says to the people in Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your heart's fallow ground and don't throw your seed among its thorns.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Circumcise yourselves to Yahveh; remove the foreskins of your heart, people in Judah and Jerusalem, so my anger won't flare because of your sins and burn with nobody to put it out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Declare in Judah and Jerusalem: "Blow the bugle in the land; call out and say, 'Flee to the fortified cities.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Lift up a standard toward Zion! Run for refuge; hurry because I'm bringing widespread destruction from the north."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A lion has come up out of its thicket, one that destroys nations; it's left its den to devastate your land and make your towns empty ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Put on burlap for that; lament and wail, because Yahveh's fierce anger hasn't turned away from us. 9"At that time," Yahveh says, "the hearts of the king and officials will fail, the priests will be terrified, and the prophets horrified."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then I said, "Lord Yahveh, you completely misled this nation and Jerusalem when you said they'd have peace; they have a sword at their throat!" 11-12"I'll answer them, 'A scorching wind from the desert's barren hills will blow on you, a wind too strong for winnowing grain or sweeping a threshing floor. It will come at my command to pronounce condemnation on you.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Judah's enemy rises up like clouds; his chariots go up like a whirlwind; his horses are faster than eagles. 'Misfortune awaits us! We're doomed!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jerusalem, wash the evil off your heart so you can be saved; how long will you harbor bad thoughts?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A voice declares from Dan and announces from Mount Ephraim that disaster is on the way. 16"Warn the nearby nations now! Announce it in Jerusalem, besiegers are coming from a far country to raise their battle cries at the towns in Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Like watchmen around a field, they're against it all around because it's rebelled against me," Yahveh says. 18"Your ways and deeds have brought this on you; this bitter punishment has cut you to the heart!" Jeremiah Anguish over Judah's Desolation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My soul, my soul! I'm in anguish! My heart's pounding, I can't stay still. My soul, you've heard the bugle's signal for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Disaster on top of disaster is in store, devastating the whole land. It's destroyed my tents in no time; my curtains were gone in a flash.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> How long do I have to look at the standard and listen to the bugle? 22"My people are foolish; they don't know me; they're ignorant kids that don't understand. They're good at doing bad, but they don't know how to do good." Jeremiah's Vision of Coming Disaster</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I looked at the earth; it was unformed and empty; I looked up at the sky; it didn't shed any light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I looked at the mountains and hills, quaking back and forth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I didn't see any people; the birds had flown away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The fertile land had become a desert; its towns lay in ruins in the face of Yahveh's fierce anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Yahveh says, "The whole country will be a wasteland, but I won't completely destroy it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The earth will mourn, and the sky will grow dark; I've told you my intentions, and I won't change my mind."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> At the sound of calvary and archers, every town is scattering; they're running into thickets and hiding in rocks; they're abandoning the towns.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> What are you going to do, desolate one? Though you're dressed in scarlet and decorate yourself with gold jewelry and accent your eyes with mascara, making yourself beautiful won't do any good, because your lovers despise you, intent on killing you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> I hear a woman crying out in labor, the anguish of one giving birth to her first child, the cry of the young woman of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, "Misfortune awaits me; I'm being murdered." Jerusalem Refuses to Repent</span>
