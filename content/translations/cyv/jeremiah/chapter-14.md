## Jeremiah Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About the Drought 2"In Judah's towns, commerce has died off at their gates; the people sit on the ground mourning; their outcry goes up from Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Nobles send servants to draw water, but the cisterns are dry. They come back with empty pots, demoralized and covering their heads.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The ground is cracked because there's been no rain; farmers are demoralized, too, and cover their heads.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Does out in the country are abandoning their newborn fawns because there's no grass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Donkeys stand on the barren hills and pant for air like jackals; their eyes are blurry because there's no grass."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The people say, "Although our iniquities show that we're guilty, Yahveh, at least do something for your reputation. Yes, we're guilty of countless apostasies; we've sinned against you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Israel's Hope, our Savior in distress, why are you acting like a foreigner here to us or a traveler just pitching his tent for the night?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Why are you like someone overwhelmed, like a strong man that can't rescue? Yet you're among us, Yahveh; we're identified with you; don't abandon us!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yahveh answers, "They like to wander; they don't watch where they're going. So I don't accept them as mine; I remember their iniquity and take account of their sins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh told me, "Don't pray for them. 12I'll ignore their outcry when they fast. When they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won't accept them. I'll put an end to them with sword, famine, and disease."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But I said, "Lord Yahveh, the prophets are telling them they won't see sword or famine, that you'll give them lasting peace here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He answered, "The prophets are prophesying falsely in my name. I haven't spoken to them. They're prophesying false visions, worthless fortunetelling, the deceptions in their own minds. 15Though I haven't sent them, they keep saying there won't be sword or famine here. So they'll meet their end by sword and famine! 16The people they're prophesying to will be victims thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem. There won't be anybody to bury them, their wives, or children. I'll pour out their own wickedness on them. 17"Tell them this, 'My eyes flow with tears day and night without end because the young virgin—my people— has been struck a powerful blow; she has a severely infected wound.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> If I go out in the country, there are corpses slain by the sword. If I go in the city, there's famine and disease because prophet and priest ply their trade in the land and they don't know what they're doing.'" A Prayer for Healing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you despise Zion? Why wound us so bad we can't heal? We waited for peace, but nothing good came; we hoped for healing, but terror came instead!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> We know we're ungodly, Yahveh; we know about our ancestors' sin; we've sinned against you too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> For your own reputation, don't despise us; don't bring disgrace on your glorious throne or annul your covenant with us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Can any nation's idols bring rain? Can the sky grant showers? Isn't that from you, Yahveh our God? So we're putting our hope in you because you can do that. Yahveh Will Not Relent</span>
