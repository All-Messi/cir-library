## Jeremiah Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time," Yahveh says, "I'll be the God of every family in Israel, and they'll be my people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The people that survived the sword found grace in the desert when Israel was looking for rest."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh appeared to him from afar and said, "I've loved you with enduring love; so I've drawn you with lovingkindness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll rebuild you, virgin of Israel! You'll pick up your tambourines again and join the dance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You'll plant your vineyards on Samaria's hills again; you that plant them will enjoy them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There'll be a time when watchmen on the hilltops in Ephraim will call out, 'Let's go up to Zion to Yahveh our God.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yahveh says, "Sing out loud with happiness for Jacob; shout among the chiefs of the nations. Proclaim, give praise, and say, 'Yahveh, save the remnant of Israel.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll bring them from the north country; I'll gather them from the remote parts of the world, the blind and lame among them, the pregnant, and those in labor— that large company will come back here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They'll come weeping, and I'll be leading them with consolation; I'll make them walk by streams on a straight path where they won't stumble; I'm Israel's father; Ephraim's my firstborn."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Nations, listen to a message from Yahveh and announce it in distant lands: "The One that scattered Israel will gather him and keep him like a shepherd keeps his flock."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh has ransomed Jacob, redeemed him from someone stronger than he is. 12"They'll come and shout for joy on Zion's hill, and be radiant over the bounty from Yahveh— the grain, new wine, and olive oil; the young in the flock and herd; they'll thrive like a watered garden and never wilt again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The virgins will celebrate in the dance; the young men and old will celebrate together. I'll turn your mourning into joy, comfort you, and replace sorrow with happiness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll fill the soul of the priests with abundance; my goodness will be satisfying to my people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh says, "A sound was heard in Ramah, weeping and bitter crying, Rachel weeping for her children; she couldn't be consoled, because they were gone."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh says, "Don't cry or shed tears; your work will be rewarded. They'll come back from their enemy's land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> There's hope for your future; your children will return to their own land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've heard Ephraim moaning, 'You've disciplined me like an untrained calf. Bring me back so I can be restored because you're Yahveh my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> After I turned around, I repented; after I was instructed, I struck my thigh. I was ashamed and humiliated because I carried the disgrace of my youth.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Is Ephraim my dear son, my delightful child? As often as I've spoken against him, I'll still remember him. My heart yearns to have mercy on him. 21"Set up road signs, erect guideposts; look at the highway you used when you left. Come, virgin of Israel; come back to your cities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> How long will you wander around, unfaithful daughter? Yahveh has created a new thing in the world— a woman protecting a man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "They'll speak this message again in Judah's towns when I restore their fortunes: 'Yahveh bless you, righteous home, holy hill!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Judah's townspeople, farmers and herdsmen will live in harmony. 25I'll satisfy the weary and refresh the fainting."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then I woke up; my sleep was pleasant. 27"The time's coming when I'll sow Israel and Judah with people and animals. 28As I've watched over them to pull up, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster; so I'll watch over them to plant and build. 29They won't say anymore, 'The parents ate sour grapes, and the children's mouths puckered.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Everybody will die for their own sin. Those who eat sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths pucker. 31"The time's coming," Yahveh says, "when I'll make a new covenant with Israel and Judah. 32It won't be like the one I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I was a husband to them. 33I'll make this kind of covenant with them: I'll put my Law inside them; I'll write it on their heart. I'll be their God and they'll be my people. 34No one will be teaching their brother and fellow citizen to know Yahveh, because they'll all know me from least to greatest. I'll forgive their sin; I won't keep it in mind anymore."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Yahveh says— who provides the sun to light the day and the moon and stars for light at night, who makes the sea roar, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts— 36"If this fixed order can disappear, then Israel's offspring can disappear from being a nation that serves me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> If the sky above can be measured and the earth's foundations can be explored, then I can throw away Israel's offspring for everything they've done. 38"The time's coming," Yahveh says, "when the city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 39The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb and then turn to Goah. 40The whole valley of dead bodies and ashes, the fields over to the Brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate on the east—will be sacred to me, never again uprooted or thrown down."</span>
