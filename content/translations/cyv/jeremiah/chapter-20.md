## Jeremiah Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Pashhur Ben-Immer, the priest in charge of Yahveh's Temple, heard Jeremiah prophesying that, 2he had him beaten and put in stocks at the upper Benjamin Gate of the Temple. 3The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah told him, "Yahveh doesn't call you Pashhur, but The Man Surrounded by Terror. 4He says, 'I'm going to make you a terror to yourself and your friends. While you watch, they'll fall by their enemies' sword. I'll turn Judah over to the king of Babylon to carry away and kill. 5I'll turn over this city's wealth, its produce, its expensive things, the treasures of Judah's kings to take to Babylon. 6Pashhur, you, everybody in your house, and the friends you've falsely prophesied for will go into captivity and be buried in Babylon.'" Jeremiah's Complaint 7"Yahveh, you've deceived me; you're stronger than I am and have prevailed. I'm a laughingstock all day long; everybody makes fun of me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When I speak, I cry out violence and destruction. Because of me your message has led to constant disgrace and derision.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But if I say, 'I won't remember him or speak in his name anymore,' my heart burns inside me like fire in my bones. I get tired of trying to hold it in; I can't endure it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I've heard many whispering, 'There's terror everywhere! Denounce him; let's denounce him!' My trusted friends watch for my downfall and say, 'Maybe he'll make a mistake so we can take revenge on him.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But you're with me like a dreaded warrior, so the ones that persecute me will trip and fall. They'll be totally ashamed because they'll fail with a disgrace people won't forget.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh of Hosts, you that test the godly, who see the heart and mind, let me watch you take revenge on them because I've turned my concerns over to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Sing praise to Yahveh; he delivers the poor from their oppressors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Curse the day I was born; don't celebrate the day my mother bore me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Curse the one that told my father, "You have a baby!" and made him so happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Let that man be like the cities Yahveh overthrew without restraint. Terrify him with a morning battle cry, a shout of alarm at noon,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> because he didn't kill me before I was born and make my mother my tomb— make her womb pregnant forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Why was I ever born to see trouble, sorrow, and shame?</span>
