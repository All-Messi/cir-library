## Jeremiah Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oh that my head was a body of water and my eyes a fountain of tears, so I could weep day and night for my people slain!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I wish I had an inn in the desert, so I could escape from my people; because they're all adulterers, a pack of liars. 3"They bend their tongues like bows; lies, not truth, dominate the land. The people move from one sin to another; they don't know me. 4"Be leery of your neighbor; don't trust your own brother, because every brother takes advantage of brother and every neighbor slanders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They all deceive their friends; nobody tells the truth. They've taught their tongues how to lie; they wear themselves out sinning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They live in deceit; by deceiving, they refuse to know me," Yahveh says. Judgment for Disobedience</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So he says: "I'll refine them and assay them; what else can I do with them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their tongues are deadly arrows that deceive; they talk peace to one another, but inside they're setting an ambush for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Am I not going to punish them for such things and avenge myself on a nation like that? 10"I'll weep and wail for the mountains and take up a dirge for the pastures, because they're laid waste, so nobody travels that way. Nobody hears cattle bawling; birds and animals have left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll make Jerusalem a pile of ruins, a den for jackals, and the towns in Judah ghost towns."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is Yahveh talking to that can pass it on? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert nobody travels through? 13Yahveh answers, "They've abandoned the Law I set before them; they haven't followed it or obeyed me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They've followed Baal and their stubborn heart like their ancestors taught them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So I'll feed them bitter plants to eat and give them poisoned water to drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll scatter them among nations they and their ancestors never knew, and chase them with the sword till I've wiped them out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says: "Call for mourners; call for wailing women!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Have them hurry and raise up wailing for us so our eyes shed tears and our eyelids flow with water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> There is wailing in Zion, 'We're ruined! We're disgraced because we've left our country, and they've torn down our houses.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Listen to Yahveh's message, women; your ears need to hear what he has to say. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach your friends a dirge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Death has come up into our windows and climbed into our houses; it's killed our children in the streets and our young men in the town squares.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Say, "Yahveh says, 'Corpses will fall like manure in the pasture, like bundles behind the reaper; but nobody will gather them up.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh says, "Don't let the wise brag about their wisdom, or the strong boast of their strength. or the rich gloat over their wealth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Instead, they need to take pride in knowing I'm Yahveh who practices enduring love, justice, and goodness in the world, because that's what I delight in. 25"The time's coming when I'll punish everyone that's circumcised in body but not in heart—26Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and the ones in the desert that cut the corners of their hair. All the nations are uncircumcised; everyone in Israel is uncircumcised in heart." God and Idols</span>
