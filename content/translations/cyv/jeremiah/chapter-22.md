## Jeremiah Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Yahveh says, <em>“</em><em>Go to the king’s </em><em>palace</em><em> in Judah and say, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>‘Listen</em><em> to </em><em>this</em><em> message from </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, king of Judah on David’</em><em>s throne—</em><em>you, your </em><em>official</em><em>s, and your people that </em><em>come</em><em> in these gates.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Be</em><em> just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who’ve been robbed. Don’t mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you do that, kings who sit on David’s throne will come </em><em>in</em><em> these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you won’t, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty.”’” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> his time Judah will be </em><em>safe;</em> <em>	</em><em>	Israel will live safely.</em> <em>	They’ll call him Yahveh</em><em> Our Goodness.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong><em>People</em></strong><strong><em> won’t swear then, ‘As sure as sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ </em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>They’ll</em></strong><strong><em> swear, ‘As sure as Yahveh lives who brought Israel’s descendants back from the north countries where he’d banished them.’ They’ll live again on their own land.”</em></strong><strong>  </strong><strong>      </strong></span>

### Message About False Prophets


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>As for the false prophets: My heart’s broken; my body’s shaking; I’m like someone drunk on wine because of Yahveh and his holy message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The country is full of adultery; it languishes under a curse. The pastures have dried up; <em>the prophets</em> all do evil; they misuse their authority.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:9-10</p>

### 11“Prophet and priest are ungodly; 	I’ve found their wickedness right in my Temple.


<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>This is what Yahveh says about Shallum/<em>Jehoahaz</em> Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here: <em>“He’s never coming </em><em>back;</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> their road will be a slippery path in the dark</em> <em>	where they’ll be driven and </em><em>fall down</em><em>.</em> <em>I’ll bring catastrophe on them</em> <em>	when I punish them.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:11-12</p>

### 13“I’ve seen something offensive about the prophets in Samaria; 	they’ve prophesied by Baal and misled my people.


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>Now</em><em> I’ve seen something horrible about the prophets in </em><em>Jerusalem;</em> <em>	they’ve committed adultery and followed lies.</em> <em>They encourage the ones that do evil,</em> <em>	</em><em>so</em><em> nobody turns back from sin.</em> <em>They’ve become like Sodom</em><em> </em><em>to me,</em> <em>	like the people in Gomorrah.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> this is what Yahveh says about the prophets:</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>‘I’</em></strong><strong><em>ll</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>feed</em></strong><strong><em> them bitter plants</em></strong><strong><em> to eat</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and </em></strong><strong><em>give them</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>poisoned water to drink</em></strong><em>,</em><em>	</em> <strong><em>	</em></strong><em>because the prophets in Jerusalem</em> <em>	</em><em>	have spread ungodliness in the land.’”</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Yahveh of Hosts says, <em>	“Ignore your </em><em>prophets;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they’re giving you false hopes.</em> <em>	They talk to you about visions they imagine,</em> <em>	</em><em>	not visions from me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>They</em><em> keep telling those who despise me</em> <em>	that Yahveh has said they’ll have </em><em>peace;</em> <em>they say to the ones who follow their own stubborn heart</em> <em>	 that catastrophe won’t happen to them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> who has stood in the council of Yahveh</em> <em>	to see and hear his message?</em> <em>	Who has paid attention to what he says?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>An</em><em> angry storm has gone out like a tornado,</em> <em>	like a micro-burst on the heads of sinners.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>Yahveh’s</em><em> anger won’t let up</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>till he’s carried out his intentions.</em> <em>Later, you’ll understand.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:16-20</p>

### 21“I didn’t send those prophets;  		yet they hurried to deliver their ideas; 	I didn’t speak to them;  		yet they kept on prophesying.


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> spoke to you in your prosperity;</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>but you said, ‘I don’t have to do that!’</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>That’s the way you’ve acted since you were young.</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 22:18-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>If</em><em> they’d stood in my council,</em> <em>	they would’ve delivered my message </em> <em>	and turned back from their own ways and deeds.</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“Am</em><em> I a God that’s close by </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>and not one that’s far off?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Can</em><em> anybody hide from me?</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>Don’t I fill</em><em> earth and sky? </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 23:21-24</p>

### 25“I’ve heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’ 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw’s different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I’m against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim IY said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They’re no benefit them at all.     	Jer 23:25-32 33“When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, ‘What’s Yahveh’s burden?’ tell him he’s the burden, and Yahveh is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, ‘Yahveh’s burden,’ I’ll punish along with his family. 35You’re to ask your brother and fellow citizen, ‘What has Yahveh answered?’ ‘What has Yahveh said?’ 36Don’t use the expression ‘Yahveh’s burden’ anymore; that ‘burden’ is nothing but somebody’s own idea that perverts the message from the living God, Yahveh of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, ‘What has Yahveh answered you?’ ‘What has Yahveh said?’ 38If you say, ‘Yahveh’s burden,’ 39I’ll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I’ll permanently disgrace you.’” 	Jer 23:33-40	 Two Baskets of Figs
