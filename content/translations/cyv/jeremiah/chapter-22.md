## Jeremiah Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "Go to the king's palace in Judah and say, 2'Listen to this message from Yahveh, king of Judah on David's throne—you, your officials, and your people that come in these gates. 3"Be just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who've been robbed. Don't mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  4If you do that, kings who sit on David's throne will come in these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. 5If you won't, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He says this about the king of Judah's palace: "You're like Gilead to me, like the top of Lebanon; yet I'll make a desert out of you, an empty city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll send destroyers against you with their weapons to cut down your best cedars and throw them in the fire. 8"Nations will pass this city and say, 'Why did Yahveh do that to this great city?' 9People will answer, 'Because they abandoned his covenant with them and served other gods.' 10"Don't mourn for the dead king; weep bitterly for the one that's leaving; he'll never come back to see his native land." Message About Jehoahaz</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> This is what Yahveh says about Shallum/Jehoahaz Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here: "He's never coming back;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> where he goes is where he'll die. Message About Jehoiakim 13"Misfortune awaits Jehoiakim that's built his palace with forced labor,									his upper rooms with injustice:								he made his countrymen work for him for nothing;							14he said, 'I'll build myself a grand palace									      with large upper rooms, 									            cut out windows for it,											panel it with cedar,											and paint it red.'		Jer 22:11-14 		15Do you think you're a king because you traffic in cedar?					Didn't your father eat and drink,									do justice and goodness?									Things went well for him.							16He defended the poor and needy; isn't that what it means to know me?						17But you have eyes and heart									only for your own dishonest gain,								for shedding innocent blood,									for practicing oppression and violence."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So Yahveh says about Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, king of Judah: "They won't mourn for him, as in								'My brother,' 'My sister!'						  They won't mourn for him, as in								'My master' or 'He had such splendor!'							19They'll him buried like a donkey,								dragged off and thrown out of Jerusalem.				20Go up to Lebanon and cry out;									shout in Bashan. Cry out from Abarim											because your lovers have been destroyed.				21I spoke to you in your prosperity;								but you said, 'I don't have to do that!'							That's the way you've acted since you were young.	Jer 22:18-21		22The wind will blow your allies away;								your buddies will go into captivity.							Your sinfulness will disgrace you.							23You that live nested in cedars from Lebanon,							how you'll groan when pangs come on you								like a woman in childbirth! Message About Jehoiachin 24"As I live," Yahveh says, "even if you, Coniah/Jehoiachin Ben-Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I'd pull you off 25and hand you to the executioners you dread: Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. 26I'll expel you and your mother from your native land. 27You won't return to the land you'll yearn to see. 28"Why is Coniah/Jehoiachin a despised, shattered pot,						an unwanted container?							Why have he and his descendants been expelled							into a foreign country?							29Land, land, land,										listen to Yahveh's message:							30'Let the records show that this man had no children;							he was a failure in his own time.						He won't have a descendant to succeed him							on David's throne in Judah.'" The Righteous Branch</span>
