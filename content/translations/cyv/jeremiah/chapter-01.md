<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Messages from Yahveh came to him in the thirteenth year of Josiah Ben-Amon, king of Judah. 3They came as well during the reign of Jehoiakim Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, till the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah Ben-Josiah, king of Judah, till Jerusalem's exile in the fifth month. The Call of Jeremiah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 5"I knew you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born and appointed you as a prophet to the nations."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I said, "Lord Yahveh! I don't know how to speak for you; I'm too young."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But Yahveh told me, "Don't say you're too young; you'll go where I send you and say what I tell you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You don't need to be afraid of them; I'll protect you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He reached out and touched my mouth, "I've put my message in you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> and appointed you over nations and kingdoms to pull up and tear down, to overthrow and destroy, to build and plant."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "An 'almond' branch." 12"Yes; I'm "watching," and I'll certainly do what I say."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Anothere message came to me: "What do you see?" "A boiling pot facing this way from the north."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then he said, "Evil is going to pour out from the north onto the people in this country. 15I'm calling the armies in the kingdoms up north. Each one will set a throne at Jerusalem's gates, against its walls all round, against the towns in Judah. 16I'll render judgment on this nation for leaving me and sacrificing to other gods, for worshiping what they've made with their own hands. 17Gird up your loins. Get up and tell them everything I've told you. Don't let them intimidate you, or I'll dishearten you in front of them. 18Today, I'm making you like a fortified city today, like an iron pillar, like bronze walls against the whole land, Judah's kings, officials, priests, and people. 19They'll fight you, but they won't win, because I'm with you." Israel Forsakes God</span>
