## Jeremiah Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah About the Philistines Before Pharaoh Conquered Gaza</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh says, "A flood is swelling up from the north; it will become a tsunami. It'll flood the land and everything in it, the cities and those who live in them. People will cry out; everybody in the land will wail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Because of the noise of stallions, rushing chariots, wheels, fathers won't look back for their children; they'll be too overwhelmed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> by what's coming to destroy the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every ally that's left. Yahveh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant along the coast of Crete.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Gaza will be bald; Ashkelon will lie in ruins. Remnant in the plain, how long will you gash yourselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Sword of Yahveh, how long before you're still, before you go back into your sheath?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But how can it be still when Yahveh has ordered it to attack against Ashkelon and the seacoast?"</span>
