## Jeremiah Chapter **33**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Yahveh’s Second Message to Jeremiah While Confined in the Courtyard of the Guard</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>This is what Yahveh says who made the earth, formed and established it:<em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Call</em><em> out to me, and I’ll tell you important things you don’t know.” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The God of Israel says <em>this </em>about the houses in this city—including the palace of Judah’s kings—that were torn down to get materials for defending against the siege mounds and the sword, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“They’re coming to fight the Babylonians and fill the </em>houses<em> with the corpses of men that in my anger I’ve </em>destined to die<em>. I withdrew because of their sinfulness. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Later<em> I’ll bring them health and </em><em>healing, and</em><em> show them true prosperity and peace. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them like they were before. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> cleanse them from their sin against me. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>This city <em>will have a world-wide reputation for joy, praise, and honor to me. The nations will hear about the good I’m doing for it, and tremble at the peace I’m making for </em>it<em>.”</em><strong>	        </strong><strong>	      </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Yahveh says,<em> “You say this place is a waste without people or animals—desolate towns in Judah and streets in Jerusalem. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But<em> you’ll hear again the sound of happiness, the voices of bride and groom, of people who say, </em> <em>	‘Thank Yahveh </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em>Hosts;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he’s </em><em>good;</em> <em>	</em><em>	his love endures forever.’</em> You’ll hear people<em> bringing thank offerings to his Temple. I’ll restore the fortunes of the land like they were in the beginning.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Yahveh of Hosts says,<em> “Shepherds will bed down their flocks in the towns that are ‘a waste without people or animals.’ </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Flocks</em><em> will pass again under the hands of the one that’s counting them in the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, in Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and Judah.</em><strong>	     </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 33:10-13</p>

### 14“The time’s coming when I’ll keep the promise I’ve made about Israel and Judah. 15A good Branch will sprout from David and carry out justice and goodness in the land. 16Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live safely. His name will be Yahveh Is Our Goodness [Yahveh Tsidekenu]. 17David will always have a man on the throne. 18The Levitical priests will always have a man to offer me burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices.”  Jer 33:14-18


<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“If</em><em> my covenant with day and night could be broken so they wouldn’t happen at their appointed times, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> my covenant could also be broken so that David wouldn’t have a descendant on his throne and the Levitical priests wouldn’t serve as my ministers. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> the stars in the sky can’t be counted and the sand on the shore can’t be numbered, that’s how much I’ll multiply the descendants of David my servant and the Levites my ministers.”</em><strong>	       </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 33:19-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Have</em><em> you noticed how the people say Yahveh has rejected the two families he chose? They don’t consider my people one nation. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>My</em><em> covenant with day and </em><em>night stands</em><em>. As sure as I’ve established the patterns of earth and sky, </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> keep the offspring of Jacob and choose a descendant of David to rule the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I’ll show them mercy and restore their fortunes.’” </em><em>	</em></span>
