<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh’s Second Message to Jeremiah While Confined in the Courtyard of the Guard</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> This is what Yahveh says who made the earth, formed and established it:<em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Call</em><em> out to me, and I’ll tell you important things you don’t know.” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The God of Israel says <em>this </em>about the houses in this city—including the palace of Judah’s kings—that were torn down to get materials for defending against the siege mounds and the sword, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“They’re coming to fight the Babylonians and fill the </em>houses<em> with the corpses of men that in my anger I’ve </em>destined to die<em>. I withdrew because of their sinfulness. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Later<em> I’ll bring them health and </em><em>healing, and</em><em> show them true prosperity and peace. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them like they were before. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> cleanse them from their sin against me. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>This city <em>will have a world-wide reputation for joy, praise, and honor to me. The nations will hear about the good I’m doing for it, and tremble at the peace I’m making for </em>it<em>.”</em><strong>	        </strong><strong>	      </strong><strong>Jer 33:1-9 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Yahveh says,<em> “You say this place is a waste without people or animals—desolate towns in Judah and streets in Jerusalem. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But<em> you’ll hear again the sound of happiness, the voices of bride and groom, of people who say, </em> <em>	‘Thank Yahveh </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em>Hosts;</em> <em>	</em><em>	he’s </em><em>good;</em> <em>	</em><em>	his love endures forever.’</em> You’ll hear people<em> bringing thank offerings to his Temple. I’ll restore the fortunes of the land like they were in the beginning.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says,<em> “Shepherds will bed down their flocks in the towns that are ‘a waste without people or animals.’ </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Flocks</em><em> will pass again under the hands of the one that’s counting them in the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, in Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and Judah.</em><strong>	     </strong><strong>Jer 33:10-13</strong><strong>	       </strong></span>
