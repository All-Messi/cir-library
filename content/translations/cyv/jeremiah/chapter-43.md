## Jeremiah Chapter **43**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>As soon as Jeremiah finished, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Azariah Ben-Hoshaiah, Johanan Ben-Kareah, and the arrogant men told him, <em>“You’re lying. Yahveh didn’t say not to go live in Egypt. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Baruch</em><em> Ben-Neriah is prompting you to turn us over to the Babylonians so they can execute us or exile us to Babylon.”</em>  <strong><sup>4-</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So Johanan and the commanders took to Egypt the entire remnant that had come back from the countries where they’d been driven: <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>men, women, children, the king’s daughters, everyone Nebuzaradan had left with Gedaliah, together with Jeremiah and Baruch. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They got as far as Tahpanhes.<strong> </strong><strong>	          </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Yahveh told Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Bury</em><em> some big rocks in the mortar in the brick </em>terrace<em> at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes so some of the Jews can see it. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> them that Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’m going to send </em><em>for Nebuchadnezzar my servant</em><em> and set his throne on those rocks</em><em>.</em><em> He’ll spread his canopy over them </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>when</em><em> he comes to strike Egypt. The ones destined to die will die; the ones destined for captivity will go captive, the ones destined for the sword will die by the sword. </em><strong><sup>12-</sup></strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> burn the temples of Egypt’s gods and shatter the obelisks in Heliopolis. He’ll wrap himself with Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself in his coat and leave unscathed.’” </em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
