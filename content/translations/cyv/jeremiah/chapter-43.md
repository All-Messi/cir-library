## Jeremiah Chapter 43

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As soon as Jeremiah finished, 2Azariah Ben-Hoshaiah, Johanan Ben-Kareah, and the arrogant men told him, "You're lying. Yahveh didn't say not to go live in Egypt. 3Baruch Ben-Neriah is prompting you to turn us over to the Babylonians so they can execute us or exile us to Babylon."  4-5So Johanan and the commanders took to Egypt the entire remnant that had come back from the countries where they'd been driven: 6men, women, children, the king's daughters, everyone Nebuzaradan had left with Gedaliah, together with Jeremiah and Baruch. 7They got as far as Tahpanhes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh told Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, 9"Bury some big rocks in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes so some of the Jews can see it. 10Tell them that Yahveh of Hosts says, 'I'm going to send for Nebuchadnezzar my servant and set his throne on those rocks. He'll spread his canopy over them 11when he comes to strike Egypt. The ones destined to die will die; the ones destined for captivity will go captive, the ones destined for the sword will die by the sword. 12-13He'll burn the temples of Egypt's gods and shatter the obelisks in Heliopolis. He'll wrap himself with Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself in his coat and leave unscathed.'"</span>
