<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah When King Zedekiah Sent Him Pashhur Ben-Malchijah and Zephaniah Ben-Maaseiah, the Priest Jerusalem to Fall to Nebuchadnezzar 2"Inquire from Yahveh for us; Nebuchadnezzar is attacking us. Maybe Yahveh will show us one of his wonderful acts so our enemy will withdraw."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jeremiah told them, "Tell Zedekiah 4that Yahveh God of Israel says, 'I'm going to make your weapons useless for fighting those who are laying siege outside the wall. I'll let them come to the center of the city. 5I'll fight you myself with outstretched hand and strong arm in anger, wrath, and fury. 6I'll strike down people and animals with a severe plague. 7After that, I'll turn over to Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah, his officials, and people that survive the sword, famine, and disease. He won't spare, he won't pity, he won't have mercy.' 8"Tell the people Yahveh says, 'I'm giving you a choice, a way to live and a way to die. 9If you stay in the city, you'll die by sword, famine, and disease. If you surrender, you'll have your life as the reward of war. 10I've decided to give this city to the king of Babylon to burn.' 11"Then tell the king of Judah's household, 'Listen to Yahveh's message, 12dynasty of David: "Render justice every morning; deliver from their oppressors those being robbed so my anger won't flare and burn with nobody to put it out because of your sins. 13"I'm against you, Jerusalem, you that live above the valley in that rocky fortress, you that say, 'Who can touch us up here? Nobody can break in where we live.'</span>
