## Jeremiah Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told me, "Go buy a linen waistcloth and put it on. Don't wash it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> So I bought one and put it on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then he said, 4"Take it to the Euphrates and hide it in a crevice in a rock." 5So I went and hid it there. 6A long time later, Yahveh told me to go get it. 7I went and dug it out of where I'd put it. It was ruined.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then he told me, 9"This waistcloth illustrates how I'll ruin arrogant Judah and Jerusalem. 10These people are following their own stubborn hearts in serving and bowing to other gods; they won't be good for anything—like this waistcloth. 11As it clings to a person's waist, so I made Israel and Judah for clinging to me so they could be my people, a name, praise, and glory; but they've ignored me. 12"So tell them that Yahveh God of Israel says to fill every jug with wine. When they say, 'Don't we very well know how to do that?' 13then say, 'Yahveh says, "I'm about to make everybody drunk in this land, from kings on David's throne, to priests and prophets, and the residents in Jerusalem! 14I'll pit them against one another, even parents against children. Pitying, feeling sorry, having compassion won't keep me from destroying them."'" Exile Threatened</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Listen; don't be proud; Yahveh has spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Honor him before he brings darkness, before you stumble on the darkened mountains. If you look for light then, he'll turn it into darkness and gloom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> If you don't listen, my soul will sob in secret, my eyes will weep bitterly, tears will run down my cheeks because Yahveh's flock's been captured.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Tell the king and queen mother, "Take a low seat, because your beautiful crown has been taken from your head."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The towns in the Negev will be closed; nobody will be able to open them; Judah will go into exile. 20"Look who's coming from the north. Where are the beautiful sheep of the flock you were given?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> What will you say when Yahveh appoints over you former allies that you taught? Won't pains come on you like a woman in childbirth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If you say to yourself, 'Why has this happened to me?' It's because of how sinful you are that your skirt has been torn off, and you're being raped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Can a Nubian change the color of his skin or a leopard change its spots? Then can you do good that have the habit of doing evil?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So I'll scatter you like chaff in the desert wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That's the lot I've measured out to you," Yahveh says, 		Jer 13:20-25a "because you've forgotten me and trusted in lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So I have stripped your skirt off over your face to show your shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I've seen your detestable deeds: your adulteries and neighing, your lewd prostitution right out in the open on the hills. Misfortune awaits you, Jerusalem! How long will you stay defiled?"		Jer 13:25b-27</span>
