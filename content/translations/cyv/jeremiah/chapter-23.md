## Jeremiah Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is what Yahveh God of Israel says about shepherds that scatter and destroy his sheep instead of tending to them, "I'm about to tend to you for the evil you've done. 3But I'll gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries where I've driven them, and bring them back to their pasture to reproduce and multiply. 4I'll raise up shepherds to tend them. They won't be afraid anymore, and none of them will go missing. 5"The time's coming when I'll raise up a good Branch for David; he'll reign as King, deal wisely, and carry out justice and goodness in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In his time Judah will be safe; Israel will live safely. They'll call him Yahveh Our Goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> People won't swear then, 'As sure as sure as Yahveh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.' 8They'll swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives who brought Israel's descendants back from the north countries where he'd banished them.' They'll live again on their own land." Message About False Prophets</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> As for the false prophets: My heart's broken; my body's shaking; I'm like someone drunk on wine because of Yahveh and his holy message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The country is full of adultery; it languishes under a curse. The pastures have dried up; the prophets all do evil; they misuse their authority. 11"Prophet and priest are ungodly; I've found their wickedness right in my Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So their road will be a slippery path in the dark where they'll be driven and fall down. I'll bring catastrophe on them when I punish them. 13"I've seen something offensive about the prophets in Samaria; they've prophesied by Baal and misled my people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Now I've seen something horrible about the prophets in Jerusalem; they've committed adultery and followed lies. They encourage the ones that do evil, so nobody turns back from sin. They've become like Sodom to me, like the people in Gomorrah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So this is what Yahveh says about the prophets: 'I'll feed them bitter plants to eat and give them poisoned water to drink, because the prophets in Jerusalem have spread ungodliness in the land.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says, "Ignore your prophets; they're giving you false hopes. They talk to you about visions they imagine, not visions from me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They keep telling those who despise me that Yahveh has said they'll have peace; they say to the ones who follow their own stubborn heart that catastrophe won't happen to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But who has stood in the council of Yahveh to see and hear his message? Who has paid attention to what he says?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> An angry storm has gone out like a tornado, like a micro-burst on the heads of sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Yahveh's anger won't let up till he's carried out his intentions. Later, you'll understand. 21"I didn't send those prophets; yet they hurried to deliver their ideas; I didn't speak to them; yet they kept on prophesying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If they'd stood in my council, they would've delivered my message and turned back from their own ways and deeds. 23"Am I a God that's close by and not one that's far off?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Can anybody hide from me? Don't I fill earth and sky? 25"I've heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, 'I have dreamed! I have dreamed!' 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw's different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I'm against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim IY said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They're no benefit them at all. 33"When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, 'What's Yahveh's burden?' tell him he's the burden, and Yahveh is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, 'Yahveh's burden,' I'll punish along with his family. 35You're to ask your brother and fellow citizen, 'What has Yahveh answered?' 'What has Yahveh said?' 36Don't use the expression 'Yahveh's burden' anymore; that 'burden' is nothing but somebody's own idea that perverts the message from the living God, Yahveh of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, 'What has Yahveh answered you?' 'What has Yahveh said?' 38If you say, 'Yahveh's burden,' 39I'll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I'll permanently disgrace you.'" Two Baskets of Figs</span>
