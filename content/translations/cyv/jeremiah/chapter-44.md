## Jeremiah Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message to Jeremiah for the Jews Living in Egypt in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the Territory of Pathros <strong>Disaster Because of Idolatry</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The men that knew their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods and the women that were standing by—including a large number from Pathros—answered Jeremiah,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Jeremiah responded, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“Didn’t</em><em> Yahveh know about the smoking sacrifices you and your ancestors, kings and official, and common people burned? </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> wouldn’t put up with your sinful deeds and detestable acts anymore. </em><em>So</em><em> your land has become a ruin, abhorred, a curse, and uninhabited. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> catastrophe has fallen on you because you’ve burned sacrifices and sinned against him, and didn’t obey him or follow his Law, statutes, or testimonies.</em> <em>[</em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>]</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> and your wives have said, ‘We’ll keep our vows to burn sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out liquid offerings to her.’ Go ahead and keep your vows! </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> listen to what Yahveh says, ‘I’ve sworn by my great name that nobody from Judah that’s in Egypt will ever invoke my name again, “As the Lord Yahveh lives . . .” </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> see to it that they’re harmed. They’ll meet their end by sword and famine. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Only</em><em> a few will ever make it back to Judah. Then the remnant in Egypt will know whose message will stand, theirs or mine. </em><strong><sup>29-</sup></strong><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is how you’ll know: I’ll punish you here </em>too<em> and deliver Pharaoh Hophra </em>[Apries] <em>to his enemies like I turned Zedekiah over to Nebuchadnezzar.’”</em><strong>          </strong><strong></span>
