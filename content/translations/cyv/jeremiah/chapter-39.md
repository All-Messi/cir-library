## Jeremiah Chapter 39

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and began to lay siege to it. 2The ninth day, fourth month, eleventh year of Zedekiah, they breached the wall. 3The officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer the Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the rest. 4When Zedekiah and his soldiers saw them, they fled at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls and headed toward the Arabah. 5But the Babylonian army caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him up to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 6He executed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him and executed the nobles of Judah. 7Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him in bronze restraints, and took him to Babylon. 8The Babylonians burned the king's palace and the people's houses and tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 9Nebuchadnezzar exiled to Babylon the rest of the people in the city and the ones that defected to him. 10Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, left some people in Judah that didn't have anything, and gave them vineyards and fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Nebuchadnezzar gave Nebuzaradan orders about Jeremiah, 12"Look after him; don't harm him. Deal with him like he tells you." 13So Nebuzaradan, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the leading officials of the king of Babylon 14sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah to take him home. So he stayed among the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Jeremiah While He Was in the Guardhouse 16"Go tell Ebed-melech the Nubian, 'Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, "I'm about to bring my message on this city for disaster, not prosperity. It'll take place before yousg on that day. 17But yousg won't be given over to the men you dread. 18I'll rescue you so you won't fall by the sword. You'll have to save your life by being a reward of war, because you've trusted in me."'"</span>
