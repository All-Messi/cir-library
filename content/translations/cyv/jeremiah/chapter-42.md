## Jeremiah Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Johanan, his commanders, Jezaniah Ben-Hoshaiah, and the people least to greatest came 2to Jeremiah, "Please honor our petition. Pray for us to Yahveh your God for this remnant. There are just a few of us left, as you can see. 3Pray that Yahveh will tell us what we should do."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jeremiah said, "I'll pray to him and not keep back a word of his answer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They said, "May Yahveh be a true and faithful witness against us if we don't obey his whole message. 6Whether pleasant or not, we'll listen so things will go well with us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Ten days later, a message came to Jeremiah. 8He called Johanan, his commanders, and the people, 9"Yahveh says, 10'If you stay in this land, I'll plant you and build you up, and relent from the catastrophe I've inflicted on you. 11Don't be afraid; I'll deliver you from the king of Babylon 12and show you mercy so he'll have mercy and return you to your own land. 13But if you say, 14"We'll go stay in Egypt, where we won't be near war, hear the bugle, or go hungry," [15] 16then the sword you fear will catch up with you, the famine you're anxious about will follow soon after you arrive, and you'll die there. 17Everybody that goes to Egypt will die by sword, famine, and disease. Nobody will survive the catastrophe I'll bring.'" 18"'As I've poured out my anger on the people in Jerusalem, I'll pour it out on you in Egypt. You'll become a curse, something abhorred, a disgrace. You won't be coming back here.' 19Yahveh is telling you today not to go to Egypt! 20You're only deceiving yourselves. You said, 'Pray to Yahveh our God; we'll do whatever he says.' 21But you're not doing it. 22So understand that you'll die by sword, famine, and disease where you want to go live."
