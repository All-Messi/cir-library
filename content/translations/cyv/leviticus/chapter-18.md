<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel, <em>“</em><em><u>I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em><u> your God</u></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> do what they do in Egypt where you lived or in Canaan where I’m taking you. Don’t follow their statutes. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you obey my regulations and keep my statutes, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>you’ll</em><em> have life.</em><em>	 </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 18:1-5</p>

### 6“Don’t have sexual relations with any blood relative; I’m Yahveh. 7Don’t uncover the nakedness of your father by uncovering the nakedness of your mother 8or your father’s wife. 9Don’t have sexual relations with your sister or half-sister, born in your home or elsewhere. 10Don’t uncover the nakedness of your granddaughter; her nakedness is your nakedness. [11] 12-14Don’t uncover the nakedness of your aunt; she’s your parent’s blood relative. You uncover your uncle’s nakedness by approaching his wife. 15Don’t have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law; she’s your son’s wife. 16Don’t have sexual relations with your sister-in-law; it’s your brother’s nakedness. 17Don’t uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter or granddaughter; they’re blood relatives. It’s sinful. 18Don’t marry a woman and her sister and they become rivals.	 	 Lev 18:6-18 19“Don’t have sexual relations with a woman during her period. 20Don’t have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife and be defiled with her. 21Don’t offer any of your offspring to Molech or profane your God; I’m Yahveh. 22Don’t lie with a male as one lies with a female; it’s detestable. 23Don’t have sexual relations with any animal; you defile yourself. No woman is to stand in front of an animal to mate with it; it’s perverse.    	Lev 18:19-23 24“Don’t defile yourselves with such things. The nations I’m chasing out ahead of you defiled themselves that way. 25They’ve defiled the land; so I’ve brought punishment on it; it has spewed out its people. 26You are to keep my statutes and judgments; don’t any native or foreigner among you do any of those disgusting things. [27] 28That’s so the land won’t spew you out for defiling it. 29Exclude from the community whoever does any of those disgusting things. 30“You’re to keep my charge so you won’t defile yourselves. I’m Yahveh your God.”   	Lev 18:24-30
