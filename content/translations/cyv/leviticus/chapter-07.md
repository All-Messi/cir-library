## Leviticus Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“This</em><em> is the law for </em><em>the </em><em><u>guilt</u></em><em><u> offering</u></em><em>; it’s most holy</em><strong><em>. </em></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> to kill the guilt offering where they kill the burnt offering. </em>The priest <em>will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> he’ll offer its fat: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>the</em><em> two kidneys in the loins with the fat that’s on them, and the lobe on the liver. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Any</em><em> male among the priests can eat it in a holy place. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> same law applies to the guilt offering and sin offering. The priest that makes atonement with it will have it. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest that presents anybody’s burnt offering also gets its skin. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Every</em><em> grain offering that’s baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle is for the priest that presents it. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Every</em><em> grain offering, dry or mixed with olive oil, will be for any of Aaron’s descendants.   </em><em>	</em></span>

### 11“This is the law for a peace offering. 12If you offer it as a thanksgiving, then along with it, offer cakes without yeast mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with olive oil, and cakes of stirred fine flour mixed with olive oil. 13Present your offering with cakes of bread without yeast. 14Present one of each offering as a contribution to Yahveh. It belongs to the priest that sprinkles the blood from the peace offerings.   	Lev 7:11-14 15“Eat the meat from a thanksgiving peace offering the day it’s offered. Don’t leave any of it till morning. 16If it’s an offering for fulfilling a vow or a freewill offering, eat it that day or the next. 17Burn any meat that’s left over till the third day. 18If you eat meat from it on the third day, you will not be accepted. It’s an offense that makes you guilty.	Lev 7:15-18	     19“Don’t eat meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean; burn it. Otherwise, anybody that is clean can eat it. 20But an unclean person that eats the meat from a peace offering will be excluded from the community. 21Anybody that touches something unclean—human, animal, or something detestable—and then eats the meat from a peace offering, will be excluded from the community.”	               	Lev 7:19-21 22-23Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel, “Don’t eat the fat from an ox, sheep, or goat 24or from an animal that dies or wild animals tear apart. Put it to other uses. 25Whoever eats the fat of an animal offered by fire to Yahveh will be excluded from the community. 26Don’t eat the blood of any bird or animal at home. 27Whoever does, will be excluded from the community.”      	Lev 7:22-27 28-29Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel, “When you offer a peace offering, take it to Yahveh 30with the breast and fat of the animal so you can present it with your hands as a wave offering to Yahveh. 31The priest will offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast will be for Aaron and his sons. 32Give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the peace offering. 33That portion is for the one that offers its blood and fat. 34I’ve taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the people’s peace offerings, and given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their permanent due from the people.   	Lev 7:28-34 35“That’s what God has consecrated to Aaron and his sons from the offerings by fire to Yahveh when he presents them to serve as priests. 36Yahveh commanded the Israelites to give them from the day he anointed them. It’s their permanent due.”


<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>That’s the law for the burnt offering, grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering, ordination offering, and peace offering. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>It’s what Yahveh commanded Moses at Mount Sinai when he told the Israelites to present their offerings to Yahveh in the Wilderness of Sinai.</span>
