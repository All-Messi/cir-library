He’ll die because I’ll appear in the cloud above the mercy seat. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> enter the Holy Place with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>After</em><em> he takes a bath, he can put on the linen </em><em>holy </em><em>vestment</em><em>s</em><em>: the</em><em> </em><em>tunic, underclothes, sash, and turban. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> to take from the community 2 male goats for a sin offering and 1 ram for a burnt offering. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> offer the bull for the sin offering to atone for </em><em>himself and his family, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> present the 2 goats at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> cast lots for them, one for Yahveh, the other as a scapegoat. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> he’ll offer the one as a sin offering to Yahveh </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> present the other one alive to Yahveh to make atonement by sending it into the open country.</span>
