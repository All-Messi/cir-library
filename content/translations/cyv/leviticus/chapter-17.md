## Leviticus Chapter **17**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Yahveh told Moses to tell Aaron, his sons, and all Israel, <em>“Yahveh has commanded </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>that</em><em> no one in Israel is to slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat inside or outside the camp </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>instead</em><em> of taking it to the Tent of Meeting to present it to Yahveh. </em>God <em>will hold him guilty of shedding blood. Exclude him from the community. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Instead, people<em> need to take their animals to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as peace offerings. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and offer up the fat in smoke as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> no longer sacrifice to the goat-idols they commit prostitution with. That’s a permanent statute. </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 17:1-7</p>

### 8“Anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice 9without taking it to Yahveh, will be excluded from the community. 10“I’ll oppose and exclude from the community anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who eats blood. 11The life is in the blood, and I’ve given it to you on the altar to atone for you. It’s the lifeblood that atones.” 12I told Israel, “Nobody among you or foreigner among you can eat blood. 13When you hunt an animal or bird that can be eaten, drain out its blood and cover it with dirt.	       	 	Lev 17:8-13	 14“In all kinds of flesh, blood is identified with its life; so I told the Israelites not to eat blood. If any of you eat it, you’ll be excluded from the community. 15Whether native or foreign, if you eat an animal that has died or wild animals have torn to pieces, wash your clothes, take a bath, and remain ceremonially unclean till evening. 16If you don’t do that, you’re considered guilty.”    	Lev 17:14-16
