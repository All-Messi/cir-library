## Leviticus Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 2"If you act unfaithfully against Yahveh and deceive your companion—about a deposit, a security entrusted to you, something you stole or extorted from someone, 3have found that was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, or sin in any way like that—4then you need to return what you stole, what you got by extortion, what was entrusted to you, what lost thing you found, 5or anything you swore about falsely. Add a fifth and give it to the one it belongs to when you present your guilt offering. 6Then take to the priest your offering to Yahveh, a ram without defect, as you evaluate for a guilt offering. 7The priest will atone for you to Yahveh, and you'll be forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh told Moses to tell Aaron and his sons, 9"This is the law for the burnt offering. The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night till morning. The altar fire will always be burning. 10The priest will put on his linen robe and underclothes, take up the ashes of the burnt offering, and place them beside the altar. 11Then he'll change clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place. 12He'll burn wood on the altar every morning, lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings. [13] 14"This is the law for the grain offering. The descendants of Aaron will present it at the altar. 15One of them will take a handful of the fine flour from the grain offering with its olive oil and incense, and offer it up in smoke on the altar, a pleasing aroma, as God's portion. 16Aaron and his sons will eat the rest. They'll eat it as cakes without yeast in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 17It will not be baked with yeast. I've given it as their share of my offerings by fire. It's most holy—like the sin offering and guilt offering. 18Any male descendant of Aaron can eat it. It's a permanent ordinance among the offerings by fire to Yahveh. Whoever touches them will become holy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 20"This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to Yahveh the day he's anointed: .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. 21Prepare it with olive oil on a griddle. Take it when it's well stirred, 22and the anointed priest will offer it. By permanent ordinance it will all be offered up in smoke to Yahveh. 23Likewise, completely burn every grain offering. Don't eat any of it." 24-25Yahveh told Moses to say to Aaron and his sons, 25"This is the law for the sin offering. Where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will be slaughtered in front of Yahveh. 26The priest that offers it will eat it in a holy place in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 27Anybody that touches it will become consecrated. If any of the blood splashes on a vestment, wash it off in a holy place 28and smash the clay pot it was boiled in. If it was boiled in a bronze container, scour it and rinse it in water. 29Any male priest can eat it; it's most holy. 30Do nor eat a sin offering that has any blood brought to the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; burn it.</span>
