## Leviticus Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s sons, put fire in their firepans. They put incense on it and offered before Yahveh fire different from what he’d commanded them. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Fire came out from Yahveh and consumed them, and they died. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Moses told Aaron, <em>“</em><em>That</em><em>’</em><em>s what Yahveh meant when he said</em><em>, </em> <em>‘Those who come near me will treat me as holy</em> <em>in front of the people.’”</em> So Aaron kept quiet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, <em>“</em><em>Carry</em><em> your relatives </em><em>outside</em><em> the camp from </em><em>in</em><em> front of the sanctuary</em>.” <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They carried them outside the camp still in their tunics. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, <em>“Don’t uncover your heads or tear your clothes so you won’t die and make him angry with the whole community. But your kin, the whole House of Israel, will wail over the burning Yahveh brought about. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> even go out of the Tent of Meeting; you’ll die because Yahveh’s anointing oil is on you.”  </em> They did what Moses said.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 10:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Then Yahveh told Aaron, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“D</em><em>on’t</em><em> drink wine or </em><em>alcohol </em><em>when you </em><em>or your sons </em><em>come into the </em><em>Tent of </em><em>Meeting</em><em> so you won’t die—an ongoing </em><em>permanent statute</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> to distinguish the holy from the prof</em><em>ane, the ceremonially clean from unclean.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>It’s</em><em> to teach the Israel</em><em>ites</em><em> the statutes </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has </em><em>given</em><em> them through Moses.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then Moses told Aaron and his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, <em>“Take the grain offering that’s left over from </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>’s</em><em> offerings by fire and eat it without yeast</em><em> beside the altar</em><em>; </em><em>it’s most holy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Eat</em><em> it in a holy place; it’s for you and your sons from Yahveh’s offerings by fire. That’s what God commanded me. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> breast and thigh of the wave offering, however, you and your sons and daughters can eat in a clean place; </em>those parts<em> are for you and your offspring. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> thigh offered by </em><em>lifting up</em><em> and the breast offered by waving, they’ll take with the burnt offerings of the fat portions to present in a wave offering before Yahveh. It’s for you and your sons permanently.” </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 10:8-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Moses looked all over for the goat from the sin offering, but it had been burned up. He was mad at Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“Why</em><em> didn’t you eat the sin offering at the holy place? It’s most holy, and Yahveh gave it to you to carry away the guilt of the community, to atone for them. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Since</em><em> its blood hadn’t been brought into the </em><em>sanctuary,</em><em> you should have eaten it in the sanctuary like I commanded.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But Aaron told Moses, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>“This very day they presented their sin offering and burnt offering </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>.</em><em> But this tragedy</em><em> </em><em>has happened to me. I</em><em>f I’d eate</em><em>n a sin offering today, would Yahveh</em><em> have </em><em>considered it</em><em> good?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>That made sense to Moses.</span>
