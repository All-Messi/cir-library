## Leviticus Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh said to Moses, 2"Tell the people to bring you clear oil from pressed olives that can keep a lamp burning continually. 3-4Outside the curtain of Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron will keep the lamps on the lampstand in order from evening to morning continually. It's an ongoing permanent statute. 5"Take fine flour and bake 12 cakes. Put .22 bushels .2 ephah in each one. 6Set them in two stacks, six to a stack on the pure gold table. 7Put pure frankincense beside each stack for the bread as God's portion, an offering by fire to Yahveh. 8Every Sabbath Aaron will set this bread in order in front of Yahveh, a permanent covenant for Israel. 9It'll be for Aaron and his sons to eat in a sacred place. It's the most sacred to them from Yahveh's offerings by fire, their permanent portion."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The son of an Israelite woman and Egyptian father went out among the people and got into a fight with an Israelite man in the camp. 11The woman's son blasphemed the Name and cursed; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother was Shelomith, Bat-Dibri, tribe of Dan.) 12They put him in custody till Yahveh made his commandment clear to Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 14"Take him outside the camp. The ones who heard him will put their hands on his head and the community will stone him. 15Tell the people, 'If anybody curses God, he's considered guilty. 16The community is to stone anybody that blasphemes Yahveh. 17"Execute a murderer, 18but anybody that kills an animal will make it good, life for life. 19If one person injures another, do the same thing to that person: 20fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.  [21] 22There'll be one standard for you and a foreigner. I'm Yahveh your God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Moses told the people, and they took outside the camp the one that had cursed, and stoned him.</span>
