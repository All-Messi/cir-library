## Leviticus Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses to tell Israel, "When a woman has a boy, she's ceremonially unclean for a week like during her menstruation. 3On the eighth day, circumcise his foreskin. 4For 33 more days, she'll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. She's not to touch anything consecrated or enter the sanctuary until after her purification time. 5If she has a girl, she's ceremonially unclean for two weeks like during menstruation. For 66 more days, she'll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. 6"When her purification days are over for a son or daughter, she'll take to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. 7He'll offer it to Yahveh for her purification, and she'll be ceremonially cleansed from her bleeding at childbirth. That's the law for a woman that has a male or female child. 8If she can't afford a lamb, she can take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a burnt offering, the other for a sin offering. The priest will offer them for her, and she'll be ceremonially clean." The Tests for Leprosy</span>
