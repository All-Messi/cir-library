She’s not to touch </em><em>anything consecrated or enter the sanctuary until after her purification time. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she has a girl, she’s ceremonially unclean for two weeks like during menstruation.</span>

### more days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. 	Lev 12:1-5 6“When her purification days are over for a son or daughter, she’ll take to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. 7He’ll offer it to Yahveh for her purification, and she’ll be ceremonially cleansed from her bleeding at childbirth. That’s the law for a woman that has a male or female child. 8If she can’t afford a lamb, she can take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a burnt offering, the other for a sin offering. The priest will offer them for her, and she’ll be ceremonially clean.”  	Lev 12:6-8          The Tests for Leprosy
