## Leviticus Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A grain offering to Yahveh will consist of fine flour with olive oil and frankincense added. 2Take it to the sons of Aaron the priests. The priest will take a handful of the mix and offer it up in smoke on the altar as God's portion, an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 3The rest is for Aaron and his sons, something most holy of the offerings to Yahveh by fire. 4"When you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it'll be flat cakes of fine flour mixed with olive oil or wafers with no yeast in them, basted with olive oil. 5If you make it on a griddle, make it out of fine flour without yeast and mixed with olive oil. 6Break it up into pieces and pour the oil on it. 7If you make your grain offering in a pan, make it out of fine flour mixed with olive oil. 8When you bring a grain offering like that, present it to the priest at the altar. 9He'll take out God's portion and offer it up in smoke by fire, an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 10The rest is for Aaron and his sons, something most holy from the offerings to Yahveh by fire. 11"Don't put yeast or honey in grain offerings. 12For an offering of the first part of the harvest, bring it to Yahveh, but it's not to rise up as a pleasing aroma on the altar. 13Season grain offerings with salt to put the salt of your God's covenant in them. 14"If you bring a grain offering of the first part of the harvest, bring heads of crushed new growth roasted in fire, 15and put olive oil and incense on them. 16The priest will offer them up in smoke as God's portion.
