## Leviticus Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“T</em><em>his</em><em> is the law ab</em><em>o</em><em>ut leper</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>that are</em><em> </em><em>ceremonially </em><em>cleansed.</em><em> Take</em><em> </em><em>them</em><em> to the priest </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>outside</em><em> the camp to see if the leprosy has healed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> give orders to take two live clean birds, cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> have one bird killed in a clay basin over running water. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> take the live bird, the cedar wood, scarlet string, and hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird killed over running water. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> he’ll sprinkle seven times the one to be cleansed, pronounce the person ceremonially clean, and let the live bird go free in an open field. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> ones cleansed will wash their clothes, shave off their hair, take a bath, and be clean. Afterwards they can go into the camp, but they’ll stay outside the tent for a week. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>On</em><em> the seventh day, they’ll shave off their hair, beard, and eyebrows; wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean.</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 14:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“On</em><em> the eighth day, the one cleansed will take 2 male lambs without defect, a yearling ewe without defect, .33 bushel </em><em><sup>.3</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, and 1 pint </em><em><sup>1 log </sup></em><em>of oil. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will present them and the person to Yahveh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will bring 1 male lamb for a guilt offering with the pint </em><em><sup>1 log</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>of olive oil and present them as a wave offering. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> slaughter the male lamb where they slaughter the sin offering and burnt offering, because the guilt offering (like the sin </em><em>offering) is for the priest; it’s most holy. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> to take some blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> pour some of the pint </em><em><sup>log</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>of olive oil into his left palm, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>dip</em><em> his right-hand finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of Yahveh. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Some</em><em> of the oil still in his palm</em><em> </em><em>he’ll put on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed—on top of the blood from the guilt offering. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> rest of the oil in his palm goes on the head of the one to be cleansed. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Next</em><em>, he’ll offer the sin offering to atone for the person. Last, he’ll slaughter the burnt offering </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> offer it up with the grain offering on the altar. Then the person will be ceremonially clean.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 14:10-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> <em>“But</em><em> someone that’s poor can take 1 male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering for atonement, .11 bushel </em><em><sup>.1</sup></em><em><sup> ephah</sup></em><em> of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a pint </em><em><sup>log </sup></em><em>of oil, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> two turtledoves or young pigeons.

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Yahveh said further to Moses and Aaron,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> <em>“When</em><em> you go to Canaan and I put mildew on a house, </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>the</em><em> owner will tell the priest, ‘Something like mildew has become visible in my house.’ </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> priest will have them empty the house before he goes in to look at the spot so everything in the house won’t become unclean. </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> go in and look at it. If the mark on the walls has greenish or reddish depressions, and appears deeper than the surface, </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>he’ll</em><em> come to the door and quarantine the house for a week. </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>On</em><em> the seventh day, he’ll inspect the house again. If the spot has spread on the walls, </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>he’ll</em><em> have them tear out the stones with the spot on them and dump them at an unclean place outside the city. </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> have them scrape off all the plaster in the house and dump it at an unclean place outside the city. </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> they’ll replace the first stones and re-plaster the house.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 14:33-42</p>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> <em>“If</em><em> the spot shows up again </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> the priest sees it has spread, it’s toxic and unclean. </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> have them tear the house down—its stones, timbers, and plaster—and dump them outside the city in an unclean place. </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> goes into the house during the quarantine, becomes unclean till evening. </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>Likewise</em><em>, whoever eats or lies down in the house will wash their clothes.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lev 14:43-47</p>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> <em>“But</em><em>, if the priest inspects the house and the spot hasn’t reappeared after being re-plastered, he’ll pronounce it ceremonially clean. </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>To</em><em> cleanse the house, he’ll take two birds, </em>some<em> cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop, </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> kill one bird in a clay basin over running water. </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> take the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet string, and live bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water and sprinkle the house seven times. </em><strong><sup>52</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and running water, along with the live bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet string. </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>However</em><em>, he’ll let the live bird loose outside the city in an open field.
