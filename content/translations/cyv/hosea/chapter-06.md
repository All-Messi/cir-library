## Hosea Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They'll say, 'Let's return to Yahveh. He has torn us, but he'll heal us; he has wounded us, but he'll bandage us up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He'll revive us in two days, and raise us up the third, so we can live in his presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So let's press on to know Yahveh. He'll respond to us as sure as dawn comes; he'll come to us like rain, like the spring rain that waters the ground.' 4"What am I going to do with you, Ephraim, or with you, Judah? Your loyalty is like a morning cloud, like dew that evaporates early.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I've cut both of you up in pieces by the prophets; I've slain you with my words; the condemnations on you are as inescapable as light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I delight in loyalty more than sacrifice, in knowing me more than in burnt offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Like Adam you've broken covenant and dealt deceitfully with me. 8"Gilead is a city of sinners, tracked with bloody footprints.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Like raiders waiting for victims, a band of priests commits murder on the way to Shechem; and every shameful crime imaginable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I've seen a horrible thing in Israel: Ephraim's prostitution, Israel's self-defilement.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Judah, I've appointed a harvest time for you when I restore my people's fortunes.</span>
