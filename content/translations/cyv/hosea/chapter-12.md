## Hosea Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh has a dispute with Judah too; he'll punish Jacob in proportion to his "deceit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In the womb he grabbed his brother's heel; when he grew up, he even wrestled with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But he's become a shrewd businessman with false balances who loves to oppress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I've spoken to the prophets and given them lots of visions; I've delivered parables through them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But there's sinfulness in Gilead, worthless people. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal too; their altars are like rock piles along a plowed field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jacob fled to the land of Aram and kept sheep to get a wife.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Yahveh brought his descendants out of Egypt by a prophet and protected them by him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But they've made Yahveh bitterly angry; so he's sentenced them to death in payment for their disgrace. Yahveh's Anger at Israel</span>
