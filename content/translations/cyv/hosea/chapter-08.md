## Hosea Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Put the bugle to your lips! A vulture is swooping down on Yahveh's Temple because my people have broken my covenant and disobeyed my Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Israel pleads with me, 'We know you; you're our God!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel has rejected what's good; so his enemies will chase him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He's set up kings, but not by me; he's appointed officials, but I didn't know it. By making idols out of his silver and gold, he's gotten himself destroyed. 5"I've rejected your calf, Samaria, and said, 'My anger burns against you! How long will you not be capable of innocence?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Even that calf originated from Israel! A workman made it, so it's not God; Samaria's calf will certainly be smashed. 7"You've sown the wind; you'll reap the whirlwind. Your standing grain has no heads; it won't yield any grain. If it did, foreigners would eat it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Israel has been swallowed up; among the nations he's like a pot nobody cares about.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He's gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Even though he's hired other nations as allies, I'll gather him up for judgment. He won't be appointing his own kings and officials for a while. 11"Ephraim has multiplied altars to remove sin, but they're altars for him to sin with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Though I wrote 10,000 laws for him, he considers them something foreign.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The people offer the meat of my sacrifices and eat it, but Yahveh doesn't delight in them. He'll remember their iniquity and punish them for their sins. They'll go back to Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has multiplied fortified towns. But I'll set their towns afire and burn their fortresses." Hosea Announces Israel's Punishment</span>
