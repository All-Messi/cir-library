## Hosea Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Israel was young, I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The more I called him, the more he withdrew from me. He kept sacrificing to images of Baal and burning incense to idols.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But I was the One that taught Ephraim to walk, leading him by the hand; but he didn't know I was the One that healed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I led him with the leashes of mercy and bonds of love; I became like One that eased the bridle from his jaws and bent over to feed him. 5"My people won't go back to Egypt; Assyria will be their king because they refused to come back to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The sword will rage against their towns; their enemies will break through their gate bars and destroy them for their evil intentions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So my people are intent on turning away from me; though the prophets call them to me, none of them honors me. 8"How can I give up on you, Ephraim? How can I let you go, Israel? How can I make you like Admah or treat you like Zeboiim? My heart shrinks back within me; my compassion wells up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I won't act on my fierce anger or destroy Ephraim again, because I'm divine, not mortal, the Holy One among you; I won't come in anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They'll follow me; I'll roar like a lion, and my people will come cringing from the west.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They'll come fluttering like birds from Egypt, like pigeons from Assyria; I'll settle them in their houses," Yahveh declares. 12"Ephraim surrounds me with lies, and the House of Israel with deceit. Judah also rebels against me, against the Holy One that's faithful."</span>
