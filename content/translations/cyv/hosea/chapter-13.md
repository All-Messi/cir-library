## Hosea Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Ephraim spoke, people cringed; he made himself important in Israel, but because of Baal he became guilty and died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Now his people sin more and more and make molten images, idols skillfully formed from silver, all made by craftsmen. They say, "Sacrifice to them, kiss the calf idols!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So they'll be like morning mist, like dew that dries off soon, like chaff blown from a threshing floor, like smoke from a chimney. 4"Yet I've been Yahveh your God since Egypt; you weren't to know any God but me because there is no savior but me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I took care of you in the desert, in a land of drought.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But when you got to pasture, fed to the full and satisfied, you got independent and forgot about me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So I'll be like a lion to you and lie in wait by the road like a leopard.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll attack you like a bear robbed of her cubs and tear your chests open. I'll devour you like a lioness and maul you like a wild animal. 9"It's to your destruction, Israel, that you're against me, your help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Where's your king that's going to save you in all your towns? Where are the officials you requested, 'Give me a king and officials'?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I gave you a king in my anger and took him away in my wrath. 12"The iniquity of Ephraim has been collected and stored up for retribution.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The pains of childbirth have come on him; he's not a very smart son; it's too late to keep from being born. 14"Should I ransom him from Sheol? Should I redeem him from death? No, I won't show him mercy; so Death, where are your thorns? Death, where is your sting? Bring it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Though he's flourishing like a reed, an east wind will come— Yahveh's wind from the desert— and dry up his fountain; his spring will go dry. It will 'blow away' every precious article in his treasury.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Samaria will bear the consequences of his guilt because he rebelled against his God: his residents will fall by the sword; his little ones will be dashed to pieces; his pregnant women will be ripped open." Healing for the Repentant</span>
