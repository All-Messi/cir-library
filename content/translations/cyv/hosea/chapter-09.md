## Hosea Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Israel, don’t celebrate like other nations; you’ve carried on prostitution by leaving your God. You’ve loved prostitutes’ earnings on every threshing floor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Threshing floor and winepress won’t feed you; you won’t have any new wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>You won’t remain in Yahveh’s land; you’ll return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>You won’t be pouring out liquid offerings of wine to Yahveh there; your sacrifices won’t please him. Your bread will be <em>unclean</em> like mourners’ bread; everybody that eats it will be defiled because it will only be for your hunger; you can’t bring it to Yahveh’s Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>What will you do on stated festival days, Yahveh’s festival days?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Even if you escape being destroyed <em>by Assyria</em>, Egypt will round you up, and Memphis will bury you. Weeds will take over your silver troves; thorns will invade your tents.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Hos 9:1-</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The time for punishment has come; the time for retribution is here. Let Israel know that! Because of how gross your sin is, how great your hostility is, <em>you say,</em> <em>“</em><em>P</em><em>rophets a</em><em>re</em><em> </em><em>foo</em><em>ls</em><em>;</em> <em>	inspired m</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em> are</em><em> </em><em>crazy</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Prophets are watchmen for my God over Ephraim; but bird catchers’ snares lie on all their paths; there’s hatred for them in the temple of their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The people have made themselves as depraved as they were at Gibeah long ago. He’ll remember their iniquity and punish their sins.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Hos 9:</p>

### 7-9


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Yahveh says, <em>“At first, finding Israel was like finding grapes in the </em><em>desert;</em> <em>	I saw their ancestors like the first fruit on a fig tree’s first season.</em> <em>But they came to Baal-peor </em> <em>	and devoted themselves to their shameful </em><em>idol;</em> <em>	they became as detestable as the idol they loved.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup><em>Ephraim’s</em><em> glory will soon fly off like a bird</em> <em>	because there’ll be no conception, no pregnancy, no birth!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>Even</em><em> if they do raise children,</em> <em>	I’ll take them away till there aren’t any left.</em> <em>	Misfortune awaits them when I leave them!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>Ephraim</em><em> is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre,</em> <em>	but he’ll bring out his children for </em><em>slaughter.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Give them, Yahveh—what will I say to give them? Give them miscarrying wombs and dry breasts.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Hos 9:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Yahveh says, <em>“Their sins began in </em><em>Gilgal;</em> <em>	I started to</em><em> despise</em><em> them there!</em> <em>Because of their </em><em>sinful</em><em> deeds,</em> <em>	I’ll drive them out of my house!</em> <em>	I won’t love them </em><em>anymore;</em> <em>	their officials are rebels.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>The</em><em> people of Ephraim are stricken, </em> <em>	their root has dried up,</em> <em>	they won’t bear any more children.</em> <em>If they do,</em> <em>	I’ll kill their precious ones at birth.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>My God will expel them because they’ve ignored him. So they’ll wander <em>without progeny</em> among the nations.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
