## Hosea Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel, don't celebrate like other nations; you've carried on prostitution by leaving your God. You've loved prostitutes' earnings on every threshing floor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Threshing floor and winepress won't feed you; you won't have any new wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You won't remain in Yahveh's land; you'll return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You won't be pouring out liquid offerings of wine to Yahveh there; your sacrifices won't please him. Your bread will be unclean like mourners' bread; everybody that eats it will be defiled because it will only be for your hunger; you can't bring it to Yahveh's Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> What will you do on stated festival days, Yahveh's festival days?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Even if you escape being destroyed by Assyria, Egypt will round you up, and Memphis will bury you. Weeds will take over your silver troves; thorns will invade your tents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The time for punishment has come; the time for retribution is here. Let Israel know that! Because of how gross your sin is, how great your hostility is, you say, "Prophets are fools; inspired men are crazy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Prophets are watchmen for my God over Ephraim; but bird catchers' snares lie on all their paths; there's hatred for them in the temple of their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The people have made themselves as depraved as they were at Gibeah long ago. He'll remember their iniquity and punish their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yahveh says, "At first, finding Israel was like finding grapes in the desert; I saw their ancestors like the first fruit on a fig tree's first season. But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to their shameful idol; they became as detestable as the idol they loved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Ephraim's glory will soon fly off like a bird because there'll be no conception, no pregnancy, no birth!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Even if they do raise children, I'll take them away till there aren't any left. Misfortune awaits them when I leave them!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Ephraim is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre, but he'll bring out his children for slaughter."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Give them, Yahveh—what will I say to give them? Give them miscarrying wombs and dry breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh says, "Their sins began in Gilgal; I started to despise them there! Because of their sinful deeds, I'll drive them out of my house! I won't love them anymore; their officials are rebels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The people of Ephraim are stricken, their root has dried up, they won't bear any more children. If they do, I'll kill their precious ones at birth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> My God will expel them because they've ignored him. So they'll wander without progeny among the nations.</span>
