## Hosea Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel is a luxurious vine that grows his own fruit. The more his fruit, the more altars he makes; the better his land, the better the sacred pillars he sets up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He's been unfaithful; now he must pay for his guilt. Yahveh is going to tear down his altars and pull over his sacred pillars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then they'll say, "We don't have a king because we didn't respect Yahveh; even if we had one, what could he do for us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They just talk; they make treaties they don't intend to keep, so condemnations sprout up like noxious weeds in the ditches in their fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The residents in Samaria will fear for the calf idol at Beth-aven [Bethel]. Its people will mourn for it; its idolatrous priests will cry over its departed beauty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The idol itself they will carry off to Assyria as tribute to their great king; Ephraim will be disgraced for depending on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Samaria and its king will float away like driftwood on the ocean tide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The high places of Beth-aven, the place of Israel's sin, will fall into ruin; thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars. Then they'll call to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh says, "Ever since Gibeah, they've just kept on sinning! Wasn't it right for war to break out against them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When I so desire, I'll attack those sinners; I'll gather the nations' armies against them to punish them for their extreme guilt. 11"Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to tread out grain, and I used to spare her fair neck. But I'll put a yoke on Ephraim; I'll make Judah plow and Jacob harrow by himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Sow seeds of goodness; harvest a crop of lasting love. Break up your heart's hardened, fallow ground; it's time to look to Yahveh so he'll come to shower goodness on you. 13"You've cultivated sinfulness and harvested injustice; you've eaten the produce of lies because you've trusted in going it on your own with your big army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So the loud noise of war will arise among your people and destroy your fortresses the way Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in battle, and mothers were dashed to pieces with their children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> That's what's going to happen to you, too, Bethel, because of your extreme sinfulness. Israel's king will be killed at dawn. Yahveh's Love for Israel</span>
