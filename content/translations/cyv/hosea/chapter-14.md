## Hosea Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel, come back to Yahveh your God; you've stumbled because you sinned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Come back to Yahveh and bring your confession with you. Say, "Take away our sin; receive us graciously so we can offer our praises to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Assyria can't save us; neither can our warhorses. We won't say 'our god' anymore to something we've made; only from you can we orphans receive mercy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh says, "I'll heal your apostasy and love you freely because my anger will be gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll be like dew to you; you'll blossom like a lily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your roots will spread out like the cedars in Lebanon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your people that live in your shade, will raise grain again, and blossom like grapevines. You'll be as fragrant as Lebanon's wine. 8"Ephraim, I don't have any connection with idols. I directly am the One that answers your prayers and takes care of you. I'm like a green cypress; your fruit all comes from me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Whoever is wise, understand— whoever perceives, be aware: the Lord's way is the right way; good people follow it, but sinners trip over it.</span>
