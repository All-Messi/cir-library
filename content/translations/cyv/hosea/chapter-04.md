## Hosea Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel, listen to Yahveh's message; he's filing charges against you: "There's no faithfulness, kindness, or awareness of God there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> There's swearing, deception, murder, stealing, and adultery; they use violence, so there's murder after murder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So the land is in mourning. Everybody that lives in it is wasting away, along with the animals in the field and the birds in the sky; even the fish are disappearing." 4"But don't anybody point a finger at somebody else; I'm suing you priests.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You'll stumble in the daytime; prophets will stumble with you at night; I'll destroy your mother Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> My people are getting destroyed because they don't know me. Since you priests have refused to know me, I'll refuse to acknowledge you as my priests. Since you've forgotten about my Law, I'll forget about your children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The more priests there are, the more they sin against me; I'll turn their honor into shame. 8"They feed on my people's sin because their sacrifices for it mean more food for the priests!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> It will be, like people like priest; I'll punish them for their ways, repay them for their deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They'll eat, but not have enough; they'll carry on prostitution, but won't gain anything by it, because they've stopped listening to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Prostitution, wine, and new wine have robbed my people of understanding. 12"My people consult their wooden idols; their fortunetellers toss sticks to give them oracles. A spirit of prostitution has led them astray; they've carried on prostitution by leaving their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They offer sacrifices to idols on mountaintops and burn incense on hills under oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees, because they make pleasant shade. That's why your daughters become prostitutes and your brides commit adultery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I won't punish their daughters when they carry on prostitution or their brides when they commit adultery, because you men visit prostitutes and offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes; so you foolish people will be ruined. 15"Though you carry on prostitution, Israel, don't draw Judah into your guilt. Don't go to Gilgal or up to Beth-aven [Bethel]; don't swear, 'As sure as Yahveh lives!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Israel is like a stubborn heifer; so how can Yahveh feed it like a lamb in the pasture?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Leave Ephraim alone because she carries on idolatry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When their rulers are done drinking, they go visit prostitutes; they have no shame whatsoever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The wind will carry them off; their altars will bring them disgrace. Judgment Against Israel's Leaders</span>
