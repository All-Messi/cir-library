## Hosea Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hear this, priests! Pay attention, Israel! Listen, family of the king! Your idolatry at Mizpah has set a trap and cast a net on Tabor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You rebels have gone deep in slaughter, but I'll punish you all for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I know what you're doing, Ephraim; you can't hide from me, Israel. Ephraim, you've left me like a prostitute; Israel, you've defiled yourself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your deeds keep you from coming back to me. You're totally a prostitute; you don't know Yahveh. 5"Israel's arrogance testifies against him; Israel and Ephraim stumble under the weight of their guilt; Judah stumbles with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They'll go with their flocks and herds to seek Yahveh, but they won't find him; he's withdrawn from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They've dealt deviously with Yahveh because they've borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them along with their fields. 8"Blow the ram's horn in Gibeah; blow the bugle in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: cringe, Benjamin!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Ephraim will become a pile of rubble when he's rebuked; that's for certain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Judah's officials are like people that remove landmarks; I'll pour out my anger on them like a waterfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed in condemnation, because he was determined to follow vanity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I'll be like a moth in Ephraim, like rot in Judah. 13"When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria; he sent for King Jareb. But he can't heal you or cure you from your wound.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll be like a lion to Ephraim, like a young lion to Judah. I'll tear them to pieces and take them away; nobody will rescue them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll go back to my place till they admit their guilt and turn to me; when trouble comes, they'll earnestly rely on me." Israel and Judah Unrepentant</span>
