## Hosea Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In that day, you will call your brothers 'Ammi' [my people] and your sisters 'Ruhamah' [the ones loved].'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But for now, bring charges against your mother Israel because she's not my wife and I'm not her husband. Let her put away her prostitution, the adultery from between her breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Otherwise, I'll strip her naked and expose her like the day she was born. I'll make her like a wilderness, like a desert; she'll die of thirst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I won't have mercy on her children; they're children from prostitution.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Their mother was a prostitute; it was a shame the way she acted. She said, 'I'll go after my lovers that gave me bread and water, wool and linen, olive oil and drink.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So I'll plant thornbushes along the sides of her road and build a wall across her path so she can't get to where she wants to go.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> She'll chase after her lovers, but not catch them; she'll look for them, but not find them. So she'll say, 'I'll go back to my first husband, because it was better for me then than now!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> She doesn't know I was the one that gave her grain, new wine, and olive oil; and lavished on her silver and gold— which she used for Baal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So I'll take back my grain at harvest time and my new wine when it's due. I'll take away the wool and linen I gave her to cover her nakedness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'll uncover her lewdness in front of her lovers, and nobody will rescue her from me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll put an end to her gaiety, her festivals, new moons, Sabbaths, and festive assemblies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll destroy her grapevines and fig trees that she claimed were the pay her lovers gave her. I'll make them a thicket where only wild animals can eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll punish her for the times when she was offering sacrifices to the images of Baal, adorning herself with earrings and jewelry, following her lovers, and forgetting about me," 	Yahveh says. Yahveh's Mercy on Israel 14"So I'll win her back, bring her into the desert, and speak graciously to her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll give her vineyards there and the Valley of Achor as a gateway to hope. She'll sing there like she did when she was young, when she first came up from Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She'll call me 'Ishi' [my husband], not 'Baali' [my lord].'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll take the many names of Baal out of her mouth; she won't mention them anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll make a treaty for her with the animals in the field, the birds in the sky, and what crawls on the ground. I'll banish bow, sword, and war from the land so she can lie down in safety.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I'll engage her to me permanently in goodness, justice, and 20faithfulness. Then she'll know Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, I'll answer the sky that pleads for rain, that will answer the earth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> that will answer the grain, new wine, and olive oil that will answer, 'God has sown' [Jezreel].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I'll sow her for myself in the land and have mercy on her that hadn't received mercy. I'll say to those who weren't my people, 'You're my people [Ammi]!' and they'll say, 'You're my God [Elohai]!'" Hosea's Wife Redeemed</span>
