## Hosea Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When I would heal Israel, Ephraim's sin gets uncovered, Samaria's evil deeds as well, because they're devious. Thieves go inside; bandits raid outside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They don't realize that I remember their sinfulness. Their deeds are all around them; they're right in front of me. 3"They entertain the king with their sinfulness, and the officials laugh at their lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They're adulterers, like an oven heated by bakers that keep the fire going from the kneading of the dough till it's risen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> On our king's holidays, the officials get sick with the heat of wine, he joins in with the ones who mock him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Their hearts are like an oven that burns with intrigue. Their anger smolders all night and breaks out in the morning like a blazing fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They're all hot like an oven and consume their leaders. They kill their kings; yet none of them cries out to me for help. 8"Ephraim mixes in with foreigners; he's like a half-baked cake that doesn't get turned over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Worshipping foreign gods is sapping his strength, but he doesn't even realize it. Gray hairs are peppering his head, but he doesn't notice it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Though Israel's pride testifies against him, he doesn't come back to Yahveh his God or rely on him. 11"So Ephraim has become a silly pigeon that coos to Egypt and flies to Assyria.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As he goes, I'll cast my net over him, bring him down like a bird from the sky, and punish him in proportion to his sinfulness. 13"Misfortune awaits him for straying from me! Destruction is in store for him for rebelling against me! I would have redeemed him, but he slandered me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He doesn't call out to me sincerely, but wails on his bed. He gashes himself for grain and new wine, turning away from me to foreign gods. Although I trained him and made him strong, he still plots against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He turns, but not upward; he's like a crooked bow; his officers will die by the sword because of their insolence toward me. Egypt will laugh at them. Israel Will Reap the Whirlwind</span>
