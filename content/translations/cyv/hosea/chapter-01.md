## Hosea Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Messages from Yahveh to Hosea Ben-Beeri at the Time of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah, and Jeroboam Ben-Joash/Jehoash, King of Israel Hosea's Wife and Children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When Yahveh spoke the first time through Hosea, he said, "Marry a prostitute and have children, because the land is committing flagrant prostitution by abandoning me." 3So he married Gomer Bat Diblaim, and she had a son. 4Yahveh said, "Name him Jezreel. Soon I'll punish Jehu's dynasty for the bloodshed in Jezreel, and put an end to Israel. 5At that time, I'll break Israel's military strength in the Valley of 'Jezreel.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then she had a daughter. Yahveh told him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah. I 'won't have mercy' any more on Israel by forgiving them. 7But I will have mercy on Judah and deliver them, but not by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When she'd weaned Lo-ruhamah, she had another son. 9Yahveh said, "Name him Lo-ammi. You're 'not my people' and I'm not your God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yet the number of Israelites will be like sand by the sea, that you can't measure or count. Where I said, 'You're not my people,' I'll say, 'You're children of the living God.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then Judah and Israel will unite and appoint one leader. They'll return from the exile together because the day of Jezreel [sowing] will be great." Israel's Unfaithfulness Punished</span>
