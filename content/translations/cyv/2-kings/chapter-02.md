## 2 Kings Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Yahveh was getting ready to take Elijah up in a tornado. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and told him, <em>“Stay here. Yahveh has sent me to Bethel.” </em> <em>“As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, I won’t leave you.”</em> They went down to Bethel. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The company of prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha, <em>“Do you know Yahveh’s going to take your master away today?”</em> <em>“Yes, I know. Keep it to yourselves.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Elijah told him, <em>“Stay here. Yahveh has sent me to Jericho.” </em> <em>“As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, I won’t leave you.”</em> They went on to Jericho. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The company of prophets in Jericho came to Elisha, <em>“Do you know Yahveh’s going to take your master away today?”</em> <em>“Yes, I know. Keep it to yourselves.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Elijah told him. <em>“Stay here. Yahveh has sent me to the Jordan.” </em> He said, <em>“As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, I won’t leave you.”</em> They continued on.<strong>  </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Fifty men from the company of prophets came and stood at a distance on the other side <em>of the Jordan</em> while the two of them stood on this side. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water. It separated from one side to the other, so the two of them crossed on dry riverbed. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then Elijah asked Elisha, <em>“What should I do for you before I leave?”</em> <em>“Put a double portion of your spirit on me.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“You’re</em><em> asking for a lot</em><em>.</em><em> But if you see me when </em>Yahveh’s<em> taking me away, your request will happen. If you don’t, it won’t.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>As they went along talking, a flaming chariot with flaming horses appeared and separated them. Elijah ascended to the sky in a tornado. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Elisha saw it and cried out, <em>“Father! Father! The chariotry of Israel and its drivers!” </em>He never saw him again. He tore his clothes, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>picked up the mantle that Elijah had dropped, and went back to the Jordan. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He struck the water with it and said, <em>“Where’s Yahveh, Elijah’s God?”</em> The water separated from one side to the other, and he went <em>back </em>across.<strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The school of the prophets in Jericho saw what happened, <em>“Elijah’s spirit is resting on Elisha.” </em>They came to meet him and bowed to the ground, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“Please</em><em> let these fifty strong men go look for your master. Maybe the wind from Yahveh has taken him up and dropped him on some mountain or in some valley.”</em> He said, <em>“Don’t do that.” </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They urged him till he felt embarrassed, <em>“Go ahead, then.”</em> They sent</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Then the men in the city told Elisha, <em>“This city is a nice place to live in, as you can see, but the water’s bad and the ground causes barrenness.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Bring me a new jug and put salt in it.” </em> They brought one, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>and he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it, <em>“Yahveh says he’s purified the water. It won’t cause death or barrenness anymore.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The water is still pure. <strong>Forty-Two Youths Jeer Elish</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>	 </strong></span>
