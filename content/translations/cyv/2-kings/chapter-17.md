## 2 Kings Chapter **17**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>twelfth year of Ahaz</strong>, <u>Hoshea</u> Ben-Elah became king of Israel in Samaria <em>and ruled</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">for 9</p>

### years. 2He did evil, but not as bad as the previous kings of Israel. 3Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, attacked him, and he had to pay tribute to Assyria. 4But the king of Assyria discovered a plot he was laying. He’d sent ambassadors to So, king of Egypt, and withheld the annual tribute to Assyria; so Shalmaneser shut him up bound in prison. 5Then he invaded the whole country and went up to Samaria and laid siege to it for 3 years. 6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria conquered the city and took Israel into exile in Assyria. He settled them in Halah and Habor on the Gozan River and in towns of the Medes.   	2 Kg 17:1-6 Israel Exiled over Sin


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>That happened because they sinned against Yahveh their God, who had brought them up from Egypt from under Pharaoh. They’d feared other gods, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>followed the customs of the nations Yahveh had <em>originally </em>driven out, and the customs Israel’s kings had brought in. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Israel secretly did what wasn’t right: they built high places in their towns from watchtower to fortified city;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>they put sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>they burned incense on the high places—things that provoked Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>They served idols Yahveh told them not to serve, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>even though he warned Israel and Judah through his prophets and seers, <em>“Turn from your sins and keep my commandments, my statutes—the whole Law I’ve commanded your ancestors through the prophets.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But they ignored him. They stiffened their necks like the ancestors who didn’t believe in Yahveh. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They rejected the statutes and the covenant he made with their ancestors and <em>dismissed </em>his warnings. They became vain and followed the nations around them that he commanded them not to be like.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 17:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>They made molten images, <em>that is, </em>two calves and an Asherah pole. They worshiped the host of heaven and served Baal. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They burned their sons and daughters as offerings, and practiced fortunetelling and sorcery. They provoked Yahveh by selling themselves to sinning. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He was angry with them and removed them away from him. None were left except the tribe of Judah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Judah didn’t keep his commandments <em>either</em>, but followed the customs Israel brought in. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Yahveh rejected Israel’s descendants, oppressed them, and delivered them to plunderers till he’d thrown them out. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>When he’d torn Israel away from David’s dynasty, they made Jeroboam<strong><sup>I</sup></strong> Ben-Nebat king. He drove them away from Yahveh and got them to commit a great sin. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Israel</em> continued to follow in his sins <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>till Yahveh removed <em>Israel</em> away from him. Israel has been in exile in Assyria ever since. <strong>Foreigners Settled in Samaria</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the towns in Samaria in place of the Israelites. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When they first started living there, they didn’t respect Yahveh. He sent lions among them and killed some of them. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>They spoke to the king of Assyria, <em>“The nations you exiled into the towns in Samaria don’t know the Law of the god of the land. He has sent lions among them to kill them.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Then the king commanded, <em>“Bring one of the priests you exiled, and have him live there and teach them the Law of the god of the land.”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 17:16-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>One of the priests they’d exiled came and lived at Bethel and taught them how to respect Yahveh. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>But every nation in the towns where they lived still made gods of their own and put them at the pagan shrines the people of Samaria had made. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>The people from Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech their gods. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They also feared Yahveh and appointed priests for the high places, who acted for them in the shrines there. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>They feared Yahveh <u>and</u> served their own gods like they did where they came from.<strong>   </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 17:18-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>They’ve kept the earlier customs ever since. They don’t respect Yahveh or follow his statutes, ordinances, Law, or commandments to Jacob’s descendants, that he named Israel <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>and made a covenant with, <em>“Don’t fear other gods, bow to them, serve them, sacrifice to them. </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Fear</em><em> Yahveh that brought you out of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Bow to him and </em><em>sacrifice to</em><em> him. </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Observe</em><em> forever the statutes, ordinances, Law, and </em><em>commandment</em><em> he wrote for you. [</em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>] </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>Fear</em><em> Yahveh your God, and he’ll deliver you from your enemies.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>They didn’t listen; <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>while they feared Yahveh, they also served their idols. Their children and grandchildren still do that.<strong>       </strong><strong></span>
