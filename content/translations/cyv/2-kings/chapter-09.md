## 2 Kings Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Elisha called a man from the school of the prophets, <em>“Gird up*,</em><em> take</em><em> this flask of oil to Ramoth-gilead. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Find Jehu Ben-Jehoshaphat Ben-Nimshi. </em><em>Tell him to get up from his companions and take him to a room inside. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Pour</em><em> the flask of olive oil on his head and say, ‘Yahveh says, “I’ve anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and run.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The young man went to Ramoth-gilead. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The commanders of the army were sitting there, and he said, <em>“I have a message for you, commander.” </em> Jehu said, <em>“Which one?”</em> <em>“You, Sir.”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 9:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He got up and went into the house. The young man poured the oil on his head, <em>“Yahveh God of Israel says,</em> <em>‘I’ve anointed you king over his people Israel.</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Strike</em><em> Ahab’s family so I can avenge the blood of my prophets that Jezebel shed. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Ahab’s</em><em> family will perish, and I’ll remove from him every male, bond and free. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> destroy his family like </em><em>Jeroboam’s</em><strong><em><sup>I</sup></em></strong><em> and Baasha’s. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Dogs</em><em> will eat Jezebel in Jezreel, and nobody will bury her.’” </em> He opened the door and ran.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Jehu came out to the other officers, and one of them asked, <em>“Is everything all right? Why did that mad fellow come to you?” </em> <em> </em>He said, <em>“You know very well how a man like him can babble.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em><sup>“</sup></em><em>That’s</em><em> not what happened. Tell us.”</em> He said, <em>“He said such and such, ‘Yahveh says, “I’ve anointed you king of Israel.”’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Each man hurried and put his cloak under Jehu on the bare steps, blew the bugle, and said, <em>“</em><em><u>Jehu</u></em><em> is king!”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Jehu plotted against <u>Joram</u>. With all Israel, Joram had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but he’d gone back to Jezreel to heal from wounds he got from the Arameans. Jehu said, <em>“If you agree, don’t let anybody leave the city to tell it in Jezreel.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Then Jehu rode a chariot to Jezreel because <u>Joram</u> was lying there healing. <strong>Ahaziah</strong>, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>A watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s company <em>of soldiers</em>, <em>“A company is coming.”</em> Joram said, <em>“Send a horseman to meet them and ask him if he’s coming in peace.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>A horseman went to meet him, <em>“The king asks if you’re coming in peace.”</em> Jehu said, <em>“What do you have to do with peace? Defect and follow me.”</em> The watchman reported, <em>“The messenger went to them, but didn’t come back.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He sent out a second horseman, <em>“The king asks if you’re coming in peace.”</em> Jehu answered, <em>“What do you have to do with peace? Defect and follow me.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>The watchman reported, <em>“He went to them, but didn’t come back. His driving is furious like Jehu’s.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 9:14-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Joram said, <em>“Get my chariot ready.”</em> They got it ready. <u>Joram</u> and <strong>Ahaziah</strong> went out in their chariots to meet Jehu and found him on Naboth’s property. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, <em>“Are you coming in peace, Jehu?”</em> <em>“What peace, with so many of your mother’s prostitutions and witchcrafts?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Joram reined around and fled. He told Ahaziah, <em>“It’s treason!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms. The arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Then Jehu told Bidkar his officer, <em>“Pick him up and throw him on Naboth’s field. Remember when we were riding behind his father Ahab, Yahveh laid this oracle against him: </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>‘I</em><em> certainly saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday. I’ll pay you back on that property.’ Throw him on the property like Yahveh said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>When Ahaziah saw that, he fled past the garden house. Jehu chased him and said, <em>“Shoot him, too, in the chariot.”</em> They shot him at the ascent of Gur, at Ibleam. He fled as far as Megiddo and died. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>His servants hauled him to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in his own grave with his ancestors in The City of David. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Ahaziah had become king in Judah in <strong>the eleventh year of Joram</strong>.<strong>	 </strong></span>

### Jezebel Killed


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>When Jehu arrived at Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, and put on eye shadow and adorned her head, and looked out the window. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>When Jehu came in the gate, she said, <em>“Is everything all right, Zimri, your master’s murderer?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>He looked up at the window and said, <em>“Who’s with me?” </em> Two of the three officials looked down. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>“Throw</em><em> her down.”</em> They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and the horses, and he tramped her under his horses hooves. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He came in and ate, and said, <em>“See to that cursed woman and bury her. She </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> a king’s daughter.” </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong>They went to bury her, but they couldn’t find any of her except skull, feet, and palms. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>They came back and told him. He said, <em>“Yahveh said by Elijah, ‘Dogs will eat her body on her property. </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Her</em><em> corpse will be like manure on her field; people won’t be able to tell if it’s Jezebel.’”</em> <strong>	</strong></span>
