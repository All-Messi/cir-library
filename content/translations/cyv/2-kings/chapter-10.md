## 2 Kings Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Ahab</span>
<p class="section-ref">had 70</p>

### sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters to Samaria, to the rulers in Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab’s children, 2“When you get this letter, since your master’s sons are with you—as well as the chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons—3select the best and fittest son, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s family.”


<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>But they were too afraid, <em>“Two kings couldn’t stand against him. How can we?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>The steward of the household, the mayor of the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children sent Jehu a message, <em>“We’re your servants; we’ll do whatever you say. We won’t make anybody king. Do what you want to.” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He wrote them a second letter, <em>“If you’re with me, take the heads of your master’s sons and meet me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.” </em><strong>	</strong></span>

### 6a The chief men in the city were raising the king’s sons. 7When the letter came, they killed his 70 sons, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>A messenger told him, <em>“They’ve brought the heads of the king’s sons.” </em> He said,<em> “Put them in two piles at the entrance to the gate till morning.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>In the morning he went out and told the people, <em>“You’re innocent. I plotted against your master and killed him, but who killed all these? </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Know</em><em> then that nothing Yahveh said about Ahab’s family will fall to the ground. He’s done what he said through Elijah.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Jehu killed everybody from Ahab’s family in Jezreel, as well as his chief men, acquaintances, and priests. There weren’t any survivors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He left and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>he met the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah, <em>“Who are you?”</em> <em>“Ahaziah’s relatives. We’ve come down to greet the king’s sons and the queen mother.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Take them alive.”</em> They took them alive and <em>then decided to </em>kill every one of them at the pit at Beth-eked—42 men.	 <strong>2 Kg </strong><strong>10:6b-14</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>When he left there, he met Jehonadab Ben-Rechad, coming to meet him. He greeted him, <em>“Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em> Jehu said,<em> “Give me your hand.” </em>He took him up into the chariot, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Come</em><em> with me and see how devoted I am to Yahveh.”</em> He had him ride in his chariot.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When he got to Samaria, he killed everybody that remained to Ahab there—like Yahveh told Elijah. <strong>The Baal Prophets Killed</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then Jehu got the people together and told them, <em>“Ahab served Baal a little; I’ll serve him a lot. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Call</em><em> the Baal prophets, worshipers, and priests. Make sure everybody’s here because I’m </em><em>holding</em><em> a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever’s absent won’t live.”</em> But it was a trick to destroy the Baal worshipers. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” </em>They declared it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He sent all over Israel and the Baal worshipers came. There wasn’t a man that didn’t go into Baal’s temple and fill it end to end. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He told the one in charge of the wardrobe, <em>“Bring out robes for the worshipers.”</em> He did that. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Jehu went in with Jehonadab and told the Baal worshipers, <em>“Make sure there aren’t any worshipers of Yahveh.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stat</span>

### men outside, “Whoever lets a man escape that I bring to you will give his life in exchange for it.” 	2 Kg 10:15-24


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>As soon as he’d finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and royal officers, <em>“Go in, kill them; don’t let anybody get out.”</em> They killed them with swords, and the guard and royal officers threw them out. They went to the inner room of Baal’s temple <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and brought out the sacred pillars and burned them. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>They demolished his sacred pillar, tore down his temple, and made it a toilet ever since. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>So Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>But, Jehu didn’t stop the sins Jeroboam caused Israel to do—the gold calves at Bethel and Dan. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Yahveh told him, <em>“Since you’ve done to Ahab’s family what I wanted, your descendants will sit on Israel’s throne for four generations.”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>But Jehu wasn’t careful to follow the Law of Yahveh with all his heart. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 10:25-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Then Yahveh began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout Israel’s territory: <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon—Gilead and Bashan. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>The rest of the acts of Jehu and the strength of his rule are recorded in <em>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</em>. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son <u>Jehoahaz</u> became king. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Jehu ruled Israel</span>
