## 2 Kings Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters to Samaria, to the rulers in Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's children, 2"When you get this letter, since your master's sons are with you—as well as the chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons—3select the best and fittest son, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's family."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But they were too afraid, "Two kings couldn't stand against him. How can we?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The steward of the household, the mayor of the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children sent Jehu a message, "We're your servants; we'll do whatever you say. We won't make anybody king. Do what you want to." 6He wrote them a second letter, "If you're with me, take the heads of your master's sons and meet me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time." 	2 Kg 10:1-6a The chief men in the city were raising the king's sons. 7When the letter came, they killed his 70 sons, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A messenger told him, "They've brought the heads of the king's sons." He said, "Put them in two piles at the entrance to the gate till morning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In the morning he went out and told the people, "You're innocent. I plotted against your master and killed him, but who killed all these? 10Know then that nothing Yahveh said about Ahab's family will fall to the ground. He's done what he said through Elijah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jehu killed everybody from Ahab's family in Jezreel, as well as his chief men, acquaintances, and priests. There weren't any survivors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He left and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 13he met the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah, "Who are you?" "Ahaziah's relatives. We've come down to greet the king's sons and the queen mother."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, "Take them alive." They took them alive and then decided to kill every one of them at the pit at Beth-eked—42 men.	 2 Kg 10:6b-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he left there, he met Jehonadab Ben-Rechad, coming to meet him. He greeted him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?" "Yes." Jehu said, "Give me your hand." He took him up into the chariot, 16"Come with me and see how devoted I am to Yahveh." He had him ride in his chariot.  17When he got to Samaria, he killed everybody that remained to Ahab there—like Yahveh told Elijah. The Baal Prophets Killed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Jehu got the people together and told them, "Ahab served Baal a little; I'll serve him a lot. 19Call the Baal prophets, worshipers, and priests. Make sure everybody's here because I'm holding a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever's absent won't live." But it was a trick to destroy the Baal worshipers. 20He said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." They declared it. 21He sent all over Israel and the Baal worshipers came. There wasn't a man that didn't go into Baal's temple and fill it end to end. 22He told the one in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out robes for the worshipers." He did that. 23Jehu went in with Jehonadab and told the Baal worshipers, "Make sure there aren't any worshipers of Yahveh." 24Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stationed 80 men outside, "Whoever lets a man escape that I bring to you will give his life in exchange for it." 	2 Kg 10:15-24</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> As soon as he'd finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and royal officers, "Go in, kill them; don't let anybody get out." They killed them with swords, and the guard and royal officers threw them out. They went to the inner room of Baal's temple 26and brought out the sacred pillars and burned them. 27They demolished his sacred pillar, tore down his temple, and made it a toilet ever since. 28So Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But, Jehu didn't stop the sins Jeroboam caused Israel to do—the gold calves at Bethel and Dan. 30Yahveh told him, "Since you've done to Ahab's family what I wanted, your descendants will sit on Israel's throne for four generations." 31But Jehu wasn't careful to follow the Law of Yahveh with all his heart. 	2 Kg 10:25-31</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then Yahveh began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout Israel's territory: 33from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon—Gilead and Bashan. 34The rest of the acts of Jehu and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 35He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became king. 36Jehu ruled Israel for 28 years in Samaria. 	2 Kg 10:32-36 Queen Athaliah and Joash</span>
