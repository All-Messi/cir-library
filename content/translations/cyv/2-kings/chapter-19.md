## 2 Kings Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with burlap, and went into Yahveh’s Temple. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He sent Eliakim with Shebna and the elders of the people, covered with burlap, to the prophet Isaiah Ben-Amoz. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They told him, <em>“Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a time of distress, rebuke, and rejection. Babies have come to </em><em>term</em><em>, but there’s no strength to deliver them. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Maybe</em><em> Yahveh your God will hear the message from the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria has sent to disparage the living God. Maybe he’ll rebuke what he’s heard. Pray for the remnant that’s left.’”</em> <strong>[</strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Isaiah said, <em>“Tell your master, ‘Yahveh says, “You don’t have to be afraid of what the Assyrian king’s messengers have blasphemed. </em><strong><em><sup>7</sup></em></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> put a spirit in him that makes him hear a rumor and go back to his country. He’ll fall by the sword in his own land.”’”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he’d heard that the king had left Lachish. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When he heard them say that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia,<em> </em>had set out to fight him<em>,</em> he sent messengers back again to Hezekiah, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> Hezekiah, ‘Don’t let the god you trust in deceive you by saying Jerusalem won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Did</em><em> their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the sons of Eden in Telassar? </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Where’s</em><em> the king of Hamath, Arpad, or the towns Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’” </em> <strong>Hezekiah’s Prayer</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Hezekiah read the letter, went up to Yahveh’s Temple, and spread it out to him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He prayed, <em>“Yahveh God of Israel Enthroned Above the Cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Incline</em><em> your ear and hear; open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to disparage the living God. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Assyria’s</em><em> kings </em><em><u>have</u></em><em> devastated the nations and their lands. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>They’ve</em><em> burned their gods because they weren’t gods, just man-made </em>pieces of <em>wood and stone. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> now, Yahveh our God, deliver us from him so the kingdoms can know that you alone are God.”</em><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Isaiah Prophesies Sennacherib’s Fall


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Isaiah sent to Hezekiah<em>, “Yahveh says, ‘Because you’ve prayed about Sennacherib, I’ve listened.’ </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is what </em>Yahveh<em> says against him:</em> <em>	‘The young virgin of Zion </em> <em>	</em><em>	despises you and mocks </em><em>you;</em> <em>	the young woman of Jerusalem </em> <em>	</em><em>	shakes her head at you!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Who</em><em> have you disparaged and blasphemed?</em> <em>	Who have you raised your voice at,</em> <em>	</em><em>	proudly </em><em>lifted up</em><em> your eyes </em><em>against?</em> <em>	The Holy One of Israel!</em><strong>	               </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>By</em><em> your ambassadors you’ve disparaged Yahveh.</em> <em>	You’ve said, “With my many chariots</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I went up to the highest mountains,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	to the most remote parts of Lebanon.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I cut down its tallest cedars and best cypress.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I entered its most distant lodging place, its thickest forest.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>while</em><em> their people are short of strength,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	 scared, and confounded.</em> <em>	</em><em>	They’ve become like plants in a field and green herbs,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	like grass on housetops, scorched before it’s grown.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Because</em><em> you’ve raged against me,</em> <em>	</em><em>	because of your arrogance that I’ve heard,</em> <em>	</em><em>	I’ll put my hook </em><em>in</em><em> your nose,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	my bridle in your jaws,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and turn </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>back</em><em> the way you came.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### 29‘This will show you what I mean: this year you’ll eat what volunteers, next year what sprouts from that, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat what they produce. 30The surviving remnant of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 31A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahveh will make that happen.  32‘Yahveh says the king of Assyria won’t come to this city or shoot an arrow here. He won’t approach it with a shield or build a mound against it. 33He’ll go back the way he came. 34I’ll save this city for my own sake and for David’s sake.”

When people got up early, the Assyrians were all dead. 36Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 37As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to Ararat.
