## 2 Kings Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim served him for 3 years, then revolted. 2Yahveh sent bands of Babylonians, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against him to destroy Judah like he'd warned by his prophets. 3At Yahveh's command, that all came on Judah because of Manasseh's sins 4and the innocent blood he'd filled Jerusalem with. Yahveh wouldn't forgive. 5The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 6He died and his son Jehoiachin became king. 7The king of Egypt didn't come out of his country again, because the king of Babylon took everything he had from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River.	2 Kg 24:1-7 Jehoiachin Rules in Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jehoiachin was 18 when he became king and ruled for 3 months in Jerusalem. His mother was Nehushta Bat-Elnathan from Jerusalem. 9He did evil like his father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> At that time, the officers of Nebuchadnezzar came up to Jerusalem and laid siege to it. 11He came while they were besieging it. 12Jehoiachin, his mother, advisors, commanders, and officials went out to him. The king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 13He carried the treasures out of Yahveh's Temple and the king's palace, and cut up the gold articles Solomon had made in the Temple—like Yahveh said. 14He led into exile Jerusalem, the commanders, trained soldiers (10,000 captives), craftsmen, and smiths. Only the poorest people remained. 15He led Jehoiachin to Babylon along with his mother, his wives, officials, leading men of the country, 16the brave men (7,000), the craftsmen and smiths (1,000), the ones strong and fit for war. 17He made his uncle Mattaniah king and changed his name to Zedekiah.

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Zedekiah was 21 and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal Bat-Jeremiah of Libnah. 19He did evil like Jehoiakim. 20Because of Yahveh's anger, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah till he threw them out from his presence. Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon.	2 Kg 24:8-20 The Fall of Jerusalem</span>
