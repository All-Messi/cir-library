### when he became king and ruled for 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah Bat-Adaiah from Bozkath. 2He did what was good and followed the ways of David.


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>In the <strong>eighteenth year of King Josiah</strong>, he sent Shaphan Ben-Azaliah Ben-Meshullam, the secretary, to Yahveh’s Temple, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> up to Hilkiah the high priest so he can count the money the people have brought to Yahveh’s Temple that the doorkeepers have gathered. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> them deliver it to the workmen that oversee the Temple so they can repair it—</em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>carpenters</em><em>, builders, and masons—and buy the timber and cut stone for repairs. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> won’t need to account for the money they receive. They’re honest.” </em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 22:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Then Hilkiah the priest told Shaphan the secretary<em>, “I’ve found the Book of the Law in the Temple.” </em>He gave it to him to read, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and Shaphan brought word to the king, <em>“Your officials have emptied out the money they found in the Temple and delivered it to the workmen that oversee the Temple.</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Hilkiah</em><em> has also given me a scroll.”</em> He read it to the king. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When he heard it, he tore his clothes. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He told Hilkiah, Ahikam Ben-Shaphan, Achbor Ben-Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king’s adviser, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> ask Yahveh for me, for the people, and for Judah about what this scroll says. Yahveh’s great anger is burning against us. Our ancestors ignored what it says and </em><em>haven’t</em><em> done what’s written for us to do.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>They went to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum Ben-Tikvah Ben-Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She lived in Jerusalem’s Second Quarter.) <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>She told them, <em>“Yahveh God of Israel says to tell the man that sent you, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>‘I’m</em><em> going to bring disaster on this place and its people like the scroll says. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>They’ve</em><em> left me and burned incense to other gods. My anger burns against this place, and it won’t be put out. [</em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>]</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> I’ve listened to you because you became sensitive and </em><em>humbled yourself when you heard about the </em><em>desolation</em><em> I’ve cursed this place and its people with; you tore your clothes and cried.  </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I’ll let you pass on to your ancestors in peace. You won’t see the disaster I’m going to bring here.”’”</em> They took word back to the king.<strong>	</strong></span>
