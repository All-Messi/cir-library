## 2 Kings Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jehoram Ben-Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and ruled for 12 years. 2He did evil, though not as bad as his parents. He did put away Baal's sacred pillar his father had built, 3but he held onto the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Mesha, king of Moab, raised sheep and was paying the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams. 5But when Ahab died, he revolted. 6Jehoram went out from Samaria and mustered all Israel. 7He sent word to Jehoshaphat, "The king of Moab has revolted against me. Will you help me fight Moab?" "Yes, I'm like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "Which way will we go up?" "From the Wilderness of Edom." 	2 Kg 3:1-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of a week's journey, and there wasn't any water for the army or the livestock that they had with them. 10The king of Israel said, "What are we going to do? Yahveh has called these three kings to deliver them to Moab!" 11But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there a prophet of Yahveh here we can ask?" One of the king's officials answered, "Elisha Ben-Shaphat. He used to pour water on Elijah's hands."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Jehoshaphat agreed, "He prophesies for Yahveh." The king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Elisha told the king of Israel, "Why come to me? Go to your parents' prophets." "No, Yahveh called these three kings together to deliver them to Moab!" 	2 Kg 3:9-13</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Elisha said, "As Yahveh of Hosts lives that I serve, if it weren't that I care about Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at yousg. 15Bring me a musician." While the musician played, Yahveh came on him. 16He said, "Yahveh says to fill this valley with trenches. 17You won't see wind or rain, but the valley will be full of water for you, your cattle, and other animals. 18This is just a little thing for Yahveh to deliver the Moabites to you. 19Then strike every fortified city, every select city, cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring, and trash every cultivated piece of land with rocks.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The next day about the time of morning sacrifice, water flowed down from Edom, and the country was full of water.	 2 Kg 3:14-20</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight them. They called in everybody that could put on armor and stationed themselves along the border. 22When they got up early, the morning sun was reflecting off the water. From a distance it looked red like blood. 23They said, "The kings must have fought and killed one another. Now Moab, to your spoils!" 24But when they got to the camp, the Israelites rose up and struck them, and they fled. The Israelites advanced into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. 25They destroyed their towns, and each one threw a rock on every piece of cultivated land and trashed it. They stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees till in Kir-hareseth only they left its rocks alone. But the stone slingers surrounded it and attacked it. 26When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took 700 swordsmen to break through near the king of Edom, but they couldn't. 27Then he took his oldest son, who was to reign, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. Great horror came over Israel, and they went home.	 2 Kg 3:21-27 The Widow's Oil Jar</span>
