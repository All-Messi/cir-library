Will you help me fight Moab?”  “Yes, I’m like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours.”

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of a week’s journey, and there wasn’t any water for the army or the livestock that they had with them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The king of Israel said, <em>“What are we going to do? Yahveh has called these three kings to deliver them to Moab!”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But Jehoshaphat said, <em>“Isn’t there a prophet of Yahveh here we can ask?” </em> One of the king’s officials answered, <em>“Elisha Ben-Shaphat. He used to pour water on Elijah’s hands.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Jehoshaphat agreed, <em>“He prophesies for Yahveh.”</em> The king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Elisha told the king of Israel, <em>“Why come to me? Go to your parents’ prophets.” </em> <em>“No, Yahveh called these three kings together to deliver them to Moab!”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Kg 3:9-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Elisha said, <em>“As Yahveh of Hosts lives that I serve, if it weren’t that I care about Jehoshaphat, I wouldn’t even look at you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Bring</em><em> me a musician.” </em> While the musician played, Yahveh came on him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Yahveh says to fill this valley with trenches. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> won’t see wind or rain, but the valley will be full of water for you, your cattle, and </em>other <em>animals. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is just a little thing for Yahveh to deliver the Moabites to you. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> strike every fortified city, every select city, cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring, and trash every cultivated piece of land with rocks.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>The next day about the time of morning sacrifice, water flowed down from Edom, and the country was full of water.<strong>	 </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>The Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight them. They called in everybody that could put on armor and stationed themselves along the border. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When they got up early, the <em>morning </em>sun was reflecting off the water. From a distance it looked red like blood. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They said, <em>“The kings must have fought and killed one another. Now Moab, to your spoils!”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But when they got to the camp, the Israelites rose up and struck them, and they fled. The <em>Israelites</em> advanced into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They destroyed their towns, and each one threw a rock on every piece of cultivated land and trashed it. They stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees till in Kir-hareseth only they left its rocks alone. But the <em>stone </em>slingers surrounded it and attacked it. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he</span>

### swordsmen to break through near the king of Edom, but they couldn’t. 27Then he took his oldest son, who was to reign, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. Great horror came over Israel, and they went home.	 2 Kg 3:21-27 The Widow’s Oil Jar
