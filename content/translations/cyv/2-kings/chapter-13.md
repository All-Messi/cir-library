## 2 Kings Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>In the <strong>twenty-third year of Joash</strong>/<em>Jehoash</em> Ben-Ahaziah, king of Judah, <u>Jehoahaz</u> Ben-Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria <em>and ruled</em></span>

### years. 2He followed the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin. 3Yahveh’s anger flared; he kept delivering them to Hazael, king of Aram, and Benhadad his son. 4Jehoahaz asked for Yahveh’s help and he listened to him, because he saw the oppression by the king of Aram. 5Yahveh gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped from under the Arameans and lived like before. 6But they didn’t turn away from the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin; the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria. 7The Arameans reduced Jehoahaz’s army to not more than 50 cavalry, 10 chariots, and 10,000 infantry, and made them like dust at threshing time. 8The rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 9He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Joash became king.        	 2 Kg 13:1-9 Jehoash Rules in Israel

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>When Elisha took sick with the illness he’d die from, Joash, king of Israel, came down and cried over him, <em>“Father! Father! the chariots of Israel and their drivers!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Elisha said, <em>“Pick up a bow and arrows, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> put your hand on the bow.”</em> Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“Open</em><em> the window toward the east. Shoot!</em> <em>Yahveh’s arrow of victory over Aram! You’ll destroy the Arameans at Aphek.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then he said, <em>“Pick up some arrows and strike the floor.”</em> He struck it three times and stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The man of God was mad at him, <em>“You should have struck </em>it <em>five or six times. Then you would have struck Aram till you’d destroyed it. But as it is, you’ll strike Aram only three times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Elisha died, and they buried him. Bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Once, as some <em>Israelites</em> were burying a man, they saw a marauding band. They threw him into Elisha’s tomb <em>and ran</em>. When he touched Elisha’s bones, he came back to life and stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Hazael, king of Aram, had oppressed Israel all the time of Jehoahaz. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But Yahveh was gracious, had mercy, and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He still hadn’t destroyed them or thrown them out of his presence. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>When Hazael died, Benhadad his son became king. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Jehoash took back the towns Hazael had taken in war from his father. Three times he defeated him and recovered Israel’s towns.<strong>	</strong></span>
