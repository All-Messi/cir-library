They went by way of the Arabah. 5But the army chased the king and overtook him in the plains by Jericho, and his whole army scattered. 6They captured him and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him. 7They executed Zedekiah's sons in front of him and then put out his eyes. They bound him with bronze restraints and took him to Babylon.</span>
