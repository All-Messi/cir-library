## 2 Kings Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elisha told the woman whose son he'd revived, "Take your family and live temporarily wherever you can. Yahveh has called for a seven-year famine here." 2They went to stay with the Philistines. 3Seven years later, she came back and appealed to the king for her house and farm. 4He was talking to Gehazi, the man of God's servant, "Tell me the great things Elisha has done." 5As he was telling him how he'd restored life to a boy, she appealed to the king for her house and farm. Gehazi said, "My lord the king, that's the woman, and that's her son!" 6When the king asked her, she told him about it. He appointed an officer to give her back everything, including the crops since she left.	 2 Kg 8:1-6 Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Elisha went to Damascus. Benhadad, king of Aram, was sick and heard that the man of God was there. 8He told Hazael, "Take him a gift and ask Yahveh by him if I'll recover." 9Hazael went to meet him with a gift, every kind of good thing in Damascus—40 camel loads. He stood in front of him and said, "Your son Benhadad, king of Aram, has sent me to ask you if he'll recover from his sickness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Elisha said, "He'll recover, but Yahveh has shown me that he'll certainly die." 11He stared at him till he was embarrassed, and the man of God cried.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Hazael said, "Why are you crying, Sir?" "Because I know the terrible things you'll do to Israel. You'll set their fortresses on fire, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women." 13"What am I, a dog, to do things like that?" Elisha answered, "Yahveh has shown me that you'll be king of Aram."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He went back to his master, who said, "What did Elisha say to you?" "He said you'd recover."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The next day Hazael dipped a blanket in water and pressed it over Benhadad's face, to kill him. Hazael became king.	 2 Kg 8:7-15 Jehoram Rules in Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> In the fifth year of Joram/Jehoram Ben-Ahab, king of Israel—who ruled at the time of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah—Jehoram Ben-Jehoshaphat became king. 17He was 32 and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 18He followed Israel's kings like Ahab had done because he'd married Ahab's daughter. He did evil, 19but for David's sake Yahveh wasn't willing to destroy Judah. He'd promised to always give him a lamp through his descendants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> During his reign, Edom revolted from Judah and appointed a king. 21Joram and his chariots crossed over to Zair. He got up at night and struck at the Edomites that had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots, but his army fled to their tents. 22Edom has been in revolt against Judah ever since. 23The rest of the acts of Joram/Jehoram are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 24He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Ahaziah became king. 	2 Kg 8:16-24 Ahaziah Rules in Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In the twelfth year of Joram/Jehoram Ben-Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah Ben-Jehoram began to rule. 26He was 22 and ruled for 1 year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. 27He did evil like Ahab's family had done because he was Ahab's son-in-law. 28He went to war along with Joram against Hazael, king of Aram in Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded him. 29King Joram came back to Jezreel to heal up. Then Ahaziah went down to see Joram because he'd been wounded.	 2 Kg 8:25-29 Jehu Anointed King in Israel</span>
