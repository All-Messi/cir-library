## Haggai Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The First Day, Sixth Month, Second Year of King Darius A Message from Yahveh to the Prophet Haggai for Zerubbabel Ben-Shealtiel, Governor of Judah, and for Joshua Ben-Jehozadak, the High Priest, God's Call to Rebuild the Temple 2"Yahveh says, 'These people are saying this is no time to be rebuilding Yahveh's Temple.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A message came by Haggai, 4"Is this a time for you to be living in your paneled houses while my Temple lies in ruins?" 5"Think about how things are going for you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You sow a lot, but reap a little; you eat, but not enough to satisfy; you drink, but not enough to quench your thirst; you put on clothes, but you're not warm; you put your pay in pouches with holes in them." 7"Think about what you're doing!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Go up into the mountains to get lumber; rebuild the Temple so I can be pleased with it and honored by it. 9You look for a good crop, but it comes in poor. When you haul it in, I blow it away. Why? Because my Temple is lying in ruins while your interest lies in your own houses. 10So the sky hasn't dropped dew, and the ground hasn't produced crops. 11I called for a drought on the fields and hills: the grain, new wine, and olive oil—on what the ground grows; on you, your livestock, and your efforts." Obedience to God's Call</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant obeyed Haggai, because Yahveh had sent him, and the people respected Yahveh. 13Then Haggai said by God's commission, "'I'm with you,' Yahveh says." 14So Yahveh stirred up Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant to begin work on the Temple 15the twenty-fourth day, sixth month, second year of Darius.</span>
