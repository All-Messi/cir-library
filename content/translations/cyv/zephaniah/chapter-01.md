I'll destroy sinful people. 4"I'll reach out against Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. I'll remove the remnant of Baal from this place and the idolatrous priests,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> the ones that bow down on housetops to the host in the sky, that swear to Yahveh and swear by Milcom too,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> the ones that quit following Yahveh, that haven't sought him or inquired from him." The Near Day of Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Be silent in front of the Lord Yahveh! His day is near; he's prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests. 8"On the day of myY sacrifice, I'll punish the officials, the king's sons in Judah, everyone that dresses in foreign clothes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> that breaks into houses, and fills their masters' homes with violence and deceit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> On that day," Yahveh says, "there'll be cries from the Fish Gate, wails from the Second Quarter, loud crashes from the hills.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Wail, people in the marketplace, because your merchants will be wiped out; every tradesman that weighs out silver will be gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll search Jerusalem with lanterns and punish people that are complacent about their sin, who tell themselves that Yahveh won't do anything to them good or bad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses demolished. They'll build houses, but not live in them; they'll plant vineyards, but not drink their wine."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> That great day of the LORD is near and coming fast, a bitter day: even soldiers will cry out bitterly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> a day of anger, a day of distress and anguish, destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, clouds and dense blackness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> a day of bugle blasts and battle cries against fortified towns and high battle towers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He'll bring such a distress on you that you'll stumble around like you're blind, because you've sinned against him. Your blood will pour out and become like dust, and your flesh will be like manure on the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Your silver and gold won't save you at the time of Yahveh's wrath; he'll consume the whole region with his burning anger and make a complete, terrifying end for people living in the land. A Call for Repentance</span>
