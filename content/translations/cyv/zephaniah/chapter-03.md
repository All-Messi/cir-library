## Zephaniah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits the rebellious, defiled, tyrannical city, Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> that wouldn't take advice or accept instruction, that didn't trust in Yahveh or come near to its God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Its officials are roaring lions; its judges are ravening wolves at dusk that leave nothing over till morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Its prophets are reckless, devious men; its priests profane the sanctuary and violate the Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh is good within it; he still doesn't do anything unjust. Every morning he hands down justice without fail, but they're never ashamed of their unjust verdicts. 6"I've destroyed nations; their towers lie in ruins. I've made their streets deserted; nobody goes by there anymore. Their towns have been laid waste; nobody lives in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I said, 'Surely, they'll respect me now and accept my instruction so their homes won't get destroyed along with everything else I'd appointed for them.' But they were eager to corrupt everything they did. 8"So wait for me to attack my prey," Yahveh says. I've decided to gather nations and kingdoms, to pour out my indignation on them, my burning anger; I'll consume them with fiery zeal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then I'll purify the people's lips so they can call on meY and serve me together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> From beyond the rivers in Nubia, those who worship me— descendants of my scattered people— will bring me offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> At that time, you won't need to be ashamed of all the things you did when you rebelled against me; I'll have removed arrogant, celebrating people from you so you'll never again be haughty on my holy mountain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But among you I'll leave humble, common people who will take refuge in meY.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The ones remaining in Israel will do no wrong, tell no lies, or have deceit among them; They'll graze and bed down in safety; nobody will make them afraid."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Shout for joy, Jerusalem! Cry out in triumph, Israel! Celebrate with all your heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh has canceled your condemnation and cleared away your foes. The King of Israel is among you; you need not dread disaster anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> At that time, he'll tell Jerusalem, "Don't be afraid, Zion; don't let your hands get weak."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh your God is among you as a victorious soldier. I'll celebrate over you and renew my love for you; I'll celebrate over you with happy songs</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> like on festival days. "I'll remove disaster from you, Zion; you won't be ashamed of being in exile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> At that time, I'll deal with your oppressors, save the lame, gather the outcast, and turn their shame into praise and renown the world over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then I'll bring you home, gather you together, and give you renown among the nations when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes," Yahveh says.</span>
