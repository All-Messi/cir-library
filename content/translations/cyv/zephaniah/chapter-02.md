## Zephaniah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Get together, go ahead, assemble, shameless nation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> before the decree takes effect— before that day of repentance passes by like chaff— before Yahveh's burning anger comes down on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Look to him, you humble in the land who've followed his commands. Aspire to goodness and humility; maybe Yahveh will protect you when his anger comes. Judgment Against Philistia</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gaza will be abandoned; Ashkelon, desolate. Ashdod will be driven out at midday; Ekron, uprooted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Misfortune awaits people along the coast, nation of Cherethites! Yahveh's message speaks against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines; I'll destroy you till there's no one left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The seacoast will be open range with camps for shepherds and folds for flocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> It will serve as pasture for the remnant from Judah. In the evening they'll lie down in the houses in Ashkelon, because Yahveh will take care of them and restore their fortune. Judgment Against Moab and Ammon 8"I've heard Moab taunting my people and Ammon insulting them; they've become arrogant about my people's territory. 9"So, as I live," Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel says, "Moab will be like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place full of nettles and salt pits, a permanent wasteland. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the remainder of my nation will take their land."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> That's what they'll get for their arrogance because they've taunted the people of Yahveh of Hosts. 11He'll terrify them and starve all the gods everywhere. Nations the world over will bow to him, each in their own land. Judgment Against Nubia and Assyria 12"I'll slay the Nubians with my sword," says Yahveh. 13"I'll reach out to the north to destroy Assyria and make Nineveh a ruins, arid like a desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Herds of wild animals will lie down in it; buzzards and desert owls will roost on its columns. Birds will chirp in its vacant windows; rubble will block its doorways; its cedar paneling will be exposed to the elements—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> the jubilant city that lived securely and said to itself, 'Nobody compares with me.' What a wasteland it will become, a haven for wild animals! Anyone that goes by will gasp and gesture in contempt." The Future of Jerusalem</span>
