## 2 Samuel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Saul died, David came back from massacring the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag. 2The third day, a man came from Saul's camp with torn clothes and dust on his head, and prostrated himself to David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> SAMUEL David Learns of Saul's Death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> David said, "Where have you come from?" "I've escaped from Israel's camp." 4"How did things go?" "They've fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead." 5"How do you know?" 6"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coming up on him. 7When he looked back, he called out to me, 8'Who are you?' 'I'm an Amalekite.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He begged me, 'Please finish me off. I'm in agony; my life lingers on.' 10"So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn't live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you." 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> David and his men tore their clothes. 12They mourned and cried and fasted till evening for Saul, Jonathan, Yahveh's people, and for Israel, because they'd fallen by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> David asked the young man, "Where are you from?" "I'm the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> David said, "How is it you weren't afraid to destroy Yahveh's anointed?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He called one of the young men, "Cut him down." So he struck him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> David told him, "Your blood is on your own head. You testified against yourself that you killed Yahveh's anointed." 17David chanted this dirge over Saul and Jonathan. 18He told them to teach Judah The Song of the Bow; The Book of Jashar records it: David's Lament for Saul and Jonathan 19"Your beauty, Israel, is slain on your high places! How the strong have fallen!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don't tell it in Gath or announce it in the streets of Ashkelon; the Philistines would celebrate; the uncircumcised would be elated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Mountains of Gilboa, may there be no dew or rain on you or fields to produce offerings, because the shield of strong men was defiled there, Saul's shield, not anointed with oil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong, Jonathan's bow didn't retreat; Saul's sword didn't come back empty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in life, died together. They were faster than eagles, stronger than lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Young women of Israel, mourn for Saul, who dressed you luxuriously in scarlet, who put gold sequins on your clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> How the strong have fallen in battle! Jonathan, slain on your high places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'm distressed over you, Jonathan my brother; you were so pleasant to me. Your love for me was more wonderful than the love of women.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> How the powerful have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!" David Anointed King of Judah</span>
