## 2 Samuel Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A long war had gone on between Saul and David. David had grown stronger; Saul had grown weaker.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> David had six sons in Hebron: Amnon his oldest by Ahinoam of Jezreel, 3Chileab second by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel; Absalom third by Maacah Bat-Tahmai, king of Geshur; 4 Adonijah fourth by Haggith, Shephatiah fifth by Abital, 5and Ithream sixth by Eglah. Abner Joins David</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> During the war between Saul and David, Abner was making himself stronger in Saul's house. 7Saul had a concubine named Rizpah Bat-Aiah. Ish-bosheth said, "Why have you had relations with my father's concubine?" 8That made Abner mad, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? I've been kind to your father's family, to his brothers and friends, and haven't delivered you to David. Yet you charge me with guilt over this woman. 9God do so to me and more if, since Yahveh has sworn to David, I don't 10transfer the kingdom from Saul to David to rule Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He couldn't talk to Abner anymore; he was afraid of him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Abner sent messengers to David, "Who does the land belong to? Make a treaty with me, and I'll bring Israel over to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He said, "Okay! I'll make a treaty with you, but I demand one thing: you won't see me unless you bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come." 14David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, "Give me my wife Michal that I was engaged to for 100 Philistine foreskins." 15Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel Ben-Laish. 16But her husband went crying as he followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said, "Go back"; so he did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Abner contacted the elders in Israel, "Before, you were looking for David to be your king. 18Now do it! Yahveh has said, 'By my servant David I'll save my people from the Philistines and their other enemies.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Abner talked to the Benjamites and went to tell David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and the House of Benjamin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He and 20 men came to David in Hebron, and David held a feast for them. 21Abner said, "Let me gather Israel to you so you'll rule everything you desire." David sent him away on good terms. Joab Murders Abner</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Some of David's troops and Joab came from a raid and brought lots of spoil, but Abner wasn't with David in Hebron, because he'd sent him away on good terms. 23When Joab and the part of the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, "Abner came to the king, and he sent him away on good terms."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Joab came to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner came to you. Why send him away already? 25You ought to know he came to deceive you and to find out about your routine and what you're doing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah without David knowing it. 27When Abner came back to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to talk privately. He struck Abner in the stomach, and he died because he'd killed Joab's brother Asahel. 28When David heard it, he said, "In Yahveh's presence, my kingdom and I are not guilty of Abner's blood. 29May that fall on Joab and his father's family. May every one of them have running sores or leprosy, use crutches, die by the sword, or go hungry."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Joab and Abishai killed Abner because he'd killed their brother Asahel in the skirmish at Gibeon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> David told Joab and everybody there, "Tear your clothes and put on burlap; lament over Abner." King David walked behind the bier. 32They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wailed at his grave and the people cried. 33He chanted a lament for Abner, "Should Abner die like a fool?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Your hands were not bound or your feet in stocks; you've been murdered by wicked men." The people cried for him again. 35They came to persuade David to eat while it was still daylight, but David vowed, "God do so to me and more if I taste anything before sunset." 36The people noticed, and it pleased them like everything he did. 37They and all Israel understood that it hadn't been the king's idea to kill Abner. 38He told his officials, "Don't you know that a prince, a great man, has fallen in Israel today? 39Even though I'm anointed as king, these sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. Yahveh repay the evildoer according to his evil deed!" Ish-Bosheth Murdered</span>
