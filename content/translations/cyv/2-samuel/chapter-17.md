## 2 Samuel Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In addition, Ahithophel told Absalom, "Let me choose 12,000 men to pursue David tonight. 2I'll attack him while he's exhausted and terrify him. The people with him will run. I'll only strike down the king 3and bring the people back to you. Everybody's return depends on the man you're looking for. Then the people will be at peace."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The plan pleased Absalom and Israel's elders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai. Let's hear what he has to say." 6When Hushai came, Absalom said, " That's what Ahithophel said. Should we do it? If not, tell us what you think."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Hushai said, "That's not a good idea. 8Your father and his men are strong warriors, as fierce as a bear robbed of her cubs out in the open. He's an expert in warfare. He won't spend the night with the people. 9He's probably already hid in a cave or someplace. When he falls on your men in the first attack, whoever hears about it will say he's slaughtered your followers. 10Even a man with a lion's heart will completely lose heart. All Israel knows your father is a strong warrior, and everybody with him is brave. 11I advise you to gather Israel from Dan to Beersheba, like sand by the sea, and go personally into battle. 12We'll come to him in a place where he can be found. We'll descend on him like dew on the ground and not leave a man with him. 13If he withdraws into a city, Israel will bring ropes and drag it into the valley till there's not a small stone left there." 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Absalom and the men of Israel said, "Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's." That happened because Yahveh had ordained to thwart Ahithophel's good advice so Yahveh could bring catastrophe on Absalom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "This is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and Israel's elders to do, and this is what I've advised. 16Quick, send and tell David not to spend the night at the fords in the open country; he needs to cross over so he and his people won't get destroyed." 	2 Sam 17:14- 16</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel. A servant girl would go tell them, and they'd tell David, because it was dangerous for them to be seen going into the city. 18But a lad did see them and told Absalom. Jonathan and Ahimaaz left in a hurry and came to the house of a man in Bahurim that had a well in his courtyard, and they got down into it. 19The man's wife had covered the well's mouth and scattered grain on it so you couldn't tell it was there. 20Absalom's men came to her at the house, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" She said, "They've crossed the river." When they searched and couldn't find them, they went back to Jerusalem. 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> After they left, the men came up out of the well and went to tell David. "Quick, get up and cross the water because Ahithophel has advised against you." 22David and every person with him crossed the Jordan by sunup. 23When Ahithophel saw that Absalom hadn't followed his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his town. He set his house in order and hanged himself. They buried him in his father's grave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> David went to Mahanaim. Absalom and his men crossed the Jordan. 25Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was Joab's cousin and son of Jithra the Israelite, who'd married Abigail Bat-Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. 26Israel and Absalom camped in Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When David got to Mahanaim, Shobi Ben-Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir Ben-Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim, 28brought David and the ones with him sleeping mats, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, 29honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd. They said, "The people are surely hungry, exhausted, and thirsty here in the countryside." The Death of Absalom</span>
