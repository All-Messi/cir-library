## 2 Samuel Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then David asked if anybody was left from Saul's house that he could show kindness out of regard for Jonathan. 2There was a servant named Ziba. They called him to David, and the king said, "You are Ziba?" "I'm your servant." 3"Is anybody left in Saul's family I can show God's kindness?" "There's still a son of Jonathan that's crippled in both feet." 4"Where is he?" "In the house of Machir Ben-Ammiel in Lo-debar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> David had him brought in. 6He came and prostrated himself. David said, "Mephibosheth, 7you don't have to be afraid. I'll treat you well out of regard for your father Jonathan, and give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul; you'll eat at my table regularly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Again he prostrated himself and said, "What am I that you should care about a dead dog like me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The king called Ziba, "I've given your master's grandson what belonged to Saul and his family. 10You, your sons, and servants can cultivate his land for him and bring in the crops and produce so he has food, but he'll eat regularly at my table." Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants. 11-13He told the king he'd do it. Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at David's table like one of his sons. (Mephibosheth had a young son Mica.) Everybody in Ziba's family was Mephibosheth's servant. David Defeats the Ammonites</span>
