## 2 Samuel Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David gathered elite troops from Israel again, 30,000. 2He and the troops went to Baale-judah to bring up God's Ark called The Name: Yahveh of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. 3They placed the Ark on a new cart to bring it from Abinadab's house that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, 4were bringing the Ark on the cart; Ahio was walking ahead of it. 5Meanwhile, David and the House of Israel were celebrating enthusiastically in Yahveh's presence with all kinds of instruments made out of fir: lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But when they came to Nacon's threshing floor, Uzzah grabbed the Ark because the oxen nearly upset it. 7Yahveh lashed out and struck him down for his disrespect. He died there by the Ark. 8David was mad because Yahveh had "lashed out against Uzzah." The place is still called Perez-uzzah. 9David was afraid of Yahveh that day, "How can the Ark come to me?" 10He wasn't willing to take it to The City of David. He took it aside to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. 11It stayed there three months, and Yahveh blessed him and his family.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> King David heard that Yahveh had blessed Obed-edom's house and everything he had because of the Ark, so he brought it to The City of David with celebration. 13When the ones carrying the Ark had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a grain-fed calf. 14He was dancing in Yahveh's presence with all his energy, wearing a linen ephod. 15He and the House of Israel were bringing up the Ark with shouting and the sound of rams' horns. 16As it came into the city, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out the window and saw him leaping and dancing, and she despised him. 17They brought the Ark and set it in its place inside the tent David pitched for it, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 18When he'd finished offering them, he blessed the people in the name of Yahveh of hosts. 19He passed a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to every man and woman in the crowd. Then everybody went home. 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> When David went back to bless his household, Michal came out, "How Israel's king distinguished himself today, exposing himself in front of his servant girls like a shameless fool!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He told her, "I celebrated in front of Yahveh, who chose me over your father and his family, and appointed me to rule his people. 22I'll be even less dignified than this and humble in my own eyes, but I'll be respected by the servant girls you've mentioned."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Michal didn't have any children the rest of her life. God's Promise to David</span>
