## 2 Samuel Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then David counted his people and set over them commanders of thousands and hundreds. 2He sent out the troops, a third each under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He told them, "I'll go out with you too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They said, "You shouldn't go out. If we flee, they won't care even if half of us die. You're worth 10,000 of us. It's better for you to be ready to help us from town."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He said, "I'll do what you think's best." He stood beside the gate, and the troops went out by hundreds and thousands. 5He charged Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom." The troops heard it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The troops went out, and the battle took place in the Forest of Ephraim. 7David's men defeated the people of Israel with a great slaughter—20,000 men. 8The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and more people died because of the forest than died from the sword. 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Absalom happened to meet some of David's men. He was trying to escape on his mule, and it went under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree. His hair got tangled up in them and left him hanging as the mule kept going. 10One fellow told Joab, "I saw Absalom hanging from a terebinth tree."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Joab said, "You saw him! Why didn't you strike him to the ground? I would've given you 10 pieces of silver and a belt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The man said, "Even if you'd given me 1,000, I wouldn't have attacked the king's son. He charged you, Abishai, and Ittai for his sake to protect young Absalom! 13Otherwise, if I'd have dealt deviously with him (and there's nothing hidden from the king), you wouldn't have gotten involved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Joab said, "I'm not wasting time here with you." He took three spears and thrust them through Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the tree. 15Ten young men that carried Joab's armor gathered around Absalom and killed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Joab blew the ram's horn, and his troops came back from chasing Israel. 17They threw Absalom in a deep pit in the forest and piled a big mound of rocks over him. Israel fled home. 18Absalom had set up a marker in the King's Valley. He said, "I don't have a son to carry on my name." So he named the marker after himself; it's still called Absalom's Monument.

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then Ahimaaz said, "Let me run to the king with the news that Yahveh has freed him from his enemies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Joab told him, "You're not the one to carry news today. You'll carry it another day. The king's son is dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Joab told the Nubian, "Go tell him what you've seen." He bowed to Joab and ran.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Ahimaaz said again, "Whatever happens, let me run too." Joab said, "Why would you run, son, since you won't get anything for it?" 23"Whatever happens, I'll run." "Go ahead."	 2 Sam 18:16-23a Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Nubian. 24David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town. The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and saw a man running by himself. 25He called it out to the king. He said, "If he's by himself, he has good news." He came closer and closer. 26Then the watchman saw another man running. He called to the gatekeeper, "There's another man running by himself." The king said, "That one is bringing good news too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The watchman said, "The first runner looks like Ahimaaz." The king said, "He's a good man, bringing good news."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All's well." He prostrated himself to the king. "Blessed is Yahveh your God, who has delivered up the rebels." 29"Is Absalom all right?" Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant and me, I saw a big great disturbance, but I didn't know what was going on."	 2 Sam 18:23b-29</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The king said, "Come over and stand here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The Nubian arrived and said, "Receive good news. Yahveh has freed you today from your attackers." 32"Is Absalom all right?" The Nubian answered, "Let everyone who opposes you be like that young man!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The king was deeply moved and went up to the room above the gate and cried. He said as he walked, "Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! Oh that I'd have died instead of you, Absalom! My son! My son!"</span>
