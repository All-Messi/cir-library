## 2 Samuel Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> David sang this song to Yahveh when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul: 2"Yahveh is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> my God, my refuge, my shield, the horn of my salvation, my fortress, my savior from violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I called on him who deserves praise, and he saved me from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The waves of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction flooded over me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> the cords of Sheol tied me down; the snares of death trapped me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In my desperation I cried out to Yahveh, and he heard me in his temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook because he was angry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Smoke poured out of his nostrils; consuming fire flared from his mouth; glowing coals erupted from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He lowered the sky too and came down with dense darkness under his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He rode on a cherub and came flying on the wings of the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He made blackness a canopy around him, a mass of moisture, dark clouds in the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Coals of fire flamed out from the brightness in front of him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh thundered from the sky; the Most High raised his voice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He shot arrows and scattered my enemies; lightning flashes routed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then the water in the sea receded; the seabed was exposed at his rebuke, at the blast from his nostrils.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He reached down from on high and grabbed me, and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He delivered me from powerful enemies that hated me, that were too strong for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They attacked me in a time of catastrophe, but Yahveh supported me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He brought me out into a safe place and rescued me because he delighted in me. 21"Yahveh has rewarded me according to my goodness, according to my innocence—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> because I'd kept his ways and hadn't sinned by leaving him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> because his ordinances all stayed with me; I hadn't shoved any of his statutes away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I stood blameless in front of him and kept away from sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> So Yahveh has rewarded me according to my goodness— according to my godliness toward him. 26"With the kind you're kind; with the blameless you're blameless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> with the pure you're pure; the devious you torture.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You rescue the humble, but bring down the haughty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You're my lamp, Yahveh, and shine light into my darkness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> With your help I can crush a battalion; I can scale a wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> God's way is perfect; Yahveh's promise proves true; he's a shield for everyone that depends on him for protection. 2 32"Who is God except Yahveh? Who is a rock except our God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> who wraps me in strength and makes my way safe,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> who makes my feet like red deer's hooves and sets me securely on high ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> who trains my hands for battle and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow, 2</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> who gives me his deliverance as a shield and helps make me great,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> who widens the path for my feet so they don't slip.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> I chased my enemies and overtook them; I didn't turn back till I'd eliminated them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> I thrust them through so they couldn't get up again. They fell under my feet</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> because you've wrapped me in strength for battle; and subdued my assailants under me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> You've made my enemies retreat; I destroyed the ones that hated me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They looked around for help, but there wasn't any; they even cried out to Yahveh, but he didn't answer them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> I pulverized them like dust, crushed and stomped on them like dirt in the street. 2 44"You delivered me from conflict with my own people and placed me at the head of nations; people I didn't know serve me now.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Foreigners pretend to submit as soon as they hear me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> they retreat and come cringing out of their fortresses. 2 47"Yahveh lives; blessed be my Rock; exalted be God, the rock that saves me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> the God that carries out vengeance for me and subdues nations under me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> who brought me out from my enemies and lifted me above my attackers, who rescued me from violent people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> So I'll thank you among the Gentiles, Yahveh, and sing praises to you. 51You're a tower of victory for your king and show enduring love to your anointed one— David and his descendants forever."	2 Sam 22:2-51 [= Ps 18:2-50]</span>
