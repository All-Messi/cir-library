## Ruth Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Naomi told her, "Let me find a permanent home for you so things will go well for you. 2Isn't Boaz our relative the one whose maids you were with? 3Take a bath, anoint yourself, put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. Don't make yourself known to him till he's finished eating. 4Notice where he lies down and go uncover his feet and lie down. He'll tell you what to do." [5]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> She went down to the threshing floor and did that. 7When Boaz had eaten and drunk and was enjoying himself, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of grain. She came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 8In the middle of the night, he was startled and bent forward, and a woman was lying at his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, "Who are you?" "I'm Ruth. Spread your covering over me. You're a close relative." 10"Yahveh bless you, my daughter. You've shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after younger men, rich or poor. 11Don't worry. I'll do what you ask, because my people in town know you're an excellent woman. 12I am a close relative, but there's one closer. 13Stay tonight; in the morning, if he'll redeem you, all right. If he doesn't want to, I will, as sure as Yahveh lives. Lie down till morning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> She lay at his feet till morning and got up before people could recognize one another. He said, "No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor. 15Hold out the cloak you're wearing." She held it out, and he laid six measures of barley on her, and she went into town.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When she got to her mother-in-law, she asked her what happened. She told her what he'd done, 17"He gave me these six measures of barley and said not to go to my mother-in-law empty-handed." 18"Wait till you find out how the matter goes. He won't rest till he's settled it today." Boaz Marries Ruth</span>
