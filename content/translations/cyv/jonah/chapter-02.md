## Jonah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jonah prayed to Yahveh his God from the fish's stomach, 2"I called to you in my distress, and you answered me; I cried out for help from the belly of Sheol, and you heard me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You threw me into the deep, into the heart of the sea; the current swirled over me; your waves and breakers overwhelmed me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So I said, 'I've been driven away from you, but I'll still look toward your holy Temple.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Water closed in over me; the great deep surrounded me; seaweed wrapped around my head.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I sank down to the base of the mountains; the earth imprisoned me forever, but you brought me up from the Pit, Yahveh my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As my life was fading away, I remembered you; and prayed to you in your holy Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Those who pay respects to pointless idols forfeit your faithfulness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> but I'll sacrifice to you with thanksgiving. I'll do what I've vowed; salvation comes from youY."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Yahveh had the fish cough Jonah up onto the shore. Jonah's Trip to Nineveh</span>
