## 1 Chronicles Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then David consulted with every commander of thousands and hundreds, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and told the whole assembly, <em>“If it seems good to you and if Yahveh our God wills, let’s send around to our relatives that are still in Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites that are with them in their towns and pastures, to have them meet with us. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Let’s bring the Ark back. We neglected it in Saul’s time.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The assembly agreed because it seemed right to them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He brought Israel together from the Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring God’s Ark from Kiriath-jearim. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He and all Israel went up to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim) on the edge of Judah to bring up God’s Ark, which wears the name Yahveh, who is enthroned between the cherubs. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They hauled the Ark on a new cart from Abinadab’s house; Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>David and all Israel were celebrating to God with all their energy—with songs and lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon/<em>Nachon</em>, Uzza reached out to steady the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Yahveh’s anger burned against him, so he struck him down, and he died there in front of God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>David was mad because Yahveh “lashed out against Uzza,” and has called the place Perez-uzza ever since. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>David was afraid of God that day, <em>“How </em><em>can I bring the </em><em>A</em><em>rk home to me?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>So he didn’t take it to The City of David but to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite nearby. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>It stayed with his family for three months, and Yahveh blessed them and everybody he had.</span>
