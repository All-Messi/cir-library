## 1 Chronicles Chapter **28**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>David gathered to Jerusalem the officials in Israel, the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, the overseers of the property and livestock that belong to the king and his sons, the officials and elite soldiers, all the brave warriors. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He stood up and said, <em>“My relatives, my people. I intended to build a permanent temple for the Ark of the Covenant and for a footstool of our God; so I made preparations. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>But he told me, ‘You won’t build me a temple; you’re a soldier that’s shed blood.’ </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But Yahveh chose me from my father’s family to rule Israel permanently. He chose Judah to lead, chose my father’s family in Judah, and delighted in me among my brothers. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>From my sons he’s chosen Solomon to sit on the throne. (Yahveh</em><em> has given me many sons.</em><em>) </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He told me, ‘Solomon will build my temple and courts. I’ve chosen him to be my son, and I’ll be his father. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure if he’s resolute in keeping my commandments and ordinances, like he is today.’ </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>In front of Israel, in the assembly of Yahveh, and in the hearing of our God, endeavor to follow all his commandments so you can keep the good land and leave it for your descendants. </em> <strong>David’s Charge to Solomon</strong><em> </em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Solomon, son, know your father’s God. Serve him with all </em>your <em>heart and a willing mind, because Yahveh examines every heart and understands every intent. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Be diligent about that because he has chosen you to build a temple for the sanctuary. Have the courage to do it.” </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Then David gave Solomon the plans for the vestibule, its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, the room for the mercy seat;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>the plan for everything he had in mind—the courts, surrounding rooms, storehouses, and storehouses of dedicated things;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>the layout </em>for the divisions of priests and Levites, <em>the plans </em>for the work of service, the utensils for the service,</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Ch 28:11-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>the golden <em>utensils</em>, the weight of gold for them; the silver utensils, the weight of silver for them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>the weight of <em>gold</em> for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; the <em>weight of silver</em> for the silver lampstands, the weight of each lampstand and its lamps;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and the silver for the silver tables;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>pure gold for the forks, basins, and pitchers, the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl, and for the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the model of the chariot for the cherubs that spread out their wings and cover the Ark of the Covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The details of this pattern he made clear in writing from Yahveh’s hand.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Ch 28:14-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then David told Solomon, <em>“Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated. Yahveh’s with you. He won’t fail you or abandon you till the work is done. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>There are divisions of priests and Levites for serving in God’s Temple, and every willing man with skill will be with you for all kinds of service. The officials and the people will be entirely at your command.”</em><em>	</em></span>
