## 1 Chronicles Chapter **17**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>While David was living in his palace, he told Nathan the prophet<em>, “I’m living in a cedar palace, but Yahveh’s Ark is under curtains.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Nathan said, <em>“Do what’s in your mind. God is with you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>That same night, the message from God came to him, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“Go tell my servant David, ‘Yahveh says, “You’re not to build me a temple. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I haven’t lived in a temple since I brought Israel up. I’ve gone from tent to tent and place to place. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>In all the places where I’ve lived with Israel, have I asked any judge that I’ve commanded to shepherd my people why he hasn’t built me a cedar temple?”’ </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Tell David, ‘Yahveh of hosts says, “I took you out of the pasture from behind sheep and made you a leader over Israel. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’ve been with you wherever you’ve gone and removed your enemies from you. </em><em>I’ll make you as famous as anyone that’s ever lived in the world. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I’ll appoint you a place for my people, and plant them so they won’t have to move anymore. Sinful people won’t lay waste to them like they did before, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>including the time I put judges over them. I’ll subdue your enemies and build you a dynasty. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>When your life’s over and you’ve gone to your ancestors, I’ll set up one of your sons and secure his throne permanently. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He’ll build me a temple. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I’ll be his father, and he’ll be my son. I won’t take my enduring love away from him like I did with your predecessor. </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I’ll settle him in my house and kingdom permanently.”’”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Nathan told David everything in his vision. <strong>David’s Prayer</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Then David went in and sat in Yahveh’s presence, <em>“Who am I, Yahveh God, and what’s my family that you’ve brought me this far? </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>It’s a small thing for you, but you’ve talked about my dynasty for a long time to come and regarded me by the standard for men of high degree. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>What more can I say about the honor you’ve put on me? You know me. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>For my sake and from your own heart, you’ve done these great things and made them known. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Nobody’s like you; there’s no God besides you. From everything we’ve</em><em> heard, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>what nation is like Israel? You went to redeem them out of Egypt to make a name for yourself with great and terrifying acts, in driving out nations ahead of your people. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>You made Israel your people permanently and became their God. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Now make permanent your promise about me and my dynasty. </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Establish your name and make it great forever. </em><strong><sup>25-26</sup></strong><em>It’s a good thing that you’ve revealed to me that you’ll build a dynasty for me. That’s encouraged me to pray to you. </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>It has pleased you to bless my family so it will continue permanently. You’ve blessed it forever.”</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
