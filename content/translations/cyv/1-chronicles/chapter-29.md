<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>David told the assembly, <em>“God alone has chosen Solomon.  He’s young and new to the work. It’s an important undertaking; the Temple won’t be for some mortal but for Yahveh God. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I’ve provided as much </em>material <em>as I could: gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood—plus large amounts of onyx, gems for settings, antimony, colored stones, marble—all kinds of precious stones. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>In addition, I’m giving my own gold and silver: </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>113¼<sup> </sup>tons <em><sup>3,000 talents</sup></em><em> of gold from Ophir, </em>264¼ tons<em> </em><em><sup>7,000 talents</sup></em><em> of refined silver</em><em> for overlaying the walls of the Temple, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>and the gold and silver items the craftsmen will make.

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>He blessed Yahveh in the presence of the assembly, <em>“You’re blessed forever, Yahveh God of our ancestor Israel. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You have the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty because </em><em>everything in the sky and on earth belongs to you. The kingdom belongs to you, the exalted head over everything. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Wealth and honor come from you. Power and strength are with you. Your control makes everyone great and strong. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>We thank you and praise your glorious name.</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“But who am I and what’s my people that we can offer as willingly as this? Everything comes from you, and what we’ve given you is from your own things. </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>We’re foreigners, nomads like our ancestors. Our time on earth is like a shadow; it’s not permanent. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>This abundance we’ve provided for building you a Temple comes from you and belongs to you. </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I know you test the heart and are delighted with godliness. With a godly heart I’ve freely offered everything and seen your people offering freely and joyfully. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Yahveh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always keep such purposes and thoughts in your people’s hearts and direct their hearts to you. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Give Solomon my son a whole heart for keeping your commandments, testimonies, and statutes; and for accomplishing everything so he can build the Temple I’ve made provisions for.”  </em><em>	</em></span>

### Solomon Anointed as King


<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then David told the assembly, <em>“Bless Yahveh your God.”</em> The whole assembly blessed Yahveh God of their ancestors. They bowed their heads in worship to him, and paid homage to the king. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They sacrificed to Yahveh, and the next day offered burnt offerings—1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams,</span>

### ,000 lambs with their liquid offerings, and abundant sacrifices for all Israel. 22They ate and drank in Yahveh’s presence that day with great happiness. They confirmed Solomon as king and anointed him as ruler for Yahveh and Zadok as priest. 23Solomon replaced David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. 24The leaders, elite soldiers, and King David’s sons pledged allegiance to him. 25Yahveh highly elevated him in front of Israel and placed such royal majesty on him as hasn’t been on any other king in Israel.
