<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ch 29:1-5</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The heads of families made freewill offerings, as did the tribal leaders, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the officers over the king's work. 7They gave for the service of God's Temple 188¾ tons 5,000 talents of gold, 185 lbs 10,000 darics of gold, 377½ tons 10,000 talents of silver, 679½ tons 18,000 talents of brass, and 3775 tons 100,000 talents of iron. 8Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9The people celebrated because they had given willingly and offered freely with all their heart. David also celebrated greatly.    	1 Ch 29:6-9 David's Prayer of Praise</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He blessed Yahveh in the presence of the assembly, "You're blessed forever, Yahveh God of our ancestor Israel. 11You have the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty because everything in the sky and on earth belongs to you. The kingdom belongs to you, the exalted head over everything. 12Wealth and honor come from you. Power and strength are with you. Your control makes everyone great and strong. 13We thank you and praise your glorious name. 14"But who am I and what's my people that we can offer as willingly as this? Everything comes from you, and what we've given you is from your own things. 15We're foreigners, nomads like our ancestors. Our time on earth is like a shadow; it's not permanent. 16This abundance we've provided for building you a Temple comes from you and belongs to you. 17I know you test the heart and are delighted with godliness. With a godly heart I've freely offered everything and seen your people offering freely and joyfully. 18Yahveh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always keep such purposes and thoughts in your people's hearts and direct their hearts to you. 19Give Solomon my son a whole heart for keeping your commandments, testimonies, and statutes; and for accomplishing everything so he can build the Temple I've made provisions for."  	1 Ch 29:10-19 Solomon Anointed as King</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then David told the assembly, "Bless Yahveh your God." The whole assembly blessed Yahveh God of their ancestors. They bowed their heads in worship to him, and paid homage to the king. 21They sacrificed to Yahveh, and the next day offered burnt offerings—1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs with their liquid offerings, and abundant sacrifices for all Israel. 22They ate and drank in Yahveh's presence that day with great happiness. They confirmed Solomon as king and anointed him as ruler for Yahveh and Zadok as priest. 23Solomon replaced David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. 24The leaders, elite soldiers, and King David's sons pledged allegiance to him. 25Yahveh highly elevated him in front of Israel and placed such royal majesty on him as hasn't been on any other king in Israel. The Death of David</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> David ruled all Israel 27for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and for 33 in Jerusalem. 28He died at a good old age, full of wealth and honor, and Solomon reigned. 29The acts of King David, from first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, The Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and The Chronicles of Gad the Seer, 30with accounts of his rule and strength, and the circumstances that came on him, on Israel, and on the surrounding kingdoms.	 1 Ch 29:20-30</span>
