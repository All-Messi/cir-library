### sons and 6 daughters, but his brothers didn’t have many sons. Their whole family didn’t multiply like the descendants of Judah. 28They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, and Hazar-shual, 29at Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, 30Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, 31Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-Birei, and Shaaraim. Those were their towns till David’s reign. 32Their villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan—5 towns, 33along with the villages that were around them as far as Baal. These were their settlements, and they kept a genealogy. 34Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah Ben-Amaziah; 35Joel, Jehu Ben-Joshibiah Ben-Seraiah Ben-Asiel; 36Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, 37Ziza Ben-Shiphi Ben-Allon Ben-Jedaiah Ben-Shimri Ben-Shemaiah: 38these named were leaders in their clans, and their families increased greatly. 39They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, to look for pasture for their flocks. 40They found good pasture, and the land was large and quiet and peaceful; the previous residents were Hamites. 41These, according to the records, came at the time of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and attacked their tents as well as the Meunites that were there, and destroyed them till today, and lived in place of them, because there was pasture for their flocks. 42From them—from the descendants of Simeon—500 men went to Mount Seir with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, sons of Ishi as their leaders. 43They destroyed the remnant of the Amalekites that escaped and have lived there ever since.	1 Ch 4:24-43
