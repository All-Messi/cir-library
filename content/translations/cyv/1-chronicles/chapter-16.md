<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He appointed some Levites to serve at the Ark—to celebrate, thank, and praise Yahveh God of Israel: 5Asaph the chief, second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel with musical instruments—harps and lyres. Asaph played the loud cymbals; 6Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew bugles constantly in front of the Ark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> That day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 18"I'll give you Canaan for an inheritance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> When they were just a few with temporary residents included,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> they wandered about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.				1 Ch 16:14-20</span>
