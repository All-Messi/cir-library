## 1 Chronicles Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Satan stood up against Israel and tempted David to take a census. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>David told Joab and the commanders of the troops, <em>“Go count Israel from Dan to Beersheba and bring me the results so I can know how many there are.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>David issued an order to gather the foreigners in Israel and set stonecutters to dress stones for God’s Temple. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He provided large stores of iron for making nails for the doors in the gates and for clamps, more bronze than could be weighed, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and cedar logs without number. The Sidonians and Tyrians brought him large supplies of cedar timber. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He said, <em>“My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and Yahveh’s Temple will be magnificent, famous, and glorious all over the world. I’ll stockpile materials for it.”</em> David gathered lots of material <em>for it</em> before he died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>But the king’s word prevailed. So Joab went all over Israel and came back to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He gave David the census number: 1,100,000 swordsmen in Israel</span>

### ,000 in Judah. 6He didn’t count Levi and Benjamin because he abhorred the king’s command. 7God was displeased with this thing, so he struck Israel. 	1 Ch 21:1-7


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Then he called Solomon and charged him to build a temple for Yahveh God of Israel, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Son, I intended to build a temple for Yahveh, </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>but his message came to me, ‘You won’t build me a temple; you’ve shed so much blood and fought great wars. </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>You’ll have a son that’s not a military figure. I’ll give him rest from his enemies everywhere. His name will be Solomon because I’ll give Israel ‘peace’ and quiet during his life. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>He’ll build a temple for me. He’ll be my son, and I’ll be his father. I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure.’ </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Yahveh be with you so you can succeed at building it. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>May he give you with discretion and intelligence, and give you charge over Israel so you can keep his Law. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>You’ll prosper if you</em><em> </em><em>observe carefully </em><em>the</em><em> statutes and ordinance</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>he</em><em> commanded Moses.</em><em> </em><em>Be strong and courageous; don’t </em><em>be afraid </em><em>or</em><em> intimidat</em><em>ed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I’ve taken great pains to </em><em>stockpile materials: </em><em>3775 tons </em><em><sup>100,000 talents </sup></em><em>of gold</em><em>, </em><em>37,750 tons </em><em><sup>1,000,000 talents</sup></em><em> of silver</em><em>, bronze and iron p</em><em>ast weighing, timber, and stone.

<p class="section-ref">1 Ch 22:6-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>David said to God, <em>“I’ve committed an awful sin. Please take it away. I’ve done something really foolish.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Yahveh told Gad, David’s seer, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Tell David,</em> <em>‘Yahveh says </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>to take </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>either three years of famine, three months of being swept away by your enemies’ sword, or three days of the sword of Yahveh when his angel destroys throughout Israel.’ What should I report to the One that sent me?”     </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Ch 21:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>David told Gad, <em>“I’m in great distress. I’ll cast myself on Yahveh’s mercy because it’s so great. Don’t let me fall into human hands.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Yahveh sent a plague on Israel; 70,000 people died. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem; but as he was about to do it, he looked and was sad over the catastrophe. He told the destroying angel, <em>“That’s enough; relax your hand.”</em> The angel was standing by the threshing floor of <em>Ornan</em>/Araunah the Jebusite. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>David looked up and saw him standing between earth and sky with his sword held out over Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with burlap, fell on their faces. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He told God, <em>“I’m the one that sinned. What have these sheep done? Yahveh my God, please plague me and my father’s house, not your people.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

### David Builds an Altar


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He directed Israel’s leaders to help Solomon, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Isn’t </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> with you?</em><em> </em><em>Hasn’t he given you rest </em><em>in every direction</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>He’s delivered</em><em> to you</em><em> the </em><em>nations</em><em> in the land</em><em>, and it’s under control</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>et your heart and soul to </em><em>look to</em><em> </em><em>him. Build his</em><em> sanctuary so you can bring the </em><em>A</em><em>rk and </em><em>God’s</em><em> ho</em><em>ly articles into it</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Duties of Levites


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then the angel of Yahveh had Gad tell David to build an altar on <em>Ornan’s</em>/Araunah’s threshing floor. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>David went up. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Ornan</em>/Araunah turned and saw the angel, and his four sons hid. He was threshing wheat. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>As David came to <em>him</em>, he left the threshing floor and prostrated himself. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>David told him, <em>“Sell me this threshing floor so I can build an altar on it. Give it to me at full price so God will restrain the plague.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>Ornan</em>/Araunah said, <em>“Take it and do what seems good. I’ll give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, the wheat for the grain offering—all of it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>But King David said, <em>“I won’t take what’s yours for Yahveh or offer a burnt offering that doesn’t cost me anything.” </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He paid</span>

### lbs 600 shekels of gold for the site. 26He built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called to Yahveh, and he answered him with fire from the sky on the altar. 27Yahveh told the angel to sheath his sword.


<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>When David saw that Yahveh had answered him, he offered sacrifice there, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>because the Tabernacle and altar that Moses made were in the countryside at Gibeon. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But David couldn’t go to it to ask God because the angel’s sword terrified him. <strong>22</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>David said, <em>“This is the house of Yahveh God and the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” </em><em>	</em></span>
