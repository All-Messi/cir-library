## 1 Chronicles Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> These are men that came over to David at Ziklag, while he still couldn't move around freely because of Saul. They were among the elite soldiers that helped him during war. 2They used bows. With either hand they could sling stones and shoot arrows. They were Saul's relatives from Benjamin. 3The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite; 4Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, an elite soldier among the 30 and a leader over them. Then came Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, 5Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite; 6Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites; 7Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jerobam of Gedor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> From Gad, brave soldiers came over to David in the stronghold in the open country. They were men trained in war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like lions' faces. They were as fast as gazelles on the mountains. 9Numbered 1-11, they were Ezer, Obadiah, Eliab, 10Mishmannah, Jeremiah, 11Attai, Eliel, 12Johanan, Elzabad, 13Jeremiah, and Machbannai. 14They were commanders in the army. The least was worth 100; the best was worth 1,000. 15They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was flooding and put to flight everybody in the valleys to the east and the west.	1 Ch 12:1-15</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then some men from Benjamin and Judah came to David's stronghold. 17He went out to meet them, "If you come peacefully to help me, my heart will be with yours. But if you've come to betray me to my adversaries, since I haven't done anything wrong, may the God of our ancestors look at it and decide."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the 30, "We're yours, David; we're with you, Ben-Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to the One that helps you. Indeed, your God helps you!" David accepted them and made them captains of the band.	1 Ch 12:16-18</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> From Manasseh also some came over to David when he was going with the Philistines to fight Saul. (But he didn't end up helping them, because the lords of the Philistines conferred and sent him away, "He might desert to his Saul and turn on us.") 20As he was going to Ziklag, these came over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, commanders of thousands in Manasseh. 21They helped him against the bands of raiders, because they were fearless soldiers and commanders in the army. 22Daily, men kept coming over to help David, till there was a large army like God's army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> These are the divisions of armed troops that came to David in Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him like Yahveh said:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> from Judah: 6,800 armed troops that carried shield and spear;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> from Simeon: 7,100 fearless soldiers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> from Levi: 4,600;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> from Jehoiada, leader of Aaron's house: 3,700;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> and Zadok, a fearless young soldier, of his family: 22 captains;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> from Benjamin: 3,000 of Saul's relatives, the greater part previously allied with Saul's house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> from Ephraim: 20,800 fearless soldiers, famous in their families;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> from the Manasseh half-tribe: 18,000 men picked by name to make David king;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> from Issachar: 200 chiefs that understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do; with their relatives at their command;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> from Zebulun: 50,000 seasoned troops, ready for battle and equipped with all kinds of weapons; who helped David wholeheartedly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> from Naphtali: 1,000 captains and 37,000 that carried shield and spear;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> from Dan: 28,600 equipped for battle;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> from Asher: 40,000 seasoned troops ready for battle;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> from beyond the Jordan—Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe:  120,000 armed with all kinds of weapons.	 1 Ch 12:19-37</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> These battle-ready men came to Hebron fully intending to make David king over all Israel. The rest in Israel were also intent on making him king. 39They were there with him three days, eating and drinking, because their relatives had made preparations for them. 40People nearby and as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—great amounts of cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep. There was happiness in Israel.	1 Ch 12:38-40 The Ark Brought from Kiriath-Jearim</span>
