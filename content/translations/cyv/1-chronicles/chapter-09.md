### chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds. They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages, men that David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust. 23They and their descendants guarded the gates of Yahveh’s Temple—when it was a tabernacle—24on all four sides. 25Their relatives in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 26The four chief gatekeepers (Levites) were in an office of trust over the rooms and treasuries in God’s Temple. 27They spent the night around God’s Temple, because they were responsible for guarding them. They were responsible for opening the Temple each morning.
