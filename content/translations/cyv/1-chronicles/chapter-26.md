<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ch 26:1-11</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad second, Joah third, Sacar fourth, Nethanel fifth, 5Ammiel sixth, Issachar seventh, and Peullethai eighth. God had blessed him. 6Shemaiah had sons who governed their family because they were brave soldiers. 7Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were brave men. 8Obed-edom's sons, their sons and relatives were capable and strong for the service—62.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Meshelemiah had sons and relatives—18 brave men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Hosah Ben-Merari had sons: Shimri the first (though not born first; his father made him first), 11Hilkiah second, Tebaliah third, and Zechariah fourth. Hosah had 13 sons and relatives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> To these divisions of the gatekeepers, the chief men were given duties like their relatives to serve in Yahveh's Temple. 13According to their families, they cast lots, without regard for age, for each gate. 14The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, an advisor with insight; his lot came out for the north gate. 15Obed-edom's lot fell for the south; the storehouse went to his sons. 16For Shuppim and Hosah the lot fell for the west gate, by Shallecheth's gate on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard. 17There were six Levites on the east, four on the north and south each day, and at the storehouse two and two. 18At the Parbar on the west there were four at the highway and two at the Parbar. 19Those are the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of Korah and Merari. 	 1 Ch 26:12-19 Duties of Gatekeepers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The Levites were responsible for the treasures in God's Temple and the dedicated gifts. 21The sons of Ladan, descendants of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, that is, the Jehielites, were the heads of families. 22The sons of Jehieli—Zetham and Joel—were responsible for God's Temple. 23As to the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites, 24Shebuel Ben-Gershom Ben-Moses was officer over the treasures. 25His relatives by Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 26That Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for the treasures from the dedicated gifts that King David, the heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and commanders of the army had donated. 27They dedicated part of the spoils of war to repair Yahveh's Temple. 28Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for everything Samuel the seer, Saul Ben-Kish, Abner Ben- Ner, Joab Ben-Zeruiah, and everybody had donated. 29The Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons, were assigned to duties away from the LORD's house as officers and judges. 30The Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives—1,700 capable men, oversaw Israel west of the Jordan, for the work of Yahveh and the service of the king. 31-32The Hebronites, Jerijah the chief and his relatives, capable men, were 2,700, heads of families. King David had them oversee Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe for the affairs of God and the king. (These Hebronites were investigated according to their genealogies and families in the fortieth year of David's reign. Men with outstanding capability were found among them at Jazer in Gilead.)	1 Ch 26:20-32 Military Divisions</span>
