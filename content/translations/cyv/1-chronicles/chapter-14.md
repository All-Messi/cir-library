## 1 Chronicles Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a palace. 2David saw that Yahveh had made him secure as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly regarded for Israel's sake. 3He took more wives at Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. 4His children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 7Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 	1 Ch 14:1-7 Philistines Defeated</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When the Philistines heard they'd anointed David king over all Israel, they went up to look for him. He heard about it and went out against them. 9They'd made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 10David asked God, "Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?" Yahveh said, "Yes, go on up." 11They went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them. He said, "God has used me to 'break through' my enemies like a flash flood"; so they named the place Baal-perazim. 12The Philistines abandoned their gods there; David had them burned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 14David asked God again, and he said, "Don't attack them head on. Circle around behind them and come at them across from the balsam trees. 15When you hear marching in the tops of the balsam trees, attack. God will have gone out ahead of you to strike their army."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> David did that, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 17His fame went out to all the countries, and Yahveh made them afraid of him. 	1 Ch 14:8-17 The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</span>
