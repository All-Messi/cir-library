## 1 Chronicles Chapter **14**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a palace. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>David saw that Yahveh had made him secure as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly regarded for Israel’s sake. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He took more wives at Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Philistines Defeated


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>When the Philistines heard they’d anointed <em>David</em> king over all Israel, they went up to look for him. He heard about it and went out against them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They’d made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>David asked God, <em>“Should I attack the Philistines?</em><em> </em><em>Will you deliver them to me?”</em><em> </em>Yahveh said, <em>“</em><em>Yes, g</em><em>o </em><em>on </em><em>up.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them. He said, <em>“God has</em><em> used me to</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>br</em><em>eak</em><em> through</em><em>’</em><em> my enemies like a flash flood”</em>; so they named the place<em> </em>Baal-perazim. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The Philistines </em>abandoned their gods there; David had them burned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>The Philistines made another raid in the valley. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>David asked God again, and he said, <em>“Don’t attack them head on.</em><em> </em><em>Circle around behind them and come at them across from the balsam trees.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>When you hear marching in the tops of the balsam trees, attack.</em><em> </em><em>God will have gone out </em><em>ahead</em><em> of you to strike their army.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>David did that, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>His fame went out to all the countries, and Yahveh made them afraid of him.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
