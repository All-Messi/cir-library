## 1 Chronicles Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Philistines attacked Israel, and they fled and fell dead on Mount Gilboa. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and struck down his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The battle grew intense against Saul, and the archers wounded him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He told his armor bearer, <em>“Draw your sword and thrust me through so these uncircumcised Philistines don’t come and </em><em>torture</em><em> me.”</em> But his armor bearer was too afraid to do it; so Saul took his sword and fell on it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When his armor bearer saw he was dead, he fell on his sword too. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So Saul’s whole dynasty died together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>When the Israelites in the valley saw they’d fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; the Philistines came and lived in them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and the people. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When Jabesh-gilead heard what they’d done to Saul, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>brave men got up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons, buried their bones under the terebinth tree in Jabesh, and fasted for a week.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>So Saul died for his trespass against Yahveh <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and <em>because he </em>inquired from a medium instead of Yahveh. He killed him and turned the kingdom over to David.<strong> </strong><strong>    </strong><strong></span>
