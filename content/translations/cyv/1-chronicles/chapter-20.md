## 1 Chronicles Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the spring, when kings go to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and overthrew it. 2Then David went to Rabbah and took the crown off their king's head, and found that it weighed 75½ lbs a talent of gold, and was set with precious stones. They placed it on David's head, and he brought out a really large amount of spoil from the city. 3He brought the people out, and cut them with saws, sharp instruments, and axes. He did that to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the people came back to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> About this time, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and they were subdued. 5There was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan Ben-Jair killed Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 6Another time there was war at Gath, where there was a huge man with six digits on each hand and foot. He had descended from the giants too. 7When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David's brother Shimea, killed him. 8Those three descended from the giants in Gath that David and his warriors killed. 	1 Ch 20:1-8 David's Ill-Advised Census</span>
