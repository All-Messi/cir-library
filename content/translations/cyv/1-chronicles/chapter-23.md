<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Those were Levi's descendants by heads of families as counted in their census. They served in Yahveh's Temple from 20 years old and up. 25David said, "Yahveh God of Israel has given his people rest, and he lives in Jerusalem permanently. 26The Levites won't need to carry the Tabernacle and the utensils for its service." 27By David's last words, Levi's descendants were counted from 20 years old and up. 28They were to assist Aaron's descendants with the service in the courts and rooms in Yahveh's Temple. They were to purify the holy things 29and help with the showbread, the fine flour for grain offerings, wafers without yeast, what's baked in the pan, or what's well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size. 30They were to stand each morning and evening to thank and praise Yahveh. 31They offered burnt offerings on Sabbaths, new moons, and scheduled festivals in the number set by the Law. 32They maintained the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place and helped Aaron's descendants with the service in Yahveh's house. 			1 Ch 23:24-32 Duties of Priests</span>
