## Song of Solomon Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In bed night after night I sought the one I love; I looked for him but didn't find him. 2'I need to get up and look around the city; in the streets and squares I have to find the one I love.' I looked for him, but didn't find him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The watchmen that make their rounds in the city met me; I said, 'Have you seen the one I love?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I had just left them when I found him. I held onto him and wouldn't let him go, till I'd brought him to my mother's house, to the room where she conceived me." 		S of S 3:1-4 Groom 5"I want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or hinds in the field, that you won't wake up my love till she's ready." Friends 6"What's this coming up from the countryside like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the merchant's scented powders?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> It's Solomon's portable couch, with 60 of Israel's mighty men around it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> All of them are swordsmen, expert in war; each with his sword at his side, guarding against the dangers at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> King Solomon has made an enclosed portable chair from wood in Lebanon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He made its posts out of silver, its back out of gold, its seat out of purple fabric, and its interior lovingly fitted out by the young women of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Go out, young women of Zion, and look at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day, his happy day." 		S of S 3:5-11 Groom</span>
