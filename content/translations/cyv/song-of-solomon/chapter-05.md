## Song of Solomon Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I've gathered my myrrh and spice. I've eaten my honey and honeycomb, and drunk my wine and milk. Eat, friends, and drink; drink deeply, lovers." 				S of S 5:1 Bride 2"I was asleep, but my heart was awake. A voice! my beloved is knocking. 'Open for me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one! My head is drenched with dew; my hair is damp from the night.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've taken off my dress; how can I put it on again? I've washed my feet; how can I get them dirty again?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> My beloved extended his hand through the opening, my feelings were aroused. 			S of S 5:2-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I got up to open the door for him; my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I opened for my beloved, but he'd turned away and gone! I looked for him but didn't find him; I called for him, but he didn't answer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The watchmen that make their rounds in the city met me; they struck me and hurt me; the guardsmen took my shawl.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I adjure you, young women of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, tell him I'm lovesick." 	S of S 5:5-8 Friends 9"But what kind of beloved is he, most beautiful among women? What kind of beloved is your beloved, that you adjure us that way?" 		S of S 5:9 Bride 10"My beloved is radiant and healthy, outstanding among 10,000.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> His head is like gold—pure gold; his hair is like clusters of dates, and black as a raven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk and neatly set.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices, banks of sweet-scented herbs; his lips are lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> His hands are rods of gold, set with beryl; his abdomen is carved ivory inlaid with lapis lazuli.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> His legs are alabaster pillars set on pedestals of pure gold; his appearance is like Lebanon, as choice as the cedars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> His mouth is full of sweetness; he's so desirable. That's my beloved, my friend, young women of Jerusalem." 			S of S 5:10-16 Friends</span>
