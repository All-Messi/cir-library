## Song of Solomon Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Where has your beloved gone, most beautiful among women? Where has he turned so we can help you find him?" Bride 2"He's gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and gather lilies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'm my beloved's, and my beloved's mine, the one that pastures his flock among the lilies." S of S 6:1-3 Groom 4"You're as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as awesome as an army with standards.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Turn your eyes away from me; they overpower me; your hair is like a flock of goats coming down from Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, that have come up from their washing, that have all had twins and none have miscarried.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your cheeks are like the halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> There are 60 queens and 80 concubines, and young women without number.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But my dove, my perfect one, is unique; her mother's only daughter, the pure child of the one that bore her. 	S of S 6:4-9 10"Who is this that grows like the dawn, as beautiful as the full moon, as pure as the sun, as awesome as an army with standards?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I went down to the orchard of nut trees to see the blossoms in the valley, to see if the grapevines had budded, or the pomegranates had bloomed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Before I knew it, my fancy put me in a chariot over my noble people." Friends 13"Come back, Shulammite; Come back so we can get a good look at you! 14"Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, as at the jostling between two armies?" 		S of S 6:10-14 Groom</span>
