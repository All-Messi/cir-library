## Song of Solomon Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You are so beautiful, my darling; you're so beautiful! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; your hair is like a flock of goats coming down Mount Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from their washing, that have all had twins and none have miscarried.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your lips are like a scarlet thread; your mouth is lovely; your cheeks are like the halves of a pomegranate behind your veil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your neck is like the tower of David, built with rows of stones that have 1,000 shields hanging on them, the round shields of the strong men. 		S of S 4:1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Till the evening breeze comes and shadows recede, I'll go my way to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. 7"You're so beautiful, my darling; there's not a blemish on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; leave the summit of Amana, the top of Senir and Hermon, away from the lions' dens, the mountains and their leopards. 		S of S 4:5-8</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You've made my heart beat faster, my sister, my bride; you've made it beat faster with a single glance with your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Your love is so sweet, my sister, my bride! so much better than wine; the fragrance of your oils is more pleasing than any spice!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your lips, my bride, distil nectar; honey and milk are under your tongue; the fragrance of your clothes is like the fragrance of Lebanon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a garden locked, a fountain sealed.		 S of S 4:9-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Your sprouts are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, henna with nard,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, along with the finest spices.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You're a garden spring, a well of fresh water, a stream flowing from Lebanon." 		S of S 4:13-15 Bride 16"Wake up, north wind; come, wind from the south; make my garden breathe out fragrance; let its spices carry abroad; let my beloved go to his garden, and eat its best produce!"			 S of S 4:16 Groom</span>
