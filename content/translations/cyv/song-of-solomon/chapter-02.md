## Song of Solomon Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I'm a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley." Groom 2"My darling among young women is like a lily among thorns." Bride 3"My beloved among young men is like an apricot tree in the forest. I took great delight in its shade and sat down, and its fruit tasted sweet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He has taken me to his banquet hall, and love is his banner above me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, because I'm lovesick.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let his left hand be under my head, and his right hand embrace me." 			S of S 2:1-6 Groom 7"I want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or hinds in the field, that you won't wake up my love till she's ready." Bride 8"Listen! My beloved! Look, he's coming, jumping across the mountains, leaping over the hills!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. It's standing behind our wall; looking in the windows; staring through the lattice. 			S of S 2:7-9 10"My beloved answered me, 'Get up, my darling, my beautiful one, and come along.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Winter's over; the rains have come and gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Flowers are coming out; it's time to sing; we can hear the turtledove.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Fig trees have ripened their figs; vines in blossom are giving off their scent. Get up, my darling, my beautiful one, and come along with me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> My dove, in the cleft of the rock, in the secret place by the steep path, let me see you; let me hear you; because your singing is sweet, your looks are lovely.' 				S of S 2:10-14 15"Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that are ruining the vineyards that are in bloom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> My beloved's mine, and I'm his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Till the evening breeze comes and shadows recede, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains." 		S of S 2:15-17 Bride</span>
