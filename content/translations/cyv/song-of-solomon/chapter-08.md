## Song of Solomon Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oh that you were my brother, who nursed at my mother's breasts. If I found you outdoors, I'd kiss you; and nobody would despise me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'd take you into my mother's house, who used to instruct me; I'd give you wine spiced from my pomegranates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let his left hand be under my head, and his right hand embrace me." Groom 4"I want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem; that you won't wake up my beloved till she's ready." Friends 5"Who's that coming up from the countryside, leaning on her beloved?" 				S of S 8:1-5a Groom "Under the apple tree I woke you up; that's where your mother was in labor with you, and gave birth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Put me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm. Love is as strong as death; jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; It flashes fire, a very vehement flame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Flood water can't quench love; a river won't drown it; If a man would offer all the wealth in his house for love, it would be utterly scorned." 			S of S 8:5b-7 Friends 8"We have a little sister, and she doesn't have breasts; what will we do for her when she's spoken for?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If she's a wall, we'll build a silver battlement on her; but if she's a door, we'll barricade her in with cedar boards." S of S 8:8-9 Bride 10"I was a wall, and my breasts became like towers; then I was in his eyes like a person that brings peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted it to caretakers; each one was to bring 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver for its fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> My own vineyard is at my disposal; the 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver are for you, Solomon, and 5 lbs 200 shekels are for the ones that take care of its fruit." Groom 13"You that sit in the gardens, my companions are listening for your voice— let me hear it!" Bride 14"Hurry, my beloved; be like a gazelle or young stag on the mountains of spices." 			S of S 8:10-14</span>
