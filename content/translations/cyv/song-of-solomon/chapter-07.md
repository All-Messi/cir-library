## Song of Solomon Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Your feet are so graceful in sandals, prince's daughter! The curves of your hips are like jewels, the work of an artist's hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Your navel is like a round goblet that's always full of mixed wine; your stomach is like a pile of wheat encircled by lilies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your neck is like an ivory tower; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, that overlooks Damascus. 			S of S 7:1-4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your head crowns you like Carmel, and the flowing locks of your hair are like purple threads; the king is captivated by your tresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> How beautiful and delightful you are, my love, with all your charms!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You're stately like a date palm; your breasts are like its clusters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I said, 'I'll climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit.' May your breasts be like clusters on a vine; your breath is fragrant like apples;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Your mouth is like the best wine!" 		S of S 7:5-9a Bride "It goes down smoothly for my beloved, and flows gently through the lips of people getting sleepy. 10"I'm my beloved's, and his desire is for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Come on, my beloved, let's go out in the country, and spend the night in the villages.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Let's get up early and visit the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms are opening, if the pomegranates have bloomed. Then I'll give you my love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The mandrakes have given off their fragrance; above our doors are choice fruits, new and old, that I've saved up for you, my beloved. 		S of S 7:9b-13</span>
