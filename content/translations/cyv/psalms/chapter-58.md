## Psalms Chapter 58

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Leaders, do you decree what’s right? Do you judge justly?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> No, you plot injustice in your hearts and spread violence in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The sinful go astray from the womb; they lie from the time they’re born.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They have venom like vipers, and stop up their ears like deaf cobras</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> so they don’t hear their charmers’ voices or those skilled at casting spells.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 58:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pull out their fangs, God; break the teeth out of the young lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Make them disappear like water that drains away; make their arrows shafts without points.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Make sinners be like snails that dissolve as they go along, like a miscarriage that never sees the sun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of burning briers; he’ll sweep them away with a whirlwind, whether green or on fire.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 58:6-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Good people will celebrate when they see God pay them back; he’ll wash their feet in the sinners’ blood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> People will say, “There’s surely a reward for good people; there’s certainly a God that judges on earth!”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 58:10-11</p>
