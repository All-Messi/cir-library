## Psalms Chapter 81

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sing to God your Strength; make a joyful sound to Jacob's God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Sing, beat the tambourine, pluck the lyre and harp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> At the new moons blow your ram's horn, at the full moon and on your festival days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> It's a statute for Israel, an ordinance from Jacob's God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He established it as a Testimony in Joseph when he displayed his power all over Egypt. I heard a language I didn't know, saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll take the burden off your shoulders and free you from heavy labor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You cried out in trouble, and I rescued you; I answered you while I concealed myself in a thundercloud; I tested you when you had no water at Meribah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Listen, my people, when I admonish you; Israel, if only you'll listen!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> There's to be no foreign god among you; don't worship any alien deity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'm Yahveh your God who brought you out of Egypt. Open your mouth, and I'll fill it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But my people ignored me; Israel wouldn't obey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So I let them follow their stubborn heart and go after their own devices.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> If only they'd listen! If Israel would just follow my ways,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'd quickly subdue their enemies; I'd turn my hand against their foes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'd doom forever those who hate me while pretending to obey me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I want to feed you with the finest wheat and satisfy you with wild honey from the rocky cliffs."</span>
