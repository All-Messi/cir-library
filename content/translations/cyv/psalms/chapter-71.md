<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>My enemies speak against me; they who want to kill me consult with each other, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“God has </em><em>left him.</em> <em>	</em><em>	Let’s go get</em><em> </em><em>him;</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>he doesn’t have anybody to de</em><em>fend</em><em> him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>I’ll praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God; and sing praises with a lyre, you Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>I’ll shout for joy when I sing to you; my soul that you’ve redeemed will praise you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>I’ll talk about your goodness, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>because the ones that were trying to harm me have been discredited.<strong>	</strong></span>
