## Psalms Chapter 71

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've taken refuge in you, Yahveh; don't let me be discredited.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> In your goodness, rescue me; listen to me and save me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Be my rock of refuge that I can always go to; give orders to save me because you're my rock and fortress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Rescue me from sinners, from the grasp of cruel men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You're my hope, Lord Yahveh, my confidence since I was young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> the One that took me from my mother's womb and sustained me since I was born.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Many have marveled over me because you've been my strong refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'm full of your praise and glory all the time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't set me aside in my old age or leave me as my strength begins to fail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> My enemies speak against me; they who want to kill me consult with each other,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God has left him. Let's go get him; he doesn't have anybody to defend him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> God, stay close by to help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Consume my adversaries with shame; cover their faces with dishonor that try to harm me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But I'll keep hoping and praising you on and on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll tell about your goodness and how many times you've saved me, though I can't count how often that's happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll praise the great deeds of the Lord Yahveh and tell about the goodness you alone have.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You've been teaching me since I was young; I still talk about your wonderful deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Even when I'm old and grey, don't leave me, Yahveh, till I tell this generation about your strength and future people about your power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Your goodness is as high as the sky, you that have done great things. Who is like you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You let me face troubles and distresses, but you revive me afterwards and lift me out of deep despair.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You increase your greatness toward me and comfort me once again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I'll praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God; and sing praises with a lyre, you Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I'll shout for joy when I sing to you; my soul that you've redeemed will praise you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I'll talk about your goodness, because the ones that were trying to harm me have been discredited.</span>
