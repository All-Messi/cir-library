## Psalms Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahveh, the world and those who live here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He positioned land higher than seas, more elevated than ocean currents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Who can climb his mountain and stand in his holy place?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> People with clean hands and pure hearts, who don't offer themselves up to idols or lie under oath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They'll receive a blessing from Yahveh, goodness from the God who keeps them safe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That's the way it is for those who seek him out and worship him—even the House of Jacob.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Open up, gates; open up, everlasting doors, so the glorious King can enter!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who is the glorious King? Yahveh strong and powerful, Yahveh mighty in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Ope up, gates; Open up, everlasting doors, so the glorious King can enter!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Who is the glorious King? Yahveh of Hosts, he is the glorious King.</span>
