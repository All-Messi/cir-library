## Psalms Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> People are blessed that don't take advice from the wicked or stand among sinners or sit with scoffers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> but delight in the Law of Yahveh and meditate on it day and night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They're like trees planted beside a river that bear fruit in season, whose leaves don't wither. They're successful at what they do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Sinners aren't like that: they're like chaff that wind blows away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> they won't withstand judgment or stand among the godly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh watches over the godly, but the wicked perish.</span>
