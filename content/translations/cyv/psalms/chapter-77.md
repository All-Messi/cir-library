## Psalms Chapter 77

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I raise my voice up to God; I call out loud; it rises to him so he’ll hear me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When trouble comes, I turn to Yahveh for help. All night I reach out to him, but I get no reassurance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I think about him, I’m shaken; I sigh and feel faint.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He won’t let me sleep; I’m in such distress I can’t pray.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I think about days gone by, years ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I remember singing during the night, meditating and pondering in my mind.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 77:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Will Yahveh reject me forever now? Won’t he ever be kind to me again?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Has his enduring love stopped permanently? Have his promises come to an end?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Has he forgotten to be gracious? In his anger has he withdrawn his mercy?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I said, “It’s my destiny that Yahveh has turned against me.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then I reconsider what all you’ve done, Yahveh, and recall your wonders from of old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I think about everything you do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Your way is holy; What god is as great as you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You work wonders and demonstrate your power among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You’ve rescued your people by your strength, descendants of Jacob and Joseph.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 77:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When the water faced you, God, it tremored to its depths.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Clouds poured down water; the sky thundered; your arrows flashed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You thundered in the whirlwind; lightning flashes lit up the landscape; the ground shook.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You went through the sea; your path led into deep water, but your footprints didn’t show.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 77:16-20</p>
