<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> bless him from now on forever;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> from sunrise to sunset, praise him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> On high above the nations, he displays his glory in the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Who is like Yahveh our God that sits on high, 6but humbles himself to watch what's happening in the sky and on earth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then he raises up the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash pile</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> to seat them beside the princes of his people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He gives the barren woman a home like a happy mother of children. Hallelujah!</span>
