## Psalms Chapter 108

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I'm steadfast, God; I'll sing praises in my heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre; I'll wake up at dawn!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll thank you, Yahveh, among the nations and sing praises to you everywhere,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> because your enduring love is bigger than the sky; your truth is as high as the heavens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Be lifted up, God, above the sky; display your glory the world over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Save with your power and answer me so your beloved can be delivered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> God has spoken in his holiness: "I'll gladly divide up Shechem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Gilead and Manasseh belong to me; Ephraim, my helmet; Judah, my scepter;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Moab, my washbasin; I'll wipe my feet on Edom and shout in triumph over Philistia."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Who will take me to the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Are you rejecting us, God? Aren't you going out with our armies?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Help us against our adversary because human help can't save us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Through you, we'll do mightily; you can tramp down our enemies.</span>
