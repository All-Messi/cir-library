## Psalms Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, are you going to forget about me forever? How long will you ignore me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> How long must I counsel myself in constant sorrow? How long will my enemies lord it over me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Think about me and respond to me, Yahveh my God; brighten my eyes so they don't grow dull as in death,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> so my enemies won't brag about defeating me and celebrate over my downfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I rely on your enduring love; I'm happy because you've delivered me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll sing to you, Yahveh, because you've blessed me wonderfully.</span>
