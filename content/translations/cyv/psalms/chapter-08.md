## Psalms Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, our Lord, you're so majestic all over the world! You display your splendor higher than the sky!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you've established a defensive wall against your adversaries, to silence enemies that want revenge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I look at the sky, the work of your fingers, the moon and stars you've set in place,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> what are we that you give us any thought or care about us?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You've made us a little lower than the angels and crowned us with glory and honor!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You've given us responsibility over what you've made and put it under our control:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> sheep and oxen, wild animals in the countryside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> birds in the sky, fish in the sea, whatever swims through the ocean.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh, our Lord, you're so majestic all over the world!</span>
