## Psalms Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh is my light and salvation; who am I going to be afraid of? He defends me; who am I going to dread?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When bad people come to devour me, they stumble and fall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Though an army attacks me, it won’t frighten me; though war breaks out against me, I’ll stay confident.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 27:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I ask Yahveh for one thing—what I look for most: to live in his house my whole life, to see his beauty and meditate in his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When trouble comes, he’ll shelter me; he’ll hide me in a secret place and station me on a high rock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I’ll hold up my head above my enemies; in his Tabernacle I’ll offer sacrifices with shouts of joy and sing praises to Yahveh.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 27:4-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Listen when I call out, Yahveh; be gracious and answer me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You said, “Seek me,” my heart and soul responded, “I’ll seek you.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don’t ignore me or turn away angry. You’ve been my help; don’t abandon me, God my Savior.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Even if my parents exposed me I as an infant to die, you would pick me up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 27:7-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahveh; lead me on a level path away from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Don’t turn me over to them, because lying witnesses have taken the stand against me, the kind that threatens violence with every breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I’d have despaired if I hadn’t believed I’d see Yahveh’s goodness while I was alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So wait for him; be strong and courageous. Yes, wait for him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 27:11-14</p>
