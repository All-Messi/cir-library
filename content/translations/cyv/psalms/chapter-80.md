## Psalms Chapter 80

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen, Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; show your glory, you that are enthroned above the cherubs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Stir up your power against Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh; and come to rescue us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Restore us, God; look at us with favor so we'll be saved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh God of Hosts, how long will you be angry with our prayers?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You've fed us tears and made us drink them in full measure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You made us a taunt to our neighbors; they laugh at us among themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> God of Hosts, restore us; look at us with favor so we'll be saved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You took a grapevine out of Egypt, drove out the Canaanite nations, and planted it in their land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and spread across the whole land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> It covered the mountains with its shadow and God's cedars with its branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> It grew its branches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea, its shoots as far as the Euphrates River.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Why did you tear down its walls so everybody that goes by can pick its fruit?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A boar from the woods roots it up; whatever moves in the countryside feeds on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God of Hosts, please come back now; look down from heaven and take care of this grapevine,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> the root you planted, the son you've raised for your use.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Our enemies have cut it down and burned it; may they perish at the rebuke from your angry look.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Encourage the man at your right hand, the son you made strong for yourself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then we won't turn away from you anymore; revive us so we can call on you again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh God of Hosts, restore us; look at us with favor so we'll be saved.</span>
