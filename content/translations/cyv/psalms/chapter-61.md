<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You're my refuge, my strong tower against the enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Let me live in your tent forever and take shelter under your wings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You've heard my vows, God, and given me the inheritance that comes to those who respect you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Have him sit enthroned in your presence forever; appoint enduring love and truth to preserve him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll sing praise to you forever as I pay my vows each day.</span>
