## Psalms Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><em>my fortress, my deliverer,</em> <em>	my God, my </em><em>R</em><em>ock, </em><em>my</em><em> </em><em>R</em><em>efuge;</em> <em>	my shield, the </em><em>place</em><em> that saves me, my stronghold</em>.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>I called on him who deserves praise, and he saved me from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>The waves of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction flooded over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>the cords of Sheol tied me down; the snares of death had entrapped me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>In my desperation, I cried out to Yahveh, and he heard me in his Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook because he was angry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Smoke poured out of his nostrils; consuming fire flared from his mouth; glowing coals erupted from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He lowered the sky too <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and came down with dense darkness under his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>He rode on a cherub and came flying swiftly on the wings of the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>with dark rain clouds veiling<em> his </em><em>advance</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>and hiding the brightness around him, while hailstones and lightning bolts broke through his clouds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Yahveh thundered from the sky; the Most High raised his voice; hailstones and lightning bolts resounded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He shot his arrows and scattered <em>my enemies</em>; lightning flashes routed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Then the water in the ocean receded; the seabed was exposed at his rebuke, at the blast from his nostrils.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>He reached down from on high and grabbed me and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He delivered me from enemies that hated me, that were too strong for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They attacked me at a time of distress, but Yahveh was my buttress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>He brought me out to a safe place and rescued me because he delighted in me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong> rewarded me </strong><strong>for</strong><strong> my goodness</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>for my innocence</strong>;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>I’d kept his ways <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and hadn’t sinned by leaving him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>his ordinances all stayed with me; I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>I stood blameless in his presence because I’d kept myself from sinning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>So <strong>Yahveh</strong><strong> rewarded me </strong><strong>for</strong><strong> my goodness,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>for my innocence</strong>.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:16-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>To the kind you’re kind; with the blameless you’re blameless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>with the pure you’re pure; with the treacherous you’re shrewd.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>You rescue the humble but bring down the haughty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>You’re my lamp, Yahveh my God, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and shine light into my darkness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>With your help, I can crush a whole battalion I can scale any wall.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:25-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>God’s way is perfect; Yahveh’s promise proves true; he’s a shield for everyone that depends on his protection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Who is God except Yahveh? <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>Who is a rock but our God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>who wraps me in strength and makes my way safe?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves and stands me securely on high ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>He trains my hands for battle and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>He’s given me his deliverance as a shield; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>his help has made me great.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>He’s widened the path where I step so my feet don’t slip.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:30-36</p>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>I chased my enemies and overtook them; I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again; they fell under my feet</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>because you wrapped me in strength for battle <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and subdued my assailants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>You’ve made my enemies retreat; I destroyed the ones that hated me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any; they even cried out to Yahveh, but he didn’t answer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>I pulverized them like dust in the wind, emptied them out like dirt on the street.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>You delivered me from conflict with the people and placed me at the head of nations; people I didn’t know now serve me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>they lose heart and come cringing out of their fortresses.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 18:</p>

### 37-45


<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>Yahveh lives; praise be to my Rock; exalted be God that delivers me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>that avenges me, that subdues nations under me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>that rescues me from my enemies, lifts me above my attackers, and delivers me from violent people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>So I’ll thank you among the nations, Yahveh, and sing your praises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>You give victory for your king and show enduring love to your anointed one, to me [David] and my descendants forever.</span>
