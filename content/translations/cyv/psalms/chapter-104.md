## Psalms Chapter **104**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Bless </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>everything that I am</strong><strong>!</strong> Yahveh my God, you’re so great; you’re dressed in splendor and majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>You cover yourself with light as with a robe; you’ve stretched out the sky like a tent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>You laid the beams for your rooms on the water; you make the clouds your chariot and walk on the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>You make the winds your messengers and blazing fire your ministers.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>You built the earth on foundations so it would never shift.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>You covered it with the ocean like a robe deeper than the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>At your rebuke it receded; at the sound of your thunder, it withdrew.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>The mountains rose up; the valleys sank down to the level you determined for them to have.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>You set a boundary <em>the water</em> couldn’t cross so it wouldn’t flow back over the earth again.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:5-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>You make springs in the valleys so creeks flow between the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>They water the animals in the countryside and quench the thirst of wild donkeys.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Birds live beside them and chirp in the trees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>You water the mountains from your home above; your work provides for the earth.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:10-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>You make grass grow for the livestock and crops from people’s labor so they could produce food from the ground</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>and wine to cheer them up, so they could make their faces shine with oil and grow food to sustain them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Yahveh’s trees drink their fill, Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>where birds build their nests and storks make roosts in fir trees.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>High mountains are for wild goats, and rocks provide cover for badgers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>You made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows where to set.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>You send darkness, and it becomes night; wild animals prowl around in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>When the sun comes up, they go back and lie down in their dens,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>and people go out to work till evening.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:18-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Yahveh, how many things you’ve done! you’ve done them all with wisdom and filled the earth with your creations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Yonder is the ocean, big and wide; it teems with schools of fish without number, marine life large and small.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Ships move along on it, Leviathan too, which you formed to play in it.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:24-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>They all depend on you to feed them when it’s time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>You give them food, and they gather it; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>you open your hand and satisfy them with good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>If you hide, they’re scared; you take away their breath, and they die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>You send out your breath, and they’re created; you renew the surface of the ground.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 104:27-30</p>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Let Yahveh’s honor endure forever; let him delight in things he’s made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>The world trembles at his look; the mountains smoke at his touch.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>I’ll sing to Yahveh as long as I live; I’ll sing praise to my God as long as I’m here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>May my meditations please him; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>I’ll be happy in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>Let sinners vanish from the earth; let the wicked cease to exist. <strong>Bless </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> everything that I am</strong><strong>!</strong> <strong>Hallelujah!</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
