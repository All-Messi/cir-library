## Psalms Chapter 84

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Your Temple is so beautiful, Yahveh of Hosts!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I long, yes, even faint with longing for your courts; my body and soul sing for joy to the living God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Even a sparrow finds a home for herself, a swallow builds a nest to raise her young near your altars, Yahveh of Hosts, my God and King.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How blessed they are who live in your Temple and continually sing your praises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> How blessed people are whose strength comes from you, who've resolved to make pilgrimages to Zion!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> As they pass through the Valley of Weeping, they turn it into a spring; autumn rains cover it with blessings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They grow from strength to more strength till each one appears before God in Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh God of hosts, listen to my prayer; listen to me, God of Jacob!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Extend your favor to the shield you anointed over us,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> because one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I'd rather stand at the threshold of your Temple than live at ease in the tents of sinners,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> because Yahveh is sun and shield, who gives grace and honor and doesn't withhold anything good from those who do what's right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh of hosts, how blessed they are who trust in you!</span>
