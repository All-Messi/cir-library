## Psalms Chapter 52

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God's enduring love lasts all day; so why brag about sinning, great soldier?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Your tongue cuts like a razor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You like evil more than good, falsehood more than truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You like words that devour and a lying tongue that deceives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But God will strike you down once and for all; he'll pull you out of your tent and uproot you from the land of the living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Good people will see it and be amazed; they'll laugh at you and say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Look at the men that wouldn't take refuge in God, but trusted in their great wealth and used their strength to destroy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But I'm like a green olive tree in God's house; I'll always trust in his enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll be eternally grateful for what he's done, and depend on him in front of his holy people because that's good.</span>
