## Psalms Chapter 129

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let Israel say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They've persecuted me often since I was young, but they haven't defeated me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My back looks like a farmer plowed it and made long furrows."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh is good; he has cut loose from me the cords of the wicked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> May everyone that hates Zion be driven away and discredited.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let them be like grass on a rooftop that withers before it's grown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The reaper doesn't fill his hand with it, or the bundler fill his arms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People that go past don't say, "Yahveh bless you; we bless you in his name."</span>
