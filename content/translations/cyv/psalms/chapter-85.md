## Psalms Chapter 85

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, you blessed your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> you forgave your people's iniquity and pardoned their sins;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> you withdrew your fury and turned away from your hot anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Restore us, our Deliverer; end your displeasure with us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever? Will you extend your wrath to every generation?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Won't you revive us so we can celebrate over you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Show us your enduring love, Yahveh; grant us your salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'll listen to what our God Yahveh says, because he offers peace to his holy people, those who avoid foolish behavior.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> His salvation is nearby for those who respect him, so there can be honor in our land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Truth and enduring love combine; goodness and peace kiss each other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Faithfulness grows up from the ground, and goodness looks down from the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh gives what's good so our land can yield its produce.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Goodness goes ahead of him and makes his footprints into a path.</span>
