<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Deliver me, God, by your name; vindicate me by your power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen to my prayer; hear what I have to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Foreigners have attacked me; violent people have tried to kill me; they don't care about you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But God helps me; Yahveh sustains my life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He pays back my adversaries and destroys them in his faithfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll sacrifice to him willingly and thank him because he's good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He's delivered me from all my trouble so I could triumph over my enemies.</span>
