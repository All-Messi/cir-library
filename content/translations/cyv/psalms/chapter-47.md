<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Clap your hands, everybody; shout to God with joy;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He subdued people groups under us, put nations beneath our feet,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> and chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob that he loves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God has ascended with a shout, with a trumpet fanfare.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The rulers of the people have gathered together with the people of Abraham's God; because the shields of the earth belong to him; he's highly honored.</span>
