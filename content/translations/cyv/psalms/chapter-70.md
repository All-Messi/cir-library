## Psalms Chapter 70

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hurry and deliver me, Yahveh; come quick to help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Discredit those who want to kill me; turn them back and dishonor the people that delight in harming me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Because of their disgrace, turn them back those who say, "Aha, Aha."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> May the ones that depend on you be happy in you; may those who love your deliverance repeatedly say, "God is great."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But I'm poor and needy, Yahveh! you're my deliverer; don't delay.</span>
