## Psalms Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Declare me innocent, Yahveh, because I've conducted myself with integrity and trusted in you without wavering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Examine me, put me on trial, test my motives and attitude.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I keep my eye on your unfailing love and follow you faithfully.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I don't sit with deceitful people or run around with pretenders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I detest the company of unreliable people and refuse to join in with sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll wash my hands to express my innocence and frequent your altar, Yahveh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> singing my gratitude and telling about the wonderful things you've done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh, I love the Temple where you live, the place where your glory lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't carry off my soul with sinners, or my life with bloodthirsty people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> that devise sinful schemes and hand out bribes left and right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But I maintain my integrity; redeem me with your grace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> My foot stands on solid ground; I'll bless you publicly.</span>
