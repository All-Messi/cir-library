## Psalms Chapter 57

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be gracious to me, God, because I depend on you to protect me; in the shadow of your wings I take refuge till danger passes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I call out to God Most High, who accomplishes everything for me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> he sends help from heaven to rescue me and discredits whoever tries to run over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I live among lions; I have to lie among those who breathe fire, people whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Be raised up higher than the sky, God; shine your glory on the whole world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They've set a trap for me to step in; they've dug a pit for me—I'm weary from stress— but they've fallen into it themselves!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> My heart is steadfast, God; it's steadfast; I'll sing; yes, I'll sing praises!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Wake up, my glory; wake up, harp and lyre; I'll wake up the dawn with my songs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll give you thanks, God, among the peoples and sing praises to you among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Your enduring love is as high as the sky; your truth reaches up to the clouds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Be raised up higher than the sky, God; shine your glory on the whole world.</span>
