## Psalms Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, who can live in your Tabernacle? Who can reside on your holy hill?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Those who act with integrity, who do what's right and tell the truth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> who don't mistreat their neighbors or join in gossiping about their friends;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> who despise reprobates, but honor people that respect Yahveh, who even swear to their own disadvantage and carry it through,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> that don't charge interest or accept bribes against innocent people. People like that will always be secure.</span>
