## Psalms Chapter 139

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, you’ve known me and examined me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You know when I sit down and when I get up; from a long way off you know what I’m thinking.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You search out my traveling and my resting; you’re well acquainted with my ways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Before I speak, you know what I’m going to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You’ve protected me front and back and laid your hand over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Knowledge like that is too amazing for me; it’s beyond me; I can’t imagine it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 139:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I go to get away from you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If I go up to the sky, you’re there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you’re there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If I take the wings of morning and live by the most distant part of the ocean,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> even there you’ll lead me and support me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If I say, “Let darkness cover me, and the light around me become night,”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> the dark’s not dark to you; the night’s as bright as day.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 139:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You formed my inner parts and knit me together in my mother’s womb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Thank you; the way you’ve made me is awesome and wonderful. What you do is marvelous; I know that for sure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My frame wasn’t hidden from you when I was being made in secret, intricately put together deep in the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You saw my unshaped substance; you wrote in your scroll the length of life you appointed for me before there was any of it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 139:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> How precious your thoughts are to me! How vast their number is!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> If I could count them, they’d outnumber the grains of sand. When I wake up, I’m still with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Oh that you’d slay the sinful, God. (Go away from me, you murderers!)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Your enemies say awful things about you; they use your name as a byword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Don’t I hate those who hate you? Don’t I despise the ones that oppose you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I have total disdain for them; they’re my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Examine me, God, and know my heart; test me and see how anxious my thoughts are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> See if there’s anything offensive in me and lead me in the everlasting way.</span>
