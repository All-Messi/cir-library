## Psalms Chapter 63

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God, you're my God; I look to you in earnest; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh yearns for you in this dry, weary land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> So I've looked at you in the sanctuary and seen your power and glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll praise you because your enduring love is better than life;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll bless you as long as I live and lift up my hands in your name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You satisfy my soul like the finest food; I offer praises gladly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I remember you when I'm in bed; I think about you during the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You've been my help; I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But those who are trying to destroy me will end up in the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The sword will overwhelm them; they'll become prey for foxes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But the king will celebrate in God; everybody that swears by him will glory while liars' mouths will be stopped.</span>
