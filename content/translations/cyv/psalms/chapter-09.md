## Psalms Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I’ll thank you, Yahveh, with all my heart and call attention to the amazing things you’ve done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’ll gladly celebrate over you and sing your praise, Most High.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When my enemies retreated, they staggered and died in front of you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> because you judged in my favor; you sat on your throne and judged justly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You’ve rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked, and blotted out their names forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your enemies have ended up in permanent ruins; you’ve uprooted their towns; the very memory of them is gone.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 9:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But Yahveh reigns as king forever, rendering judgment from his throne.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He judges the world justly, delivers verdicts evenhandedly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> a stronghold for oppressed people, a fortress in troubled times,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> trusted by those who know him because he doesn’t abandon the ones who depend on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Sing praises to Yahveh that lives in Zion; tell what all he’s done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He that avenges murder remembers the helpless; he doesn’t forget the cries of those who suffer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Be gracious to me, Yahveh; look at how those who hate me treat me. Lift me up from death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> so I can publicly praise you and celebrate in Zion’s gates over your deliverance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The nations fall into the pit they dig and catch their feet in the net they hide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh makes himself known for carrying out judgment. Sinners snare themselves in their own traps.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 9:11-16</p>

### [Higgaion]


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The sinful go down to Sheol; so does every nation that forgets God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Needy people won’t be overlooked forever; the hopes of the depressed won’t perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t let people prevail, Yahveh; judge the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Put them in fear; remind them that they’re mere mortals.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 9:17-20</p>
