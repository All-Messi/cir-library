<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, I've cried out to you from the depths;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> be attentive to my petitions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If you kept track of sins, who could stand?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But you forgive so people can continue to respect you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I wait for Yahveh and put my hope in what he says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I wait for the Lord more than watchmen hope for morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Israel, put your hope in Yahveh because there's enduring love and abundant redemption in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He'll redeem Israel from its sins.</span>
