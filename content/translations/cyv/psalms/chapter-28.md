## Psalms Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I'm calling out to you, Yahveh; don't turn a deaf ear, my Rock; otherwise, I'll be like someone going down to the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Help me when I plead for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Don't drag me away with the wicked, with those who sin, who offer their neighbors peace while selfish motives lurk in their hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Pay them back according to their deeds, in proportion to the sin they practice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Since they don't appreciate what you've made and done, tear them down and don't rebuild them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Bless Yahveh for listening to my petition.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He's my strength and shield; I trust him and he helps me; so I celebrate and thank him with songs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He's his people's strength, the saving defense for his anointed ones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</span>
