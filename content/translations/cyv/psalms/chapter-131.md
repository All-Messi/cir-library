## Psalms Chapter 131

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, my heart's not proud or my eyes arrogant; I don't insert myself into things I can't handle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I've calmed and quieted myself; like a weaned child resting against its mother, my soul is quiet within me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Israel, put your hope in Yahveh from now on forever.</span>
