## Psalms Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Help, Yahveh; there aren't any decent people left; the faithful are disappearing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Neighbors lie to one another and speak with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> May Yahveh cut off their flattering lips and bragging tongues 4that say "We can talk our way out of anything; they're our lips; who's going to stop us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh says, "Since the oppressed are suffering violence and the needy groan, I'll come to give them the protection they long for."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your promises are pure, Yahveh, like silver refined in a furnace seven times.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Keep us; protect us from this generation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> that struts around, displaying its contempt.</span>
