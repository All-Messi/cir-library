## Psalms Chapter 49

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hear this, every nation; listen, everyone on earth,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> low and high, rich and poor alike.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My words are wise; my thoughts are full of insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I listen to proverbs and expound my riddles on a harp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Why should I be afraid when there’s adversity, when my enemies’ sins are all around me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> people who trust in their wealth and brag about how rich they are?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Nobody can use wealth to redeem a brother from death or pay God a ransom for him—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> redeeming a life is too expensive; you may as well forget about</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> living on forever and not seeing the Pit.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 49:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Even the wise die— just like the ignorant and senseless— and leave their wealth to others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They act like their houses will last forever, like where they live will be there for all generations; so they name their lands after themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But in all their pomp, they won’t endure; they’ll perish like animals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> This is the fate of the foolish and those who agree with them:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> like sheep they’re appointed to Sheol; death will be their shepherd. The godly will rule them in the morning; Sheol will consume their form far from their stately homes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But God will redeem me from its power and take me to himself.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 49:10-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Don’t be afraid when people get rich, when their houses appreciate in value;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> because when they die, they won’t take anything with them; what they gloried in won’t go down with them to the grave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Though they congratulate themselves while they’re alive, though other people praise them for being successful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> they’ll go to their ancestors and never see the light of day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> People in all their pomp who don’t have intelligence amount to being like animals when they die.</span>
