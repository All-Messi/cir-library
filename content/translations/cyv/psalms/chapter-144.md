## Psalms Chapter 144

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bless Yahveh, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He's my enduring love and fortress, my stronghold and deliverer, my shield and refuge, who subdues nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh, what are we that you give us any thought or care about us?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We're like a breath; our lifetime is like a passing shadow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Lower the sky, Yahveh, and come down; touch the mountains and make them smoke.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Throw your lightning bolts and scatter my enemies; shoot your arrows and rout them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Reach down from on high and rescue me from deep water, from aliens 8that lie, whose right hand deceives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll sing you a new song, God; I'll sing praise to you on a ten-string harp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You deliver kings and rescued David from the cruel sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Deliver me from aliens that lie, whose right hand deceives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Make our sons in their youth like grown-up plants and our daughters like corner pillars in a palace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Fill our granaries with every kind of crop; have our flocks bear thousands—tens of thousands—in our pastures.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Have our cattle deliver without miscarriage or failure to bear; make it so there's no danger in our streets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> How happy people are that have such blessings; how blessed they are that have Yahveh as their God!</span>
