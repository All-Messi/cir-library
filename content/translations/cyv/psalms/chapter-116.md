<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I love Yahveh because he listens to my petitions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> so I'll call on him as long as I live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The snares of death were all around me; the pains of Sheol came on me; I suffered distress and sorrow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then I called on Yahveh, "Please save me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> YouY are gracious and good, merciful God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You preserve the simple; when I was brought low, you saved me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I can rest again because you've been good to me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> you've saved me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll walk with you in the land of the living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I kept believing even when I said, "I'm greatly oppressed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I said in my anxiety, "Everybody's lying to me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> How can I repay you, Yahveh, for all your benefits?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll lift up the cup of salvation and call on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll fulfill my vows to you in the presence of your people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You care about your holy people when they die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh, I'm your servant, the son of your maidservant; you've removed my shackles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice and call on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll fulfill my vows to you in the presence of your people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> in the courts of your Temple in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!</span>
