## Psalms Chapter 143

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hear my prayer, Yahveh; listen to my petition; in your faithfulness and goodness, come to my relief.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Don't put me on trial because, compared to you, nobody's good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My enemy has chased me, crushed me on the ground, and made me sit in the dark like people long dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So I feel overwhelmed, and my heart is empty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I remember the old days; I ponder everything you've done and think about what you've made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I reach out for you, thirsty for you like parched ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Answer me right away, Yahveh; my spirit is failing; don't hide from me, or I'll get like those destined for the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Let me hear about your enduring love every morning because I put my trust in you; show me where to walk because I'm lifting myself up to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Deliver me from my enemies; you're my refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Teach me how to do your will because you're my God; let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> In defense of your honor, Yahveh, protect me; in your goodness, take me away from trouble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> in your enduring love, slay my enemies; destroy the ones that abuse me, because I'm your servant.</span>
