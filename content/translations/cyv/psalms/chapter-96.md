<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tell about his glory the world over, his marvelous deeds among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh is great and deserves great praise; he's to be respected more than all gods</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> because the nations' gods are idols, but Yahveh created the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Say among the nations, "Yahveh reigns; yes, the world is firmly set; it won't move; he'll judge the nations fairly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let the heavens be happy and the earth rejoice; let the ocean roar and everything that's in it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> let the fields celebrate and all that grows there; then the trees in the forest will sing 13to Yahveh because he'll judge the world with justice and its people with truth.</span>
