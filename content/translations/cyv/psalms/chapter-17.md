## Psalms Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, listen to my call for justice; pay attention to my sincere prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Declare me innocent because you see that I’m righteous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You’ve visited me at night and tested my heart; you’ve put me on trial and found nothing wrong; I’m determined not to say anything sinful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your word has kept me from following the example of cruel people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My steps have stayed on your path; my feet haven’t slipped.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 17:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I’m calling on you, God, because you answer me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Demonstrate your amazing, enduring love for the ones that take refuge in you from people that rebel against you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Keep me as the pupil of your eye; hide me under your wings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> from sinners who plunder, from deadly enemies that surround me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> that have no mercy in their hearts, and brag arrogantly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They’ve tracked me down and surrounded me, and threaten to knock me to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They’re like lions eager to maul me, like young lions lurking in ambush.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 17:6-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Confront them, Yahveh; knock them down; deliver me from sinners with the sword</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> that’s in your hand, from people who’ve cast their lot in this life, whose stomach you fill with your treasure. They’re satisfied with having children and leaving their wealth to their babies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But because I’m righteous, I’ll be satisfied by seeing you when I wake up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 17:13-15</p>
