### Set to The Hind of the Dawn

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, so far from my groaning?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I call out in the daytime, but you don’t answer; I don’t get any relief at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yet you’re holy, enthroned on Israel’s praises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They called out to you, and you saved them; they relied on you, and you didn’t disappoint them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But I’m a worm, not a man; people scorn me and despise me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Everybody that sees me makes fun of me; they make faces at me and shake their heads at me and say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Entrust yourself to Yahveh; let him deliver you; let him rescue you because he delights in you!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet you’re the One that delivered me from the womb and made me trust when I was on my mother’s breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I’ve depended on you from birth; you’ve been my God from my mother’s womb.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:6-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Don’t be distant because trouble’s near; there’s nobody else to help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded me; fierce bulls from Bashan have gathered around me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They bellow at me like ravening, roaring lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I’m being poured out like water; all my bones are out of joint; my heart’s melting like wax.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My strength has dried up like a potsherd, my tongue is sticking to my jaws, and you’ve laid me down dead in the dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Dogs have surrounded me; an crowd has ganged up on me; they’ve pierced my hands and feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I can count all my bones; people are staring at me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> they’re dividing up my clothes and gambling for my garments.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:11-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t be distant, Yahveh; you’re my only help; hurry and help me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Deliver me from the sword; rescue me from the dog’s paws;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> save me from the lion’s mouth and the wild ox’s horns.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:19-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I’ll tell my brothers about you and praise you when your people gather.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You that respect Yahveh, praise him; stand in awe of him, descendants of Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> because he hasn’t looked down on the oppressed or ignored them; when they’ve appealed to him for help, he’s listened.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:22-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The theme of my praise in the great assembly comes from you; I’ll fulfill my vows in front of people that respect you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The poverty-stricken will eat and be satisfied; those who rely on Yahveh will praise him. May their hearts live forever!</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 22:25-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The most distant places will remember and turn to Yahveh; all the families in the nations will worship him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> because the kingdom belongs to him; he rules the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Prosperous people will eat and worship; everyone that goes down to dust will bow to him, all those who can’t keep themselves alive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Posterity will serve him; one generation will tell the next one about him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> To people not yet born, they’ll come to declare his goodness, that he’s the One that’s done all of this.</span>
