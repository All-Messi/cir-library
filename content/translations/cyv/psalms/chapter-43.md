## Psalms Chapter 43

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Declare me innocent, God; defend me against this ungodly nation; deliver me from liars!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You're the God that I rely on for courage; why reject me? Why do I go around mourning because my enemies oppress me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Send your light and truth to lead me, to bring me to the holy hill where you live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then I can go to your altar, my greatest source of joy, and praise you with a harp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Why despair, my soul? Why be disturbed? Put your hope in God because I'll still praise him, my helper and my God.</span>
