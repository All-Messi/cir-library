## Psalms Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh is great and deserves great praise in the city of our God on his holy mountain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon, is high and beautiful— the joy of the whole earth, the city of the great King.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> In its towers God reveals himself as a strong defense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Kings joined forces and advanced against that strong defense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But as soon as it came into view, they panicked and fled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Panic seized them like the anguish of a woman in childbirth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yahveh destroyed them like ships of Tarshish capsized by an east wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> As we've heard, so we've seen in the city of Yahveh of Hosts, our God; he'll make it safe forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In your Temple we think about your enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Like your name, God, your praise is everywhere; your right hand is filled with goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let Mount Zion be happy, and the residents of Judah celebrate your goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Walk around Zion and count its towers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> inspect its ramparts and tour its fortresses so you can tell the next generation;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> because God is God forever; he'll guide us till we die.</span>
