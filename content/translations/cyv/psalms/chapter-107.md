<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Let his redeemed say it, the ones he rescued from their adversaries</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> and gathered from other countries east and west, north and south.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Some wandered in trackless desert and couldn’t find their way to any inhabited city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted inside them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble, and he delivered them from it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> he led them straight to a city they could live in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love and his awesome acts for his people!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:4-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow, prisoners suffering in iron shackles,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> because they’d rebelled against what God said and spurned the advice of the Most High.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So he humbled them with labor; they stumbled and nobody was there to help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble, and he delivered them from it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow and broke their chains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love and his awesome acts for his people!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> because he shattered bronze gates and cut iron bars in two.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:10-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Some were fools and suffered because they rebelled and sinned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The very sight of food was repulsive to them; they came close to dying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble, and he delivered them from distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He sent his message to heal them and delivered them from destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love and his wonderful acts for his people!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and tell about his deeds with joyful singing.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:17-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Some went down to ships by the sea and did business on the ocean;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> they, too, have seen what Yahveh can do, his powerful acts on the great deep.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He spoke and a storm arose that whipped up the waves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> waves that swelled up toward the sky and crashed down to the depths; sailors’ courage melted away in their terror.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They reeled and staggered like drunks; they were at their wits’ end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then they appealed to Yahveh in their trouble, and he delivered them from distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then they were happy because they had quiet; so he guided them to the port they desired.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They need to thank him for his enduring love and his wonderful acts for his people!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Let them extol him in front of the community and praise him at the elders’ seats.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:23-32</p>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He transforms rivers into desert, springs into thirsty ground,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> productive land into a salt waste because sinful people live there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But he transforms a desert into a sea, dry land into springs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> He enables hungry people to live there and build a city,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> sow fields, plant vineyards, and gather a big harvest.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 107:33-37</p>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He blesses them and they multiply; he keeps the number of their livestock from decreasing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When they’re decreased and brought low through oppression, misery, and sorrow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> he pours contempt on their rulers and makes them wander in trackless wasteland.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity and makes their families like a flock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The godly see it and are happy, but bad people don’t have anything they can say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Who is wise? Pay attention to these things and think about Yahveh’s’s enduring love.</span>
