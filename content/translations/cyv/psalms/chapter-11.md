## Psalms Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I rely on Yahveh's protection; so why tell me, "Flee like a bird to the mountains</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> because the ungodly are bending the bow; they're putting their arrow to the string to shoot from the shadows at the godly in heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If the foundations of society collapse, what can good people do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh is in his holy Temple; he rules from heaven, watching everyone, examining each one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He tests the good and the bad and hates the ones that love violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He'll rain burning coals on sinners; he'll punish them with fire, sulfur, and scorching wind</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> because he's good and loves goodness. Good people get to meet him face to face.</span>
