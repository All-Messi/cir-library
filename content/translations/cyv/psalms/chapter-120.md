## Psalms Chapter 120

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In my troubles I appealed to Yahveh, and he answered me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh, rescue me from lying lips and treacherous tongues.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What will God do to you, treacherous tongues? How will he intensify your punishment?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He'll pierce you with a soldier's sharp arrows and burn you with coals from a broom tree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Misfortune awaits me because I'm a foreigner in Meshech, because I live among the tents of Kedar!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> For too long I've lived where people hate peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'm for peace; but when I speak up, they're for war.</span>
