## Psalms Chapter **109**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>God that I praise, speak up for me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Deceitful people speak against me; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they slander me with lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>They surround me with hateful words and fight me for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>In return for my love, they accuse me even when I’m praying for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>They repay me evil for good, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>hatred for love.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Appoint someone corrupt over them, an accuser to stand beside them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>When they’re judged, pronounce them guilty; count even their prayers as acts of sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Shorten their lives and give someone else their position of oversight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Make their children fatherless and their wives widows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Have their children go begging, looking for food far from their ruined homes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Have their creditors seize everything they own <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and foreigners plunder what they’d labored to produce.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>May no one extend enduring love to them <strong><sup>	</sup></strong> or be gracious to their fatherless children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Cut off their posterity; erase their names from the next generation.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:6-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Yahveh, remember their fathers’ sins and not blot out their mothers’ transgressions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>always keep them in mind; Have people forget they ever lived,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>because they didn’t show enduring love; they persecuted poor, needy people, and murdered the despondent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>They loved to curse; put curses on them! <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they didn’t like to bless; don’t bless them!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They cover themselves with cursing like clothes; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>it soaks into their bodies like water, down to the bone like oil!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Put it on them like a robe they have to wear all the time, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>like a belt they always have on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Make such things Yahveh’s reward to accusers that claim bad things about me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:14-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>But Yahveh God, deal graciously with me <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>because your enduring love is good; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>deliver me <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>because I’m poor and needy and wounded in my heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>I’m passing on like a lengthening shadow; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>I’m brushed off like a locust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>My knees are weak from fasting; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>I’m skin and bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>I’m someone people scorn; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>they just shake their heads at the sight of me.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:21-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Help me, Yahveh my God; in your enduring love, save me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Show them this is your doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Let them curse, but you bless; when they attack me, humiliate them, and I’ll be happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Dress those accusers in dishonor; cover them with their humiliation like a cloak.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:26-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>I’ll praise Yahveh repeatedly; I’ll praise him in front of everyone,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>because he stands by the needy to save them from those who condemn them to death.</span>
