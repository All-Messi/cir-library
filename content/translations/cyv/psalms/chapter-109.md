<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God that I praise, speak up for me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Deceitful people speak against me; they slander me with lies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They surround me with hateful words and fight me for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In return for my love, they accuse me even when I’m praying for them.</span>

<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Appoint someone corrupt over them, an accuser to stand beside them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When they’re judged, pronounce them guilty; count even their prayers as acts of sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Shorten their lives and give someone else their position of oversight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Make their children fatherless and their wives widows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Have their children go begging, looking for food far from their ruined homes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Have their creditors seize everything they own and foreigners plunder what they’d labored to produce.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> May no one extend enduring love to them or be gracious to their fatherless children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Cut off their posterity; erase their names from the next generation.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:6-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh, remember their fathers’ sins and not blot out their mothers’ transgressions;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> always keep them in mind; Have people forget they ever lived,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> because they didn’t show enduring love; they persecuted poor, needy people, and murdered the despondent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They loved to curse; put curses on them! they didn’t like to bless; don’t bless them!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They cover themselves with cursing like clothes; it soaks into their bodies like water, down to the bone like oil!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Put it on them like a robe they have to wear all the time, like a belt they always have on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Make such things Yahveh’s reward to accusers that claim bad things about me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:14-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But Yahveh God, deal graciously with me because your enduring love is good; deliver me 22because I’m poor and needy and wounded in my heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I’m passing on like a lengthening shadow; I’m brushed off like a locust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> My knees are weak from fasting; I’m skin and bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I’m someone people scorn; they just shake their heads at the sight of me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:21-25</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Show them this is your doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Let them curse, but you bless; when they attack me, humiliate them, and I’ll be happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Dress those accusers in dishonor; cover them with their humiliation like a cloak.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 109:26-29</p>
