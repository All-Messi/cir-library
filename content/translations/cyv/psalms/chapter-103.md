<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bless Yahveh, all that I am! Everything that's in me, bless him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Bless Yahveh, all that I am; May I never forget how he helps me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> he pardons my sins and heals my diseases;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> he rescues me from the Pit and crowns me with enduring love and mercy;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> he satisfies my years with good things, and renews my youth like an eagle's.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh performs good deeds and renders justice for people mistreated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He made his ways known to Moses and demonstrated his acts to Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He won't constantly confront us or always be angry with us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins or rewarded us in proportion to our iniquities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As high as the sky is above the earth, so great is his enduring love toward those who respect him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, that's how far he's removed our sins from us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Like a father that has mercy on his children, Yahveh has mercy on those who respect him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He knows how we're made; he's aware that we're only dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> People are like grass, they flourish like flowers in a field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When the wind blows on them, they're gone like they'd never been there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh's enduring love is from eternity past to future for them who respect him; his goodness is to children's children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> to those who keep his covenant, that obey his commandments.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Yahveh has secured his throne in the sky; he's sovereign everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Bless Yahveh, angels, great in power, who do what he says and obey him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Bless Yahveh, all his hosts who serve him and do his will.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Bless Yahveh, everything he's created everywhere he reigns. Bless Yahveh, everything that I am!</span>
