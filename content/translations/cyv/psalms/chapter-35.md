## Psalms Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, oppose the ones that oppose me; fight those who fight me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Put on buckler and shield, and come to my aid.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Draw spear and javelin against my pursuers; tell me you’ll save me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Dishonor the ones that want to kill me; drive back and humiliate those who scheme against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Make them like chaff in the wind, with the angel of Yahveh blowing them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Make their path dark and slippery, with the angel of Yahveh chasing them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> for no reason they hid a net to catch me and dug a pit to trap me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Bring destruction on them unawares; have the net they hide catch them; have them fall into that very destruction.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 35:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I’ll be happy in Yahveh and celebrate over his salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> My very bones say, “Yahveh who is like you that delivers the oppressed from people too strong for them, and saves the needy from the one that robs them?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Malicious witnesses testify against me and accuse me of things I don’t do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They repay me bad for good; I’m heartbroken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But when they were sick, I wore burlap; I humbled myself with fasting and prayed with my chin on my chest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I went about as if it was my friend or brother; I bent over mourning as if it was my mother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But when I stumbled, they celebrated and ganged up on me; strikers that I didn’t even know gathered against me and slandered me for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Like godless jesters at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 35:9-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Lord, how long will you just watch? Rescue me from their ravages; save me from those lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I’ll thank you in the great community and praise you in the mighty throng.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don’t let my enemies celebrate over me, or wink maliciously who hate me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They don’t talk about peace; they scheme against those who are peaceful in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They open their mouth wide against me, “Aha, aha, we saw him do it!”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 35:17-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You can see what they’re doing, Yahveh; don’t stand back and not say anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Stir yourself up, awake for my justice, for my cause, my Lord and my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Judge me, Yahveh, according to your goodness; don’t let my enemies celebrate over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don’t let them say to themselves, “Just what we’d hoped!” don’t let them say, “We’ll eat him alive!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Humiliate them who celebrate over my distress; dress them in shame and dishonor who vaunt themselves up over me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 35:22-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Shout for joy you that are in favor of my vindication; say again and again, “Yahveh is great; he delights in his servant’s prosperity.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I’ll declare your goodness and praise all day long.</span>
