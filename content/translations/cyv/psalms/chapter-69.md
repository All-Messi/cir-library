### Set to Lilies

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Save me, God; I’m in water up to my neck!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I’ve sunk in deep mud, where there’s no foothold; a flood is sweeping over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I’m worn out from crying; my throat’s dry; my eyes are red from crying, waiting for my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The people that hate me for no reason outnumber the hairs on my head; those who want to destroy me are powerful; they’re trying to make me repay what I didn’t steal.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God, you know about my foolish choices; I can’t hide the things I’ve done wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> May those who put their hope in you not be disgraced because of me; may the ones who look to you not be dishonored by what I’ve done;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> because I’ve endured humiliation for your sake; I have shame written all over my face.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I’m alienated from my brothers; my mother’s sons treat me like a foreigner.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I’m consumed with zeal for your Temple; the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When I humble myself with fasting, they mock me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> when I wear burlap, they make my name a byword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Those who sit in the city gate talk about me; drunks make up songs about me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:5-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But, I pray to you, Yahveh; at an acceptable time, in your great enduring love, answer me with your sure salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Save me from sinking in the mud; deliver me from my enemies and from deep water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> May the flood not overwhelm me or the deep drown me or the Pit close over me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Answer me, Yahveh, because your enduring love is good; turn to me according to your great mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don’t abandon me, because I’m in distress; answer me quickly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Come close to my soul and redeem it; ransom me from my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You know my disgrace, shame, and dishonor; all my adversaries stand in your presence.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:16-19</p>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Insults have broken my heart; I’m heartsick. I looked for sympathy, but there wasn’t any, and for comforters, but I couldn’t find any.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Instead, they gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> May their table become a snare and their peace a trap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> May their eyes go blind and their loins tremble feebly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Pour out indignation on them; overwhelm them with furious anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Make their camp desolate and their tents deserted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They persecute the one you yourself have struck; they strike even more the ones you’ve already wounded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Pile their sins high; don’t let them experience your goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Erase them from the Book of Life; don’t enroll them with the godly.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:20-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> I’m miserable with pain; save me, God; set me safely up high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I’ll praise God with song and magnify him with thanksgiving.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> That will please Yahveh more than a young bull with horns and hoofs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The humble will see it and be happy; you that look to God for help will revive your hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Yahveh listens to the needy; he doesn’t look down on his imprisoned people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 69:29-33</p>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Let earth and sky praise him, the seas and everything that’s in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> God will save Zion and rebuild the towns in Judah so the people can settle there and own it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The descendants of his servants will inherit it; those who love him will live there.</span>
