<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> sustainY them when they’re sick and restore them to health.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I said, “Be gracious to me, Yahveh; heal my soul because I’ve sinned against you.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My enemies say rude things about me: “When’s he going to die so we can forget about him?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When they come to visit me, they say things they don’t mean; they just come to gather threads they can weave into gossip when they leave.</span>
