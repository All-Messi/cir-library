## Psalms Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My soul pants for God like a deer pants for water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> My soul is thirsty for the living God; when will I ever see him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night as people ask me all the time, "Where's your God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I think about these things as I pour out my soul. I used to go with the throng, leading the procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks in the great celebration.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Why despair, my soul? Why be disturbed? Put your hope in God because I'll still praise him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm in despair, God; so I remember you from the land of the Jordan, from the peaks of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The sounds of your crashing waves echo back and forth; your waves and breakers are sweeping over me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh directs his enduring love to me in the daytime; I sing his songs at night, prayers to my living God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I say to God, my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go around mourning because my enemies oppress me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Like breaking my bones, they taunt me; people ask me all the time, "Where's your God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Why despair, my soul? Why be disturbed? Put your hope in God because I'll still praise him</span>
