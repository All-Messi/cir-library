## Psalms Chapter 56

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be gracious, God; people are walking all over me, oppressing me all the time, 2attacking me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I'm afraid, I put my trust in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In you, whose word I praise, I've put my trust; what can mortals do to me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> All day long they try to frustrate my purposes; they think up ways to harm me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They stir up conflict, they lurk, they watch my every step, looking for a chance to kill me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Because they're sinful, throw them out; in anger put them down, God!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You've kept track of my wanderings and collected my tears in your bottle; aren't they recorded in your scroll?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help; I know this one thing: you're with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in Yahveh, whose word I praise,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I've put my trust so I won't be afraid; what can mortals do to me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I have to perform my vows to you; I'll give thank offerings for your help,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> because you've delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling so I can walk with you in the light of life.</span>
