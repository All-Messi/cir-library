## Psalms Chapter 79

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Other nations have invaded your inheritance, God; they've defiled your holy Temple and laid Jerusalem in ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They've given the buzzards your servants' corpses, and the wild animals the flesh of your holy people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They've poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem; there wasn't anybody to bury them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We've become a disgrace to our neighbors, mocked and derided by the people around us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh, will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pour out your wrath on nations that don't know you, that don't call on you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> they've devastated Jacob and laid waste his realm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't hold our ancestors' sins against us; bring us mercy quickly because we're in despair.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> For your honor, help us, God who delivers; forgive our sins for your name's sake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Why should the nations say, "Where's their God?" Show those nations your vengeance for your servants' blood that they shed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Listen to the moaning prisoner; with your great power save those doomed to die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Repay our neighbors seven times over</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> so we, your people, the sheep in your pasture, can be eternally grateful to you and recount your praise to all generations.</span>
