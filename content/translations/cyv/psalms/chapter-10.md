## Psalms Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Why stand so far away, Yahveh? Why hide when trouble comes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Sinners hunt down the poor in arrogance and get themselves caught in their own schemes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They brag about their sinful desires; they bless the greedy and curse Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In their arrogance, they don’t trust in him; they just keep acting like there’s no God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 10:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yet they always seem to prosper; they don’t see your coming judgments from on high; they sneer at adversaries</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> and keep telling themselves, “We’re all set; nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They curse, deceive, and oppress; scheming and sin are on the tip of their tongue.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They lie in ambush in villages, kill innocent people in private, and search for the unfortunate in stealth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They lurk in hiding places like lions in a den and sneak around to pounce on helpless people when they snare them in their nets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They crouch and slink down; the unfortunate fall under their power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They tell themselves, “God won’t remember; he doesn’t pay attention to what’s going on; he won’t even see it.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 10:5-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Raise up your hand, Yahveh; remember the helpless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Why do sinners renounce you? Why tell themselves you won’t call them to account?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You do see trouble and distress; so you will take care of it. Poor people commit themselves to you, and you defend orphans.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Break the arms of bad people; search out sinners till there’s none left to find.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh, you’re King forever; nations perish at your hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You listen to what the humble need and increase your mercy toward them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You vindicate the orphan and the oppressed so worldly people can’t abuse them anymore.</span>
