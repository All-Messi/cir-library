## Psalms Chapter 132

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, remember David and what he suffered;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> how he swore to Yahveh and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I won't go to my own house or get on my bed 4and sleep</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> till I find a place for Yahveh to live, a place for the Mighty One of Jacob."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We heard it in Ephrathah and found it in the fields of Jaar,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let's go to his Temple and worship at his footstool."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Come to your resting place, Yahveh, you and the ark that represents your strength.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> May your priests be arrayed in goodness, and your holy people sing for joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> For the sake of David your servant, don't turn away from your anointed one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You've sworn to him a truth you won't take back: "I'll set a son from your body on your throne.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If your descendants keep my covenant and the Testimony I teach them, their descendants will also sit on your throne permanently."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You've chosen Zion; you wanted to live there:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is my permanent resting place; I'll live here because I've wanted it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll abundantly bless what it can provide and satisfy its needy ones with food.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll dress its priests in deliverance; its holy people will sing for joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll make a horn from David spring up there and light a lamp for my anointed one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll dress his enemies in humiliation but make his crown shine."</span>
