<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>I’ve seen a violent, wicked people spread themselves out <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>like tall trees in their native soil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>Then they passed away and were gone; I looked for them, but they were nowhere to be found.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>Take note of blameless, watch the godly because peaceful people prosper;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>but sinners will be destroyed along with their future.</span>
