## Psalms Chapter 126

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Yahveh brought us exiles back to Zion, we were like people dreaming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Our mouths were laughing, our tongues were shouting with joy; the other nations were saying of us, "Yahveh has done great things for them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yes, Yahveh has done great things for us; we're happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Restore our fortunes, Yahveh, like streams in the Negev.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Those who go back and forth weeping with their bags of seed, will come again with shouts of joy, bringing bundles of grain.</span>
