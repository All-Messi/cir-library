## Psalms Chapter 141

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, I'm calling on you; come quick; hear me out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Consider my prayer as incense and the raising of my hands as an evening offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Guard my mouth; watch over my lips.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Incline my heart away from anything evil, from practicing sinful things with sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Let a godly person strike me or rebuke me graciously; that would be ointment for my head; Don't let me refuse it. I still pray constantly against the deeds of sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When their leaders are thrown over the cliffs; they'll learn that Yahveh's word is true.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Like someone plowing up rocks, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I look to you, Lord Yahveh, and take refuge in you; don't leave me with no defense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Keep me from the jaws of the trap they've set for me, from sinners' snares;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> may they stumble into their own nets while I go on by safely.</span>
