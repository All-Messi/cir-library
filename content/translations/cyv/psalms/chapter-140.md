## Psalms Chapter 140

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, rescue me from sinful people protect me from those who are violent,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> that plot evil things in their minds, and constantly stir up conflict.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They have pointed tongues like a snake; viper's venom lies behind their lips.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh, protect me from sinful people; Protect me from those who are violent, that try to trip me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The arrogant hide traps for me; with cords they spread a net beside the road and set snares for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I said to Yahveh, "You're my God; listen to my petitions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yahveh the Lord, my strong deliverer, you've protected my head in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't let sinful people do whatever they please; don't further their evil intentions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Make the schemes they talk about come down on their own heads.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Let burning coals fall on them; throw them into the fire, into deep pits they can't climb out of.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Don't let slanderers get a foothold in the earth; have misfortune hunt down violent people quickly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I know you'll champion the cause of the suffering and render justice for the poor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The godly will thank you and live in your presence.</span>
