## Psalms Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Don't lash out at me, Yahveh, or take me to task in your anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Be gracious to me because I'm weak; heal me because I'm troubled deep inside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'm really scared; how long, Yahveh, before you save me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Come back and rescue me; because of your enduring love, save me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> because nobody talks about you when they're dead; who gives you gratitude in Sheol?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm worn out from moaning; I flood my bed with tears every night and drench my couch with weeping.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> My eyes melt from grief, worn out over my adversaries.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Go away, all you sinners, because Yahveh has heard me call.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He's heard my plea and accepts my prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He'll disgrace my enemies and greatly distress them; they'll suddenly retreat, humiliated.</span>
