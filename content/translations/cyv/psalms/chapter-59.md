## Psalms Chapter 59

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, God; set me on high away from my attackers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Save me from sinners; rescue me from bloodthirsty people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They lie in ambush to kill me; fierce enemies stir up conflict against me, Yahveh, but not for my transgression.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> For no fault of mine, they run to attack me; get up to see and help me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh God of Hosts, God of Israel, wake up and punish the nations; don't extend grace to any that are treacherous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They come back in the evening and roam the city, howling like dogs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They growl with their mouth; they have swords in their lips; they say, "Who's going to hear us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But you laugh at them, Yahveh; you scoff at the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll watch for you, my Strength, my fortress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You'll meet me in your enduring love; and let me look down in triumph at my enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Don't kill them; otherwise, my people will forget; scatter them with your power and bring them to their knees, Yahveh our shield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, catch them in their pride, their curses, and the lies they tell.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In your anger, destroy them so they'll be out of the way, so people will know that you rule in Jacob and everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They come back in the evening and roam the city, howling like dogs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They wander around looking for food and growl if they're not satisfied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But I'll sing about your strength, every morning about your enduring love. You've been my fortress, my refuge in trouble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll sing praise to you, my Strength, the God who shows me enduring love.</span>
