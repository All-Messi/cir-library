## Psalms Chapter **73**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>God is good to Israel, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>to those whose hearts are pure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>because I envied the prosperity of the arrogant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>They don’t seem to suffer when they die; their bodies are healthy and well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>They don’t have trouble like other people; they aren’t stricken like everyone else.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>So pride is the <em>gold </em>chain around their neck; violence is their clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Their eyes are puffy with fatness; they have everything they could want.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They mock, and talk about oppressing, and talk down to the oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>They brag against the sky itself; their words strut across the world.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>So his people turn to them and drink in all their claims.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>They say, <em>“How does God </em><em>know any of this</em><em>?</em> <strong><em><sup>	</sup></em></strong><em>D</em><em>oes the Most High </em><em>even </em><em>know </em><em>what’s happening</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>They’re the sinful, always at ease as their wealth grows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing and washed my hands in innocence <em>for no reason</em>,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>because <u>I’m</u> stricken all day and endure grief every morning.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>If I’d talked the way I felt, I’d have betrayed your people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When I tried to understand why sinners prosper, I was troubled by it</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>till I went to God’s sanctuary; then I understood their destiny.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>You put them on slippery places and make them slide into ruin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They’re quickly destroyed, completely swept away by sudden desolation!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>They’re like dreamers when they wake up, Yahveh; their phantoms disappear.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 73:15-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>I was senseless and ignorant like an animal in your presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Nevertheless, I’m continually with you; you’ve taken me by the hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>You’ll guide me with your advice and afterward receive me into glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Who do I have in heaven but you? I want you more than anything on earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>My own flesh and heart may grow weak, but you’re my strength and portion forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>Those who are far from you perish; you destroy those who are not faithful to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Your nearness to <u>me</u> is good for me; I’ve made you my refuge so I can tell everybody how you operate.</span>
