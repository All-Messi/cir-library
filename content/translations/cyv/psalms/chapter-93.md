## Psalms Chapter 93

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh reigns, robed in majesty, dressed in strength. The world stands firm; it won't move.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Your throne has been secure from of old; you're from eternity past.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The floods have swelled; the roar of their pounding waves has increased.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But more than the thunder of overwhelming water, more than the mighty ocean breakers against the shore, Yahveh on high, you are powerful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your decrees stand firm; holiness adorns your Temple forever.</span>
