<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let's tell how great Yahveh is; let's honor him together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I looked to Yahveh; he answered me and freed me from my fears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I cried out in my suffering, and heY listened and saved me from my troubles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> An angel of Yahveh camps around people that respect him, and he rescues them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When good people call for help; he listens and rescues them from their troubles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He's close to the brokenhearted and saves those whose spirit is crushed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Good people face lots of trouble, but Yahveh delivers them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Sin slays the sinful; God punishes those who hate the righteous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He redeems his servants; he doesn't condemn anyone that takes refuge in him.</span>
