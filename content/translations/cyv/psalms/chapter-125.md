## Psalms Chapter 125

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Those who trust in Yahveh are like Mount Zion, that can't be moved, that lasts forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like mountains surround Jerusalem, Yahveh surrounds his people from now on forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sinners won't rule in the land allotted to good people because they'd tempt the good to do wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh does good to those who do good, who are godly in heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But those who turn aside to their crooked ways, he'll lead away with sinners. Peace to Israel!</span>
