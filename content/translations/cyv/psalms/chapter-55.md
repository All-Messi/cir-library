## Psalms Chapter 55

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Hear my prayer, God; don’t ignore my plea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen and answer; trouble has overwhelmed me; I’m distracted</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> by the threats of my enemies, by bringing suffering on me and bearing angry grudges against me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> My heart’s pounding; terror of death has fallen on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Fear and trembling have come over me; horror has overwhelmed me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove! I’d fly off and find peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I’d flee far away and lodge out in the countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I’d hurry to my shelter from the howling wind and raging storm.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:4-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Lord, destroy their plans; confuse their languages, because all I see is violence and conflict in the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Day and night they patrol the walls, but sin and scheming threaten inside it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Ruin is rampant within it; oppression and cheating never leave the streets.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:9-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> It’s not an enemy that’s disparaging me; I could handle that; it’s not foes that hate me and rise up against me, I could hide from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But it’s you, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> We used to be close friends that walked in God’s Temple together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Let death overtake my enemies; let them go down alive to Sheol, because there’s evil where they live.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:12-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I’ll call on Yahveh my God to deliver me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Morning, noon, and night, he’ll hear my groaning</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> and deliver my life in peace from my attackers, because lots of people are opposing me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The One who sits enthroned from of old will punish the ones that don’t change or respect him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> As for that companion of mine, he betrays his friends and breaks his promises against those who are at peace with him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:16-20</p>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> His speech is smoother than butter, but there’s war in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, but secretly they’re drawn daggers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Put your burdens on Yahveh, and he’ll take care of you; he won’t let the godly fall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You, God, will bring the wicked down to the deepest pit; bloodthirsty, devious people won’t live half their time, but I’ll trust in you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 55:21-23</p>
