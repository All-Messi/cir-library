## Psalms Chapter 92

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It's good to thank you, Yahveh, to sing praises to you, Most High;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> to declare your enduring love in the morning and your faithfulness at night</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> with a lute and a ten-stringed harp, with melody on a lyre.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Because you've made me happy by what you've done, I'll sing for joy over what you do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your deeds are so great, Yahveh, your thoughts so deep!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Senseless people don't realize, ignorant mortals don't understand</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> that when sinners sprout up like grass and the wicked flourish, it's only that they'll be destroyed forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But you're on high forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Your enemies will perish; everybody that sins will scatter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've made me as strong as a wild ox and anointed me with fresh oil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I've looked in triumph at my enemies and heard about the defeat of my attackers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Good people flourish like palm trees; they grow like cedars in Lebanon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Planted in Yahveh's Temple, they flourish in the courts of our God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They bear fruit even when they're old; they're still green and full of energy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They declare that Yahveh is good, that he's our rock; there's nothing bad about him.</span>
