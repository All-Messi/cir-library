<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There will be silence in your presence, God, as well as praise in Zion; people will fulfill their vows to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> All people will come to you, who hear prayers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Sins overwhelm us, but you forgive them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How blessed are the ones you choose and bring close to you to live in your courts; how satisfying is the goodness of your house, the holy Temple.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 65:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You answer us with awesome deeds, God who keeps us safe, who is trusted in every land and the farthest sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You established the mountains by your power and dressed yourself with strength,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> you that still the roaring seas and the disturbances among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They who live at the ends of the earth stand in awe at your wonders; you make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 65:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You take care of the earth and water it; you greatly enrich the ground and provide the water to grow the grain; that’s how you’ve ordained things to work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You water the plowed ground abundantly and level its ridges; you soften its clods with showers and bless its growth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The pastures in the countryside drip with dew; the hills blossom with rejoicing.</span>
