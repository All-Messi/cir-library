## Psalms Chapter 62

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I wait for God alone because my victory comes from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress; I won't be shaken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> How long will youpl assail me so you can murder me, like a leaning wall or crumbling fence?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your only intention is to knock me down; you enjoy lying about me; you bless out loud but curse inside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God because my hope lies only in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress; I won't be shaken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> My deliverance and glory rest with him, my strong rock and refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Always trust him, people; pour out your heart to him, our refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Common people have no value; the powerful aren't what they seem. Either one rises higher in the balances; they're both lighter than air.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don't put confidence in extortion; don't place empty hopes in stealing. If wealth does increase, don't set your heart on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God has spoken once; I've heard it twice that power belongs to God</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> and Yahveh has enduring love; he pays people according to their work.</span>
