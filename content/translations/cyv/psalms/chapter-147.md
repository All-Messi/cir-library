<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He supports the abused and takes sinners down to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Sing thanksgiving to Yahveh; sing praise to our God with a lyre.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He gives animals their food and feeds the young ravens when they caw.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He doesn't delight in the strength of horses or take pleasure in human might.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Praise Yahveh, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He's reinforced the bars on your gates and blessed those who reside in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He brings peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest wheat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He issues his command to the world, and his message travels swiftly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He sends snow like wool and scatters frost like ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He makes it hail; who can stand his freezing cold?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He speaks and it melts; he makes wind blow and water flow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He declares his message to Jacob, his statutes and ordinances to Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He hasn't dealt this way with any other nation; they haven't known his ordinances. Hallelujah!</span>
