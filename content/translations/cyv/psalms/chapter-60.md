## Psalms Chapter 60

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You've rejected us, God, and broken us; you've been angry, but restore us now.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You've made the land quake; you've split it open; now repair the faults and stop the tremors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've made your people endure hardship and given us wine that makes us stagger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You've raised a banner for those who respect you as a rallying point for truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Save us now with your right hand and answer us, deliver your beloved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In his kindness God has answered; "I'll celebrate by dividing up Shechem and measuring out the Valley of Succoth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Gilead and Manasseh belong to me; Ephraim is my helmet; Jacob is my scepter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Moab will be my washbasin; I'll scrape off my shoes on Edom and shout in triumph over Philistia!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Who will take me to a fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Have you rejected us, God? You're not going out with our armies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Help us against our enemies; we have no hope of human deliverance!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Through you we can do valiantly; you'll tread down our adversaries.</span>
