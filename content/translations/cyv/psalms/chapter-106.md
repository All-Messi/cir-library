## Psalms Chapter **106**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>Hallelujah!</strong> <strong>Be grateful to </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong> because he’s good;</strong> <strong>	his enduring love lasts forever.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Who can recount all his mighty deeds? Who can ever praise him enough?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>How blessed they are who maintain justice, who practice goodness all the time!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Remember me, Yahveh, when you’re gracious to your people; come and rescue me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>so I can share in your holy people’s prosperity, celebrate in your nation’s happiness, and glory in your heritage.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>We and our ancestors have sinned, committed iniquity, and behaved badly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of <em>Yahveh</em><em>’s</em> amazing acts or remember his abundant kindness; instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor and demonstrate his power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He commanded the Red Sea to dry up, and led them through its depths as through a desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>He saved them from those who hated them; he rescued them from their enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The water drowned their adversaries; not a one survived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then they believed in him and praised him in song.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:6-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>But </em>they soon forgot what he’d done and didn’t wait for his direction,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>but made loud demands and put him on trial in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:13-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When men in the camp got jealous of Moses and of Aaron, Yahveh’s holy priest,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>the ground opened up <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and swallowed Dathan and Abiram’s rebels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Fire broke out among their companions and consumed the sinful. <strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:16-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They made a calf at Horeb/<em>Sinai</em> and worshiped a molten image;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>they exchanged their Glorious One for an image of a bull that eats grass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>They forgot God, who’d saved them and done such great things in Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>amazing things in Ham, awesome things at the Red Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>So he said he’d destroy them. If Moses, his chosen one, hadn’t stood in the gap to turn away his wrath, he would’ve done it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>They refused to enter the pleasant land and didn’t believe what he promised;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>they grumbled in their tents and didn’t listen to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>disperse their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in other lands.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:19-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>They joined in the worship of Baal-peor and ate sacrifices to the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>What they did provoked him to send a plague out among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then Phinehas got up and intervened; so the plague stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>He’s been considered a good man ever since.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:28-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>They’d already provoked <em>God</em> at Meribah and got Moses in <em>serious</em> trouble <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>for speaking rashly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like Yahveh told them to, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>but mixed in with them, learned their practices,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>and served their idols, which led to their downfall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>and thereby shed innocent blood, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>the blood of their sons and daughters that they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; they polluted the land with blood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>So they defiled themselves with their practices and played the prostitute in their deeds.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:32-39</p>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>Yahveh’s anger so sparked against his people that he abhorred his special possession.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>So he gave them over to the surrounding nations; people that hated them ruled them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>their enemies subdued them and oppressed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>Many times he delivered them, but they kept rebelling with their <u>own</u> intentions and sank into sin.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 106:40-43</p>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them when he heard them cry out in distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>He remembered his covenant and relented because of his enduring love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>He even made their captors be kind to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>Save us, Yahveh our God; retrieve us from the nations so we can thank you and glory in praising you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>Bless Yahveh God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Everybody say, <em>“Amen.”</em> <strong>Hallelujah!</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
