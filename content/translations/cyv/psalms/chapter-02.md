## Psalms Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Why do the nations get together to plot pointless schemes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Kings take their stand and rulers hold counsel against Yahveh and his Anointed One [Messiah]:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let's break their bonds and throw them away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The One that's in heaven laughs; Yahveh scoffs at them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He'll speak to them in his anger and terrify them with his fury:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll tell Yahveh's decree: 'You're my Son; I've inaugurated you today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Just ask me, and I'll give you the nations to inherit, the most distant lands to possess.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You'll rule them with an iron scepter and shatter them like clay pots.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So, kings, be wise; rulers, be warned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Serve Yahveh with reverence; celebrate with trembling.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Kiss the Son so he won't be angry and you perish along the way; his anger is easily sparked. They're so fortunate who take refuge in him!</span>
