## Psalms Chapter 91

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They'll say about Yahveh, "Our refuge and fortress, the God we trust!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He delivers you from the trapper's snare and deadly pestilence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He covers you with his pinions; you can find refuge under his wings; his faithfulness shields and protects you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You won't be afraid of terrors at night, of arrows that fly by day,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> of pestilence that lurks in the dark, or destruction that lays waste at noon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand by your right hand; but disaster won't touch you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You'll stand by and watch his recompense to the wicked,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> because you've made Yahveh your refuge, the Most High your hiding place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Misfortune won't fall on you; no plague will get near you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He'll make his angels responsible for guarding you whatever you do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They'll carry you so you won't trip over a rock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You'll step on lions and cobras and crush them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll rescue them that love me and set up high those who know me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They'll call on me, and I'll answer them; I'll be with them in trouble, rescue and honor them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll satisfy them with long life and give them salvation."</span>
