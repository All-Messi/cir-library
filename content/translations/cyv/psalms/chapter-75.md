## Psalms Chapter 75

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Thank you, God, for being close by; people declare your wonderful deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When I set a time for judgment; I'll judge even-handedly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The earth and everybody in it melt; I'm the One that firmly set its pillars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I said to people that brag, 'Stop it,' and to sinners, 'Don't lift up your horns;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> don't raise them up high or talk with such arrogance.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Exaltation doesn't come from the east or west,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> but from God, the judge; he puts one person down and raises another up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> There's a cup of foaming wine in his hand; he has mixed it well and pours it out; sinners have to drain it and drink its dregs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I'll sing praise to Jacob's God; I'll declare it forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He'll cut off the horns of the wicked, but lift up the righteous.</span>
