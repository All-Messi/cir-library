## Psalms Chapter 45

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My heart is overflowing with a noble theme as I recite my verses to the King; my tongue is like the pen of a gifted poet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You're more handsome than the sons of men; gracious words stream from on your lips; God has blessed you forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Strap your sword to your thigh, Mighty Warrior, in your splendor and majesty!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In your majesty, ride on to victory, defending truth, humility, and goodness; have your right hand display awesome deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your sharp arrows pierce your enemies' hearts; nations fall under you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your throne is eternal, God; your kingdom's scepter is a godly one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You love goodness and hate sinfulness; so God, your God, has anointed you with more happiness than your companions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Your robes have the fragrance of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; stringed instruments entertain you in ivory palaces.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yourmas maids of honor include kings' daughters; at yourmas right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Listen, daughter; pay attention; forget your people and your father's family</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The king delights in your beauty; since he's your lord, bow to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The people from Tyre will shower youfem with gifts; wealthy citizens will sue yourfem favor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The princess looks beautiful in her gown interwoven with gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> She'll be led to the king in embroidered robes with bridesmaids in her train.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> With happiness and celebration, they'll enter the palace of the king.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yourmas sons will take the place of yourmas fathers; you'llmas make them rulers over many lands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll perpetuate yourmas memory in every generation; the nations will be eternally grateful to youmas.</span>
