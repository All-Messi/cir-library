## Psalms Chapter 133

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It's so good and pleasant for brothers to live together in peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It's like precious anointing oil running down like it did on Aaron's beard and dripped on his robe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> It's like the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the hills around Mount Zion; Yahveh commanded the blessing there—eternal life.</span>
