## Psalms Chapter 123

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I look to you enthroned in heaven!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like a servant looks to his master and a maid looks to her mistress, we look to Yahveh our God, to show us mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Be gracious to us, Yahveh, because we're had our fill of contempt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> For too long our lives have been full of the scorn of people at ease and the contempt of arrogant others.</span>
