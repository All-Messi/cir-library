## Psalms Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God, our ancestors have told us what you did in their time long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You drove out nations and planted this one; you struck them and scattered them abroad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Our ancestors didn't conquer the land with their sword; their own arm didn't save them. Your right hand, your arm, the light of your presence did it when you showed them favor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You're my King, God; ordain victories for Jacob in our day too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> By your power we'll push back our adversaries and tramp down our attackers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We don't trust in our bow; our sword won't save us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You are the one that must save us from our enemies and disgrace those who hate us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> We take pride in you always and give you thanks forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet now you've set us aside to dishonor; you don't go out with our armies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've made us retreat from our enemies; those who hate us have plundered our land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You've butchered us like sheep and scattered us among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You sell us cheap and make no profit from doing it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You make us a disgrace to our neighbors, something to scoff at,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> a byword the world over, a laughingstock among the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> All day long we're disgraced and humiliated</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> because people insult us; we have enemies and avengers everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> That's all come on us though we haven't forgotten you or been unfaithful to your covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Our heart hasn't deserted you; we haven't strayed from your way;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> yet you've crushed us in a place filled with jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> If we'd forgotten you or raised our hands to a foreign god,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> wouldn't you have found it out? You know all our inner secrets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But for the sake of your honor, our lives are always in danger; we're like sheep headed for slaughter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Wake up, Yahveh; why are you sleeping? don't reject us forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Why ignore us and forget our suffering and oppression?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> We're struck down to the dirt; our bodies stick to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Get up and help us; redeem us like your enduring love suggests.</span>
