## Psalms Chapter 127

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Unless Yahveh builds the house, they work for nothing who build it; unless Yahveh guards the city, its watchmen stay awake for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> In vain you rise early and work late to eat the food you gain by painful labor; he gives rest to the ones he loves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Children are a gift from Yahveh; what the womb produces is a reward.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Children born to a young man are like arrows in a soldier's hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> How blessed he is that has a quiver full of them; he won't be disgraced when he confronts his accusers at the city gate.</span>
