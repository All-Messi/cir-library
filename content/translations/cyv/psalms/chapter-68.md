## Psalms Chapter **68**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Arise, God, scatter your enemies; chase off those who hate you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Blow them away like smoke; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>melt them like wax near fire; make sinners perish in your presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But may good people be happy, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>delight in your presence, celebrate and be glad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>So sing to God, sing praises to him; lay out a highway for the One that rides through deserts, whose name is Yahveh, and celebrate with him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 68:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>God in his holy Temple is a father for the fatherless and a judge for widows;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>he makes a home for the lonely and leads prisoners out to prosperity; only the rebellious live in a parched land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>God of Israel, when you went out ahead of your people and marched through the desert,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>the ground shook, the sky poured down rain, Sinai itself quaked in front of you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>You sent widespread, abundant rain, God, and refreshed your inheritance when it was parched.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The animals settled in it; in your goodness you provided for the poor.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 68:5-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The Lord gives the command, and a host of women sing the good news: <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Kings </em><em>and their</em><em> armies flee</em> <em>	</em><em>	the</em><em> women</em><em> that stayed</em><em> home divide the spoil!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Even those who stayed among the flocks <em>found treasure</em> like the wings of a dove covered with silver and pinions <em>covered</em> with glistening gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>The Almighty scattered the enemy kings there like blowing snow in Zalmon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The mountain in Bashan is majestic, a mountain<strong><sup> </sup></strong>range with many peaks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy at the mountain that God wanted for his home? He’ll certainly live there forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands; Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>He has ascended on high and led captivity<sup>LXX</sup> captive, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>and received gifts among people, even among the rebellious so Yahveh God might live there.<strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 68:15-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Bless Yahveh, who carries our burdens every day, who keeps us safe <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and rescues us; deliverance from death comes from Yahveh the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>He’ll bash in the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who keep doing their guilty deeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>The Lord said, <em>“I’ll bring them </em><em>down</em><em> from Bashan</em> <em>	</em><em>and </em><em>bring them </em><em>up</em><em> from </em><em>the ocean depths</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup><em>so you can wash your feet in their blood</em> <em>	</em><em>and</em><em> your dogs can have their </em><em>share of</em><em> your enemies.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 68:19-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>They’ve seen your solemn procession, God, the procession of God, my King, into the sanctuary—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>singers first, then musicians, with young women playing tambourines.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Bless God as a community, Yahveh, the fountain of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>There’s Benjamin, the youngest, leading them, the officials of Judah in the throng, the officials of Zebulun and Naphtali.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Summon your strength, God; <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>show us your power like you have before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Kings will bring you gifts because of your Temple in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Scare off the beast that lives in the reeds, <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong>the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Trample underfoot its bars of silver; scatter the nations that delight in war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Let envoys bring gifts out of Egypt; let Nubia quickly submit to God.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ps 68:24-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Sing to God, kingdoms on earth; sing praises to Yahveh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>that rides high in the ancient sky, that thunders out his loud voice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Attribute power to God, whose majesty shines on Israel, whose strength is displayed in the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>He’s awesome in his sanctuary; the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people. Bless God!<strong>	</strong></span>
