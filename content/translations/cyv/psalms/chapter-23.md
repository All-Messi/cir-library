## Psalms Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh is my shepherd; I'll have everything I need.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He beds me down in green pasture and leads me beside still water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He refreshes me and guides me along good paths for his honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I won't be afraid, because he's with me; his rod and staff reassure me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You set a table for me in front of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Goodness and mercy will follow me all my life, and I'll live in Yahveh's house forever.</span>
