## Psalms Chapter 82

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God presides over the divine council and judges you judges.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> So how long will youpl judge unjustly by showingpl partiality to lawbreakers?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Renderpl justice to the weak and fatherless; standpl up for the oppressed and destitute.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Rescuepl the weak and needy; deliverpl them from bad people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You don't know or understand; You're walking around in the dark; the very foundations of your world are unstable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I say, "You're gods, children of the Most High,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> but you'll die like other mortals and fall like anyone else."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You judge the world, God! You're the One that owns the nations.</span>
