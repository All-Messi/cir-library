## Psalms Chapter 95

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Come, let's sing to Yahveh; let's make a joyful sound to the Rock that saves us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Let's go to him with thanksgiving and sing to him with psalms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh is a great God, a great King above all gods.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He controls the deep sea; he owns the mountain peaks</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> and the ocean because he created them; he made the dry land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Come, let's bow in worship; let's kneel to Yahveh our Maker.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He's our God, and we're sheep in his pasture, the flock under his care. If you hear him today,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> don't harden your hearts like they did at Meribah that day at Massah in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Your ancestors kept testing me though they'd been seeing my work for 40 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I detested that generation and said, "They err in their hearts; they don't know my ways."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So I swore in my anger, "They certainly won't enter my rest."</span>
