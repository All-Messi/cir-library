## Psalms Chapter 142

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I cry out to Yahveh and petition him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I pour out my complaint to him and tell him my troubles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I feel overwhelmed, he knows the route I should take; they've hidden traps for me on every path I walk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I look in every direction, but nobody notices me. There's no escape for me; nobody cares if I live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'm calling out to you, Yahveh; "You're my refuge, my portion among the living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Listen to my outcry because I'm in desperate need; deliver me from my persecutors; they're just too strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Bring me out of prison so I can thank you; the godly gather around me because you've been so good to me."</span>
