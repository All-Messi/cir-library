## Isaiah Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, seven widows will grab hold of one man and say, "We'll provide our own food and clothes. Just let us take your name so we won't be old maids!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> But at that time, Yahveh's branch will be beautiful and glorious. What the ground produces will be the pride and joy of Israel's survivors. 3The remnant in Zion and Jerusalem will be holy, everybody that's in his record books for living there. 4When Yahveh has washed the grime off of Zion's inhabitants and cleaned up the bloodstains in Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and burning, 5then he'll create over Mount Zion and its assemblies a cloud of smoke during the day, a bright blazing fire at night, and a canopy above the glory. 6It'll be shade from daytime heat and shelter from storms and rain. The Song of the Vineyard</span>
