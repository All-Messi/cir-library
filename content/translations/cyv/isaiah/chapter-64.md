## Isaiah Chapter 64

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oh that you'd open the sky and come down and the mountains would quake in your presence—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> like a flame that burns brush and boils water— to show yourself to your adversaries so they'd tremble in your presence!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When you did awesome things we didn't expect, you came down and the mountains quaked in your presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> No one has ever heard of a God like you that acts on behalf of people that wait for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You visit those who enjoy doing good, who remember you and your ways. You were angry because we kept sinning for a long time; can we ever be saved?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've all become unclean; our best efforts are like menstrual rags. We wither like leaves; our sins blow us away like the wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> No one calls on you or reaches out to you because you've hid from us and delivered us to the consequences of our sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But now, Yahveh, you're our Father; we're the clay, you're the potter; you've made us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't be angry beyond measure; don't hold our sin against us forever; look now, we're all your people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Your holy cities have become a desert; Zion is a wasteland; Jerusalem is desolate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Our holy, beautiful Temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned; all our precious things lie in ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Will you limit yourself to this much retribution, or will you keep disciplining us no end? Judgment and Final Salvation</span>
