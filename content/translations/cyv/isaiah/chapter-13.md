## Isaiah Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Babylon That Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw 2"Hoist a signal flag on a bare hilltop; call out an army and signal them to attack the mansions of the nobles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've commanded my consecrated ones and strong men to carry out my anger."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There's noise in the mountains like a large army, the uproar of gathered kingdoms! Yahveh of Hosts is mustering an army for war.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He and his instruments of indignation are coming from distant countries, from far-off horizons, to destroy the whole region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Cry out, because the day of Yahveh has come, destruction from the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Everybody's hands will fall limp; everyone's heart will melt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll panic; pain and anguish will seize them; they'll writhe like a woman in labor and look aghast at one another; their faces will be hot.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The day of Yahveh is coming— cruel, with fury and burning anger— to desolate the land and destroy its sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The stars and constellations won't glimmer; the sun will be dark at dawn, and the moon won't shine. 11"That's how I'll punish the world for its sin, put an end to its arrogance, and humble the pride of ruthless people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll make people rarer than gold, rarer than gold from Ophir.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll make the sky shake and the earth quake at my fury when my burning anger comes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Like hunted gazelles or sheep with no shepherd, everyone in Babylon will try to get back to their own people, to escape to their own country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Anybody that's found will be thrust through; anybody that's captured will fall by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Their little ones will be dashed to pieces while they watch; their houses will be plundered and their wives raped. 17"I'm going to stir up the Medes against them, who don't care about silver or delight in gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Their bows will slaughter the young men; they won't show mercy to babies or pity children."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Babylon—the glory of the kingdoms, the Babylonians' pride— will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Nobody will ever live there; no nomad will pitch his tent inside it; no shepherd will bed down his flock in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Desert animals will rest there; howling creatures will shelter in its abandoned houses; owls will nest in it; shaggy goats will frolic there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Hyenas will howl in its fortified towers, and jackals in its luxurious palaces; its fate is soon to come. A Taunt for the King of Babylon</span>
