## Isaiah Chapter 44

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But listen now, Jacob my servant, Israel my chosen one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> This is what Yahveh says who created you and formed you from the womb, who will help you: 'Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant, Jeshurun my chosen one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As I'll pour out water on thirsty ground to make streams on desert land, I'll also pour out my Spirit on your offspring and bless your descendants;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> they'll thrive like well-watered grass, like poplars beside streams.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> This one will say, "I belong to Yahveh"; that one will wear Jacob's name; others will write on their hand, "Belonging to Yahveh," and name Israel's God with honor.'" The Folly of Idols</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> This is what the King of Israel saysY, its Redeemer, Yahveh of Hosts, "I'm the first and last; there's no God but me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is like me? Speak up; recount things to me in sequence from the time I created this ancient nation; then tell that nation what's going to happen to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't tremble in fear; haven't I announced it to you long ago? You're my witnesses. Is there any God but me? Is there any other Rock? I don't know of a one."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Those who carve idols don't accomplish anything because their precious objects can't do anything. Their worshippers don't know that; so they'll be put to shame. 10Who but fools make their own gods and then worship them? 11The craftsmen are mere mortals. They'll all gather with the worshipers, take their stand, and go down in terror and infamy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A blacksmith shapes iron into a cutting tool over coals in his forge. He beats it with hammers till he gets hungry and weak, thirsty and tired. 13Then a carver shapes a block of wood, stretches out a measuring line on it, and draws a pattern on it with red chalk. He works it with chisels and planes to look like a beautiful human figure to set in a little shrine in somebody's house. 14He cuts down a cedar, takes a cypress or oak, and plants a fir tree in the woods, and the rain makes it grow. 15-16It becomes something he can burn. So he burns half of it to warm himself up and say "Ah, I'm warm; the heat feels good." Or he bakes bread and eats a roast and is satisfied. 17He carves the other half into an image, his god. He falls down to it, worships it, and prays to it, "Deliver me, my god."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They don't understand because God has glazed over their eyes so they can't see, and closed their minds so they can't think. 19The one that made it doesn't stop to reflect, "I burned half of it to bake bread and roast meat; I worshiped the other half!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He eats ashes and trusts something that can't help him. He doesn't ask, "Am I holding something fake in my hand?" Restoration for Jerusalem 21"Remember, Jacob and Israel; you're my servant; I made you; I won't forget you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I've wiped out your transgressions like a dark cloud, your sins like a heavy morning fog; come back to me; I've redeemed you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Shout for joy, sky, because Yahveh made you! Make a joyful sound, depths of the earth. Break into singing, mountains, forest, and every tree in them; Yahveh has redeemed Jacob and taken pride in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> This is what Yahveh your Redeemer says who formed you in the womb, "I'm the One that made everything: I stretched out the sky by myself and spread out the earth. Who helped me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I expose false prophets' omens and make fools out of fortunetellers; I force the wise to eat their words and turn their "knowledge" into nonsense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I carry out my prophets' predictions and perform my messengers' advice; I'm the One that says Jerusalem will be inhabited and the towns in Judah will be rebuilt!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I'm the One that tells the deep ocean to dry up and its currents will be dry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I say about Cyrus, 'He's my shepherd! He'll do everything I tell him'; he'll decree that Jerusalem will be rebuilt and the Temple foundations will be laid again." Cyrus, Yahveh's Chosen One</span>
