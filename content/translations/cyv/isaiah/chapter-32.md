## Isaiah Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A righteous king is coming; his princes will rule honestly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Each will provide a refuge from the wind, a shelter from the storm, a stream of water in the desert, the shade of a big tree in parched land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then the seeing will perceive; the hearing will listen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The rash will use good judgment; stuttering tongues will speak fluently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Fools won't be called noble anymore; rogues won't be considered generous;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> because fools speak nonsense; they're inclined to practice ungodliness, to lie about Yahveh, to keep hungry people hungry, and deprive the thirsty of a drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Their methods are evil; they design plots to destroy the poor with slander even when the plea of the needy is just.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But the truly noble make noble plans and stick with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Get up, women of leisure; listen, complacent daughters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> In a little over a year, trouble will come, complacent daughters; because the grapes will fail, the fruit harvest won't happen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Tremble, women of leisure; shudder, complacent daughters. Strip down to the skin and wrap burlap around your waist.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Beat your breasts for pleasant fields and fruitful vines,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> for joyful houses and happy towns, for my people's land, where thorns and thistles grow;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> because the palace will be abandoned, the populated towns will be empty, hill and watchtower will become permanent dens, a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> till the Spirit is poured out on us from on high, till the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field becomes a forest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then justice will thrive in the countryside; goodness will grow in the fertile field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Goodness will lead to peace and bring extended calm and confidence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then my people will live undisturbed in safe houses and peaceful retreats.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Though hail flattens the forest and the city's leveled,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> you'll still be blessed who sow near water, who let livestock and donkeys range free. An Oracle About Assyria</span>
