## Isaiah Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Send tribute lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela through the desert to Mount Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> At the Arnon fords the women of Moab will be left fluttering like birds or homeless nestlings. 3"Give us advice, grant us justice; cast your shadow on us like night at noon to hide us outcasts; don't betray us fugitives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Let our refugees from Moab stay among you; hide us from the destroyer." When oppression and destruction end and raiders have left the land, God will establish one of David's descendants as king;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> he will set up a throne in enduring love, and a faithful judge will sit on it in David's tent. He'll rule with mercy and truth, strive for justice, and measure out goodness in timely fashion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've heard about Moab's excessive pride, its arrogance and fury; its idle boasts have proved to be false.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So everyone in Moab will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth like people completely stricken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The fields of Heshbon will wither; the vineyards of Sibmah too. The lords of the nations will tramp on its choice clusters whose tendrils reach out as far as Jazer and spread to the eastern desert, whose shoots have grown westward even across the Dead Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So I'll weep bitterly for Jazer and the wine of Sibmah; I'll drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh, because the happy shouts over your summer fruits and harvest have died out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Happiness will be gone from the productive fields; there'll be no joyful shouting in the vineyards. Nobody will be treading out wine in the wine presses; I'll make the shouting stop.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So my heart moans for Moab like a dirge on a harp; my heart aches for Kir-hareseth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When the people of Moab wear themselves out in worship at their shrines and come to their sanctuary to pray, it won't do them any good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh spoke that message earlier about Moab. 14Now he says, "In three years, like a hired hand under contract would count them, I'll humble Moab's pride and decimate its sizeable population. Its survivors will be few and feeble."</span>
