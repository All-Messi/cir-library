## Isaiah Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Come sit in the dirt, virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne; you won't be treated honorably anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Grind meal with heavy millstones; take off your veil, strip off your skirt, uncover your legs and cross the rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your nakedness will show; your shame will be exposed; in my revenge I won't spare you or anybody else."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; Yahveh of Hosts is his name. 5"Sit silently in the dark, daughter of Babylon; you won't be called the queen of kingdoms anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I was angry with my people and punished them by letting them fall to you. But you didn't show them any mercy; you put a heavy yoke even on the elderly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yet you said, 'I'll be queen forever'; you were thoughtless about these things and didn't consider the consequences. 8"Listen to this, you that love pleasure, that live securely and tell yourselves, 'I exist and nobody can harm me; I'll never be a widow or lose my children.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But both will happen to you suddenly the same day— losing your children and becoming a widow; those disasters will come on you in full measure despite your many sorceries and powerful spells." 10"You felt secure in your sinfulness and said, 'Nobody can see me.' Your 'wisdom and knowledge' have misled you; you've told yourself, 'I exist and nobody can harm me.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But misfortune will come on you that you can't charm away; disaster will fall on you that you can't buy off; destruction will meet you suddenly that you're not prepared for. 12"Stick with your spells and sorceries that you've labored under since you were young; maybe you can scare somebody.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You're tired of all the advice you've received; let the astrologers—who prophesy by the stars, and predict by the new moon— stand up and save you from what's coming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They're like chaff in a fire; they can't deliver themselves from the flames; there won't be any good place for you to sit and keep warm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> That's the way it is for the ones you've worked with and done business with from your youth; each one will go off in their own direction; nobody can save you. Stubborn Israel</span>
