## Isaiah Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About the Sandy Wastes Beside the Sea Like a haboob sweeping in from the Negev, catastrophe will sweep in through the desert from a terrible land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I see a harsh vision: plunderers plundering; destroyers destroying. Go on, Elam; lay siege, Media. I'm going to put an end to the groaning Babylon's caused.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> My body's in agony; pangs have seized me like a woman in labor. I'm so faint I can't hear, so scared I can't see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> My mind is reeling, the horror is overwhelming; I longed for the twilight; now I'm afraid of the dark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The people are setting tables and spreading rugs to sit on; they're eating and drinking. But— "Get up, captains; oil the shields for battle!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then Yahveh said to me, "Station a sentry to report what he sees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, a donkey train, a camel caravan, he needs to stay alert."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then the sentry shouted like a lion, "Yahveh, every day I've manned my station on the tower; every night I've stood at my post.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now at last, here come riders, horsemen in pairs. They're reporting, 'Fallen! Babylon's fallen! its images shattered on the ground.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> My threshed people, winnowed on the threshing floor! I'm reporting what I've heard from Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Oracle About Edom Someone keeps calling to me from Seir, "Watchman, what time is it? How long till morning?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The watchman answers, "Morning is coming, but night will soon return; if you want updates, come back later and ask again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Oracle About Arabia Caravans of Dedanites, you have to spend the night hiding in the deserts of Arabia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> People in Tema, bring water for these thirsty refugees; meet them with food,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> because they're running from the drawn sword, the bent bow, the press of battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> This is what Yahveh told me, "A year from now, as a hired hand's contract would read, Kedar's splendor will end. 17Its surviving archers and strong men will be few; I, Yahveh God of Israel, have spoken.</span>
