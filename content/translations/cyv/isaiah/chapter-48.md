## Isaiah Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to this, Jacob called 'Israel,' that came from Judah's family, that swear by Yahveh and invoke Israel's God, but not sincerely and rightly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> that call yourself The Holy City and depend on Yahveh of Hosts:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> long ago, I told you what was going to happen; all at once it has; my prediction has come true.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I know how stubborn you are, that your neck is as stiff as iron, and your head is as hard as bronze.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I made my prediction long ago so you couldn't say your idol did it, that your carved image, your molten god commanded it.' 6"You've heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled, but you still won't own up to them; now I'll tell you things you haven't heard.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They're not things from long ago; so you can't claim you knew them all along.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I know what traitors you are; you've been rebels from birth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet for my name's sake, I've delayed expressing my anger; for my honor I've restrained it to keep from wiping you out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I've refined you, but not like silver; I've refined you in the furnace of suffering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> For my own sake—yes, I'll do it for my own sake— I won't let my reputation be tarnished; I won't share my honor with idols. Israel Freed from Babylon 12"Listen to me, Jacob, Israel that I've chosen; I'm the only One, the first and the last.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'm the One that founded the earth and spread out the sky; when I call out the stars, they come out in force.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Come here, all of you, and listen! Which of your idols has told you this? I've set my regard on Cyrus; he'll carry out my intentions on Babylon; he'll oppose the Babylonians.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> There I've said it; I've called him; I've brought him; he'll succeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Come close and listen: from the beginning I've spoken plainly about what would happen." Already the Lord Yahveh and his Spirit have sent me with that message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> This is what Yahveh says, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I'm Yahveh your God that teaches you how to be succeed and leads you the way you should go.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> If only you'd paid attention to what I told you, you'd have had peace like a river and goodness like ocean waves washing over you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Your descendants would have been too numerous to count, like grains of sand by the seashore; I wouldn't have needed to cut them off or destroy them out of my presence." 20"Get out of Babylon! Escape from the Babylonians! Shout the news everywhere with joy: Yahveh has rescued his servant Jacob!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They weren't thirsty while he led them through the desert; he made water gush out of rock for them to drink; 22"But there's no peace for the wicked," Yahveh says. The Servant of the LORD</span>
