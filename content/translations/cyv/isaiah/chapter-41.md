## Isaiah Chapter 41

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Lands beyond the sea, come to order and listen; prepare your case; step forward and present it; your case is next on the docket.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Who has stirred up the king in the east that he rightly called to his service, who delivers up nations and subdues kings; who makes them like dust with his sword, like wind-driven chaff with his bow;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> who chases them away and passes along safely on paths he hasn't walked before?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who does such momentous deeds generation after generation from the beginning till now? I, Yahveh, am the One, 5"The islands have seen it and fear; far-off places tremble; they're coming; they're getting close.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Each one encourages the other, 'Be strong!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So the carver encourages the goldsmith; the one that shapes with the hammer encourages the one that beats the anvil, and says of the soldering, 'It's good'; he fastens it down with nails so it won't rock. 8"But you, Israel my servant, Jacob my chosen, descendant of Abraham my friend,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> you that I took from a far-off place and called from the most remote parts and said, 'You're my servant; I've chosen you—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> don't be afraid, I'm with you; don't look around discouraged; I'm your God; I'll encourage you and help you; you can count on me to hold you up with my righteous right hand.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> All who are incensed at you will be disgraced; anybody that opposes you will perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You'll look around for people in conflict with you and won't find any; any who attack you won't exist anymore,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> because I'm Yahveh your God that holds you up, that tells you, 'Don't be afraid, I'll help you.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So don't be afraid, Jacob you worm, you people in Israel; I'll help you," Yahveh says; "Your rescuer is the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll make you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with teeth; you'll thresh the mountains and pulverize them and grind the hills into chaff.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You'll winnow them, the wind will blow them away, the storm will scatter them; but you'll celebrate in Yahveh and take pride in the Holy One of Israel. 17"The poor and needy are looking for water, but there isn't any; their tongues are parched with thirst; I, Yahveh, will answer them myself; as the God of Israel, I won't abandon them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll make creeks run in the barren hills and open up springs in the valleys below; I'll make the desert a lake of water and turn dry land into fountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> In the desert I'll put cedars and acacia trees, myrtles and olive trees; I'll plant junipers there along with box trees and cypress trees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I'll do that so people can recognize that I've done it; the Holy One of Israel has created it. 21"Present your case for your idols," Yahveh says; "bring forward your strong proofs," the King of Jacob says. 22"Predict for us what's going to happen; tell us what happened before so we can connect them with their outcome and learn what those outcomes will be.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> State what the future holds so we can tell you are gods; do anything—good or bad— so we can look around and be scared together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You aren't anything; you can't do anything; anybody that chooses you is pathetic. 25"I've stirred up a leader from the north; he answers me from the rising sun; he'll come on rulers like on mortar, like a potter treading clay."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Who predicted this from the start, so we could know about it? Who said it in former times, so we could say, 'He was right'? Nobody said anything; nobody heard any god say a word. 27"I was the first to tell Zion, 'Help's coming,' and Jerusalem, 'I've got good news.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But when I look, there's no advisor among them; if I ask them, who can answer?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They're all fake; they don't do anything; molten images are wind and hot air. The Servant of Yahveh</span>
