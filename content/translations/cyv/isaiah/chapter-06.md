## Isaiah Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high throne, and his train filled the Temple. 2Seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings:  two covered their faces, two covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3One shouted to the other, "Holy, Holy, Holy is Yahveh of Hosts; the whole world is full of his glory."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The thresholds shook when he shouted, and smoke filled the Temple. 5I said, "I'm doomed! I'm lost, a man with unclean lips living among people with unclean lips, and I've seen the King, Yahveh of Hosts!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> One seraph flew to me with a burning coal he'd taken off the altar with tongs. 7He touched my mouth with it and said, "That has taken away your guilt; your sin's forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then I heard the Lord say, "Who will I send? Who'll go for us?" I said, "I'll go; send me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, "Go tell this nation: 'Keep listening, but don't understand anything; keep looking, but don't perceive anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Harden your hearts, be hard of hearing, and shut your eyes so you can't see or hear, understand and repent, and be healed.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I said, "How long, Lord?" "Till the towns are deserted, the houses are empty, and the land's forsaken;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> till I've taken the people far away and leave the land largely abandoned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A tenth of it will survive only to be invaded again and burned; like a terebinth tree or oak whose stump is still standing after it's cut down, the stump will be Israel's holy seed." A Message for Ahaz</span>
