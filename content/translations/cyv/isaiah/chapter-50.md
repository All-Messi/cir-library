## Isaiah Chapter 50

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "Did I put your mother away with divorce papers? Did I sell you as slaves to pay my debts? No, I sold you because of your transgressions and divorced your mother for her sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When I came, why wasn't anybody home? When I knocked, why didn't anyone answer the door? Am I too poor to pay a ransom; don't I have the strength to rescue? I can dry up the sea with a word, make rivers empty and the fish in them die and stink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I dress the sky in darkness and cover it with burlap."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The Lord Yahveh has given me a disciple's tongue, so I can comfort the weary with a message. He wakes me up morning after morning to help me understand his will.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He's cleaned out my ears, and I haven't pulled away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I 've turned my back to the ones who scourge me and my cheeks to those who pull out my beard. I haven't covered my face from being spitting on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He helps me so I'm not disgraced. I set my face like flint and know I won't feel ashamed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The One that vindicates me is close at hand; who wants to fight me? Let's stand up to each other. Who wants to take me to court? Go on, sue me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The Lord helps me; who can condemn me? Adversaries will wear out like old, moth-eaten clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Who among you respects Yahveh, obeys his servant, and still lives in the dark? Trust Yahveh and rely on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You that live by the light of the fires you set will fall into them in torment. Everlasting Salvation for Israel</span>
