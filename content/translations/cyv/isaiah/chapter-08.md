## Isaiah Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh told me, "Take a large tablet and etch on it in standard letters 'Maher-shalal-hash-baz' [quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil]." 2I got reputable men to witness it: Uriah the priest and Zechariah Ben-Jeberechiah. 3So I had relations with my wife the prophetess, and she had a son. Yahveh told me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 4because before he knows how to say 'daddy' or 'mommy,' the king of Assyria will 'carry away the wealth' in Damascus and 'the spoil' in Samaria."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh spoke to me again, 6"These people have rejected the water at Shiloah that flows gently and admire Rezin and Remaliah's son. 7So I'll flood them with the powerful, abundant 'water' of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its banks, 8surge into Judah, flood it, and wash on through. It will get neck deep over your whole land, Immanuel. 9"Be broken, nations, and terrified; listen, distant lands; gird up, but you'll be crushed; gird up, but you'll be crushed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Devise a battle plan, it'll be thwarted; develop a strategy, it won't stand, because 'God is with us' [Immanuel]." Trust the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh warned me strictly not to think the way this country thinks: 12"Don't suppose everything's a conspiracy that they do or fear everything they fear or dread what they dread. 13Fear Yahveh of Hosts, the One you consider holy. 14He'll be your sanctuary. To both houses of Israel, he'll be a stone to stub your toe on, a rock to trip over, a snare and a trap for the people in Jerusalem. 15Many will trip on it, fall down, and shatter. They'll be caught in a snare."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Preserve the testimony; entrust the teaching to my disciples. 17I'll wait for Yahveh that's turned away from Jacob's descendants. I'll diligently depend on him. 18I and the children Yahveh has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from Yahveh of Hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> If they tell you to consult mediums and wizards that chirp and mutter, shouldn't they consult their God instead? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 20Instead, go to God's teaching, go to his testimony! If what they say doesn't agree with that, it's because they're not going to see a new dawn. 21They'll pass through the land, distressed and hungry. They'll get mad and curse their king and their God. They'll look up to the sky 22and down at the earth at distress and darkness, at the despair that comes from anguish. Then they'll be thrust into deep darkness. A Messiah Has Been Born to Us</span>
