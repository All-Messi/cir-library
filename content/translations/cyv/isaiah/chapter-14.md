## Isaiah Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Yahveh will have mercy on Jacob, choose Israel again, and settle them in their own land, foreigners will join Jacob's house. 2The nations will help bring them home. Israel will possess them as an inheritance in Yahveh's land, as male and female servants. They'll capture their captors and rule their rulers. 3When Yahveh gives them relief from their pain, turmoil, and harsh slavery, 4they'll taunt the king of Babylon: "How the big bully has ceased bullying and stopped his insolence!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh has broken the staff of the corrupt, the scepter of rulers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> that struck people in fury with endless blows, that ruled nations with unrestrained tyranny.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The whole region is resting and quiet now; the people are breaking out into shouts of joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The cypress trees are celebrating over you; the cedars of Lebanon say, 'Since you were laid low, no lumberjacks have come to cut us down.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Sheol below you is excited to welcome you; the spirits of dead leaders rouse to see you; the nations' kings rise from their thrones. \	10They welcome you and say, 'You've become as weak as we are; you're like us now.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your pomp and the music of your lyres have come down to Sheol; maggots are your bed; worms are your covers.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> How you've fallen from the sky, Morning Star, son of the dawn! You that overthrew nations have been thrown to the ground!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You told yourself you'd ascend to the sky and raise your throne above God's stars and preside over the mount of assembly in the distant north;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> you'd rise above the clouds and be like the Most High.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But, you'll be thrust down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Those who see you will gape and wonder, 'Is this the king that made the ground shake and kingdoms tremble,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> that turned the world into a wasteland, overthrew cities, and didn't let his prisoners go home?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The kings of earth lie in honor in their magnificent tombs;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> but you'll be thrown out of your sepulcher like a gross miscarriage, dumped with the slain in a mass grave, with those pierced by the sword, who go down into a cistern like trampled corpses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> No one will give you a proper burial because you've ruined your own country and slain your own people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Slaughter his descendants for their father's guilt so they won't grow up and conquer the world like he did."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh of hosts says, "I'll attack Babylon and destroy its reputation, children, and posterity. 23I'll make a marsh out of it, a haunt for hedgehogs, and sweep it with a broom of destruction."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Yahveh of Hosts has sworn, "It will happen the way I planned; it'll stand like I intended.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I'll break Assyria when it comes into my land and trample it underfoot on my mountains. I'll remove its yoke from my people and its burden from their backs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> That's what I've planned for the whole region, a judgment that reaches out across the nations."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Yahveh of Hosts has a plan; who's going to stop it? Who can shove aside his raised fist? Oracle Against Philistia</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The year King Ahaz died, this oracle came: 29"You that live in Philistia, don't celebrate because the rod that struck you is broken; from that serpent's stock a more poisonous snake will come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I'll pasture the firstborn of my poor, and their needy will lie down safely; but I'll starve your root to death and kill off any survivors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Wail, gates; cry, city; melt away, Philistia; because an army is drifting in like smoke from the north, and every soldier in it rushes to the fight."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> What should we tell any messengers the Philistines send? "Yahveh founded Zion; the stricken among his people will find refuge there."</span>
