## Isaiah Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and went to the Temple. 2He sent Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah. 3They went to him and said, "Hezekiah says, 'This is a distressing, discouraging, dejecting day. Babies have come due, but there's no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe Yahveh your God has heard the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God. Maybe he'll reprove him for it. Pray for the remnant that's left.'" [5]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isaiah said, "Tell your master Yahveh says, 'You don't need to be afraid of what the Assyrian king's messengers have blasphemed. 7I'll make him believe a rumor and go back home. He'll fall by the sword there.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Meantime the Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he'd heard he'd left Lachish. 9The king had heard that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him. When the Rabshakeh heard it, he sent ambassadors back to Hezekiah: 10"Don't let the god you trust in deceive you into thinking Jerusalem won't fall. 11You've heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the Edenites in Telassar? 13Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Hena, Ivvah, or the city of Sepharvaim?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Hezekiah read the letter, then went up to the Temple and unrolled it in Yahveh's presence. 15He prayed, 16"Yahveh of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 17Incline your ear and hear, open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God. 18Assyria's kings have devastated all the nations and their lands. 19They've thrown their gods into the fire because they were just hand-made pieces of wood and stone. 20But now, Yahveh our God, deliver us from the one that destroyed those kingdoms so the world can know that you alone are God." Isaiah Predicts Israel's Deliverance</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Isaiah sent word to Hezekiah, "Yahveh God of Israel says, 'Because you prayed to me about Sennacherib, 22 I have this to say to him: "The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and laughs at you; the young woman of Jerusalem shakes her head as you flee, 23"Who've you been mocking and blaspheming? Who'd you raise your voice at and roll your eyes about? The Holy One of Israel!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You mocked the Lord through your messengers: 'I came up to the highest mountains with many chariots, to the most remote parts of Lebanon; I cut down its tall cedars, its best cypress; I reached its highest peak, its deepest forests.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I've dug wells and refreshed myself with their water and dammed up the rivers in Egypt with my feet.' 26"Haven't you heard? I decided that very thing long ago; I planned it ages back; now I'm letting you do it so you'll turn fortified towns into piles of rubble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> That's why the people in them are so weak, scared, and confused; they're as weak as plants in a field, as grass sprouting on housetops that's scorched before it's grown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I know when you sit down, when you come and go, when you rage at me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Because you raged at me and I heard your arrogance myself, I'll put my hook in your nose, my bridle in your lips, and turn you back the way you came." 30"Hezekiah, I'll show you what I mean: this year you'll only eat what volunteers, next year what volunteers from that, but the third year you'll sow and harvest, tend vineyards and eat their fruit. 31The surviving remnant of the siege in Judah will again take root down and bear fruit up. 32A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahveh of Hosts will make it happen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Yahveh says, "The king of Assyria and his army won't come into this city or shoot an arrow here. He won't approach it with a shield or throw a mound up against its walls. 34He'll go back home the way he came. 35I'll save this city for my sake and my servant David."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The angel of Yahveh went out that night and struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early the next morning, the Assyrians were all dead. 37So Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 38As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrock, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him. Hezekiah's Sickness and Recovery</span>
