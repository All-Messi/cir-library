## Isaiah Chapter 57

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Good people perish and nobody notices; the devout disappear without anyone realizing it, because God removes good people out of harm's way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They who take the godly road go to peace and rest in their graves. Idolatrous Worship Condemned 3"But come here, you sons of sorcerers, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who are you making fun of? Who are you mouthing off to? Who are you sticking out your tongue at? Aren't you rebellious brats, lying cads</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> that worship your idols with lust among the terebinths under every green tree, that slaughter your children in the wadis on the jagged rocks beneath the cliffs?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your destiny is among those smooth-stone fertility symbols that you worship in those wadis; they're your fate; you pour out liquid offerings to them and make grain offerings; am I supposed to be appeased by stuff like that?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You've committed adultery on every high mountain and gone up there to offer sacrifice to your idols.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You've put pagan symbols on the back of your doors and on your doorposts; you've deserted me and uncovered yourself to your temple prostitutes; you've loved their bed and looked at their nakedness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You've gone to Molech with olive oil and lots of perfume; you've sent your messengers far and wide, even to Sheol.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've worn yourselves out by your long search, but you didn't give up; you found renewed strength and didn't faint. 11"Who were you worried about and fearful of when you lied and didn't think about me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll tell everybody about your so-called good deeds, but they won't do you any good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When you appealed for help, did your collection of idols deliver you? A gust of wind can pick them up; a breath can blow them over. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain." Comfort for the Contrite</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God says, "Fix the road; rebuild it; get rid of every obstacle to my people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> This is what the high and lofty One says that lives forever, whose name is Holy: "I live in a high and holy place to revive the courage of the humble and the heart of the repentant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I won't oppose you forever or always be angry; the spirit and breath of the ones I've created would lose spirit and give up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I was angry and struck them for their sinful, unjust gain; I hid from them and was angry, and they went on turning away in heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've seen their ways, but I'll heal them anyway; I'll lead them, comfort their mourners,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> and create praise from them. Peace to the near and far; I'll heal them,"	Yahveh says. 20"But sinful people are like a tossing sea; it can't relax; it stirs up debris and mud.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> There's no peace for them," my God says. False and True Worship</span>
