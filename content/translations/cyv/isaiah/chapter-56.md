## Isaiah Chapter 56

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "Maintain righteousness and be godly because my salvation's coming; my deliverance will arrive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They are fortunate who do that, who hold onto it, who honor my Sabbath and don't do anything sinful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Foreigners that join themselves to Yahveh shouldn't say, 'He'll surely make a difference between me and his people'; eunuchs shouldn't say, 'I'm a dead tree.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh says, "For eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths holy, choose to do what pleases me, and keep my covenant—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll erect a memorial inside my Temple walls and inscribe on it a name that's better than heirs. 6"Foreigners that join me to minister to me, love and serve me, observe my Sabbaths, and keep my covenant—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll bring to my holy mountain and make happy in my Temple for prayer; I'll accept their sacrifices and burnt offerings on my altar; I'll make my Temple a house for prayer for all nations."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The Lord Yahveh who brings back the dispersed from Israel, says, "Still others I'll bring to those I've already gathered." Sinful Leaders Condemned</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> All you wild animals in the field and forest, come and devour my people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The watchmen are blind; they don't know what's going on. They're dogs that can't bark, always lying around asleep, dreaming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They have huge appetites they can never satisfy; they're shepherds that don't know how to shepherd. They've all turned to their selfish interests, looking for personal profit. 12"Come on," they say, "let's get some wine and drink lots of alcohol; tomorrow let's do it again—and more so."</span>
