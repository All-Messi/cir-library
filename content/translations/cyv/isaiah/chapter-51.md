## Isaiah Chapter 51

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to me, you that want to be good, that look to Yahveh, the Rock you were hewn from, the quarry you came from.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Look to Abraham your ancestor, to Sarah who bore you in pain; he was just one man when I called him; then I blessed him and multiplied him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Indeed, Yahveh will comfort Zion again and have mercy on its desolate places; he'll make its wilderness like Eden, its desert like Yahveh's orchard. Joy and happiness will be there, thanksgiving and songs. 4"Listen, my people; pay attention, my nation, because my law will go out from me; my justice will shine like a light for the nations, to distant lands that wait for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My goodness will come soon to set my deliverance in motion, my arms will bring justice to the nations; the distant lands will look to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Look up at the sky; then look at the earth below it, because the sky will dissipate like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment the people in it will die like gnats; but my deliverance will be permanent, my goodness won't end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Listen, you that know goodness and have my Law in your heart; don't worry about criticism or be intimidated by scorn;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> moths will eat away at your adversaries like a cloak; worms will consume them like wool; but my goodness will last forever, my deliverance will continue to all generations."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Wake up, wake up, show your strength, arm of Yahveh; wake up as in the old days, generations ago; wasn't it you that cut Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Wasn't it you that dried up the sea, the water in the great deep, that made it a path for the rescued to pass through?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The ones Yahveh has ransomed will return to Zion with happy shouts, crowned with everlasting joy; sorrow and sighing will disappear. 12"I'm the One that gives you assurance. Why be afraid of mortals that wither like grass?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Why forget Yahveh your Maker that stretched out the sky and laid the foundations for the world? Why constantly fear your enemies' fury when they threaten to destroy you? Where's the fury of those oppressors now?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Exiles will soon be free; they won't starve to death in dungeons,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> because I'm Yahveh your God that stirs up the sea and makes its breakers roar. ("Yahveh of Hosts" is my title.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I've put my message in your mouth and covered you with my hand to establish the sky, to found the earth, to tell Zion, 'You're my people.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Wake up! Jerusalem; get up, you that drank from Yahveh's hand the cup of his anger, that drank to the dregs the chalice that made you stagger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Out of all the children you've borne and raised, there's no one to take you by the hand and guide you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Two things have happened to you: devastation and destruction, sword and famine. Who's going to mourn for you? How can I comfort you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Your children have fainted; they lie helpless at the head of every street like an antelope in a net, full of Yahveh's anger, your God's rebuke.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So listen to this, oppressed people, drunk but not with wine;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> this is what your Lord says, Yahveh your God that contends for his people: 'I've taken out of your hand the cup filled with my anger, the chalice that made you stagger; you won't have to drink it anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I'll hand it to your tormentors to drink who told you to lie down so they could walk on you. You made your back like the ground, like a street for them to tread." Deliverance for Jerusalem</span>
