## Isaiah Chapter 45

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This is what Yahveh says to Cyrus his anointed whose right hand he'll empower to subdue nations and dethrone kings, to open fortress gates so they won't be shut: 2"I'll go ahead of you to level out the mountains, shatter bronze gates, and cut through their iron bars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll give you treasures stored in the dark and wealth hidden in secret places, so you'll know it's me, Yahveh God of Israel, who calls you by name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> For the sake of Jacob my servant, Israel my chosen one, I've called you by name and given you an honorable title even though you didn't know me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'm Yahveh; there's no other; there's no God but me. I'll arm you for war though you don't know who I am,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> so people from sunrise to sunset can know there's no God but me. I'm Yahveh; there's no other,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Yahveh that creates light and makes darkness, that sends peace and brings catastrophe— I'm Yahveh that does all of that. 8"Sky, shower from above; clouds, rain down goodness; ground, open up so salvation can sprout and goodness can spring up from you. I'm Yahveh your creator. 9"Misfortune awaits the ones that fuss at their Maker like a clay pot fussing at a potter! Will a pot say to a potter, 'What are you doing?' or 'What you're making doesn't have any handles'?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Misfortune awaits the baby that says to its father, 'Why did you beget me?' or its mother, 'Why did you have me?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel and your Maker, says "Will you question me about my children or tell me how to do my work?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm the One that made the world and created people in it; I stretched out the sky and hung the stars there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll stir up Cyrus for my righteous purposes and smooth his paths; he'll rebuild my city and free my exiles without payment or reward." Yahveh, the Only Savior</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh says, "Egyptians, Nubians, and Sabeans—men of stature— will come in chains and fall down in front of you; their wealth and merchandise will be yours. They'll say to you, 'God is with you for sure; there's nobody else, no other God.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Truly you're a God that works in mysterious ways, God of Israel, Savior!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They'll be disgraced who manufacture idols; they'll go away together in humiliation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh will deliver Israel permanently; Israel won't ever be put to shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yahveh says—who created the sky, who made the earth and shaped it, who didn't make it waste and void, but shaped it to be lived in— "I'm Yahveh; there's no other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I haven't spoken secretly in some dark corner; I didn't tell Jacob's descendants to look for me in a desolate place; I'm straightforward and declare what makes sense. 20"Get together and return; come near together, refugees from the nations around. They don't know what they're doing who carry around wooden idols and pray to gods that can't save.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Consult together and set forth your case. Who predicted those things from of old? What idol has proclaimed it for so long? Am I not the One, Yahveh? There's no God but me, an upright God and Savior; there's none but me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Turn to me and be saved, people everywhere, because I'm God, there's no other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I've sworn by myself; I won't take back the reliable message, the message that every knee will bow to me and every tongue will swear allegiance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They'll say about me, 'Godliness and strength are only in Yahveh.' People will come to me; everyone that's been mad at me will be put to shame."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Israel's offspring will be justified and honored in Yahveh. Babylon's False Gods</span>
