## Isaiah Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits you, destroyers who haven't been destroyed yourselves; misfortune awaits you, treacherous people that others haven't treated treacherously. As soon as you're done destroying, you'll be destroyed; as soon as you've finished your treachery, others will deal treacherously with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh, be gracious to us; we've waited for you; be our strength each morning, our deliverer when trouble comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Let people run from the turmoil you bring; let nations scatter when you threaten.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gather spoil like caterpillars gather and locusts strip the countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Honor Yahveh because he lives on high; he's filled Zion with justice and goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Later he'll provide you stability, a wealth of salvation, knowledge, and wisdom; respect for him will be your treasure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But for now, your brave men cry in public; your ambassadors for peace weep bitterly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The roads are empty; travel is at a standstill because the enemy has broken the treaty, despised towns, and doesn't care about their inhabitants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The land mourns and pines away; Lebanon shrivels up with shame. Sharon has become a desert; Bashan and Carmel are losing their leaves. 10"So now I'll stand up and be honored," Yahveh says, 11"You've conceived chaff and given birth to stubble; my breath will consume you like a flame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll burn the nations to lime and destroy cut thorns with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You that are far off, pay attention to what I've done; you that are near, acknowledge my power."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sinners in Zion have panicked; the godless tremble, "Who among us can live in this consuming fire and continual burning?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You that conduct yourselves justly and speak truthfully, who refuse to profit from fraud and pull your hand back from bribes, who stop your ears from listening to murderous plots and shut your eyes from watching evil—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> you'll live on high; your refuge will be an impregnable cliff; you'll have food enough to eat and water you can rely on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You'll see the King in his splendor and look at a land that stretches far and wide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You'll remember your fears from before, and ask, "Where are the Assyrians that counted our defenses, numbered our towers, and added up the spoil?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You won't see those fierce people anymore whose language nobody could understand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Look at Zion that hosts your appointed festivals; you'll see that Jerusalem offers a safe place to live, a tent that won't blow over, whose stakes won't pull up, whose guy ropes don't snap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yahveh, the Majestic One, will be there for you, a place with streams and canals, where no galley will come or big ship can sail;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> because Yahveh your judge, lawgiver, and king will protect you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Your enemies' tackle is hanging loose; it can't hold the mast in place or keep the sail spread. As God's people, you'll divide the abundant spoil; even the lame will gather plunder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You that live here won't say, "We're weak and sick," because God will forgive your sin. An Oracle for the Nations</span>
