## Isaiah Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Tyre Wail, you merchant ships of Tarshish, because Tyre's destroyed without home or harbor, just like the rumor you heard all the way over at Cyprus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Be quiet, you people on the coast, merchants of Sidon; your traders crossed the sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> and sailed on many bodies of water. Grain from the Nile, harvest from the Shihor was your revenue; you were the international marketplace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But now be disgraced, Sidon, because the fortress by the sea says, "I'm childless, without young men and virgins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the report reaches Egypt, they'll agonize over Tyre.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pass the news on to Tarshish; wail, people in distant places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Is this your joyous city that originated in antiquity and colonized distant lands?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who planned this against Tyre, the granter of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders the world honored?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh of Hosts planned it to dampen the pride of all beauty, to humble the honored in the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Tyre's land has been flooded like the Nile, Tarshish; its defenses are gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh has stretched out his hand over the sea and shaken the kingdoms; he has commanded to demolish Phoenicia's fortresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He said, "You won't celebrate anymore, crushed virgin of Sidon; even if you escape to Cyprus, you won't find rest."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Look at the land of the Babylonians; it's gone. The Assyrians delivered it to the desert animals; they erected siege ramps, stripped its palaces, and reduced it to ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Wail, ships of Tarshish; the harbor you sailed to has been destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Tyre will pass from memory for 70 years, the lifetime of one king. Then it will come back to life like the woman in "The Song of the Prostitute": 16"Take your harp and walk the streets, forgotten prostitute; pluck the strings skillfully and sing your songs so they'll remember you again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> After 70 years Yahveh will revisit Tyre. It'll go back to playing the prostitute with kingdoms everywhere. 18In the end, her pay won't be saved up or hoarded; it will be set aside to feed and dress the Yahveh's priests. Devastation of the Earth</span>
