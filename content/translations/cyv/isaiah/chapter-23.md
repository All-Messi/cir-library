## Isaiah Chapter **23**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Oracle About Tyre Wail, you merchant ships of Tarshish, because Tyre’s destroyed without home or harbor, just like the rumor you heard all the way over at Cyprus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Be quiet, you people on the coast, merchants of Sidon; your traders crossed the sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and sailed on many bodies of water. <strong><sup>	</sup></strong>Grain from the Nile, harvest from the Shihor was your revenue; you were the international marketplace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>But now be disgraced, Sidon, because the fortress by the sea says, <em>“I</em><em>’m childless, without</em><em> young men </em><em>and</em><em> virgins.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>When the report reaches Egypt, they’ll agonize over Tyre.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Pass the news on to Tarshish; wail, people in distant places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Is this your joyous city that originated in antiquity and colonized distant lands?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 23:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Who planned this against Tyre, the granter of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders the world honored?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Yahveh of Hosts planned it to dampen the pride of all beauty, to humble the honored in the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><em>Tyre’s</em> land has been flooded like the Nile, Tarshish; its defenses are gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Yahveh has stretched out his hand over the sea and shaken the kingdoms; he has commanded to demolish Phoenicia’s fortresses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>He said, <em>“You won’t </em><em>celebrate</em><em> anymore,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>crushed </em><em>virgin of</em><em> </em><em>Sidon</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>even if you escape</em><em> to Cypr</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>,</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>	you won’t find rest.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 23:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Look at the land of the Babylonians; it’s gone. The Assyrians delivered it to the desert animals; they erected siege ramps, stripped its palaces, and reduced it to ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wail, ships of Tarshish; the harbor you sailed to has been destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Tyre will pass from memory</span>
<p class="section-ref">for 70</p>

### years, the lifetime of one king. Then it will come back to life like the woman in “The Song of the Prostitute”: 16“Take your harp and walk the streets, 			forgotten prostitute; 		pluck the strings skillfully and sing your songs 			so they’ll remember you again.”


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup></span>
<p class="section-ref">After 70</p>

### years Yahveh will revisit Tyre. It’ll go back to playing the prostitute with kingdoms everywhere. 18In the end, her pay won’t be saved up or hoarded; it will be set aside to feed and dress the Yahveh’s priests.	        Is 23:13-18 Devastation of the Earth
