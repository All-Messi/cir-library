## Isaiah Chapter 54

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Shout for joy, childless woman; break into joyful shouting and cry out, you that have never had birth pangs; because the woman that's by herself will have more children than a married woman," Yahveh says. 2"Make a bigger space for your tent; stretch out its curtains—don't hold back; lengthen your guy ropes and drive your pegs deeper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You'll spread out left and right; your descendants will live in the nations and resettle the ruined towns. 4"Don't be afraid, you won't be disgraced; don't feel humiliated, you won't feel ashamed. You'll forget the shame of your youth; you won't remember the disgrace of your widowhood;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> because your husband is your Maker; his name is Yahveh of Hosts; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh has called to you like a wife abandoned and grieving, like a young woman divorced.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> For a short time I separated from you, but I'll bring you back with mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> To show you my anger, I withdrew from you awhile; but with enduring love, I'll have mercy on you now," Yahveh your Redeemer says. 9"This is like Noah's time to me, when I swore that water like he saw wouldn't flood the world again; In that same way I swear now that I won't be angry with you or rebuke you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Mountains may quake and hills may shake, but I won't remove my enduring love from you or break my covenant for peace with you," Yahveh says who has mercy for you. 11"Suffering city, storm-tossed and uncomforted, I'll rebuild you with stones set in antimony and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll make your battlements out of rubies, your gates out of carbuncles, your entire wall out of precious stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> All your descendants will be Yahveh's disciples; they'll prosper greatly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> You'll be established in goodness far from fear and oppression; terror won't get near you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> If anybody assaults you, it won't be because I sent them; whoever attacks you will fall in defeat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I've created blacksmiths that blow the burning coals and make weapons for their purpose; I've also created destroyers that ruin them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> No weapon designed to oppose you will achieve its aim; you'll refute whoever brings charges against you in court. I'll vindicate you," 	Yahveh says. Invitation to Yahveh's Salvation</span>
