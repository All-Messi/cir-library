## Isaiah Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The desert wilderness will be happy; the Arabah will blossom profusely with crocuses, and sing and celebrate. It will be as glorious as Lebanon, as majestic as Carmel and Sharon. They'll see the glory of Yahveh, the majesty of our God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Strengthen feeble hands; steady weak knees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Say to those with pounding hearts, "Be strong and not afraid; your God will avenge you and save you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He'll open the eyes of the blind and unplug the ears of the deaf.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The lame will leap like a deer, and the mute will shout for joy, because water will gush out into the wilderness, and streams will water the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Parched land will become a marsh; springs will moisten the thirsty ground; The jackals' dens will become a swamp. grass will give way to reeds and rushes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> There'll be a new highway there called The Highway of Holiness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Lions won't lurk along it; vicious animals won't hunt by it. Such as those won't live there, but the redeemed will walk on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The ones Yahveh ransoms will return to Zion with happy shouts and crowned with everlasting joy. They'll find happiness and joy; sorrow and sighing will fade away. Sennacherib Invades Judah</span>
