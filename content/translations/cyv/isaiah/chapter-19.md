## Isaiah Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Egypt Yahveh is riding a swift cloud to Egypt; Egypt's idols tremble in his presence; the Egyptians' hearts melt. 2"I'll pit the Egyptians against one another, brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor; city against city, district against district.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They'll be demoralized; I'll confuse their strategy so they'll resort to their idols and spirits of the dead, to mediums and spiritists.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll deliver them to a cruel master; a powerful king will rule them," the Lord Yahveh of Hosts says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Nile will dry up; its riverbed will be parched and dry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The canals from the Nile will get foul; the braiding streams in the delta will trickle and dry up; reeds and rushes will rot.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Bulrushes by the Nile and the sown fields beside it will dry up and disappear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Fishermen will chant a dirge; the ones that cast lines in the Nile will mourn; those who spread nets on the water will lose heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The ones that manufacture linen from combed flax or weave white cloth will despair.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Business owners will go bankrupt; their hired laborers will grieve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The officials in Zoan are simply fools; Pharaoh's best advisors give stupid advice. How can you brag to Pharaoh that you're wise, descendants of ancient kings?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Where are your wise men, Pharaoh? Let them understand, have them tell you what Yahveh of Hosts has planned for Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The officials in Zoan are simply fools; the nobles in Memphis are deluded; the cornerstones of its tribes have misled the country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh has stirred up confusion in them, they've led Egypt astray in everything it's doing, like a drunk staggering in his vomit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> There's nothing helpless Egypt can do with its head or tail, palm branch or reed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The Egyptians will be like women then, cringing with fear as the fist of Yahveh of Hosts shakes over them. 17Judah will terrorize Egypt. They'll dread hearing Judah mentioned because Yahveh has laid out his purpose against them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At that time, five cities in Egypt will start speaking Hebrew and swear allegiance to Yahveh of Hosts—Heliopolis for one. 19There'll be an altar to him in Egypt and a monument to him at its border, 20a sign and witness. When they call out to him against oppressors, he'll send them a champion to rescue them. 21That's how he'll make himself known to them. They'll even worship with sacrifice and offering, take vows to him and keep them. 22He'll strike Egypt, striking then healing them, so they'll come back to him. 23-24A highway then will run from Egypt to Assyria, and people will travel to each other and worship together. Israel will be the third member in an alliance with Egypt and Assyria, with Yahveh's blessing located between the two. 25"Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, Israel my permanent possession." A Sign Against Egypt and Nubia</span>
