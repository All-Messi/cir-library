## Isaiah Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Come close, nations, and listen! world and everything in it, pay attention.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh is furious with the nations and their armies; he'll destroy them and deliver them to slaughter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Their slain will be thrown out; their corpses will reek; their blood will soak the hillsides.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The stars will fade out; the sky will roll up like a scroll. it'll wither away like leaves on a grapevine or fig tree. 5"My sword has drunk its fill in the sky; it will come down in condemnation on Edom, a nation I've devoted to complete destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> My sword will be bloody, covered with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat on the kidneys of rams; because I'll hold a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in Edom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Wild oxen will fall with them, male calves and great bulls; Its ground will be soaked with blood; its dust will be greasy from fat."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh will have a day of vengeance, a year of payback for what Edom did to Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Edom's wadis will run with pitch; its dirt will become sulfur; its ground will be covered with burning tar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> It won't go out day or night; its smoke will rise endlessly. Generation after generation it won't be inhabited; nobody will ever travel through it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Hawks and hedgehogs will take it over; owls and ravens will roost there. God will measure it for desolation, hold a plumb line on it for chaos.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> There won't be anyone to call king; no princes, or nobles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Thorns will grow in its fortresses; nettles and thistles will come up in its forts. It'll be a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Desert animals will mix with hyenas; hairy goats will bleat to one another; the night monster [Lilith] will settle down to rest there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Owls will make nests and lay their eggs there; they'll hatch them and gather the brood under their shadow. Buzzards will gather there in nesting pairs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Read about them in the Book of Yahveh; every one is mentioned there with its mate because he has commanded, and his Spirit will gather them by kinds in pairs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He has surveyed the land and deeded it over to them forever. Joy for the Redeemed</span>
