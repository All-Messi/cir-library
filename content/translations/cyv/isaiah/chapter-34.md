### 5“My sword has drunk its fill in the sky; 		it will come down in condemnation on Edom, 			a nation I’ve devoted to complete destruction.


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong><em><sup>6</sup></em></strong><em>My</em><em> sword will be bloody,</em> <em>	</em><em>	covered with the blood of lambs and goats,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	with </em><em>the fat</em><em> on the kidneys of </em><em>rams;</em> <em>	</em><em>	because I’ll hold a sacrifice in Bozrah,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	a great slaughter in Edom.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong><em><sup>7</sup></em></strong><em>Wild</em><em> oxen will fall with them,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	male calves and great </em><em>bulls;</em> <em>	</em><em>	 Its ground will be soaked with </em><em>blood;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	its dust will be greasy from fat.”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 34:6-7</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Yahveh will have a day of vengeance, a year of payback for what Edom did to Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Edom’s wadis will run with pitch; its dirt will become sulfur; its ground will be covered with burning tar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>It won’t go out day or night; its smoke will rise endlessly. Generation after generation it won’t be inhabited; nobody will ever travel through it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Hawks and hedgehogs will take it over; owls and ravens will roost there. God will measure it for desolation, hold a plumb line on it for chaos.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 34:8-11</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There won’t be anyone to call king; no princes, or nobles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Thorns will grow in its fortresses; nettles and thistles will come up in its forts. It’ll be a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Desert animals will mix with hyenas; hairy goats will bleat to one another; the night monster [Lilith] will settle down to rest there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Owls will make nests and lay their eggs there; they’ll hatch them and gather the brood under their shadow. Buzzards will gather there in nesting pairs.			<strong>Is</strong><strong> 34:12-15</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Read about them in the Book of Yahveh; every one is mentioned there with its mate because he has commanded, and his Spirit will gather them by kinds in pairs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He has surveyed the land and deeded it over to them forever.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 34:16-17</strong> <strong>Joy for the Redeemed</strong></span>
