## Isaiah Chapter 43

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But this is what Yahveh your creator says, Jacob, the One that formed you, Israel, "You don't need to be afraid, because I've redeemed you and called you by name. You're mine!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> When you pass through the sea, I'm with you; when you cross rivers, they won't flood over you; when you walk through fire, the flame won't burn you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> because I'm Yahveh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I've given Egypt to ransom you, Nubia and Seba in exchange for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Since you're precious to me, since you're honored and I love you, I'll trade other people in return for you, others in exchange for your life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You don't need to be afraid, because I'm with you; I'll bring your offspring from the east and west.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Quit holding onto them.' Bring my sons and daughters from distant countries—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> everyone that wears my name, that I've created for my honor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Bring out the blind, though they have eyes, and the deaf, though they have ears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Gather the nations; assemble the peoples. Which of their idols can tell about the past? They need to present witnesses to justify themselves that what they say is true. 10"You're my witnesses, Israel," Yahveh says, "the servant I've chosen so you can know me and believe me, and understand that I'm the only One; no god ever existed before me; none will exist after me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'm Yahveh; there's no Savior but me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm the One that predicted it, did it, and proclaimed it before there was any foreign god among you; so you're my witnesses," Yahveh says; "I'm God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> From eternity I'm God; No one can take anyone away from me; no one can undo what I do." Yahveh's Promised Victory</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> This is what Yahveh your Rescuer says, "To help you, I'll dispatch an army against Babylon to drive them out as refugees in the ships they're proud of; the Babylonians' celebration will turn into mourning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'm your King, Israel's Creator,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> who made a path through the Red Sea, a road through the flood,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> who brought out in Egypt horse and chariot, army and soldier. They all lay down at the same time, drowned, snuffed out like a flickering wick.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But don't just recall those former things or ponder the past.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Duly note something new I'm doing now; it's happening; see it? I'm making, like before, a highway in the wilderness, streams in the desert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Wild animals will honor me, jackals and owls; because I've put water in the wilderness and streams in the desert so my people can drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The people I created for myself at that time will one day declare my praise worldwide. 22"Yet recently you haven't called on me for help, Jacob; you're tired of me, Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You haven't brought me the sheep for your burnt offerings or honored me with your sacrifices, though I haven't burdened you down with offerings or worn you out with incense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You haven't bought any calamus for me or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. Instead, you've burdened me down with your sins; I'm tired of your iniquities. 25"I, yes, I am the One that will erase your transgressions for my own sake and not hold onto your sin against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Remember me; let's debate our case together; state your evidence for being innocent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But from the time of your first ancestor through your subsequent leaders, you've sinned against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So I profaned the priests of the sanctuary; I delivered Jacob to total destruction and Israel to lasting contempt.</span>
