## Isaiah Chapter 49

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen, far off lands; pay attention, distant nations. Yahveh called me before I was born; he named me inside my mother's body.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He made my mouth like a sharp sword and hid me under his hand; he made a polished arrow out of me and put me in his quiver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He told me, "You're my servant, Israel; I'll demonstrate my glory in you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But I replied, "I haven't really accomplished anything; I've just worn myself out for nothing; yet surely my just due is in Yahveh's hands; I'll have to trust him for my reward."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant and bring Jacob back to him (because Yahveh values me and strengthens me): 6"It's not a minor thing to serve me and restore the remnant in Israel; I'll also make you a light to the Gentiles, to take the news about my salvation all over the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> This is what Israel's Redeemer says to the despised nation, the one that other nations abhor, the servant of rulers: "Kings will stand at attention when they see you; officials will bow because of Yahveh, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel that has chosen you." The Restoration of Israel Promised</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh says, "I'll respond to you at an appropriate time and help you when you need deliverance. I'll offer you as a covenant to the people to restore Israel's land, to parcel out its deserted territories,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> to say to the ones in bonds, 'Be free,' and to those in darkness, 'Come out into the light.' My 'sheep' will graze along the roads and pasture on the former barren hills.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They won't be hungry or thirsty; the scorching heat won't oppress them, because the One that shows them mercy will lead them to springs of running water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'll make my mountains a level road and raise my highways above the valleys.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They'll come from a long way off, some from the north and west, some from the region of Sinim."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Shout for joy, earth; celebrate, sky! Break out into singing, mountains! Yahveh will comfort his people and shown mercy to his suffering ones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yet Zion says, "Yahveh has abandoned me; he's forgotten about me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But Yahveh says, "Can a mother forget her nursing child or withhold mercy from the son she bore? Even if you forget, I won't.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I've written your name on my palms; your fallen walls are always on my mind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Those who rebuild you will soon return to start their work; the ones that want to destroy you will leave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Look up and around; your people are gathering to you. As I live," Yahveh says, "you'll put them all on like a bride attaches jewels to her wedding gown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> In place of your empty spaces, you'll be overrun with residents; your enemies that swallowed you will be long gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The children born in exile will tell you it's too crowded here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You'll ask yourselves. 'Who was their father? I was bereaved and barren, wandering in exile; I was alone; who had all these children? Who raised them?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The Lord Yahveh says, "I'll signal to the nations to bring back your boys in their arms and to carry your little girls on their shoulders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Kings will be your foster fathers; queens will be your nurses. They'll bow to you, and lick the dust off your feet. You'll know I'm Yahveh; the ones that trust me won't be disappointed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Can anybody steal prey back from a warrior or rescue captives from a tyrant?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Yahveh says, "I'll even retrieve the captives of the strong and rescue the tyrant's prey. I'll combat anybody that combats you, and save your children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'll make your oppressors eat their own flesh and get drunk on their own blood. Everyone will know I'm Yahveh, your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob." Israel's Sin and the Servant's Obedience</span>
