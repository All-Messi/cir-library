## Isaiah Chapter 63

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Who is this that's coming from Edom in crimson clothes from Bozrah, one majestic in attire and marching with such power? "The One that's announcing vindication, that has the strength to save."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Why are your clothes stained red like those who tread out grapes? 3"Ineed, I've been treading in a winepress—alone; nobody from the nations could help me; so I tramped down my foes in my fury; their life blood spattered my garments and stained my clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I've had a day for payback on my mind; a year for redemption to come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But I looked, amazed that there was no one to intervene for the oppressed; so my own arm did the saving; anger sustained me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I tramped down nations in my fury and made them drunk in my wrath; I poured out their blood on the ground." Praise for Deliverance</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll recount the praises and tell about Yahveh's enduring love in proportion to everything he has granted us; I'll declare the great goodness he has shown in proportion to his mercy and kindness toward Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "They're my people, offspring that surely won't betray me again; so he saved them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> In all their adversity he felt their suffering; so he sent the angel from his presence to save them. In his love and mercy, he redeemed them; he picked them up and carried them like he'd done in the past.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But they did rebel and grieve his Holy Spirit; so he became their enemy and opposed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then his people remembered the past at Moses' time. "Where's the One that brought them up from the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is the One that put his Holy Spirit among them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> that showed his power when Moses raised his right hand, that divided the water for them to make an eternal name for himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> that led them through the deep sea? Like a horse in open country, they didn't stumble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> like livestock that goes down to a sheltered valley, the Spirit of Yahveh gave them rest; that's the way he led his people to make a glorious name for himself." Prayer for Pardon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Look down from heaven, from your holy house; where are your zeal and powerful deeds? I don't sense the mercy you used to have toward us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Even if Abraham would disown us and Israel wouldn't recognize us, you'd still be our Father and Redeemer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh, why let us stray from your ways and harden our hearts against you? For our sake, bring us back as your special possession.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Your holy people had your sanctuary for a while, but our adversaries have tramped it down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> We've become like a nation you never ruled, like people that never wore your name.</span>
