## Isaiah Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Visions Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw About Judah and Jerusalem During the Reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah Rebellious Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen, earth and sky, Yahveh says, "I brought up sons, but they've rebelled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> An ox knows its owner, and a donkey recognizes its owner's manger, but Israel doesn't know me; my people don't recognize that I'm the One who provided for them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Sinful nation, people weighed down with iniquity, offspring of sinners who deal falsely, you've rejected Yahveh, despised the Holy One of Israel, and turned away from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Where else can he strike you as you just keep on rebelling? Your head is sick; your heart is faint.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There's nothing healthy in you from head to toe, just bruises, sores, and open wounds without compress or bandage, or ointment to soften them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your country lies in ruins; your towns have been burned. Foreigners stole your crops while you watched; it's a wasteland they've overthrown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zion is like a shed in a deserted vineyard, like a watchman's hut in an old cucumber patch, like a city under siege.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If Yahveh of Hosts hadn't left us a few survivors, we'd be like Sodom and Gomorrah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Listen to Yahveh's message, rulers in "Sodom"; hear our God's teaching, people in "Gomorrah": 11"Why are you offering me all these sacrifices? I've had enough of your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of your grain-fed cattle; I'm not happy with the blood of bulls, lambs, and goats.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When you show up to worship me, who's making you tramp on my courts?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don't keep bringing me your worthless offerings; I detest their incense. New moons, Sabbaths, scheduled assemblies— I can't endure any more of your solemn assemblies mixed with your sinfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I despise your new moon celebrations and stated festivals; they're a drag to me; I'm tired of them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When you spread out your hands, I won't look; though you offer lots of prayers, I won't be listening; your spread-out hands have bloodshed on them. 16"Take baths and get cleaned up; get your sins out of my sight; give up doing sinful things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Learn how to do good, seek out justice, correct ruthless people, defend orphans, fight for widows' rights. 18"Come, now; let's talk," Yahveh says. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they can be as white as snow; if they're red like crimson, they can be like wool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> If you start obeying me, you'll eat the best in the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> If you refuse and rebel, your enemies' sword will overwhelm you." Yahveh has told you the truth. Unfaithful Jerusalem</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> How the once-faithful city has become a prostitute, she that used to be full of justice! Goodness used to lodge there; now murderers do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Your once-pure silver has turned to dross; your drink's been diluted with water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Your rulers rebel, your friends steal; everybody likes bribes and requires kickbacks; they don't defend orphans or let widows' cases come to trial.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So the Lord Yahveh of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says, "I avenge myself of my enemies; I take vengeance on my adversaries;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I'll turn against you; I'll smelt away your dross with lye and remove your impurities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'll make your judges like they were at first and your advisors the way they were in the beginning; after that, you'll be called 'The City of Righteousness,' 'The Faithful City.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Justice will redeem Zion; repentance will lead to goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But Yahveh will crush rebels and sinners; those who forsake him will meet their end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> You'll be ashamed of the sacred terebinth groves you delighted in, embarrassed by the gardens you chose to worship your idols in;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> because you'll be like a terebinth tree with withered leaves and a garden with no water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The strong will become kindling, and their evil work the spark that lights it; everything will burn up with nobody able to put out the fire. Yahveh's Future Reign</span>
