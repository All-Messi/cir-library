## Isaiah Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, Yahveh will punish Leviathan with his fierce, big strong sword, Leviathan the swift, slithering snake. He'll kill the dragon that's in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Then, "There'll be a delightful vineyard to sing about!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I, Yahveh, will be its keeper; I'll water it constantly and guard it day and night so no one harms it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I won't be angry anymore. If anybody gives me briars and thorns in battle, I'll trample and burn them completely</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> unless they rely on me for protection. Let them make peace with me; let them make peace with me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In time to come, Jacob will take root; Israel will sprout and blossom, and fill the world with fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Has Yahveh struck Israel the way he struck Israel's strikers? Has he slain Israel the way he slew Israel's slayers?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> No, he contended with Israel by banishing them, expelling them with his fierce east wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So that's how he'll purge Jacob's iniquity; that's what pardoning its sin will cost, when God makes pagan altar stones like pulverized chalk, when he leaves no Asherah pole or incense altar standing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The fortified towns will be deserted, their houses empty as in open country; calves will graze there and bed down; they'll chew on brush and branches there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When those branches dry up, they'll break off and women will gather them for kindling; this nation doesn't use any sense; so their Maker won't show them any mercy; their Creator won't be gracious to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yet in time, Israel, Yahveh will start gleaning from the Euphrates River to the River of Egypt and gather you up one by one. 13A large trumpet will blow, and the exiles who were perishing in Assyria and Egypt will come to Jerusalem to worship Yahveh on his holy mountain.
