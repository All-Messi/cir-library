## Isaiah Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About Damascus "Damascus will stop being a city, and become a pile of ruins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The villages around Aroer will be deserted; flocks will bed down in them, with no one to chase them away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Fortified towns will disappear from Ephraim, sovereignty from Damascus and the remnant from Syria; they'll be like Israel's departed glory," Yahveh of hosts says. 4"At that time, Jacob's glory will fade; his robust body will grow frail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It will look like a grainfield after harvest, like someone gleaning grain heads one at a time in the Valley of Rephaim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yet some gleanings will be left— like shaking an olive tree, two or three olives on the highest branch, four or five on a fruitful limb," Yahveh God of Israel says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At that time, people will finally care about their Maker and look to the Holy One of Israel. 8They won't care about the altars, the work of their hands, or rely on what their fingers have made, the Asherah poles, and incense stands. 9Their largest towns will be like places the Hivites and Amorites deserted when the Israelites came. Desolation will prevail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've forgotten the God who can save you, the Rock where you could hide. So, though you plant nice plants and set them as seedlings from a foreign god,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> though you make them sprout the day you plant them, put a hedge around them and get them to blossom the same morning — you won't pick any grapes from them; harvest time will be a time of grief and unrelieved pain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Ah, the uproar of many nations like the roar of the ocean, like the rumbling of a flash flood!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The nations rumble on like flooding water, but he'll rebuke them, and they'll flee like chaff in the mountain wind, like whirling dust ahead of a storm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> In the evening Israel will wait in terror, but by morning its enemies will be dead! That's what will happen to the ones that plunder us, a proper end for those who pillage us. An Oracle About Nubia</span>
