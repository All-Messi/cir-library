## Isaiah Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About the Valley of Vision What's the matter with you? Why are you all running up to the housetops?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You noisy, exuberant city in an uproar, your dead weren't slain in battle, but by famine and disease.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Your rulers all fled together and were captured without resistance; your people were discovered and taken captive too, though they'd tried to escape.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So I said, "Leave me alone to weep bitterly; don't try to comfort me about the destruction of my people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts has in mind a day of panic, trampling, and confusion in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and outcries echoing off the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Elam will take up the quiver with chariots, infantry, and cavalry; Kir will uncover the shield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Chariots will fill your beautiful valleys; cavalry will storm the gates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> God will take down Judah's defenses.	Is 22:4-8a At that time, you depend on the weapons in the House of the Forest</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> when you see how many breaches were in the wall of David's city; you store up water from the lower pool;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> you tear down some of the houses to get materials to fortify the wall;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> you create a reservoir between the walls to hold water from the old pool; but you don't ask for help from the One that made all this or consider the One that planned it long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts had called for you to weep, wail, shave your head, and put on burlap. 13Instead, you've celebrated with revelry, butchering cattle and sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: "Let's eat and drink; tomorrow we die." 14Yahveh of Hosts revealed this to me, "I won't forgive that sin as long as you live."  	Is 22:8b-14 An Oracle for Shebna</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts says, "Go ask Shebna, the palace administrator, 16'Who are you that you've hewn out a monumental tomb for yourself here high in the rock? 17-19Arrogant man! I'm going to depose you from your office, wad you into a ball, and throw you away into a large country to die there with your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master's house. 20-21I'll put your robe on my servant Eliakim Ben-Hilkiah and tie your sash around him. I'll entrust him with your authority, and he'll become a father to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 22I'll hang on his shoulder the key to David's house. When he opens, no one will shut; when he shuts, nobody will open. 23I'll drive him like a stake in solid ground. He'll become famous, 24and they'll place on him the prestige of his family, from offspring and issue to the least items of bowls and jars. 25But then the peg driven in solid ground will break off, and the load hanging on it will fall to the ground. I, Yahveh, have said so.'"</span>
