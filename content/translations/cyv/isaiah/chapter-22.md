## Isaiah Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Oracle About the Valley of Vision What’s the matter with you? Why are you all running up to the housetops?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You noisy, exuberant city in an uproar, your dead weren’t slain in battle, but by famine and disease.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Your rulers all fled together and were captured without resistance; your people were discovered and taken captive too, though they’d tried to escape.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is 22:1-3</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So I said, <em>“</em><em>Leave me alone to</em><em> weep </em><em>bitterly</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>d</em><em>on’t try to comfort me about the destruction of my </em><em>people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Lord Yahveh of Hosts has in mind a day of panic, trampling, and confusion in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and outcries echoing off the mountains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Elam will take up the quiver with chariots, infantry, and cavalry; Kir will uncover the shield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Chariots will fill your beautiful valleys; cavalry will storm the gates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>God</em> will take down Judah’s defenses.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 22:4-</strong><strong>8a</strong> At that time, you depend on the weapons in the House of the Forest</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>when you see how many breaches were in the wall of David’s city; you store up water from the lower pool;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> you tear down some of the houses to get materials to fortify the wall;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> you create a reservoir between the walls to hold water from the old pool; but you don’t ask for help from the One that made all this or consider the One that planned it long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts had called for you to weep, wail, shave <em>your</em> head, and put on burlap. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Instead, you’ve celebrated with revelry, butchering cattle and sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: <em>“Let’s </em><em>eat</em><em> and drink</em><em>;</em><em> tomorrow</em><em> we die</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Yahveh of Hosts revealed this to me, <em>“</em><em>I won’t forgive that sin as long as you live.</em><em>”</em>  	<strong>Is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>22:8b-14</strong> <strong>An Oracle for Shebna</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts says, <em>“</em><em>Go ask Shebna, the palace administrator, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>‘W</em><em>ho</em><em> </em><em>are you that</em><em> you</em><em>’ve </em><em>hewn out</em><em> </em><em>a </em><em>monumental </em><em>tomb for yourself </em><em>here high </em><em>in the rock?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Arrogant</em><em> man! I’m going to depose you from your office, wad you into a ball, and throw you away into a large country to die there with your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master’s house. </em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> put your robe on my servant Eliakim Ben-Hilkiah </em><em>and tie your sash around him.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll entrust him with your authority, and he’ll become a father to the people in </em><em>Judah and </em><em>Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> hang on his shoulder the key to David’s house. When he opens, no one will shut; when he shuts, nobody will open. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> drive him like a stake in solid ground. He’ll become famous, </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> they’ll place on him the prestige of his family, from offspring and issue to the least items of bowls and jars. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> then the peg driven in solid ground will break off, and the load hanging on it will fall to the ground. </em>I,<em> Yahveh, have said so.’”</em><strong>	      </strong><strong>   </strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 22:15-25</strong></span>
