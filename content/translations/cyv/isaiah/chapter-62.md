## Isaiah Chapter 62

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For Zion's sake I'll speak to God; for Jerusalem's sake I won't keep still, until your goodness glows brightly, and your salvation radiates like a burning torch;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> so the nations can witness your goodness and kings can gaze at your glory. Yahveh himself will give you a new name.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You'll be a beautiful crown in his hand, a royal diadem he holds up high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You won't be called Abandoned [Azubah] anymore or your land be named Desolate [Shemamah]; you'll be My Delight Is in It [Hephzibah], and your land will be Married [Beulah], because he delights in you, and your land will be married to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Like a young man marries a virgin, your sons will marry you, Jerusalem; like a groom is happy over a bride, your God will be happy over you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've stationed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem, not to be silent day or night, but to remember you to Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> till he makes you something worth praising in the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He has sworn by his right hand and strong arm, "I'll never again let your enemies eat your grain or foreigners drink the new wine you labored for.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But the ones that put the grain in the granary will eat it and praise me; the ones that pick the grapes will drink the wine in the courts of my sanctuary."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Go out through the gates; clear the way for my people. Build a highway so they can return; get the loose rocks off the road. Hoist a flag the nations can see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh has declared all over the world, "Tell Zion its salvation's coming; he's bringing his reward with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They'll call you The Holy People [Ha'am Haggadosh], Yahveh's Redeemed [Ge'ule-adonai], The Sought For, A City No Longer Forsaken. Vengeance Against Israel's Enemies</span>
