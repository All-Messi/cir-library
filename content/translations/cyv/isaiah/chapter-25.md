## Isaiah Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh, you're my God. I'll honor and thank you for doing the wonderful things you planned long ago.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You've reduced fortified towns to ruble; the foreigners' palaces will never be rebuilt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So strong people will honor you; towns in ruthless nations will come to revere you,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> because you've defended the helpless and needy in their despair; you're a shelter from the storm and a shade from heat, because the breath of ruthless people is like a storm beating on a wall</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> or stifling heat in drought. You weaken the threats of foreigner powers like a cloud's shadow lessens heat; the raucous war songs of the ruthless fall silent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> On this mountain Yahveh of Hosts will hold a lavish banquet for everybody in the world, a banquet of aged wine and choice meat. 7Here he'll remove the shadow that lies over every country, the veil that covers the nations. 8He'll swallow up death for all time, wipe away everyone's tears, and remove the abuse of his people everywhere. Yahveh has said so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, people will say, "This is the God we've waited for to save us. He's Yahveh; let's celebrate and be glad he's done it." 10His hand will rest on this mountain, and Moab will be trodden down like straw in the urine of a manure pit. 11He'll subdue Moab like a swimmer pushes down water. He'll end its pride and slight-of-hand. 12He'll bring down its impregnable fortifications and throw them on the ground. A Song of Praise to the LORD</span>
