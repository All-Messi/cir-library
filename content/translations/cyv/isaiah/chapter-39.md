## Isaiah Chapter 39

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Soon after this, Merodach-baladan Ben-Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah because he'd heard he'd been sick and had recovered. 2That pleased Hezekiah, and he showed the ambassadors everything in his treasure house, the silver and gold, the spices and precious oil, his whole armory, and everything in his royal treasuries. There wasn't anything in his palace or kingdom that he didn't show them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then Isaiah came to ask him, "What did those men say? Where'd they come from?" "From a distant country, Babylon." 4"What have they seen in your palace?" "Everything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then Isaiah said, "Listen to a message from Yahveh of Hosts: 6'The time's coming when everything in your palace, everything your ancestors have stored up, will be carried off to Babylon. 7Some of your sons will be taken and made officials in the palace of its king.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Hezekiah told Isaiah, "That's a good message you've brought from Yahveh." (He was thinking, "At least there'll be peace and truth in my time.") Comfort for God's People</span>
