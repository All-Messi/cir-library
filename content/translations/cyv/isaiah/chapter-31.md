## Isaiah Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune lies ahead for those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, that trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are strong, instead of looking to the Holy One of Israel, instead of consulting Yahveh!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He's wise and brings disaster and doesn't take back what he says; he rises up at the sinful and their helpers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Egyptians are people, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. So Yahveh will hold out his fist, and the one that helps them will stumble, the one that's helped will fall. They'll meet their end together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh says to me, "Like a young lion growls over its prey and shepherds' shouts don't scare it away, I'llY come down to wage war on Mount Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Like a hovering bird I'll guard Jerusalem, protect and deliver it, spare and rescue it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Come back to the One you've rebelled against, Israel, 7and throw away the silver and gold idols you've made. 8"The Assyrians will fall by a sword that's not human; a sword that's not human will devour them. They won't escape, and their young soldiers will become slaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Their 'rock' will pass away in panic; their princes will desert the standard," Yahveh says, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is Jerusalem. Israel's Ultimate Deliverance</span>
