## Isaiah Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A sapling will grow out of Jesse's stump; a branch from his roots will bear fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh's spirit will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and insight, counsel and strength, knowledge and respect for Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He'll delight in respecting Yahveh; he won't judge by appearances or render verdicts based on hearsay.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He'll judge the poor justly and decide for the meek fairly. He'll shake the ground with the force of his words and blow the sinful away with his breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Faithfulness will be his cloak; goodness will be his belt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Wolves will live with lambs; leopards will lie down beside baby goats; calves, lion cubs, and grain-fed animals will herd together; and a little child will herd them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Cows will graze beside bears; their young will bed down together; lions will eat straw like oxen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A nursing baby will play by a cobra pit; a weaned child will put his hand in a viper's hole.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nothing will do harm anywhere on my holy mountain, because the land will be full of knowledge of Yahveh like the ocean is full of water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> At that time, Jesse's heir will serve as a banner for the Gentiles. They'll rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11For a second time he'll recover the remnant of his people that are left in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands in the sea. 12He'll hoist a flag for the nations and repatriate the exiles of Israel and Judah from every direction. 13Ephraim and Judah won't resent each other or harass one another. 14They'll swoop down on the Philistines in the west and together plunder the nations to the east. They'll control Edom and Moab, and subjugate the Ammonites. 15Yahveh will dry up the Red Sea by Egypt and blow his scorching wind on the Euphrates River. He'll separate it into seven channels so people can wade across in sandals. 16There'll be a highway from Assyria for the remnant to return on, like there was for Israel when he brought them out of Egypt. A Song of Praise for Salvation</span>
