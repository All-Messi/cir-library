## Isaiah Chapter 11

### A Branch from Jesse

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A sapling will grow out of Jesse’s stump; a branch from his roots will bear fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh’s spirit will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and insight, counsel and strength, knowledge and respect for Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He’ll delight in respecting Yahveh; he won’t judge by appearances or render verdicts based on hearsay.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He’ll judge the poor justly and decide for the meek fairly. He’ll shake the ground with the force of his words and blow the sinful away with his breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Faithfulness will be his cloak; goodness will be his belt.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 11:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Wolves will live with lambs; leopards will lie down beside baby goats; calves, lion cubs, and grain-fed animals will herd together; and a little child will herd them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Cows will graze beside bears; their young will bed down together; lions will eat straw like oxen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A nursing baby will play by a cobra pit; a weaned child will put his hand in a viper’s hole.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nothing will do harm anywhere on my holy mountain, because the land will be full of knowledge of Yahveh like the ocean is full of water.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 11:6-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> At that time, Jesse’s heir will serve as a banner for the Gentiles. They’ll rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For a second time he’ll recover the remnant of his people that are left in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands in the sea. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He’ll hoist a flag for the nations and repatriate the exiles of Israel and Judah from every direction. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Ephraim and Judah won’t resent each other or harass one another. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They’ll swoop down on the Philistines in the west and together plunder the nations to the east. They’ll control Edom and Moab, and subjugate the Ammonites. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Yahveh will dry up the <em>Red </em>Sea by Egypt and blow his scorching wind on the Euphrates <em>River</em>. He’ll separate it into seven channels so people can wade across in sandals. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>There’ll be a highway from Assyria for the remnant to return on, like there was for Israel when he brought them out of Egypt.</span>
