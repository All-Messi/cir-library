<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, you'll say, "Thank you, Yahveh; though you were angry with me, you turned your anger away and reassured me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> You're my salvation; I'll trust you and not be afraid, because you're my strength and song."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> So I'll draw water with joy from the wells of salvation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> and say, "Thank Yahveh, call on him; tell everyone what he's done; tell them his name is Honored.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Sing praises to him because he's done excellent things; tell it all over the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Sing and shout for joy, you that live in Zion, because the Holy One that lives with you is great."</span>
