## Isaiah Chapter 59

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> It's not that Yahveh's hand is not too weak to save or his ear too deaf to hear you call.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It's your iniquities that have separated you from him; your sins have shut him off from you, so he ignores you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've defiled your hands with blood, your fingers with sin, your lips with lying, your tongues with gossip.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> None of you brings just suits or argues cases honestly; you hide behind double talk and perjury; you conceive schemes and give birth to sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs; whoever eats the eggs dies; snakes hatch from the cracked eggs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your webs can't become clothes; you can't dress yourselves with what you've made. Your deeds are sinful; you use your hands for violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You hurry to do harm, run to shed blood, and think sinful things; destruction lies scattered along your highways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> You don't know any road that leads to peace; you give the wrong directions; whoever follows them gets lost.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So justice is a long way off from you; right living doesn't help you. You hope for light, but it's dark here; you look for sunny days but live in gloom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You grope along the wall like the blind and fumble around like people without eyes; you stumble around as much at noon as you do at dusk, like the dead among the living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You growl like bears and moan like pigeons; you look for justice, but it doesn't come; you want salvation, but it's a distant prospect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You've multiplied your sins right in God's face; they testify against you. You know you're sinful;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> you transgress and deny Yahveh and turn your backs on him. You advocate oppression and rebellion, conceive and tell lies from the heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The courts oppose justice; it's nowhere near; truth stumbles in the streets; honesty is illegal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> b-16Yahveh was amazed; it displeased him that there was no justice. Nobody was intervening to help the oppressed; so he brought about salvation himself and sustained it with his goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He put on goodness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he dressed himself in vengeance and wrapped himself with zeal like a mantle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He'll repay his adversaries according to their deeds, recompense his enemies with his anger, and carry out retribution to the ends of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So they'll fear Yahveh in the west and honor him from the rising of the sun, because he'll come like a rushing tide that he drives with the wind. 20"A redeemer will come to Zion, to those who turn from sin in Jacob," Yahveh says.    Is 59:15b-20 21"This is my covenant with you: my Spirit that's on you, my message that's in you won't leave you, your children, or grandchildren from now on." Israel's Future Glory</span>
