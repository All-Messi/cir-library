## Isaiah Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits you, Ariel, city where David camped! Year after year, you observe the festivals on schedule.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yet I'll bring disaster on you, Ariel; you'll lament and mourn; you'll be to me what Ariel means [blood-covered altar].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll camp against you all the way around and set up siege works and battle towers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You'll be brought low; you'll speak from the ground where you lie prostrate; you'll speak like a spirit conjured up from the dirt, like a whisper from the grave. 5"But suddenly your many enemies will be like fine dust blown away, ruthless attackers like chaff gone with a gust of wind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh of Hosts will visit you with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise, with whirlwind, storm, and consuming fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The nations that carry on war with you, Ariel, that attack your fortresses, will vanish like a dream at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll be like hungry people that dream they're eating, but wake up still hungry; or thirsty people that dream they're drinking, but wake up fainting from thirst. That's how it will be with the countries that attack Mount Zion."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But you linger and wait and blind yourselves. You're drunk, but not with wine; you're staggering, but not from alcohol;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> that's because Yahveh has poured a sleeping spirit over you; he's shut your eyes, prophets, and covered your heads, seers. 11-12This whole vision won't mean much to you, either because it's a sealed scroll to you or because you can't read. Literate or not, you won't get it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So Yahveh says, "These people come near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are somewhere else; their respect for me consists of memorizing human rules.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So I'll surprise these hypocrites once again with something awesome and amazing; the wisdom of the wise will perish; the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear. 15"Misfortune awaits people that try to hide their intentions from me, who do things in the dark and think I can't see them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You've got things turned around! Is a potter treated like clay so that what's made says to its maker, 'You didn't make me'; or what's formed says to the one that formed it, "You don't know what you're doing'"?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Isn't it just a little while till Lebanon becomes a fertile field and the fertile field becomes a forest?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At that time, the deaf will hear the message from the scroll; the blind will see through the gloom and darkness;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> the humble will have fresh happiness in Yahveh; the needy will celebrate in the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Ruthless people will come to nothing; scoffers won't scoff anymore; those intent on creating disorder will be destroyed—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> people that slander, that try to entrap the judge in court, that defraud the innocent with sophistry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So Yahveh that redeemed Abraham says of Jacob's houseouseHou, "They won't be ashamed anymore, or turn pale with fear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When they see their descendants around them, the work of my hands, they'll treat me as holy and stand in awe of me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The ignorant will know the truth; the stubborn will accept instruction." No Help from Egypt</span>
