## Isaiah Chapter 53

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Who has believed our message? Who has Yahveh shown his arm to? He grew up before Yahveh like a tender sprout, like a shoot out of parched ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He wasn't particularly handsome or noble to draw our attention to him or have the looks that would attract us to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> People despised and abandoned him, a pained man, acquainted with grief; like someone people look the other way from, we looked down on him and didn't respect him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Actually though, he was shouldering our weaknesses and carrying our pains, but we considered him someone God struck and made suffer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But he was pierced for our sins, crushed for our iniquities. The discipline that was for our welfare fell on him, and by his scourging we are healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We've all wandered off like sheep and turned to our own way; but Yahveh laid on him the sinfulness of us all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He was oppressed and suffering, but he didn't say anything; like a lamb they led to slaughter or a sheep silent before its shearers, he didn't open his mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He was taken away by oppression and condemnation; who realized at the time that he was being cut off from the living for the sins of my people, who deserved the stroke?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They assigned his grave with criminals though he hadn't deceived or been violent; yet he was associated with a rich man in his death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But it was Yahveh's plan to crush him, to put him to grief; when he offers himself as a guilt offering, he'll see his offspring and extend his life, and Yahveh will accomplish his good pleasure in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He'll see what results from his anguish and feel fulfilled; by his experience, my servant the upright one, will justify many by shouldering their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So God will assign him a place among the great, and he'll divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his life when they treated him like a transgressor. But he was shouldering many other people's sins and interceding for them. The Future Glory for Zion</span>
