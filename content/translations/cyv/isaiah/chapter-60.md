## Isaiah Chapter 60

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Arise, shine; your light has come; the glory of Yahveh has risen on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Darkness will cover the earth; thick blackness will blanket the nations; but Yahveh will shine on you; his glory will appear on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Nations will come to your light, kings to the brightness of your rising. 4"Look all around you; they're all gathering home to you. Your little boys will come from a long way off; your girls will be carried in arms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then your eyes will be radiant; you'll be thrilled and happy, because commerce from the sea will return to you, and the nations' wealth will be available to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Caravans of camels will cover you, young camels from Midian and Ephah. The ones from Sheba will bring gold and frankincense, and good news about the praises of Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The flocks of Kedar will gather to you; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you. I'll accept them on my altar and honor my Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who are these that fly like a cloud, like pigeons to their windows?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The distant lands will learn to trust in me; the ships from Tarshish will come first, bringing your descendants home from afar and their silver and gold with them for Yahveh your God, for the Holy One of Israel, because he's honored you. 10"Foreigners will rebuild your walls; their kings will be your servants. Though I struck you in my anger, now I'll have mercy on you in my favor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your gates will stay open day and night so nations can bring their wealth to you, and their kings can be led as captives in the victory procession.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Nations that won't serve you will perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The splendor of Lebanon will come on you, the juniper, box tree, and cypress tree together, to beautify the place for my feet in my sanctuary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The descendants of your oppressors will come bowing to you; your despisers will prostrate themselves at your feet. They'll call you The City of Yahveh, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 15"Whereas you've been hated, shunned, and abandoned, I'll make you something to be proud of forever, a joy for endless generations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You'll nurse on the milk of nations, breasts of kings; you'll know that I'm Yahveh, your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll bring gold for bronze, bronze for wood, silver for iron, iron for stone. I'll make peace your administrators and goodness your overseers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Violence will disappear from your land, war from inside your borders; you'll call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You won't need the sun for daylight or the moon to be bright. You'll have Yahveh for an everlasting light; he'll be your glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Your sun won't set anymore; your moon won't have phases. You'll have Yahveh for an everlasting light; your mourning will be over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Your people will be good; they'll own their land forever, the branch I planted with my own hands will honor me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The smallest will become a clan; the least will be a nation. I, Yahveh, will hurry it along when the time comes." The Year of Yahveh's Favor</span>
