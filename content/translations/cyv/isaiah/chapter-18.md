## Isaiah Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ah, land of fluttering wings, land beyond the headwaters of the Nile in Nubia,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> that sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats— go swiftly, ambassadors, to a nation tall and smooth, a people feared far and wide, a powerful, oppressive nation crisscrossed by rivers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> All of you that live in the world, look when I raise the signal on the mountains, listen when I blow the ram's horn,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> because Yahveh has told me: "I'll watch quietly from my Temple, as quietly as a cloud forming in the summer sunshine, like dew condensing at harvest time."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Before harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms and the flowers start turning into grapes, he'll snip off the new shoots with pruning shears and lop off the spreading branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your huge army will be left dead for the mountain buzzards and wild animals on the ground. The buzzards will spend the summer picking at the corpses; the wild animals will spend the winter gnawing on them till harvest time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> At that time, a nation tall and smooth will pay homage to Yahveh of Hosts— a people feared far and wide, a powerful, oppressive nation crisscrossed by rivers. They'll bring their gifts to Mount Zion, the place that wears the name Yahveh of Hosts.</span>
