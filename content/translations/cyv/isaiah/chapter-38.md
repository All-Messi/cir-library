## Isaiah Chapter 38

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Around that time, Hezekiah got deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, "Yahveh says to set your house in order; you're going to die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Hezekiah turned to the wall and prayed, 3"Yahwh, please remember how I've followed you honestly with all my heart and done what you consider good." He cried bitterly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then a message from Yahveh came to Isaiah: 5"Go back and tell Hezekiah that Yahveh God of your ancestor David says, 'I've heard your prayer and seen your tears. I'll give you 15 more years to live 6and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. 7This is the sign that I'll do what I've said: 8I'll make the shadow on Ahaz's stairway go back up 10 steps.'" So it went back up 10 steps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A Writing by Hezekiah, King of Judah, After His Illness and Recovery 10"In the prime of life, I was headed for the gates of Sheol, deprived of the rest of my life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I wouldn't see Yahveh again while I was alive or people in this world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Where I live was being blown away like a shepherd's tent. I've been rolling up my life like a weaver; he was cutting me off the loom, ending my life in one day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I called out for help all night; like a lion he was breaking all my bones, ending my life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I chattered like a swallow and a crane and moaned like a pigeon; my weary eyes look up wistfully, 'Help me, Yahveh, I'm oppressed.'" 15"What could I say? You let me know what you'd do and did it; I couldn't sleep because of the bitterness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh, people gain life by hard experiences; spiritual life comes from them all; now restore my health so I can live!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> My deep anguish was for my own good; you've kept me from the Pit of destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Sheol doesn't thank you; death doesn't praise you; those who go down to the Pit can't experience hope from your faithfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Only the living can thank you, as I do today; from parent to child, they tell about your faithfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Yahveh will surely save me; so we'll play my songs on stringed instruments the rest of our lives in his Temple."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Isaiah had said, "Apply fig salve to the boil so he can recover." 22Hezekiah had asked, "What's the sign that I'll go up to Yahveh's Temple?" Envoys from Babylon</span>
