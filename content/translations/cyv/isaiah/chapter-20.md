## Isaiah Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sargon, king of Assyria, sent his general to attack Ashdod. 2That year Yahveh spoke through Isaiah Ben-Amoz, "Take the burlap off your waist and remove your sandals." So he went around naked and barefoot. 3Yahveh said, "My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as an omen to Egypt and Nubia. 4The king of Assyria will lead captives away from there, young and old, naked and barefoot with their butts showing, to Egypt's humiliation. 5People will be disgraced and disappointed by Nubia their hope and Egypt their pride. 6The people along the coast will say, 'Look at what's happened to them! How can we escape who fled there for protection from the king of Assyria?!'"</span>
