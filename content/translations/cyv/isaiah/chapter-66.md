## Isaiah Chapter 66

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh says, "Heaven is my throne; earth is my footstool; where are you going to build me a Temple to rest in?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I made all this; that's why it's here. But the ones I especially love are humble with a repentant spirit and respect what I say. 3"But for the ones who've chosen their own way and delight in detestable things, offering an ox will be like human sacrifice, sacrificing a lamb will be like breaking a dog's neck, offering a grain offering will be like offering pig's blood, burning incense will be like blessing an idol.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll carry out their punishments and bring on them what they dread; because I called, but nobody answered; I spoke, but they ignored me. They did what I consider sinful and chose what I don't delight in."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Listen to this message from Yahveh, you that respect what he says, "Your brothers that hate you and exclude you because you're loyal to me, have scoffed, 'Honor Yahveh so we can see how happy he makes you!' But they're the ones that will be humiliated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The uproar in the city and the Temple is Yahveh paying back his enemies. 7"Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she had a boy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Who ever heard of such a thing? Who has seen anything like that? Can a country be born in a day? Can a nation be brought forth all at once? But as soon as Zion's travail began, she brought forth her children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Would I bring to term and not deliver? Would I that give delivery shut the womb?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Be joyful over Jerusalem, you that love her; be happy with her, you that mourn for her;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> so you can be satisfied by her consoling breasts, nurse and be delighted by her bountiful bosom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This is what Yahveh says, "I extend peace to her like a river, the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream. She'll nurse you and carry you on her hip, and play with you on her lap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I'll comfort you like a mother does; I'll comfort you in Jerusalem."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When you experience it, you'll be happy; you'll flourish like new grass. Yahveh's servants will realize what he's doing; his enemies will experience his indignation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He will come in fire; his chariots will rush in like a windstorm to render his anger with fury, to rebuke with flames.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He'll condemn by fire and sword; the number he slays will be countless. 17"Those who 'sanctify and purify' themselves to enter sacred gardens with idols in the center, that eat pig meat and disgusting things like mice, will all come to their end at the same time. 18I know what they're thinking; I can see what they're doing. The time's coming to gather all nations to see my glory. 19I'll perform a sign among them and send survivors out from them to the nations—to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and distant lands that have never heard of me. 20From all the countries they'll bring me your people as a grain offering. On horses, mules, and camels; in chariots and litter wagons they'll bring them to my holy mountain Jerusalem," 	Yahveh says. 21"1'll make some of them priests and Levites."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> As surely as the new earth and sky will last, your descendants and name will endure. 23-24Every new moon and Sabbath, all humanity will come to bow to me. When they leave, they'll see the corpses of those who've rebelled against me. The maggots won't die; the fire won't go out. They'll be repulsive to everybody that sees them," Yahveh says.</span>
