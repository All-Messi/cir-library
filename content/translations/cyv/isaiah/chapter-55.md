## Isaiah Chapter 55

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Everyone that's thirsty, come to the water; you that don't have any money, come, buy, and eat; get wine and milk for free.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Why spend money on what's not food, wages on what doesn't satisfy?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Come and listen so you can live; I'll make an everlasting covenant with you like the faithful mercies I showed David.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I've appointed him as a witness to the nations, a leader and commander for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You too will call nations you don't know; nations that don't know you will hurry to you because of Yahveh your God, the Holy One of Israel, because he has honored you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Look for Yahveh while you can find him; call on him while he's near.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Sinners need to change the way they act; the unjust have to abandon selfish intentions. They must return to Yahveh so he'll have mercy on them, come back to their God because he'll generously pardon. 8"I don't think like you do; I don't do like you do," Yahveh says. 9"As high as the sky is above the earth, my ways are above your ways and my thoughts above your thoughts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As rain and snow fall from the sky and don't go back there without watering the ground, making it sprout and produce, and providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> so my message won't come back to me without accomplishing what I sent it to do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You'll go out with joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will break out in singing; the trees in the field will clap their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Cypress trees will come up in place of thorns; myrtles will grow instead of nettles; they'll be a memorial to Yahveh, an everlasting sign that won't be destroyed." Blessings for All Nations</span>
