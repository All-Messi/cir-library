## Isaiah Chapter 58

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Shout; don't hold back; raise your voice like a ram's horn; tell my people their transgressions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They look to me daily and seem to delight to know my ways, as if they're a good nation that hasn't left my ordinances; they ask for favorable verdicts and act like they delight in drawing near to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then they wonder, 'Why have we fasted, and you haven't noticed? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you haven't acknowledged it?' It's because you fast to get what you want (meanwhile overworking your workers)!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You fast only to win disputes and fist fights— not to be heard on high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Is that the kind of fast I had in mind for humbling yourselves? Isn't that just going through the motions of bowing your head like a reed and spreading out burlap and ashes under you? Do you call that penance, a fast that's acceptable to Yahveh?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isn't this the kind of fast I had in mind: loosening the bonds of people you falsely imprisoned, undoing the straps of their yoke, freeing the oppressed, and breaking every tie that binds people?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Isn't it sharing your food with the hungry, bringing the homeless into your house, dressing the naked when you see them, not hiding from relatives that need you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then your light will break forth like the dawn; your wounds will heal quickly. Your good reputation will precede you; the glory of Yahveh will have your back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You'll call and he'll answer; you'll appeal to him, and he'll say, 'I'm here.' If you remove oppression from among you, the finger pointing and vicious gossip, if you feed the hungry and satisfy the needs of the suffering—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> then you'll be a light shining in the dark; the gloom around you will turn to noonday light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh will always guide you, quench your thirst, and restore your strength; he'll make you like an irrigated garden, like a year-round spring.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins on foundations from long ago; you'll repair the breaches in the walls and fix the streets you live on. 13"If you turn around from the direction you're headed, stop doing just whatever you please on my holy day, consider the Sabbath a delight, honor Yahveh's day by what you do that day, step aside from your own pursuits and seeking your own pleasure and talking idly—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> then you'll be delighting in Yahveh. He'll give you honor on the earth and satisfy you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob." Yahveh has spoken. Warnings Against Sin</span>
