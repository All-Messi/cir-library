## Isaiah Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>But there won’t be any more darkness for those who have been in distress. In earlier times, <em>God</em> didn’t give much prominence to the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, but at a future time he’ll make it glorious along the road from the Jordan along the Sea <em>of Galilee</em>, Galilee of the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Those who walk in deep darkness will see a bright light; it will shine on people that live in a dark land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’ll enlarge the nation and increase their happiness; they’ll be happy in your presence like people at harvest time or when they divide up spoil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You’ll take off their yoke of slavery, remove the burden from their shoulders, and break the oppressor’s rod like when you destroyed Midian in battle.<strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 9:1-4</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Infantry boots from the chaos of battle and uniforms soaked in blood will be burned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A child has been born to us, a son has been given; the government will rest on him. He’ll be called Wonderful<em> </em>Counselor, Mighty<em> </em>God<em>,</em> Eternal<em> </em>Father, Prince<em> </em>of<em> </em>Peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>His peaceful rule will never end on David’s throne and over his kingdom. He’ll make it secure and maintain it with justice and goodness permanently. The zeal of Yahveh of Hosts will make it happen.<strong> </strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 9:5-7</strong> <strong>God’s Anger at Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Yahveh is issuing a message against Jacob, <em>a message of </em>condemnation that falls on Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Everyone in Ephraim will find out, those who live in Samaria who say with such arrogance, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“The</em><em> </em><em>fallen </em><em>bricks </em><em>in our ruins</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	we</em><em>’ll replace with dressed </em><em>stones;</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	s</em><em>ycamores</em><em> that</em><em> have been cut down</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	we’ll </em><em>replant</em><em> with cedars.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But Yahveh will bring adversaries from Rezin and spur them on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Syrians from the east plus Philistines from the west will devour Israel with wide-open jaws. <strong>Even then</strong><strong>, his anger </strong><strong>wo</strong><strong>n’t </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>spent</strong><strong>;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	his </strong><strong>fist</strong><strong> </strong><strong>will still be</strong><strong> </strong><strong>raised</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Is 9:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Yet the people still won’t come back to the One that disciplined them or look to Yahveh of Hosts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So he’ll cut off head and tail from Israel, palm branch and reed the same day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The head is the elders and honored men; the tail is the false prophets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The people’s guides are misguiding them; they’re guiding them toward destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>That’s why Yahveh doesn’t delight in their young men or feel compassion for their orphans and widows: every one of them is godless; they all speak foolishness. <strong>Even then</strong><strong>, his ange</strong><strong>r wo</strong><strong>n’t </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>spent</strong><strong>;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	his </strong><strong>fist</strong><strong> </strong><strong>will still be</strong><strong> </strong><strong>raised</strong><strong>.</strong>	<strong>Is</strong><strong> 9:13-17</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Sin burns here like a brush fire, consuming briars and thorns, setting ablaze the undergrowth in the woods, and sending up clouds of smoke <em>from igniting trees</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The fury of Yahveh of Hosts will burn through the land; its people will be the fuel for the fire; nobody will spare his own brother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They’ll grab what’s on the right hand, but still be hungry; they eat what’s on the left, but not be satisfied; they’ll eat the flesh off their own arm!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Ephraim and Manasseh will devour each other and together feed on Judah. <strong>Even then</strong><strong>, his anger </strong><strong>won’t be </strong><strong>spent</strong><strong>;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	his </strong><strong>fist</strong><strong> </strong><strong>will</strong><strong> </strong><strong>still be</strong><strong> </strong><strong>raised</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> 9:18-21</strong></span>
