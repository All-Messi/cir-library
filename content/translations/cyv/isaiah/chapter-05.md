## Isaiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For the one I love, let me sing a song about his vineyard: The one I love had a vineyard on a fertile hill.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He spaded up the ground, picked up the rocks, and planted the best grapevines in it; he built a tower there and hewed out a stone wine vat; he expected it to produce good grapes, but it produced wild ones. 3"People in Judah and Jerusalem, judge between me and my vineyard.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What could I have done for it that I didn't do? Why did it produce bitter grapes instead of sweet ones?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Let me tell you what I'm going to do with it: I'll cut down the hedge around it and burn it; I'll tear down the wall and let animals trample it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I won't take care of it, prune it, or hoe it; briars and thorns will take it over; I'll tell the clouds not to rain on it anymore."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Israel is Yahveh's vineyard; the people in Judah are his delightful garden; so he looked for justice but saw bloodshed; he expected goodness but heard cries of distress. Judah's Guilt and Judgment</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Misfortune awaits you that buy up houses and fields till there's none left to buy, and you're living alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I've heard Yahveh of Hosts swear, "Lots of houses will be empty, even big, nice ones;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> ten acres of vineyard will only produce 9 gallons 1 bath of wine;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Misfortune awaits those who get up early to drink alcohol and stay up late to get drunk on wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Their banquets feature lyres and harps, tambourines and flutes—and wine; but they give no thought to Yahveh or pay attention to what he's doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So my people will go into exile for ignoring me; their honored ones will starve; their common people will be parched with thirst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sheol will increase its appetite and eat its fill; Jerusalem's nobles and celebrating throngs will go down to it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Commoners will be humbled, important people abased, proud ones brought low.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But Yahveh of Hosts will be exalted by his judgments; the holy God will display his holiness by his goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then lambs will graze in their pasture; foreigners will eat among the ruins of the wealthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Misfortune awaits those who pull iniquity behind them with ropes made out of lies, who harness falsehood and hook up their carts to sin,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> who say, "Let the Holy One of Israel hurry so we can see what he's doing; let his purpose come close so we can find out what it is!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Misfortune awaits those who call bad good and good bad, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Misfortune's in store for people that think they're smart, that consider themselves clever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Misfortune comes on winners at wine drinking and champions at mixing drinks,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> who acquit the guilty for a bribe and deprive the innocent of justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So, like a flame ignites stubble and dry grass shrivels up in fire, their roots will rot, and their blossoms will go up like smoke. They've rejected Yahveh's Law and despised the message of the Holy One of Israel;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> so his anger has burned against his people, and he's reached out to strike them down. The mountains quake; corpses litter the streets like garbage. His anger hasn't turned away; his fist is still raised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He'll signal to a far-off country; he'll whistle for it to come from a remote land and to do it swiftly and soon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Nobody from there will get tired or stumble, rest or sleep; there won't be one loose belt or broken sandal strap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Its arrows will be sharp; its bows bent; its horses' hoofs will spark like flint; its chariot wheels will spin like tornadoes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> It will roar like a lioness, like a young lion; it'll growl when it seizes prey and carries it off; nobody will be able stop it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> It will growl over its prey like the ocean roars; on land, there'll be darkness and distress; clouds will block out the light. Isaiah's Call and Cleansing</span>
