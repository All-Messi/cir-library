## Isaiah Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts will remove food and water from Judah and Jerusalem,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> strong men and soldiers, judges and prophets, fortunetellers and elders,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> captains of 50 and their men, advisors, expert magicians, and skilled astrologers. 4"I'll make boys their officials, babies their rulers;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> people will oppress one another, neighbor against neighbor; youths will insult elders; inferiors will be rude to honorable citizens."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At that time, a man will grab his brother and say, "You have a mantle; be our leader; rule this pile of ruins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But he'll protest, "I won't be your leader; I don't have a mantel or extra food at home; don't expect me to lead you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jerusalem will stumble, Judah will fall, because their words and deeds oppose Yahveh. They've rebelled against his glorious presence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Even the looks on their faces give them away; they show their sin like Sodom; they don't even try to hide it; they're doomed by the disaster they've brought on themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Tell good people it'll go well with them; they'll eat what their efforts produce.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But doom awaits the wicked! It'll be bad for them because they'll get what they deserve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Children oppress my people; women rule them. My people's guides get them lost; they give them wrong directions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh is getting up to contend in court, to render verdict against the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He's going to sue the officials of his people: "You're the ones that have ruined my vineyard; plunder from poor people sits in your houses;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> what do you mean crushing my people, grinding their faces in the dirt?" the Lord Yahveh of Hosts says. From Beauty to Ruin 16"Because the young women of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and flirting eyes, because they prance along with dainty steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll strike their scalps with scabs and shave off their eyebrows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll take away their pretty anklets, headbands, and crescent necklaces; 19dangling earrings, bracelets, and veils; 20headdresses and ankle bracelets; sashes, perfume boxes, and charms; 21finger rings and nose rings; 22fine robes, gowns, capes, and handbags; 23hand mirrors, linen clothes, tiaras, and shawls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Instead of sweet perfume, there'll be stench; instead of a girdle, a rope; instead of permed hair, baldness; instead of a fine robe, burlap; and instead of beauty, branding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The young men of Israel will fall by the sword; the strong will die in battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The city gates will hang in lament and mourning; Jerusalem will sit on the ground like a raped woman." Yahveh's Branch</span>
