## Isaiah Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits the proud crown of Ephraim's drunks, the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Samaria, that's at the head of the fertile valley of those drunk with wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh has a strong and powerful military agent; he'll throw Samaria down on the ground like a hail storm, destructive gale, overwhelming flood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The proud crown of Ephraim's drunks will get tramped on;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> the fading flower of its glorious beauty that's at the head of the fertile valley, will be like the first-ripe fig of summer: as soon as it's seen, it's picked and eaten.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At a later time, Yahveh of Hosts will finally become Israel's crown instead, a beautiful diadem for his remnant people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He'll give their judges a desire to render justice and their soldiers the courage to repel onslaughts at the gates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But for now the priests and prophets reel with wine and stagger from alcohol, reeling while having visions, staggering while rendering verdicts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their tables are covered with vomit; there's filth everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yet they say, "Who's Yahveh think he's going to teach? Who's he going to explain the message to? Are we little kids just weaned from milk, just taken from the breast?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They say that because he tells them over and over, "Precept on precept, line on line; here a little, there a little."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So instead, he'll have to speak to his people in a foreigner's language.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He told them, "Here's a place for the weary to rest," but they ignored him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So Yahveh will keep on lining out his message to them, "Precept on precept, line on line; here a little, there a little"; till they stumble and fall backward, broken, snared, and captured.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So listen to Yahveh's message, you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem: 15"You try to tell yourselves, 'We've made a deal with death, a treaty with Sheol; the overwhelming scourge won't trample us when it comes along; we can lie our way out of danger and hide behind deceit.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But the Lord Yahveh says, "I'm laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a firm foundation; nothing that's built on it will shift out of place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll make justice the measuring line and goodness the level; hail will sweep away your refuge in lies, and water will flood your hiding place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll undo your deal with death and annul your treaty with Sheol; when the overwhelming scourge comes along, it will trample you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It'll seize you again and again; morning after morning it will come through and at any time day or night. That will mean pure terror for you once you get what that means."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The bed you've built is too short to stretch out on; your blanket's too narrow to cover up with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yahveh will come like he did at Mount Perazim; he'll show his anger like he did in the Valley of Gibeon. He'll do his unexpected task and accomplish his extraordinary work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Don't carry on like scoffers; he'll tighten your bonds even more. I've heard from the Lord Yahveh of hosts about his decree to destroy the whole region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Listen to my question.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When it's planting time, does a farmer keep on plowing, keep breaking up ground and harrowing it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Doesn't he smooth it out, sow dill and scatter cummin, plant wheat in rows, and broadcast barley and rye in their plots</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> because his God has taught him how to do it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> A farmer doesn't thresh dill with a sledge or drive a cart wheel over cummin; he beats out dill and cummin with a stick.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Does he crush grain for bread? No, he doesn't keep threshing it over and over; the cart wheel and horses' hooves would ruin it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> That goes for Yahveh of Hosts too, who made his advice wonderful and his wisdom great. An Oracle About Jerusalem</span>
