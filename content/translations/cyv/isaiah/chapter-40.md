## Isaiah Chapter 40

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Comfort, comfort my people," your God says. 2"Speak graciously to Jerusalem; tell it that its warfare's over, its iniquity's removed, it's received from Yahveh double for its sins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A voice is calling, "Build a road for Yahveh in the desert; make a smooth highway for our God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Fill every pothole, level off every bump and high spot. Smooth the rough ground and make rugged terrain like a wide valley.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then the glory of Yahveh will come; everyone will see it together." Yahveh has said so.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A voice said, "Shout." I answered, "Shout what?" "People are like grass; their beauty is like a flower in a field.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Grass withers and flowers fade when Yahveh blows on them; people are like that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Grass withers and flowers fade, but Yahveh's word stands forever."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Climb a high mountain, Zion, messenger with good news; shout it out; shout it louder; don't hold back; tell the towns in Judah, "Your God is coming!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He'll come with power to rule with his strong arm; he'll bring his reward with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He'll tend his flock like a shepherd; he'll pick up the lambs in his arms and carry them against his chest, and gently lead the nursing ewes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Who else has measured the ocean in the palm of his hand or the sky with a span, or counted the dust? Who else has weighed the mountains in a scales or the hills in a balance?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who has directed Yahveh's Spirit or instructed him as his advisor?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Who did he consult for enlightenment? Who taught him what's good?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The nations are just a drop in the bucket, a piece of sand on a scales; he picks up islands like specks of dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Lebanon couldn't provide enough wood or its animals be sufficient for a burnt offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> All the nations amount to nothing in front of him; they're of no consequence compared to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Who can we compare God to? What's he like?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> An idol is something an artisan makes, a goldsmith plates with gold, a silversmith makes silver chains for.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> People too poor for such an offering select wood that won't rot and find a skilled craftsman to prepare an idol that won't fall over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Haven't you heard? Don't you know? Didn't anybody tell you at the beginning of the earth that</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> the One who sits above the circle of the earth, whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers to him— he's the One that stretches out the sky like a curtain, spreads it out like a tent to live under.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He's the One that dethrones rulers and unseats judges.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They've hardly been planted, hardly sown, hardly taken root, when he blows on them and they wither, and the wind carries them off like chaff.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Who can you compare him with; who's his equal?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Look up and see who created those stars, who leads the host of them out in full number and calls each one by name; because of his great power and strength, not a one of them is missing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jacob, why do you think Yahveh can't see what you're going through, that he doesn't notice the justice you deserve?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Don't you know? Haven't you heard? The eternal God, Yahveh, the creator of the earth, doesn't get tired; no one can measure his intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He gives stamina to the tired and increases strength in the weak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Even youths get weary; young men collapse exhausted;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> but those who trust in Yahveh keep finding new strength; they walk and don't get weary; they run and don't get tired; they soar up on wings like eagles. God's Help for Israel</span>
