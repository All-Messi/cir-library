## Isaiah Chapter 52

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wake up, wake up; dress yourself with strength, Zion; put on your beautiful clothes, Jerusalem the holy city; defiled, godless people won't invade you anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Get up, shake off the dust, captive Jerusalem; take the chains off your neck, resident in Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> because Yahveh says: "You were sold for nothing; you'll be redeemed without money.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> In the beginning my people went down to Egypt to live; now the Assyrians oppress them for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Why are my people enslaved for nothing and their rulers wail and blaspheme me all the time?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now my people will know my name; they'll know I'm the one that's talking to them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> How welcome on the mountains is the messenger that brings good news, that announces peace and happiness, that declares salvation and says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Listen! Your watchmen are happy and singing; they can see that Yahveh is restoring Zion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Break out in joyful song together, you laid-waste places in Jerusalem, because Yahveh has comforted his people; he's redeemed Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He's bared his holy arm so the nations can witness the deliverance he's bringing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Leave, leave there; don't hang onto anything defiled; purify yourselves, you that bring back Yahveh's sacred objects.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You won't go out quickly like fleeing refugees; Yahveh will lead you out; the God of Israel will be your rear guard. The Suffering Servant Poem (52:13-53:12)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> My servant will succeed; he'll be looked up to and highly honored.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But, even as many were astonished at you, my people, so his astonishing appearance was marred beyond human resemblance; his form mutilated beyond recognition.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He'll cleanse many nations; kings will shut their mouths in his presence. They'll see what they had no one to tell them and understand what they hadn't heard.</span>
