## Isaiah Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message Isaiah Ben-Amoz Saw About Judah and Jerusalem</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> In the last days, the mountain where Yahveh's Temple is, will become the tallest mountain; it will rise above the hills, and nations everywhere will stream into it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Many nationalities will say, "Let's go up to Yahveh's mountain, to the Temple of Jacob's God, so he can teach us his ways and we can follow his paths," because the Law will go out from Zion, Yahveh's message from Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He'll mediate between nations and settle disputes between them; they'll hammer their swords into plowshares and beat their spears into pruning hooks; they won't fight one another or train for war anymore. Warning About Coming Judgment</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Come, House of Jacob; let's follow the light of Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He's abandoned you because practices from the east have filled you; you use soothsayers like Philistines; you strike bargains with foreigners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your land has lots of silver and gold; there's no limit to your treasures; you own lots of horses and countless chariots.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Your country is full of idols; you worship your own creations, what your fingers have made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So the common people will be humbled, important ones abased; don't forgive them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Get inside caves and hide underground from the terror Yahveh's bringing and the splendor of his majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He'll abase arrogant people and humble haughty ones; he alone will be honored then.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh of Hosts has set a time for reckoning, for everybody that's proud and arrogant, for everybody that's pompous and aloof so they can be abased,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> for the tall cedars of Lebanon and oaks of Bashan,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> for high mountains and lofty hills,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> for every high tower and fortified wall,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> for the ships of Tarshish and their beautiful crafts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yahveh will humble the haughty and abase the arrogant; he alone will be honored then;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> idols will disappear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> People will hide in caves in the rocks and holes underground in anticipation of the terror Yahveh's bringing and the splendor of his majesty when he takes action that makes the ground quake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> At that time, they'll toss to the moles and bats the silver and gold idols they made to worship;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> they will hide in the caves in the rocks and clefts in the cliffs in anticipation of the terror Yahveh's bringing and the splendor of his majesty when he takes action that makes the ground quake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Stop trusting in people who breathe; why depend on them? Judgment Against Judah</span>
