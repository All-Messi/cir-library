## Isaiah Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits judges that enact unfair laws and render illegal verdicts,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> who deprive the needy of justice and rob the poor of their rights so they can make widows their spoil and orphans their plunder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What are you going to do when punishment arrives, when devastation comes from far off? Who will you run to for help? Where will you hide your wealth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> There'll be nothing left for you but to crouch among the captives or fall among the slain. Even then, his anger won't be spent; his fist will still be raised. Judgment Against Assyria 5"Misfortune awaits Assyria, the club my anger is using, the staff I've loaded with my indignation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm sending Assyria against my godless nation, a people I'm angry with, to capture spoil and seize plunder, to tramp on like a dirt road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But that's not Assyria's intention. It simply intends to destroy one nation after another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> It will say, 'My princes will all be kings?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Calno will fall like Carchemish, Hamath like Arpad, Samaria like Damascus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As I've done to other kingdoms with idols, whose carved images were greater than Jerusalem's and Samaria's,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> so I'll do to Jerusalem and its images what I've done to Samaria and its idols.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So when the Lord finishes using Assyria to complete his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he'll say, "I'll punish the arrogant king of Assyria and his pompous pride." 13That's because he brags, "I did this by my own power and wisdom, because I'm intelligent; I have broken through nations' boundaries and carried off their treasures, knocked down their kings like a bull</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> and robbed their wealth like a nest; I gathered the whole world like someone gathers abandoned eggs; not a one flapped its wings or opened its beak or clucked."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But should an axe brag about being mightier than the woodsman that chops with it? Should a saw elevate itself above the carpenter that saws with it? That would be like a staff wielding a shepherd or a cane standing up the one that leans on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So the Lord Yahveh of Hosts will send a plague among Assyria's strong soldiers; he'll ignite their glory with a burning flame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Israel's light will be that fire, its Holy One that flame; it will eat up Assyria's "thorns and briars" in one day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He'll destroy Assyria's glory like a forest and his fruitful "garden" body and soul; it'll waste away like sick people in a plague.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So few trees will be left in his "woods" a kid could count them. Hope for the Remnant</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> At that time, the remnant in Israel and the survivors in Judah that escaped will have the sense to never again rely on allies that want to destroy them. They'll rely on Yahveh, the Holy One of Israel, 21-22the Mighty God. 22Then, even though Israel was as numerous as sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. 23The Lord Yahveh will carry out the total destruction he's decreed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So this is what he says, "My people in Zion, don't be afraid of Assyria that wants to strike you with a rod and threaten you with its staff like Egypt did. 25In a little while, my anger at you will be spent, and I'll redirect it at Assyria. 26I'll scourge it like I massacred Midian at the Rock of Oreb. I'll hold my staff out over the sea and lift it up like I did in Egypt. 27Then I'll lift the Assyrian burden off your shoulders and break its yoke from off your neck."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The Assyrians have passed through Migron, attacked Aiath, and set up base camp at Michmash.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They've gone over the pass and are camping at Geba; Ramah has panicked, and Gibeah of Saul has fled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Cry out in terror, people in Gallim! Warn Laishah and poor Anathoth!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Madmenah has fled; the residents of Gebim are searching for refuge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The enemy will halt his advance at Nob for the day and shake his fist at Mount Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Lord Yahveh of Hosts will lop off limbs with a terrible crash and cut down Lebanon's tall, lofty trees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> With an iron axe he'll chop down the undergrowth in its forest, and Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One. A Branch from Jesse</span>
