## Isaiah Chapter 61

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Spirit of the Lord Yahveh is on me; he's anointed me to bring good news to the downtrodden. He's sent me to bandage up the brokenhearted, to liberate captives, to free prisoners,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> to announce that this is the year Yahveh shows blessing, the day he sets things right, to comfort anyone that's grieving,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> to give to the sad in Zion a crown in place of ashes, the oil of happiness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise rather than a fainting spirit so they'll be like Terebinths of Goodness Yahveh has planted to demonstrate his glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then they'll rebuild the ancient ruins, set back up what was torn down, repair destroyed towns deserted for generations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Foreigners will pasture your flocks, do your farming, and tend your vineyards.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But you'll be Yahveh's priests; people will speak of you as his ministers. You'll feed on the wealth of nations and take pride in their prosperity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Instead of humiliation you'll have a double portion; rather than dishonor you'll celebrate over your lot. You'll have everlasting joy in your land. 8"I, Yahveh, love justice and despise short-changing in burnt offering; I'll make an everlasting contract with you and faithfully pay you for your work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the nations will honor your offspring worldwide; everyone will recognize you as the offspring Yahveh blessed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I'm really happy in Yahveh; I celebrate over my God because he's dressed me in salvation and wrapped me in goodness like a robe, like a groom dresses himself in a garland, and a bride adorns herself with jewels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As the ground produces seeds and a garden makes sprouts grow, so the Lord Yahveh makes goodness and praise spring up for all the world to see. Isaiah's Prayer for Jerusalem</span>
