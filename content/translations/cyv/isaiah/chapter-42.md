## Isaiah Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My Servant that I uphold, my Chosen One I delight in, I've put my Spirit on him; he'll bring righteousness to the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He won't holler or be boisterous; he won't make a racket in the streets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He won't break a bruised reed or put out a flickering wick; he'll faithfully render justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He won't falter or lose heart; he'll establish justice on earth; distant lands will rely on his instruction."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God Yahveh says— who created the sky and stretched it out, who made the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it— 6"I'm Yahveh; I've called you to demonstrate my goodness; I'll hold you by the hand and watch over you. I'll appoint you to be a covenant for the people, a light for the Gentiles</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> to open the eyes of the blind, to free prisoners from dungeons and those living in darkness from prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'm Yahveh; that's my name. I won't share my honor with anyone else or my praise with carved images.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> My former prophecies have already happened; now I'm prophesying new ones; I'll tell you about them before they occur." A Song of Praise to Yahveh</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Sing a new song to Yahveh; sing his praise from the ends of the earth, you that sail the ocean, you distant lands and people that live there!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let the desert towns join the chorus, the villages where Kedar lives; let the people of Sela sing for joy and shout from the mountaintops.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Let them honor Yahveh and declare his praise in distant lands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> HeY will rush out like a soldier and stir up his fury like a warrior; he'll raise his battle cry and prevail over his enemies. 14"I've kept quiet," God says, "and restrained myself for a long time; now like a woman in labor, I'll groan and gasp and pant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll make mountains and hills desolate and wither their vegetation; I'll turn rivers into wadis and dry up the ponds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll lead the blind on a new road, guide them in unfamiliar paths; I'll make darkness into light ahead of them and make rough places smooth; I'll do these things; I won't leave them undone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll drive back and completely disgrace those who trust in idols and say to molten images, 'You're our gods.' Israel Deaf and Blind 18"Listen, you deaf; look, you blind.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Who is as blind as my servant, as deaf as my messenger? Who is as blind as my chosen people, as blind as Yahveh's servant?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You look at many things, but don't see; your ears are open, but you don't listen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Because he's good, Yahveh was pleased to make his Law great and glorious.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But his people have been robbed and plundered, trapped in caves and hidden in prisons; they've become prey with no savior, spoil with nobody to demand, "Give them back!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Who among you will learn from the past? Who will listen about the future?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Who gave Jacob up for spoil and Israel to plunderers? Wasn't it Yahveh that you've sinned against, whose ways you wouldn't follow, whose Law you didn't obey?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> So he poured out his hot anger on you in fierce warfare and enveloped you in flames; you didn't catch on, and it burned you; you didn't take it to heart. Israel's Only Savior</span>
