## Joshua Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A good while later, when Joshua was old, 2he called in Israel's elders, heads, judges, and officers, and told them, "I'm getting old. 3You've seen everything Yahveh your God has done to those nations for you. He fought for you. 4I've allotted to your tribes those nations that remain, along with the nations I've already removed, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 5Yahveh will push them back. 6Keep doing everything in the Law of Moses. 7Don't mix with the nations left among you. Don't mention their gods, swear by them, serve them, bow down to them. 8Hold onto Yahveh like you've done so far. 9He has driven out big, strong nations. Nobody has been able to resist you. 10One of you puts a thousand to flight, because he fights for you like he promised. 11Give attention to loving him. 12If you join the remnants of nations left among you and intermarry with them, 13you can be sure he won't keep driving them out. They'll be a snare, a trap, a scourge in your sides, thorns in your eyes, till you perish from this good land he's given you. 14"I'm going to die soon. You know in your hearts and souls that not one good thing has failed to happen that Yahveh promised. 15Just as he has done all the good things he promised, he'll bring about all the bad things till he's destroyed you. 16If you sin against his covenant, serve other gods, and bow to them, his anger will flare at you, and you'll soon perish." Covenant Renewed at Shechem</span>
