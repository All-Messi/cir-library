<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Joshua called the twelve men, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Go</em><em> on past the Ark to the middle of the Jordan and </em><em>pick up a </em><em>rock</em><em> on</em><em>to</em><em> your shoulder</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> be a sign when</em><em> your children ask what the</em><em>se </em><em>rocks</em><em> mean</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>ell</em><em> them the Jordan </em><em>River held back ahead of the A</em><em>rk </em><em>as it crossed. These rocks serve as a permanent memorial for Israelites.”</em></span>

### rocks out of the Jordan, carried them over to where they would spend the night, and laid them down. 9Joshua set up 12 rocks in the Jordan where the priests had stood. They’re still there. 10The priests stood in the Jordan till everything happened that Yahveh had Joshua tell the people. 	Josh 4:1-10a The people crossed in a hurry. 11Then the priests and the Ark went on over. 12Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe also went over to the plains by Jericho—13about 40,000. 14That day Yahveh elevated Joshua in Israel. They stood in awe of him all his life.


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Yahveh said to Joshua, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> the priests that are carrying the A</em><em>rk to come up out of the Jordan.”</em> [<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When they’d come up, the water went back to overflowing its banks.</span>
