## Joshua Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Joshua sent two men secretly from Shittim to<em> </em>check out the land, Jericho in particular.<em> </em>They went to the house of a harlot named Rahab to lodge. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The king of Jericho heard about it, <em>“Some men from Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land</em><em>.”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He sent to Rahab, <em>“Bring </em><em>the m</em><em>en that have come to your house. They’re spies</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But the woman had hidden them, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>en did come, but I didn’t know where they </em><em>came</em><em> from.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> left w</em><em>hen the gate </em><em>closed</em><em> at dark.</em><em> </em><em>I don’t know where they went.</em><em> Follow them right away so y</em><em>ou can catch</em><em> </em><em>up with them.”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But she’d taken them up to the roof and hidden them under stalks of flax. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The men pursued them toward the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as they left, the gate was shut.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Before they lay down, she came up to the roof <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and said, <em>“I know Yahveh is going to</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> the land</em><em> to you</em><em>.</em><em> We’re all afraid; t</em><em>he </em><em>people are </em><em>melt</em><em>ing</em><em> away </em><em>on account of</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>We’ve</em><em> heard how </em><em>he</em><em> dried up the Red Sea </em><em>for</em><em> you when you </em><em>left</em><em> Egypt, and how you destroyed </em><em>Sihon and Og</em><em> beyond the Jordan.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> soon as we heard it, our hearts melted</em><em>. Nobody had any courage left. Yahveh</em><em> your God is God in heaven above and on earth be</em><em>low</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em>, swear by </em><em>him</em><em> that as I’ve dealt </em><em>gracious</em><em>ly with you, you’ll dea</em><em>l graciously with my father’s family. G</em><em>ive me a </em><em>guarantee</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>that</em><em> you’ll</em><em> save my </em><em>parents</em><em>, brothers and sisters, and </em><em>their relatives</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>They said, <em>“Our life for yours! If you don’t tell </em><em>why we’re here</em><em>, </em><em>you can trust us to</em><em> deal </em><em>gracious</em><em>ly with you when </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> gives us the land.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Her house was built against the city wall. She let them down by a rope through the window and <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>told them, <em>“Go</em><em> up into the hills</em><em> so </em><em>you won’t run into </em><em>the </em><em>ones that are searching for you</em><em>.</em><em> Hide </em><em>there</em><em> three days till they</em><em> </em><em>get back</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Then you</em><em>’ll be able to</em><em> go.”</em><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 2:8-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>They said, <em>“We won’t be guilty of the oath you had us swear. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> we come, tie this scarlet cord in the window you let us down through. Get your parents, brothers, and father’s family into the house. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> any of them goes out into the street, their </em><em>blood’s</em><em> on themselves. But if a hand is laid on anybody that’s in the house with you, that person’s </em><em>blood’s</em><em> on us. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you tell why we’re </em><em>here,</em><em> we won’t be obligated by the oath.” </em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“All</em><em> </em><em>right.”</em><em> </em> She sent them away and tied the scarlet cord in the window.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	       </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>They went into the hills for three days till the ones that were looking for them got back. They’d looked all along the road and didn’t find anything. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Then the two men came back down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua. They told him what all had happened, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Yahveh</em><em> has for sure delivered the land to us. The inhabitants have lost heart over us.”</em><em>	</em></span>
