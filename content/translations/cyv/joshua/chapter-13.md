## Joshua Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Joshua was getting along in years, Yahveh told him, "You're getting old, and there's still a lot of land to take:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> the territory of the Philistines, Geshurites (3From the Shihor, east of Egypt, north to the boundary of Ekron, is considered Canaanite. The Philistines have five rulers: in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.) and the Avvim, 4in the south; the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah, which belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> the Gebalites, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath, 6-7the people in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, that is, the Sidonians. I'll drive them out in front of Israel.  Allot the land to the nine tribes and the Manasseh half-tribe." Land East of the Jordan Divided</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The other Manasseh half-tribe together with Reuben and Gad had received their inheritance from Moses east of the Jordan: 9from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon valley, the city in the middle of the valley, the whole tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon; 10the towns of Sihon, king of the Amorites; 11Gilead, the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites; all of Mount Hermon, the whole of Bashan to Salecah; 12the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the only Rephaim left.) Moses had defeated them and driven them out. 13Yet the people of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites or Maacathites. They still live among the Israelites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Moses didn't give an inheritance to the tribe of Levi; their inheritance was the offerings by fire to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben by clans. 16Their territory went from Aroer—on the edge of the Arnon valley, and the city that's in the middle of the valley—the whole tableland of Medeba; 17Heshbon and the other towns on the tableland: Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baalmeon, 18Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 19Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 20Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth. 21Reuben's territory included the whole kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated together with the leaders of Midian—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, allies of Sihon. 22The people of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam Ben-Beor, the fortuneteller. 23The Jordan was the boundary of Reuben. That was Reuben's inheritance by clans, towns, and villages.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Moses gave an inheritance to Gad by clans. 25Their territory was Jazer, the towns in Gilead, half the land of the Ammonites to Aroer, east of Rabbah; 26from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpah and Betonim, from Mahanaim to the territory around Debir; 27the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The Jordan was its boundary to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward from the Jordan. 28That was Gad's inheritance by clans, towns, and villages.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Moses gave an inheritance to the Manasseh half-tribe by clans. 30Their territory extended from Mahanaim through Bashan—the whole kingdom of Og, king of Bashan—all the towns of Jair in Bashan (60 towns), 31half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, towns in Og's kingdom in Bashan. Those were allotted to the people of Machir Ben-Manasseh for half of the Machirites by clans.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Those inheritances Moses had distributed by God's command in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho. 33He didn't give an inheritance to Levi; Yahveh is their inheritance. Land West of the Jordan Divided</span>
