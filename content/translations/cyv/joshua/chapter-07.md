## Joshua Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But the people violated the instructions about the things set apart to Yahveh. Achan Ben-Carmi (Ben-Zabdi Ben- Zerah) from the tribe of Judah, took some devoted things, and Yahveh's anger burned against Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai near Beth-aven, east of Bethel to spy out the area. They spied it out, 3came back and said, "Just have 2,000 or 3,000 go up to attack Ai. There aren't many of them. 4About 3,000 went up but fled. 5The men from Ai killed about 36. They chased them from the gate as far as Shebarim and killed them at the descent. The people's hearts melted and became like water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joshua tore his clothes. He and the elders fell on their faces by the Ark of Yahveh till evening and put dust on their heads. 7Joshua said, "Lord Yahveh, why bring us across the Jordan and turn us over to the Amorites? If only we'd been content to live beyond the Jordan! 8What can I say when Israel has turned its back on its enemies? 9The Canaanites and the people in the land will hear about it and surround us. They'll remove our name from the earth, and what will you do for your great name?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yahveh told Joshua, "Why fall on your face? Get up.  11Israel has broken my covenant and taken some devoted things. They've stolen and lied about it and put them among their own things. 12So Israel can't stand up to its enemies. They turn their backs on them because now they're something to be destroyed. 13Get up. Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. You can't stand up to your enemies till you get rid of the devoted things. 14In the morning, come forward by tribes. The tribe Yahveh takes will come forward by families. The family he takes will come by households. The household he takes will come one by one. 15The one that took the devoted things and everything he has will be burned. He's sinned against Yahveh's covenant by doing something horrible."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Joshua got up early and brought Israel forward tribe by tribe; Yahveh took Judah. 17He brought the clans of Judah forward; Yahveh took the family of Zerah. He brought the family of Zerah forward one household at a time; Yahveh took the household of Zabdi/Zimrimss. 18He brought Zabdi's household forward one man at a time; Yahveh took Achan Ben-(Carmi Ben-Zabdi/Zimri Ben-) Zerah. 19Joshua told Achan, "Son, honor Yahveh God of Israel and praise him. What have you done?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Achan answered, "Truthfully, I did sin against Yahveh God of Israel. 21I saw among the spoils a beautiful mantle from Shinar, 5 lbs 200 shekels of silver, and a gold bar weighing 20 oz 50 shekels. I wanted them and took them and hid them in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joshua sent messengers to the tent. The devoted things were there with the silver under them. 23They brought them out to Joshua and put them down in front of Yahveh. 24Joshua and all Israel took Achan, the silver, the mantle, the gold bar, his children, cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent and everything he had, and went up to the Valley of Achor. 25Joshua said, "Why trouble on us? Yahveh is bringing trouble on you now." Israel stoned them and burned them. 26They piled a big mound of rocks over him that's still there. Then Yahveh turned away his burning anger. Israel Destroys Ai</span>
