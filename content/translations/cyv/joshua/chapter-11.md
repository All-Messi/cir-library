## Joshua Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard about it, he sent to Jobab, king of Madon, to the king of Shimron to the king of Achshaph,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> to the kings in the northern hill country, the Arabah south of Chinneroth, the western foothills, Naphothdor on the west,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> to the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites in the hill country, and Hivites on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They came out with their troops, a large army like sand on the shore, with very many horses and chariots. 5All those kings joined forces, came and camped together at the water by Merom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them. At this time tomorrow, I'll deliver them to Israel. Hamstring their horses and burn their chariots." 7He came suddenly on them with all his fighting men. 8Yahveh gave them to Israel, who struck them and chased them to Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward to the Valley of Mizpah. There weren't any left. 9Joshua hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Joshua turned back and took Hazor and struck its king with the sword. Hazor was formerly the head of those kingdoms. 11The Israelites put to the sword everything in it that breathed, and Joshua burned Hazor. 12He took the kings and their towns and destroyed them—like Moses Yahveh's servant commanded. 13Israel didn't burn towns that stood on mounds, but Joshua did burn Hazor. 14The people took the spoil in those towns and the livestock for plunder. They struck every man with the sword till they'd destroyed them. 15What Yahveh told Moses, Moses told Joshua, and he did it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Joshua conquered the hill country, the Negev, Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland 17from Mount Halak that rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He put their kings to death. 18Joshua fought those kings for a long time. 19No town made peace with Israel except the Hivites in Gibeon. 20Yahveh hardened their hearts to come out against Israel so they'd be destroyed without mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At that time, Joshua completely wiped out the Anakim and their towns in the hill county—Hebron, Debir, Anab, and the towns in the territory of Judah, and Israel. 22The only Anakim left were a few in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 23He took the whole land the way Yahveh had told Moses. He gave it to Israel by tribal allotments. The land rested from war. List of Defeated Kings</span>
