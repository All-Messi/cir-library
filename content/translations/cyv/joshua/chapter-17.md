## Joshua Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong>Manasseh</strong>, Joseph’s firstborn, received an allotment. Gilead and Bashan went to Machir, Manasseh’s firstborn and father of Gilead, because he was a soldier. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Allotment came to the rest of Manasseh’s male descendants by clans: the sons of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and <u>Shemida</u>. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>However, Zelophehad Ben-Hepher (Ben-Gilead Ben-Machir Ben-Manasseh) only had daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the elders, <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>told Moses to give us an inheritance among our </em><em>relatives</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>So he gave them an inheritance among their uncles. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Ten sections fell to Manasseh besides Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>because Manasseh’s daughters received an inheritance with his sons. Gilead belonged to the rest of Manasseh’s sons.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 17:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Manasseh’s territory reached from Asher to Michmethath, east of Shechem. Then the boundary went south to En-tappuah. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to Ephraim. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then the boundary went down to Brook Kanah. The towns there, south of the stream, among the towns in Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim. Then Manasseh’s boundary went on the north side of the stream and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The land to the south was Ephraim’s, that to the north was Manasseh’s, and the Mediterranean Sea formed its <em>western </em>boundary. The north reached Asher; the east reached Issachar. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Also in Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean/<em>Beth-shan</em>, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements. (The third was Naphath.) <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Yet Manasseh’s descendants couldn’t conquer those towns, so the Canaanites kept living there. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When Israel grew stronger, they put them to forced labor, but didn’t completely drive them out.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 17:7-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The tribe of Joseph asked Joshua, <em>“Why have you given </em><em>us</em><em> </em><em>only one territory </em><em>though </em><em>we’re</em><em> numerous </em><em>because</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>has blessed </em><em>us</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Joshua told the House of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, <em>“You’re numerous and strong. You won’t just have one lot </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> the hill country too. Though it’s wooded land, clear it and take possession of it to its full extent. You’ll drive out the Canaanites too though they’re strong and have iron chariots.” </em><em>	  </em><strong>Josh 17:14-18</strong> <strong>Allotment of Remaining Land</strong></span>
