<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The heads of families among the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the heads of families in Israel. 2They said, "Yahveh commanded Moses to give us towns to live in along with pastures for our livestock." 3Israel gave the Levites those towns and their pastures out of their inheritance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> To the Gershonites—one clan of the Levites—from the Manasseh half-tribe they gave Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge; and Be-eshterah—2 towns with their pastures. 28From Issachar they gave Kishion, Daberath, 29Jarmuth, En-gannim—4 towns with their pastures. 30From Asher they gave Mishal, Abdon, 31Helkath, and Rehob—4 towns with their pastures. 32From Naphtali they gave Kedesh in Galilee, a city of refuge, Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—3 towns with their pastures. 33The Gershonites had 13 towns with their pastures.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Yahveh gave Israel all the land he swore to their ancestors. They took it and settled there. 44He gave them peace from every direction. Not one of their enemies could stand against them. 45None of his good promises failed. Eastern Tribes Return Home</span>
