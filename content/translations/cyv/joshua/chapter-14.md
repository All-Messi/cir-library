## Joshua Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> These are the territories the Israelites inherited in Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua Ben-Nun, and the heads of families distributed. 2Their inheritance came by lot for the 9½ tribes. [3] 4Joseph's people consisted of two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. Moses just gave the Levites towns to live in along with land for pasturing livestock and raising crops for them. 5The Israelites allotted the land like Yahveh commanded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb Ben-Jephunneh the Kenizzite told him, "You know what Yahveh told Moses in Kadesh-barnea about you and me. 7I was 40 when Moses sent me to spy out the land. I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. 8But my brothers that went up with me made the people's heart melt. Yet I wholly followed Yahveh. 9Moses swore that day, 'The land you've walked on will belong to you and your descendants permanently. You've followed Yahveh my God.' 10HeY has kept me alive these 45 years since he said that to Moses in the desert. Today I'm 85, 11still as strong as I was when Moses sent me—strong for war and everyday life. 12Give me this hill country Yahveh spoke about that day. At that time, you heard that Anakim were there with big, fortified towns. Yahveh may be with me, and I can drive them out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron. 14It's still his inheritance because he wholly followed Yahveh. (15Hebron's earlier name had been Kiriath-arba because Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) The land rested from war. Allotment to Judah</span>
