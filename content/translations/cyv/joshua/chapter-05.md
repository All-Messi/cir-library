## Joshua Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The Amorite kings west of the Jordan and the Canaanite kings by the sea, heard that Yahveh had dried up the Jordan for the Israelites to cross. Their hearts melted; there was no spirit in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>At that time, Yahveh told Joshua to make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites this second time<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He did that at Gibeath-haaraloth. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The fighting men who came out of Egypt <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>had been circumcised, but the ones born in the desert hadn’t. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The Israelites lived</span>
<p class="section-ref">there 40</p>

### years till those fighting men died. Yahveh swore they wouldn’t see the land flowing with milk and honey that he’d promised their ancestors. 7So Joshua circumcised the offspring Yahveh raised up to replace them.


<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>After the circumcising, they stayed in the camp till they healed up. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Yahveh told Joshua, <em>“I’ve </em><em>‘</em><em>rolled away</em><em>’</em><em> from you the </em><em>disgrace</em><em> of Egypt</em><em> today</em><em>”</em>;<em> </em>so the place has been called Gilgal ever since.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>While the people camped in Gilgal, they kept Passover on the fourteenth of the month in the evening in the plains by Jericho. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The next day, they began eating the produce in the land—parched grain and cakes without yeast in them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The manna stopped the next day; they didn’t have it anymore. They ate the produce in Canaan that year.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man with his sword drawn. He went to him and asked, <em>“Are you for us or </em><em>our enemies?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>I’ve</em><em> come </em><em>to command Yahveh’s </em><em>army.” </em> <em> </em>Joshua fell on his face in homage, <em>“What </em><em>do you want</em><em> </em><em>me</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>do?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“Take</em><em> your shoes off. Where</em><em> you’re standing is holy.”</em><em> </em>Joshua obeyed.<strong> </strong></span>
