## Joshua Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh said to Joshua, 2"Have the people establish the cities of refuge I spoke to you about through Moses, 3so anyone that kills somebody accidentally can flee there from an avenger. 4Standing at the entrance to the city gate, the slayer will explain his case to the elders, and they'll give him a place to stay in the city. 5They won't give him up to any avenger because the death was an accident, no previous animosity involved. 6The slayer will stay in that city for judgment till the death of the current high priest, and hen he go back home."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 8East of Jericho and the Jordan, they designated Bezer on the tableland in Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in Gad, and Golan in Bashan in Manasseh. 9They designated those towns for Israelites and foreigners among them to flee to, so the avenger of blood couldn't take revenge before the slayer could stand in public trial. Towns for the Levites</span>
