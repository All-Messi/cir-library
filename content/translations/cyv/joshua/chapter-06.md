### The Fall of Jericho

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jericho was shut up inside and out. Nobody was coming out or going in. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Yahveh told Joshua<em>, </em> <em>“I’ll</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> Jericho to you, its king and </em><em>strong</em><em> </em><em>fighting </em><em>men.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> </em>Israel’s<em> fighting men </em><em>march around the city</em><em> once</em><em> a day</em><em> for </em><em>a week</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> s</em><em>even priests</em><em> each a</em><em> carry ram</em><em>’</em><em>s horn </em><em>ahead of the A</em><em>rk.</em><em> </em><em>On the seventh day</em><em>,</em><em> march around the city seven times</em><em> while the priests blow</em><em> their </em><em>rams’ horns</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> soon as you hear a long blast on</em><em> the ram</em><em>s’ horns</em><em>, </em><em>raise the battle cry</em><em> as loud as </em><em>you</em><em> can, and the city wall will </em><em>fall down</em><em> flat</em><em>. E</em><em>very man</em><em>,</em><em> go straight </em><em>in</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joshua called the priests and told them to take the Ark and have seven priests each carry a ram’s horn ahead of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He told the people to start marching around the city with the armed men ahead of the Ark.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 6:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The seven priests went forward blowing rams’ horns in front of Yahveh with the Ark behind them. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The armed men went first ahead of the priests, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. The rams’ horns blew continually.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Joshua told the people, <em>“Don’t raise the war cry</em><em> till the day I </em><em>tell</em><em> you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He sent the Ark around the city once. Then they spent the night in camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Joshua got up early and the priests took the Ark, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and the seven priests went along, blowing the horns continually. The armed men went first ahead of them, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The second day they marched around the city once and went back to camp. They did that for six days.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 6:8-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city the same way seven times. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The seventh time, when the priests blew the rams’ horns, Joshua told the people, <em>“Raise the battle cry! Yahveh</em> <em>i</em><em>s</em><em> delivering</em><em> the city</em><em> to you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The city and everything in it will be devoted to</em><em> </em><em>him</em> <em>for destruction.</em><em> </em><em>Only Rahab the harlot and her house</em><em>hold</em><em> will live</em><em>;</em><em> she hid the messengers we sent.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Make</em><em> sure you keep </em><em>away </em><em>from the things devoted to destruction.</em><em> If</em><em> you ta</em><em>ke any devoted thing, you’ll bring trouble on Israel’s camp and get it</em><em> </em><em>destroyed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>All</em><em> the silver and gold, the </em><em>bronze and iron items</em><em>, are sacred to </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll go into </em><em>his </em><em>treasury.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>T</em><em>he priests</em> blew the rams’ horns. As soon as the people heard them, they raised the battle cry as loud as they could, and the wall fell down flat. Every man went straight ahead up into the city and took it. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>With swords they destroyed men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.<strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joshua told the two men that had spied out the land to go to the harlot’s house and bring her and her relatives out, like they’d promised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They went in and brought out her, her parents, brothers, and relatives; and put them outside the camp. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They burned the city and everything in it, but put in Yahveh’s treasury the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Rahab and her father’s family still live in Israel because she hid the spies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Joshua bound an oath on them, <em>“</em><em>C</em><em>ursed </em><em>by</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>is any</em><em>one</em><em> that rebuilds this city.</em> <em>He’ll lay its foundation</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>t the cost of his </em><em>firstborn</em> <em>	and</em><em> set up its gates at the</em><em> cost of his youngest son</em><em>.”</em></span>
