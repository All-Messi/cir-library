## Joshua Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jericho was shut up inside and out. Nobody was coming out or going in. 2Yahveh told Joshua, "I'll deliver Jericho to you, its king and strong fighting men. 3Have Israel's fighting men march around the city once a day for a week. 4Have seven priests each a carry ram's horn ahead of the Ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times while the priests blow their rams' horns. 5As soon as you hear a long blast on the rams' horns, raise the battle cry as loud as you can, and the city wall will fall down flat. Every man, go straight in."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joshua called the priests and told them to take the Ark and have seven priests each carry a ram's horn ahead of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He told the people to start marching around the city with the armed men ahead of the Ark.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The seven priests went forward blowing rams' horns in front of Yahveh with the Ark behind them. 9The armed men went first ahead of the priests, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. The rams' horns blew continually.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Joshua told the people, "Don't raise the war cry till the day I tell you." 11He sent the Ark around the city once. Then they spent the night in camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Joshua got up early and the priests took the Ark, 13and the seven priests went along, blowing the horns continually. The armed men went first ahead of them, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. 14The second day they marched around the city once and went back to camp. They did that for six days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city the same way seven times. 16The seventh time, when the priests blew the rams' horns, Joshua told the people, "Raise the battle cry! Yahveh is delivering the city to you. 17The city and everything in it will be devoted to him for destruction. Only Rahab the harlot and her household will live; she hid the messengers we sent. 18Make sure you keep away from the things devoted to destruction. If you take any devoted thing, you'll bring trouble on Israel's camp and get it destroyed. 19All the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items, are sacred to Yahveh. They'll go into his treasury."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The priests blew the rams' horns. As soon as the people heard them, they raised the battle cry as loud as they could, and the wall fell down flat. Every man went straight ahead up into the city and took it. 21With swords they destroyed men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joshua told the two men that had spied out the land to go to the harlot's house and bring her and her relatives out, like they'd promised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They went in and brought out her, her parents, brothers, and relatives; and put them outside the camp. 24They burned the city and everything in it, but put in Yahveh's treasury the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items. 25Rahab and her father's family still live in Israel because she hid the spies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Joshua bound an oath on them, "Cursed by Yahveh is anyone that rebuilds this city. He'll lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Yahveh was with Joshua, and his fame spread all over the territory. Achan's Sin</span>
