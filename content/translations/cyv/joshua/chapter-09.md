## Joshua Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The kings heard about it in the hill country and the western foothills along the Mediterranean Sea up to Lebanon—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 2They formed an alliance against Israel. The Gibeonites Deceive Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But when the people in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 4they resorted to trickery. They made fake preparations: worn-out sacks on their donkeys; worn-out, torn, and mended wineskins; 5worn-out and patched sandals, and worn-out clothes. Their provisions were dry and moldy. 6They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and told him and Israel, "We've come from a distant country. Make a treaty with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Maybe you're living among us. How could we make a treaty with you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They said to Joshua, "We're your servants." "Who are you? Where do you come from?" 9"We've come a long way because of Yahveh your God. We've heard what all he did in Egypt, 10and to the Amorite kings beyond the Jordan—Sihon and Og, who lived in Ashtaroth. 11Our elders and the people in our country told us to take provisions for the journey, go meet you, and say, 'We're your servants. Make a treaty with us.' 12Our bread was still warm when we took it from our houses for the trip. Now it's dry and moldy. 13These wineskins were new when we filled them; now they've burst. These clothes and shoes are worn out from the trip."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The men took some of their provisions and didn't ask direction from Yahveh. 15Joshua made peace with them and let them live. The leaders of the community swore to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Three days later, they found out they were neighbors. 17Israel set out and reached their towns on the third day: Gibeon, Cherphirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 18But they didn't kill them, because their leaders had sworn by Yahveh God of Israel. The community murmured against the leaders, 19"We've sworn to them by Yahveh God of Israel. We can't touch them. 20We'll let them live so wrath won't come on us." 21They cut wood and drew water for the community—like the leaders told them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joshua sent for them and said, "Why lie to us and say you were from a distant country when you were living among us? 23Now you're cursed. Some of you will always be slaves, cutting wood and drawing water for my God's house."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They answered Joshua, "We heard that Yahveh your God had commanded Moses to give you the land and destroy its people. We were afraid we'd be killed 25We're at your mercy. Do to us what you think's right."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> That's what he did and rescued them from the people. 27He made them cut wood and draw water for the community and Yahveh's altar where he chose. They still do that. The Sun Stands Still</span>
