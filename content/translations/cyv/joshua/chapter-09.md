## Joshua Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The kings heard about it in the hill country and the western foothills along the Mediterranean Sea up to Lebanon—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They formed an alliance against Israel. <strong>The Gibeonites Deceive Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But when the people in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>they resorted to trickery. They made <em>fake </em>preparations: worn-out sacks on their donkeys; worn-out, torn, and mended wineskins; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>worn-out and patched sandals, and worn-out clothes. Their provisions were dry and moldy. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and told him and Israel, <em>“We</em><em>’ve come from a distant country. M</em><em>ake a </em><em>treaty</em><em> with us.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 9:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, <em>“</em><em>Maybe you’re living among us. How could</em><em> we make a </em><em>treaty</em><em> with you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They said to Joshua, <em>“We’</em><em>re your servants.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Who are you?</em><em> </em><em>Where do you come from?” </em> <em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“We’ve</em><em> come </em><em>a long way because of Yahveh</em> <em>your God.</em><em> </em><em>We’ve heard what all he did in Egypt, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>to the </em><em>Amorite kings </em><em>beyond the Jordan—Sihon </em><em>and </em><em>Og</em><em>, who</em><em> lived in Ashtaroth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Our</em><em> elders and the </em><em>people in our country told us to t</em><em>ake provisions for the journey, go meet </em><em>you, and say, ‘We’</em><em>re your servants</em><em>.</em><em> Make a treaty with us.’ </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>O</em><em>ur</em><em> bread was still warm when we </em><em>took it from our houses </em><em>for the </em><em>trip. N</em><em>ow it’s dry and moldy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>These</em><em> wineskins</em><em> were new when we filled them; now they’ve burst. These clothes and shoes are worn out from the trip.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>The men took some of their provisions and didn’t ask direction from Yahveh. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Joshua made peace with them and let them live. The leaders of the community swore to them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Josh 9:7-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Three days later, they found out they were neighbors. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Israel set out and reached their towns on the third day: Gibeon, Cherphirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But they didn’t kill them, because their leaders had sworn by Yahveh God of Israel. The community murmured against the leaders, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“We’ve</em><em> sworn to them by </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>God of Israel</em><em>. W</em><em>e can’t touch them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>We’ll</em><em> let them live so wrath won’t </em><em>come</em><em> on us.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They cut wood and drew water for the community—like the leaders told them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Joshua sent for them and said, <em>“Why </em><em>lie to</em><em> us and say</em><em> you were </em><em>from a </em><em>distant country</em><em> when you </em><em>were living</em><em> among us?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> you’re cursed</em><em>. S</em><em>ome of you will always be slaves, cuttin</em><em>g wood and drawing water for my God’s</em><em> house.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>They answered Joshua, <em>“</em><em>W</em><em>e heard that </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>your God had commanded Moses to give you the land </em><em>and </em><em>destroy </em><em>its</em><em> p</em><em>eople</em><em>.</em><em> W</em><em>e </em><em>were afraid</em><em> </em><em>we’d be killed </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>e’re</em><em> </em><em>at your mercy</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Do </em><em>to us what </em><em>you</em><em> think’s right</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>That’s what he did and rescued them from the people. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He made them cut wood and draw water for the community and Yahveh’s altar where he chose. They still do that.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></span>
