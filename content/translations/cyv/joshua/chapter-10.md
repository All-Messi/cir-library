## Joshua Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had taken Ai and destroyed it like Jericho and its king. He heard how Gibeon had made peace with Israel and was among them. 2He was really afraid because Gibeon was a big city, like a royal city. It was bigger than Ai and its men were strong. 3So he sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, 4"Help me attack Gibeon; it has made peace with Israel." 5Those five allied forces camped against Gibeon and attacked it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The men in Gibeon sent to Joshua at camp in Gilgal, "Don't relax your grip on us. Come quick and save us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have formed an alliance against us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So Joshua and the fighting men went up from Gilgal. 8Yahveh told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them. I'll deliver them to you. Not a man will stand against you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He marched up all night and attacked them by surprise. 10Yahveh threw them into panic, and Israel killed them with a great slaughter. They chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 11As they fled down the ascent of Beth-horon, Yahveh sent big hailstones on them all the way to Azekah. More died from hailstones than Israel killed with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then in front of Israel, Joshua spoke to Yahveh the day he gave the Amorites to Israel, "Have the sun stand still at Gibeon and the moon over the Valley of Aijalon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the sun stood still, and the moon stayed till the nation took revenge on its enemies. It's recorded in The Book of Jashar. The sun stood still at midday and didn't go down for about a day. 14There wasn't a day like it before or since when Yahveh listened to such an extreme request by someone, because he fought for Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Joshua and Israel came back to camp at Gilgal. Five Amorite Kings Executed</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The five kings fled and hid in the cave at Makkedah. 17People told Joshua where they were hiding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said, "Roll large rocks against the mouth of the cave and post a guard. 19Don't stay there. Chase your enemies and fall on them. Don't let them get into their towns. Yahveh your God will deliver them to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Joshua and the Israelites killed them with a great slaughter till they wiped them out, but some stragglers got back into the fortified towns. 21The people came back safe to Joshua at Makkedah. Nobody said a word against Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then Joshua told them to open the cave and bring out the five kings. [23]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He told the commanders and fighting men, "Put your feet on their necks. 25Don't be afraid or intimidated; be strong and courageous. This is what Yahveh will do to all the enemies you fight."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He struck them and put them to death and hung them on five trees. 27At sundown he had the men take them down, throw them back into the cave, and put large rocks against its mouth. They're still there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That day Joshua struck down everybody in Makkedah with the sword and did to its king what he'd done to Jericho's king. Southern Towns Conquered</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He and Israel passed on from Makkedah and attacked Libnah. 30Yahveh gave it and its king to Israel. He struck everybody in it with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Next, Joshua lay siege to Lachish, 32and Yahveh gave it to Israel. He took it on the second day and stuck everybody in it with the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then Horam, king of Gezer, came to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people till there weren't any left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> He passed on from Lachish, laid siege to Eglon, and attacked it. 35They took it that day, struck it with the sword and destroyed everyone in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Joshua went up from Eglon to attack Hebron. 37He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then he turned back and attacked Debir. 39He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them. So he did to Debir what he'd done to Hebron, Libnah, and their kings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Joshua defeated the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, the slopes, and their kings. He destroyed everybody that breathed—like Yahveh commanded. 41He defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, the whole country of Goshen as far as Gibeon. 42He took those kings and their land in one campaign because Yahveh God of Israel fought for them. 43Then he and Israel went back to camp at Gilgal. Northern Kings Defeated</span>
