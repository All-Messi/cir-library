## Job Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elihu continued: 2"Do you think it's righteous for you to say you're upright before God?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You say, 'What advantage will I have? What benefit will I get more than if I'd sinned?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'll answer you and your friends.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Look at the sky; the clouds are higher than you are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> If you've sinned, what do you gain against God? if you have lots of sins, what harm are you doing to him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If you're good, what good are you doing for him? What good does he get out of you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Your goodness is for other people like you. 9"They cry out because they're oppressed; they call for help against powerful people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But nobody says, 'Where's God my Maker, who gives songs at night,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> who teaches us more than the animals on the ground and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> There bad people call out, but he doesn't answer because they're arrogant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Indeed, God will ignore empty cries; the Almighty doesn't pay any attention to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> How much less when you say you don't see him; he has your case, but you're having to wait for him to give notice!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Now, since he hasn't visited in his anger and acknowledged sin enough,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> you open your mouth with empty talk, Job, not knowing what you're talking about."</span>
