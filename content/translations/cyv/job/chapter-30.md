## Job Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But now people younger than me make fun of me, people whose fathers I wouldn't let run with my sheep dogs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> What good was their strength to me, fellows whose vigor was gone?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They were haggard from hunger and want and clawed the dry ground in the wastelands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They picked wild greens from among the bushes and ate the roots of broom shrubs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People drove them away; they shouted at them like they were thieves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So they lived in ravines, caves, and rocks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> they sounded like animals in the bushes and huddled together under the nettles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A senseless, unnamed bunch, they were outcasts from society. 9"Now their sons mock me with songs and use my name as a byword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They're appalled at me and shrink back; they don't hesitate to spit in my face.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Because God has removed my bowstring and cast me down, people don't hesitate to argue with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> This rabble opposes me, drives me out, lays traps for me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They tear up my road and profit from my misfortune; nobody restrains them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They come at me as if through a wide breach; they roll in like a storm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They terrorize me and chase my honor like the wind; my prosperity dissipates like a cloud. 16"My life ebbs out of me; depression has taken hold of me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> At night my bones ache, and soreness gnaws at me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> My clothes are tattered from violence; they hang on me like a coat. 19"You've thrown me in the mud; you've made me like dust and ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I call out to you, but you don't answer; I stand up, but you turn your attention elsewhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You've become cruel and use your power to persecute.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You pick me up and blow me around in the wind; you destroy me in the storm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I know you're going to bring me to death, the destiny of all the living. 24"Don't people in a pile of ruins hold out their hands and in their misery call out for help?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Haven't I cried for people whose life is hard? Wasn't I grieved for the needy?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When I expected good, evil came; when I needed light, darkness arrived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I'm in turmoil inside; I can't relax; days of misery lie ahead of me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I go around mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly and call out for help.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> I've become a brother to jackals, a companion of owls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> My skin is ashen, and I'm burning up with fever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> My harp plays music for mourning; my flute moans with those who weep.</span>
