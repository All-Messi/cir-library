## Job Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bildad the Shuhite answered: 2"How long will you talk like that? You make your mouth a blustering wind?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty twist the truth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When your children sinned against him, he delivered them to the consequences of their sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If you look for God and beg for mercy from the Almighty,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> if you're pure and just, he'll certainly act on your behalf and restore you to your good position.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Though you started with little, you'll end up with a lot. 8"Ask previous generations and find out what the ancestors learned;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> we're only like yesterday and don't know much; our short time on earth has been like a shadow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Won't they teach you and offer their thoughts? 11"Can papyrus grow where there's no marsh? Can reeds grow without water?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> While they're still growing and not ready to be cut, they wither sooner than grass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The paths of everyone that forgets God are like that; the hopes of godless people perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What they depend on breaks down; what they trust is like a spider's web.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They trust it, but it doesn't hold firm; when they take hold of it, it mashes in their hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It's like a lush plant that thrives in the sunshine and spreads its shoots across the garden,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> whose roots twine around a rock pile and grow among the stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But if it's pulled loose, you can't tell it was ever there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> That's the extent of its 'joy'; others sprout up to replace it. 20"God doesn't reject blameless people or give sinners a hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Yet he'll fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> In the end, those who hate you he'll cover with disgrace; the tents of sinners won't exist anymore."</span>
