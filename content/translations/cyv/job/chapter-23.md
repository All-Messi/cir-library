## Job Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"My complaint is still bitter; God's hand weighs heavily on me despite my groaning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If only I knew where to find him so I could go to his courtroom!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'd present my case and offer my arguments.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'd find out what he'd answer and understand what he'd say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Would he oppose me with his great power? No, he'd listen!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Someone godly would be reasoning with him, and my Judge would acquit me permanently. 8"I go east, but he's not there; I go west, but I can't find him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When he acts in the north, I can't see it; when he turns to the south, he's hidden there too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But he knows where I'm going; when he tests me, I'll come out like pure gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I've stayed close to his steps and kept to his ways without turning aside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I haven't veered off from his commands; I've treasured up what he says more than food.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But once he's made up his mind, who can change it? He'll go ahead and do to me what he wants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He'll fulfill his plans; he has intentions for my whole destiny.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So I'm intimidated by him; when I think about all this, it scares me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It's God that's made my heart faint, the Almighty that's terrified me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Yet the darkness doesn't silence me or the deep gloom that covers me.</span>
