## Job Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job took up his discourse again: 2"Oh that I could be like I was just a few months ago when God was watching over me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> when his lamp shined above my head and I walked through darkness by his light,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> while I was in the prime of life and his friendship hovered above my tent,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> when my feet were drenched with cream and the millstone poured out streams of olive oil for me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> when I went to the city gate and took my seat in the town square.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Young men saw me and stepped aside, old men stood up,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> officials stopped talking and put their hands over their mouths;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> nobles' voices got quiet and put their tongues against their palates.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> When people heard me, they praised me; when they saw me, they spoke well of me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> because I helped the poor that asked for it and the orphan that had no advocate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> People about to die blessed me; I made widows sing for joy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I dressed in goodness; justice covered me like a robe and turban.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I became a father to the needy and helped strangers I didn't know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I broke the jaws of the wicked and snatched the prey from their teeth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then I supposed, 'I'll die in my nest and multiply my days like sand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My roots reach out to the water; dew lies all night on my branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> My honor is always fresh; my bow stays new in my hand.' 21"They listened to me, waited, and kept quiet to hear my advice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When I spoke, they had nothing to add; what I said was sufficient for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They waited for me like spring rain and drank in my words like fresh showers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I smiled at them when they weren't sure what to do; they valued my approval.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I told them what course of action to take and sat as their chief; I lived like a king among his troops, like somebody that comforted mourners.</span>
