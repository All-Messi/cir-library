## Job Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My heart pounds when I think about this; it feels like it's out of place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen closely to his thundering, the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He unleashes his lightning under the whole sky; it travels to the horizon in every direction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> After it his roars; he thunders with his majestic voice and doesn't hold anything back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God thunders wondrously and does extraordinary things we can't comprehend.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He tells the snow to fall on the ground and the rain to be heavy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He stops everyone's labor so they can watch his work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Animals head for their dens and stay in their lairs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The stormy wind comes from its rooms, and the driving winds bring the cold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> God's breath makes ice, and the wide expanse of water freezes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He loads up dark clouds with moisture; they disperse his lightning flashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They change direction by his guidance; they do whatever he commands across the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He makes these things happen either to punish his people or to water the earth and show his love. 14"Listen, Job, stop and think about God's wondrous works.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Do you know how he controls the clouds or makes lightning flash in them?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Can you explain the layers of dark clouds, the wonders of One that knows everything,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> you whose clothes are hot because the south wind isn't blowing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Can you spread out the sky like he does, as hard as a bronze mirror?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Teach us what to say to him; we can't draw up our case without your help!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Should somebody let him know I want to speak? Does anyone ever want to be destroyed? 21"We can't look at the bright light in the sky after the wind has cleared it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Golden splendor comes from the north; awesome majesty surrounds God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> We can't imagine how extremely powerful the Almighty is; yet he doesn't violate justice and abundant goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So people everywhere revere him because he doesn't value people that are wise in their own conceit."</span>
