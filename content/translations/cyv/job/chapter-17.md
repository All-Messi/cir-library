## Job Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My spirit's broken; my days are snuffed out; people have already dug my grave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Mockers sit around and taunt me to my face.		Job 16:18-17:2 3"God, sign a pledge for me; who else will put up security for me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You've kept them from understanding; so don't let them triumph.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They inform against their friends to get a share of their property; so let their children pass out from hunger. 6"God has made me a byword among people; I'm someone they spit at.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> My sight is blurry from grieving; my neighbors look like shadows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Godly people are appalled at such a thing; innocent people oppose the godless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The righteous hold onto their way; the ones with clean hands grow stronger. 10"All of you, if you come again, I still won't find a wise man among you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> My days are done; my hopes are dashed; my heart's desires are gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You friends claim night is day and say, 'Light amounts to darkness.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> If I look for the grave to be my house and spread my couch in the darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> if I say to the pit, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> where's my hope? Who even cares about my hope?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It'll go down to Sheol with me; we'll go down in the ground together."</span>
