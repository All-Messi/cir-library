## Job Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There's a mine for silver and a refinery for gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Iron comes out of the ground, and people can smelt copper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They use a torch in the darkness and go in as far they can, searching for the ore in gloom and deep shadow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They sink mine shafts far from where people live and go down them, dangling on ropes, swinging back and forth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People grow food on top of the ground; but far below, the ground melts as if by fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Its rocks yield lapis lazuli, whose flecks glitter like gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Birds of prey can't get to it; no falcon has seen it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Proud animals don't set foot in it; fierce lions don't prowl there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Miners find flint and tear down mountains to get at it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They chisel out tunnels in the rock to discover precious stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They dam up trickling streams and bring hidden treasure out to light. 12"But where can people discover wisdom? Where is intelligence located?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> People don't know what it's worth; they can't find it where people live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The deep says, 'It's not here'; the sea says, 'It's not inside me.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Pure gold doesn't exchange for it; silver doesn't weigh out equal to its price.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Its value can't be calculated in the gold from Ophir, in precious onyx or lapis lazuli.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Gold or crystal can't match it; it can't be traded for articles made from fine gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Coral and crystal can't be mentioned with it; acquiring wisdom is more important than buying pearls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The topaz in Nubia can't compare to it; it can't be measured in terms of pure gold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Where then does wisdom come from? Where's it located?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Nothing alive can see it; it's hid from the birds in the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Abaddon and Death say, 'We haven't heard any report about it.' 23"God knows where it is and understands how to get to it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He can see all the way to the end of the earth and everything that's under the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When he decided how hard the wind should blow and how much rain should fall,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> when he decreed the way rain should form and the course a thunderbolt should follow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he put it in place and tested it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He told humanity, 'Respecting the Lord shows wisdom; getting away from sin brings insight.'"</span>
