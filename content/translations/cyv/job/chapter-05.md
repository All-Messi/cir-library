## Job Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Call out for help now; will anybody answer you? Which of the angels will you turn to?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Adversity slays the foolish; anger kills the simpleminded.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've seen the foolish taking root and having their progress immediately cursed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Their children are never safe, they're oppressed in the courts, and there's nobody to deliver them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The hungry eat up their harvest; briers take over it; schemers are eager to get their wealth;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> because adversity doesn't sprout from the dirt, and trouble doesn't grow out of the ground. 7"Mortals are born for trouble like sparks fly up from burning wood. 8"I would seek God; I'd place my cause in front of him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> who does great, unsearchable things, wonders without number.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He sends rain to water the fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He sets the humble up high and lifts mourners to safety.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He frustrates devious plots so they can't succeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He catches the wise in their own shrewdness and quickly thwarts wily people's schemes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They run into darkness in the daytime and grope at noon as at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But he saves people from the sword and the poor from the powerful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So the helpless have hope; the sinful have to shut their mouths. 17"How happy they are that God corrects; so don't despise discipline by the Almighty,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> because he inflicts pain but gives relief,			he wounds in order to heal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He'll deliver you from six troubles; even in seven, tragedy won't touch you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> In famine he'll redeem you from death; in war he'll save you from the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He'll hide you from the scourge of the tongue; you won't panic when violence comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You'll laugh at destruction and famine; wild animals won't scare you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> You'll be at peace with the rocks in the field; the wild animals will be at peace with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> You'll know your tent is secure; you'll inventory your holdings and find nothing missing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> You'll have lots of children, offspring like grass on the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> You'll come to your grave at a ripe old age, like a bundle of wheat at harvest time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> We've examined this and found it's true; listen to it for your own good."</span>
