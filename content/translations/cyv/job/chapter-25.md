## Job Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bildad the Shuhite answered: 2"Dominion and awe belong to God, who establishes order high in his sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Who can count his troops? Who doesn't his light rise on?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> How can anyone be innocent in his presence? How can anyone born of woman be pure?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If the moon isn't bright and the stars aren't pure to God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> how much less people—like maggots, and their offspring—mere worms."</span>
