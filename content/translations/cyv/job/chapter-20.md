## Job Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zophar the Naamathite answered: 2"My thoughts make me answer because I'm in turmoil inside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've listened to your insults, and I'm answering from what I understand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don't you know from of old— from the time God put people on earth—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> that the triumph of sinners is short-lived; the joy of the godless is temporary.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Though they're as tall as the sky, though their heads are in the clouds,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> they'll perish forever like their own feces; people that saw them before will say, 'Where'd they go?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll fly away like a dream, and nobody will find them; they'll vanish like a nightmare.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> People that saw them before won't see them again; their family won't have them around anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Their offspring will have to give back the wealth they'd confiscated and beg from the poor</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They may have youthful health, but it'll lie down with them in the dust. 12"Though evil is sweet in their mouth and they hide it under their tongue,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> though they like the taste of it and won't spit it out,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> yet the food in their stomach will ferment into the venom of asps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Though they swallow wealth, they'll vomit it up; God will purge it from their stomach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They'll suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue will slay them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They won't admire the streams that flow with honey and curds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They'll lose everything they worked for and couldn't swallow; they won't even enjoy the profits from their trading,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> because they've oppressed the poor and seized houses they didn't build. 20"Since their greed is never satisfied, they won't keep anything they enjoy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> There won't be anything left for them to devour; their prosperity won't last.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They'll have so much stuff they can't move; the full force of their misery will stack up against them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> While they're filling their stomach, God will be sending his fierce anger at them and raining it on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They may escape an iron weapon only to have a bronze arrow point run them through.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> It's thrust will come out of their back; the glittering point will puncture their gall; death-terrors will descend on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Their treasures are destined for total darkness; unfanned flames will consume them; whatever's left in their tent will burn up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Sky will reveal their sin; earth will condemn them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Others will carry off what's in their house at the time when God demonstrates his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> That's sinful people's plight, the inheritance God decrees for them."</span>
