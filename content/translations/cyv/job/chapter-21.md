## Job Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"Listen carefully; let this be your consolation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Bear with me; after I've spoken, you can mock me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Am I just complaining about people? Why shouldn't I be impatient?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Be appalled at the way I look; put your hand over your mouth in shock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When I think about it, I get scared and shaky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Why do bad people keep on living and become so powerful?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their descendants are secure in their presence; their offspring are near them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They have safe houses, and God's not beating them with a rod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Their bulls breed without fail, and their cows don't miscarry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They let out their little ones like a flock to skip around and play.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They sing to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps and celebrate with a flute.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They're prosperous their whole life and go down to Sheol in peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They tell God, 'Get away! We don't want you telling us what to do.' 15'Who is the Almighty that we should serve him anyway?' 'What good would it do to pray?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They think they produce their own prosperity; I won't have anything to do with such thinking. 17"Yet how often do sinful people's lamps get put out, does calamity fall on them, does God measure out destruction in his anger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> and they're like straw in the wind, like chaff in a storm?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You say, 'Well, God stores up their sins for their children.' Let him pay it back to the parents so they know it's happening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Let them experience their own destruction and drink the Almighty's wrath themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> What do they care about their families after they die, when they can't talk anymore?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Can anybody teach God anything since he judges even the most powerful?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They die in full strength, completely at ease and satisfied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Their bodies are healthy; their bone marrow is moist,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> while others die in bitterness without tasting anything good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They all lie down in the ground the same way with maggots all over them. 27"I know what you're thinking about: schemes for doing me wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You say, 'Where's the nobleman's house? Where are the tents sinners live in?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Haven't you asked travelers? Don't you believe what they tell you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Sinners are reserved for disaster, to be led out into the fury when it comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Who confronts them openly about their sins? Who repays them for what they do?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> When they're carried to their graves, an honor guard keeps watch over their tombs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The soil in the valley gives them sweet repose; a countless throng precedes and follows them, paying their respects.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Do you think you can comfort me with clichés? Your explanations don't make any sense."</span>
