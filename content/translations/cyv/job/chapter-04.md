## Job Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eliphaz the Temanite answered: 2"Will you be offended if someone offers you advice? Who can help speaking up?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've admonished many people and encouraged the weak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What you've said has helped the tottering stand and weak knees hold firm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But now difficulty has come to you, and you're impatient and distressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Isn't your reverence for God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? 7"Think now, who ever perished that was innocent? Where were the godly ever destroyed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In my experience, those who plow sin and sow trouble, reap it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They perish by God's breath; a blast of his anger consumes them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A lion roars; it can roar loud; but even the teeth of a young lion can be broken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A lion perishes because there's no prey, and the cubs of a lioness scatter. 12"A message crept in quietly to me; I heard it whisper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In my dreams at night when deep sleep comes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> dread overwhelmed me, and I trembled all over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A spirit glided by my face and made my hair stand up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It stood still, but I couldn't make out what it looked like; a form hovered in front of me; everything was quiet; then I heard a voice: 17'Can mortals be good in God's presence? Can they be as pure as their Maker?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> God doesn't trust his own servants; he even brings charges against his angels,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> much more those who live in clay houses, whose foundations lie in dust, who get crushed as easy as a moth!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> In one day they're broken to pieces; they perish forever without anyone noticing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Isn't their tent-rope pulled up inside them? They die in ignorance.'</span>
