## Job Chapter 38

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God answered Job out of the whirlwind: 2"Who is this that confuses my counsel with ignorant words?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Gird up* like a man; I'll ask you some questions, and you answer me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Where were you when I laid the foundation for the earth? Tell me if you have any idea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Who specified its measurements or stretched out a line on it? Surely you know!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> What did its pylons rest on? Who laid its cornerstone</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> when the morning stars sang together and all God's angels shouted for joy? 8"Who shut the ocean in boundaries, when it came bursting out of the womb,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> when I clothed it with clouds and swaddled it with deep darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> when I set its boundaries, bolted its doors,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> and said, 'You can't go beyond this point; here's where your proud waves stop'? 12"Have you ever commanded the morning and made dawn happen</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> so it can spread to the ends of the earth and bring to an end night's evil?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The earth is stamped like clay under a seal; its features stand out like folds in a robe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Light is withheld from sinners, and their uplifted arm is broken. 16"Have you traveled to the springs of the ocean or walked in the recesses of the deep?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you; have you seen the doors into deep darkness?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Do you have any idea how big the earth is? Tell me if you know that. 19"Where's the road to where light lives? Where's the place for darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> so you can take it to its territory and make out the paths to its home?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You know because you were born there, right! and you've lived so long!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Have you entered the storehouses for snow or seen where I keep the hail</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I reserve for troubled times, for the time of war and battle?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Where's the road to the source of light or where the east wind scatters over the earth? 25"Who carved a channel for the flood or laid out the course of a thunderbolt</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> to bring rain on land with no people— on a vacant desert—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> to satisfy desolate land and make grass sprout?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Does rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Whose womb did ice come out of? Who gave birth to frost from the sky?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Water gets as hard as rock; its surface freezes over and imprisons the deep. 31"Can you tie up the chains of the Pleiades or untie the cords of Orion?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Can you lead out the signs of the Zodiac in their seasons and guide the Bear with her cubs?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Do you know the laws of the sky or manage the earth with them? 34"Can you shout to the clouds to get enough water to cover you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Do you send out lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'We're here'? 36"Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave intelligence to the mind?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Who can count the clouds or tip over the water jars in the sky</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> when dust hardens into clumps and forms clods? 39"Can you stalk prey for a lion or satisfy the appetite of young lions</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in their lairs?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Who fixes feed for the ravens when their young call out to God and wander around with nothing to eat?</span>
