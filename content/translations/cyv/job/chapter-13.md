## Job Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've seen that; I've heard it and understand it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> What you know, I know too; I'm not more ignorant than you. 3"But I'm willing to speak to the Almighty himself; I want to argue with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You men are smearing me with things that aren't true; you're untrained doctors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Oh that you'd just be quiet and show your wisdom that way!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Hear me out; listen to what I'm arguing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Will you lie to defend God? Will you speak deceitfully on his behalf?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Will you favor him by how you testify? Will you argue his case for him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> How will you fare when he examines you? Will you try to deceive him like you deceive people?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He'll rebuke you for sure if you secretly skew your testimony to favor him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Doesn't his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall on you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs made of ashes, defenses made of clay. 13"Be quiet so I can talk; then let come on me what may.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Why should I bite my body and take my life in my hands?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Even if he kills me, I'll trust him; but I'll still defend myself to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> That will also be to my salvation because godless people can't approach him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Listen carefully to what I'm saying; let what I'm claiming fill your minds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I've prepared my case; I know I'll be acquitted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Will you defeat me in this argument? If so, I'll shut up and die. 20"Just grant me two things, God; then I can face you:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> don't remove your hand from me or let my dread of you terrify me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then call and I'll answer; or let me speak, then reply to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> How many iniquities do I have? Tell me what my rebellions are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Why do you hide from me and treat me like your enemy?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Do you make a driven leaf tremble or chase dry chaff?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> You list bitter accusations against me and charge me with sins from my youth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You put my feet in shackles and hover over the path as I walk. You set a boundary for where I could go</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> while I was decaying like something rotten, like a moth-eaten shirt.</span>
