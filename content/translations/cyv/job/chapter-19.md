## Job Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"How long are you going to torment me and shatter me with a barrage of words?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You've insulted me ten times over; aren't you ashamed of treating me wrong?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Even if I did make mistakes, that's on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If you're acting superior to me and using my humiliation to argue against me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> know that God is the One that's put me in the wrong and closed his net around me. 7"I cry out, 'Violence!' but I don't get an answer; I call for help, but justice doesn't come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He has blocked my way so I can't go on; he's darkened my path.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He has stripped me of my honor and taken off my crown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He has destroyed me on every side; I'm finished; he's uprooted my hope like a tree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He has flashed his anger at me and considered me his enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His troops have come at me in force; they've camped around my tent and thrown siege works up against me. 13"He has taken my brothers away from me; my acquaintances are alienated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> My relatives are gone; my friends have forgotten me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The ones who live in my house consider me a stranger; I'm a foreigner to my maids.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When I call to my servant, he doesn't answer me; I have to beg him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> My breath is repulsive to my wife; my own brothers detest me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Even kids despise me and contradict me when I stand up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My associates abhor me; the ones I love have turned against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I'm skin and bones; my skin is sloughing off; my teeth are coming loose.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Show me some mercy, friends; God's hand has struck me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Do you have to harass me like he does? Haven't you chewed on me enough? 23"Oh that my words were written down, inscribed in a scroll!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Oh that they were engraved permanently on a rock with an iron chisel and inlaid with lead!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I know my Redeemer's alive, and in the end he'll stand on the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Even after my skin decays, without my body I'll see God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I'll see him myself; the thought of that overwhelms me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> If you say, 'Can we find a way to harass him?' What pretext can we use for a case against him?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> fear the sword because wrath punishes with a sword; you'll find out there's a judgment!"</span>
