## Job Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eliphaz the Temanite answered: 2"Should you answer with empty talk and fill yourself with the east wind?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Should you argue with useless speech, with words that do no good?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You're losing reverence for God and hindering meditation in front of him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Your sin is telling you what you say, and you're choosing misleading language.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You condemn yourself; I don't; you're testifying against yourself. 7"Were you the first person ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Can you hear God's secret counsel? Do you think you're the only one that's wise?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What do you know that we don't know? What do you understand that we don't?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> There are gray-haired, aged men around here that are older than your father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Are God's consolations too small for you or spoken too gently to you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> that you turn against God, and say such things?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Can mortals be pure? Who born of women can be good?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> God doesn't even trust his angels absolutely or regard the sky as perfectly pure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> How much less someone disgusting and corrupt that drinks sin like water! 17"Listen, I'll tell you something; I'll tell you what I've seen—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> what the wise have said, and their ancestors haven't kept to themselves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> people the land was given to and no foreigners passed through—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> the sinful writhe in pain their whole life; the ruthless have a limited number of years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They hear terrifying sounds coming; while they're at peace, destroyers attack them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They don't expect to come back from darkness; they feel destined for the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They wander around asking for food; they know darkness is on its way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Distress and anguish terrify them like a king preparing for battle,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> because they shake their fists at God and defy the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They attack him with abandon, with reinforced shields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They're stout in face and thigh,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> but they'll live in desolate towns, in houses nobody wants to occupy, homes destined for demolition.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> They won't get rich, their wealth won't last; their grain won't be so heavy it bends over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They won't escape from darkness; the hot sun will wither their roots; the wind will blow away their blossoms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They shouldn't trust in emptiness and deceive themselves; emptiness will be their payback.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> It will be paid in full before their time; their palm fronds won't turn green again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Their unripe grapes will fall from the vine; their olive trees will lose their blossoms.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> The godless live in barren company; fire consumes the tents of those who bribe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> They conceive schemes and give birth to evil; their mind prepares deceit."</span>
