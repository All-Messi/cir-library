## Job Chapter 41

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Can you pull Leviathan in on a fishhook or muzzle it with a noose?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Can you tie it up with a rope in its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Will it beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Will it agree to work for you like a slave for life?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Will you make a pet out of it like a bird or put it on a leash for your little girls?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Will traders bid on it or divide it up among the merchants' shops?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Can you hurt its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Put your hands on it, and you'll remember the fight! You won't do that again!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Anything you try to do with it is useless; the very sight of it is overpowering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Nobody is fierce enough to dare to disturb it; who then can stand against me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who has given to me that I should repay? Whatever's under the sky is already mine. 12"I won't fail to mention its limbs, its great strength or graceful frame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who can strip off its outer armor or penetrate its double coat of mail?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Who can pry its jaws open? Its teeth are terrifying!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> It's proud of its hard scales that fit together like a seal,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> one so close to the other that air can't get between them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They interlock with one another and can't be separated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When it sneezes, it flashes out light; its eyes are red like the rays of dawn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Burning torches blaze out of its mouth; sparks fly from it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Smoke pours out of its nostrils as from a boiling pot or burning reeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Flames burst out of its mouth; its breath lights coals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> It has a strong neck that strikes panic wherever goes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The folds of its flesh fit tightly together, firm and unmovable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Its heart is as hard as rock, like a lower millstone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> When it stands up, mighty men scramble and retreat at its thrashing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> No sword can hurt it; neither can a spear, dart, or javelin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They glance off like straws; it deflects bronze weapons like rotten sticks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Arrows can't chase it away; sling stones amount to wads of sod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Clubs do no more harm to it than stubble; it laughs at rattling javelins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Sharp scales like potsherds cover its underbelly; it leaves grooves in the dirt like a threshing sledge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> It makes deep water roil like a boiling pot; it stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The water in its wake foams behind it; you'd think the deep had gray hair.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> There's nothing like it on earth; it's not afraid of anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> It stares down at everything tall; it's king over everything arrogant."</span>
