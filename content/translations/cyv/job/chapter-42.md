## Job Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered Yahveh: 2"I know you can do anything and nobody can thwart what you do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You asked, 'Who is this that darkens my counsel with ignorance?' So I admit I don't understand; these things are too awesome for me to look into.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You said, 'Listen; I'll talk; I'll ask; you instruct me.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'd only heard about you before, but now I see you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So I take back what I've said and repent in dust and ashes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> After Yahveh spoke to Job, he told Eliphaz the Temanite, "I'm aggravated with you and your two friends because you haven't said about me what's right like Job has. 8So take 7 bulls and 7 rams to him and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. He'll pray for you, and I'll accept him so I won't do to you what you deserve, because you haven't said about me what's right like he has."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahveh said, and he accepted Job.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When Job prayed for his friends, Yahveh restored his fortunes and doubled what he had before. 11Then his brothers, sisters, and acquaintances that knew him before, came to eat with him in his house. They consoled him for the misfortunes Yahveh had let come on him. Each one gave him one piece of money and a gold ring. 12Yahveh blessed Job's later life more than its beginning. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. 13He had 7 sons and 3 daughters. 14He named the firstf Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 15In the whole land there weren't any women as beautiful as his daughters. Their father gave them an inheritance alongside their brothers. 16After that, Job lived 140 years and saw his grandsons and great-grandsons, four generations. 17He died an old man that had lived a full life.</span>
