## Job Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong>Job</strong><strong> answered </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong>: </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“I</em><em> know you can do anything</em> <em>	</em><em>	and nobody can thwart what you do.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You asked, <em>‘Who is this that darkens </em>my <em>counsel with ignorance?’</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>So</em><em> I admit I don’t </em><em>understand;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	these things are too awesome for me to </em><em>look into</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>You</em><em> said, ‘Listen; I’ll </em><em>talk;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I’ll ask; you instruct me.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>I’d</em><em> only heard about you before,</em> <em>	</em><em>	but now I see you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>So</em><em> I take back what I’ve said</em> <em>	</em><em>	and repent in dust and ashes.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 42:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <strong>After</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Yahveh</strong><strong> spoke to Job, he told </strong><strong>Eliphaz</strong><strong> the Temanite, </strong> <em>“I’m aggravated with</em><em> </em><em>you </em><em>and your two friends because </em><em>you haven’t said about me what’</em><em>s right like</em><em> </em><em>Job has.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> take </em><em>7</em><em> bulls and </em><em>7</em><em> rams to </em><em>him and o</em><em>ffer up a burnt offering for yourselves</em><em>. H</em><em>e’ll pray for you</em><em>, and </em><em>I’ll accept </em><em>him</em><em> so I won’t do </em><em>to</em><em> you </em><em>what</em><em> you</em><em> deserve</em><em>, because </em><em>you haven’t said about me what’</em><em>s right like </em><em>he</em><em> has.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahveh said, and he accepted Job.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 42:7-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When Job prayed for his friends, Yahveh restored his fortunes and doubled what he had before. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Then his brothers, sisters, and acquaintances that knew him before, came to eat with him in his house. They consoled him for the misfortunes Yahveh had let come on him. Each one gave him one piece of money and a gold ring. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Yahveh blessed Job’s later life more than its beginning. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He had 7 sons and 3 daughters. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He named the first<sup>f</sup> Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>In the whole land there weren’t any women as beautiful as his daughters. Their father gave them an inheritance alongside their brothers. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>After that, Job lived 140 years and saw his grandsons and great-grandsons, four generations. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He died an old man that had lived a full life.</span>
