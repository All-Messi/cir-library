## Job Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust at a young woman?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> What is our portion from God above, our inheritance from the Almighty on high?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Isn't it misfortune for the unjust, disaster for sinners?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Doesn't he see everything I do and count every step I take? 5"If I've supposedly conducted myself falsely and tried to deceive,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> let him weigh me with accurate scales and he'll find out my integrity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If I've strayed off the road, if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen, if any other blemish has stuck to me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> let somebody else eat what I sow; let them uproot my crops. 9"If a woman enticed me, if I've lurked at my neighbor's doorway,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> may my wife grind for somebody else, and let others sleep with her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> That would be shameful, a crime judges would punish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> a fire that would consume all the way to Abaddon and completely burn up everything I own. 13"If I've denied claim by my male or female servants, complaints they filed against me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> how could I face God? What could I say when he questioned me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Didn't the One that made me in the womb make the accuser too? Didn't the same One make us both? 16"If I've withheld from the poor what they needed or stifled widows' hopes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> if I've eaten my morsel alone and a fatherless child hadn't shared it (18from my youth I reared him like a father, and from infancy I guided her),</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> if I've seen anybody perish for lack of clothing or the needy go without clothes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> if their loins haven't thanked me and been warmed with wool from my sheep,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> if I've mistreated the fatherless because I knew the courts would support me—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> pull my shoulder out of its socket and break off my arm at the elbow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> because calamity from God scares me, because I can't resist his majesty. 24"If I've put confidence in gold and called fine gold my trust,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> if I've gloated because I was wealthy and had secured so much,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> if I've looked at the shining sun or the moon moving in splendor,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> and became secretly enticed and threw it a kiss—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> that too would've been a sin the judges punish, because I'd have been disloyal to God above. 29"Have I celebrated my enemy's ruin or been happy when disaster fell on him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> No, I haven't let my mouth sin by asking for his life in a curse. 31"Haven't the ones in my tent said there's no one he's let go hungry?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> No foreigner has had to lodge outside; I've opened my doors to travelers. 33"Have I covered up my sins like people do by hiding my iniquity in my heart,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> because I was afraid of the big crowd and the contempt of families terrified me, so I kept quiet and didn't go outside?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Oh that somebody would listen! Here's my signature on my defense; let the Almighty answer me! Oh that my adversary would write out my indictment;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> I'd carry it openly on my shoulder or wear it proudly like a crown.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> I'd declare to God every step I'd taken and approach him confidently like a prince. 38"If my land cries out against me and my furrows are all wet with tears,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> if I've eaten more than my share of the crops or broken the spirit of its tenants—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> let briars grow on my land instead of wheat, stinkweeds in place of barley." Job's words end here.</span>
