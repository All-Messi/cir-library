## Job Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Zophar the Naamathite answered: 2"Should your barrage of words go unchallenged, and you exonerate yourself by talking a lot?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Will your babble shut people up? Will you mock and nobody rebuke you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You claim your beliefs are pure and you're innocent in God's presence;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> but I just wish God would speak out against you</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, because sound wisdom is not simple; be assured that God doesn't remember just one part of your sin. 7"Can you find out the deep things of God or probe the limits of the Almighty?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They're higher than the sky—what can you do? They're deeper than Sheol—what can you know?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They measure longer than the world and wider than the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> If he passes through or imprisons or calls to judgment, who can stop him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He knows worthless people; he knows about their sin without having to investigate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A stupid man can no more become intelligent than a wild donkey can have a baby. 13"If you set your heart right, you can raise your hands and pray to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> If there's sin in you, get rid of it; don't let it live in your house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then you can hold your head up, be steadfast and unafraid.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You can forget your misery and remember it like water gone by.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Your life will become brighter than noonday; darkness will be like morning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then you'll have confidence because of hope, be protected, and rest in safety.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> You'll lie down, and no one will disturb you; others will ask for your blessing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But the eyes of sinners will be blinded; they can't escape; their only hope is death."</span>
