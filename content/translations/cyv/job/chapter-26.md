## Job Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"What a help you are to the weak! How you've saved arms with no strength!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What counsel you've given me in my stupidity! What brilliant insight you've provided!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who've you been talking to? Whose spirit has been speaking through you?! 5"The departed spirits tremble below the water and its inhabitants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Sheol is naked in front of him; Abaddon has no covering before him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He stretches out the north over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He wraps up water in his clouds, and they don't burst under its weight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He shrouds the full moon in clouds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He has set the horizon between the water above and below and put a boundary between light and darkness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The mountains, pillars of the sky, tremble and shudder at his rebuke.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He calms the sea monster with his power and breaks Rahab in pieces with his intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He clears clouds from the sky with his breath and wounds the celestial fleeing Serpent with his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> These are just fringes of what he does: his faint whisper! his loud thunder! Who can comprehend his power?"</span>
