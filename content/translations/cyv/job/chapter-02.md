## Job Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On another day when the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahveh, Satan came with them. 2Yahveh asked him, "Where'd you come from?" "From roaming around in the world." 3"Have you noticed my servant Job? There's nobody like him in the world, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil. He still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to ruin him for no reason." 4"Skin for skin! Everything mortalsm have they'll give for their life. 5Reach out and touch his flesh and bone, and he'll curse you to your face." 6"He's under your authority. Just don't take his life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Satan went out from Yahveh and struck Job with sore boils from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. 8He was using a potsherd to scrape himself, sitting in ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> His wife said, "Do you still maintain your integrity? Curse God and die!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But he told her, "You talk like a foolish woman. Will we accept good from God and not adversity?" In all that, Job didn't sin in what he said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him. They made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. 12When they looked up from a distance and didn't recognize him, they wailed loudly, tore their robes, and threw dust over their heads. 13They sat down on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw he was in so much pain.</span>
