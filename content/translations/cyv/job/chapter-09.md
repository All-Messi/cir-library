## Job Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"I know that's true, but how can anyone be innocent in God's sight?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If you wanted to dispute with him, you couldn't answer him once in a thousand times.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He's so wise and powerful; who has ever defied him and succeeded? 5"It's God that moves mountains; they don't know it when he overturns them in his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He can shake the earth and make its pillars tremble;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> he can tell the sun not to rise and the stars not to shine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He alone stretched out the sky and tramped on the ocean waves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He made the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and constellations in the southern hemisphere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He does great, unimaginable things, countless amazing deeds. 11"If he passes by me, I don't see him; if he goes by, I can't sense him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He snatches away; who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> God won't turn away his anger; Rahab's helpers cower below him. 14"How then can I answer him or argue with him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Even if I were innocent, I couldn't answer him; I'd have to appeal to my accuser for mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If I called and he answered me, I wouldn't expect him to pay attention to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He attacks me with a storm and multiplies my wounds for no reason.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He won't let me catch my breath, but saturates me with bitterness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> If it's a matter of power, look at him! If it's a matter of justice, who can sue him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Though I'm good, my mouth will condemn me; though I'm innocent, it'll pronounce me guilty. 21"I'm innocent, but it doesn't matter; I despise my life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Innocent and guilty are the same to him; so I say, 'He destroys the innocent with the guilty.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks innocent people's despair.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The earth has been turned over to sinners; he blinds the eyes of his judges. If it's not him, who is it? 25"Now my days go past faster than a runner; they hurry away; they don't see anything good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They slip by like a reed skiff, like an eagle swooping on prey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> If I say, 'I'll forget about my complaint; I'll leave my sad countenance and be cheerful,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I'm afraid of my sufferings; I know he won't declare me innocent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He'll condemn me anyway; why should I try for nothing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Even if I wash myself with snow and clean my hands with lye,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> he'd still throw me into a pit; even my clothes would abhor me. 32"He's not a mortal like me that I can argue with, that I could go to court against.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> There's no mediator between us that could hold us apart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me; don't let my dread of him terrify me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Then I'd speak without fearing him, but I can't do that on my own.</span>
