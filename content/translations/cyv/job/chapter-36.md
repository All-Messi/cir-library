## Job Chapter 36

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elihu continued: 2"Bear with me a little longer, and I'll show you what I have to say on God's behalf.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I'll bring my knowledge from afar and credit goodness to my Maker.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What I'm saying is true; I know perfectly well what I'm talking about.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> God is powerful, but he doesn't despise anybody; he's mighty in his power to understand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He doesn't keep sinners alive, but gives justice to the oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He doesn't take his eyes off of good people, but enthrones them with kings and exalts them permanently.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If they're bound in chains and held tight in a web of difficulties,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> he tells them the reason: it's because they've acted arrogantly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He opens their ears to instruction and commands them to turn away from sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If they listen and serve him, they'll end their days in prosperity, their years in pleasantness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But if they ignore him, they'll perish by the sword and die ignorant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But the godless in heart store up anger; they don't call out for help when he restrains them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They die young; their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions and opens their ears with adversity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So he's luring you with distress into a safe space that's not crowded and has set delicious food on your table. 17"But you've become obsessed with condemning sinners, obsessed with judgment and justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Be careful that anger doesn't lure you into scoffing; don't let the great cost of the ransom turn you aside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Will your wealth or strength keep you away from troubles?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Don't long for the cover of night when people disappear unnoticed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Make sure not to turn to evil, which you've preferred to affliction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> God is honored by his power; who can teach like him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Who has prescribed his conduct or said, 'You've done something wrong'? 24"Remember to extol his work that people sing about.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Everybody has seen it; they can look at it from a long way off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> God is so great we don't understand him; we can't find out how old he is.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He evaporates water drops and distills his mist into rain,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> which the clouds pour down on people abundantly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Can anyone understand how clouds spread out or how thunder claps in his pavilion?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He spreads out lightning all around him and covers the depths of the ocean.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They're how he governs nations and supplies food abundantly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He fills his hands with lightning bolts and hurls them at their marks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Thunder announces his presence and warns livestock that a storm is coming.</span>
