## Job Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elihu continued: 2"Listen, you wise men; pay attention, you that 'know';</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> the ear tests words like the palate tastes food.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Let's choose what's right; let's determine for ourselves what's good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> because Job has said, 'I'm good, but God has disregarded my goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Should I lie about my goodness? I have a wound that won't heal, but I haven't done anything wrong.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Who is like Job that drinks scorn like water,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> that pals around with sinners, that associates with bad people—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> because he said, 'What good does it do to try to please God'? 10"So, listen, you that 'understand.' God would not sin; the Almighty would never do what's wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He pays everyone according to what they've done and treats them the way their living deserves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> God doesn't act wickedly; the Almighty won't pervert justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who gave him authority over the earth? Who laid the whole world on him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> If he'd take back his spirit, if he'd gather his breath to himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> everybody would die; mortals would return to dust. 16"But if you understand, listen to what I'm saying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Would God be ruling if he hated justice? Will you condemn someone great that's good,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> who tells kings, 'You're worthless,' or nobles, 'You're corrupt,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> who doesn't show deference to officials or care more about the rich than the poor? They're all God's work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They die quickly; at midnight they shudder and pass away; the powerful are taken away without human hand. 21"He watches what people do; he sees their every step.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> There's no darkness or deep shadow where sinners can hide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He doesn't have to investigate anyone and bring them in to find out what they've done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He brings the mighty to ruin without an investigation and replaces them with others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He knows what they've done; he overthrows them at night and destroys them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> He strikes them down openly for their sinfulness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> because they've turned aside from following him and don't care about his ways;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> they've made the poor cry out to him, so he hears the call of the oppressed—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> if he does keep quiet, who can condemn him? when he hides, who can see him, whether individual or nation?—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> so the godless won't rule or become a snare to other people. 31"Has anybody told God, 'I've been disciplined; I won't offend anymore';</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> or, 'Show me what I didn't notice; if I've sinned, I won't do it again'?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Will God punish in a way that suits you when you're the one that rejected him? You have to make the choice, not me; say what you know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> People with insight say to me— the wise, who listen to me— 35'Job doesn't know what he's talking about; his words don't make sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> He deserves the maximum penalty because of the sinful way he answers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> He's adding rebellion to his sins; he scornfully claps his hands at us and multiplies his words against God.'"</span>
