## Job Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Afterward Job cursed the day he was born: [2] 3"Perish the day I was born, the night I was conceived.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> May that be a dark day; let God above not care about it or any light shine on it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Let darkness and gloom claim it, dark clouds cover it, and darkness make it terrifying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let darkness seize that night; let it not celebrate among the days of the year or be counted among the months.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let that night be barren, and no joyful shout be heard in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Let them curse it who curse the daytime, who dare to arouse Leviathan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Let its morning stars be blacked out; let it hope for light, but not get any, or see the eyelids of the morning;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> because it didn't shut my mother's womb or hide trouble from me. 11"Why didn't I die at birth— just come out of the womb and die?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Why did the knees receive me and the breasts that nursed me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then I would've lain down in peace; I would've slept and been at rest</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> with kings and advisors that rebuilt ruins for themselves,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> with rulers that had gold and filled their houses with silver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Why wasn't I a miscarriage that was discarded, that never saw the light of day?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Sinners stop raging in death, and the weary rest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Captives are at ease together; they don't hear a taskmaster.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The least and the greatest are there; slaves are free from their masters. 20"Why does light come to those who are suffering, and life to the bitter;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> to people who long for death and it doesn't come, who dig for it more than for hidden treasure;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> who celebrate greatly, glad to find the grave?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Why is light given to someone with no future, someone God has hemmed in with difficulties?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I sigh at the sight of food and pour out groans like water;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> because what I'm afraid of comes at me, and what I dread happens to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I'm not at ease, I'm not at peace; I'm not at rest; only trouble is coming."</span>
