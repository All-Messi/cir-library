## Job Chapter 40

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh said to Job, 2"Will a faultfinder spar with the Almighty? Let the one that argues with God answer that."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Job said, 4"I'm insignificant; what kind of answer can I give? I've put my hand over my mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I've spoken once or twice; that's enough; I don't have anything else to say."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh answered him out of the storm: 7"Gird up* like a man; I'll ask you some questions, and you answer me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Will you really try to discredit me to justify yourself?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Do you have an arm like mine? Can you thunder like me? 10"Go ahead and put on eminence and dignity; dress yourself with honor and majesty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Pour out your overflowing anger; look at everybody that's proud and humble them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Look down on everybody that's arrogant; walk on sinners where they stand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Bury them in the dust together; imprison them in the hidden place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then I'll acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you. 15"Look at Behemoth, which I made as well as I did you; it eats grass like an ox.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It has strong loins and powerful muscles in its stomach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> It swings its tail like a cedar beam; the sinews in its thighs intertwine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Its bones are like bronze tubes; its limbs, like iron bars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It's a prime example of my what I've created; only the One that made it need bring his sword!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The mountains produce its food, where wild animals play.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> It lies down under the lotus plants and hides among the reeds in the marsh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The lotus plants give it shade; the willows by the stream surround it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> It doesn't care if the river rages or worry if the Jordan rushes at its mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Can anyone capture it when it's awake? Can anybody trap it and put a ring in its nose?</span>
