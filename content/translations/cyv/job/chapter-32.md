## Job Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. 2Then Elihu Ben-Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he'd justified himself to God. 3He was mad at his three friends because they couldn't answer Job but still condemned him. 4Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. 5When he saw they didn't provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. 6So he spoke up. "I'm young and you're old; so I've been reluctant to tell you what I believed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I thought age should speak because wisdom should come with age.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But it's the spirit in a person and the breath of the Almighty that give insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Abundant years may not bring wisdom; elders may not understand what's just.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So listen and I'll say what I think too. 11"I waited for your words; I listened to your reasoning while you thought about what to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I paid careful attention; none of you refuted Job or answered his arguments.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don't say, 'We've found him too wise for us; God alone will have to refute him, not mortals.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Job hasn't been arguing with me; but I wouldn't have answered him with your arguments. 15"You're discredited; you don't have anything else to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Should I keep waiting when you're not speaking anymore?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I'll give my answer too and express my opinion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I have so many things I want to say; my spirit constrains me to speak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My stomach is like an unvented wine cask; it's about to burst like a new wineskin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I have to say something so I can get relief; let me answer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> I won't show partiality to anybody or flatter anyone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I don't know how to flatter; otherwise, my Maker would put an end to me."</span>
