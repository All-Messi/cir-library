## Job Chapter **32**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then Elihu Ben-Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he’d justified himself to God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He was mad at his three friends because they couldn’t answer <em>Job</em> but still condemned him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When he saw they didn’t provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So he spoke up. <em>“I’m young and you’re </em><em>old;</em> <em>so</em><em> I’ve been reluctant to tell you what I believed. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> thought age should speak</em> <em>because wisdom should come with age.</em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> it’s the spirit in a person</em> <em>and the breath of the Almighty that </em><em>give</em><em> insight.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em>Abundant</em><em> years may not bring </em><em>wisdom;</em> <em>elders may not understand </em><em>what’s</em><em> just.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> listen and I’ll say what I think too.</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 32:1-10</p>

### 11“I waited for your words; I listened to your reasoning while you thought about what to say.


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> paid careful </em><em>attention;</em> <em>none of you refuted Job</em> <em>or answered his arguments.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>Don’t</em><em> </em><em>say, ‘</em><em>We’ve found him too wise for </em><em>us;</em> <em>God alone will have to refute him, not mortals.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup><em>Job</em><em> hasn’t been arguing with </em><em>me;</em> <em>but I wouldn’t have answered him with your arguments.</em><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Job 32:11-14</p>

### 15“You’re discredited; you don’t have anything else to say.


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>Should</em><em> I keep waiting </em> <em>when you’re not speaking anymore?</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> give my answer too</em> <em>and express my opinion.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup><em>I have so many things I want to </em><em>say;</em> <em>my spirit constrains me to speak.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>My</em><em> stomach is like an unvented wine </em><em>cask;</em> <em>it’s about to burst like a new wineskin.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> have to say something so I can get </em><em>relief;</em> <em>let me answer. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> won’t show partiality to anybody</em> <em>or flatter anyone.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>I</em><em> don’t know how to </em><em>flatter;</em> <em>otherwise, my Maker would put an end to me.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
