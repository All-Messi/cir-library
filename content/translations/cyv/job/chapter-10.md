## Job Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I detest my life; so I'll fully vent my complaint and speak out of my total frustration.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll tell God, 'Don't just condemn me; tell me why you're contending with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Is it right for you to oppress me, to reject my toil, to look favorably on sinners' schemes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Do you just have physical eyes and only see like people see?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Are your days like a mortal's, your years like a human's,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> that you should look all around for my guilt and search diligently for my every sin?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You know I'm not guilty; yet nobody can deliver me from you. 8"'You fashioned me and made me; now you want to kill me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Remember, you made me out of clay; you want to turn me back to dust?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Didn't you pour me out like milk, curdle me like cheese,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> dress me in skin and flesh, knit me together with bones and tendons?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You've granted me enduring love and preserved my spirit with your care;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> yet you hid other things in your heart too. I know that was your real purpose.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> If I sin, you mark me and won't acquit me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> If I'm sinful, misfortune awaits me! Even if I'm good, I dare not hold my head up because I still feel ashamed and look miserable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> If I do hold my head up, you hunt me down like a lion and show me how powerful you are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You multiply your accusations against me; you increase your anger at me and bring hardship after hardship on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Why let me be born? I wish I'd died and nobody'd seen me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> It would have been like I never existed, carried from the womb to the tomb.' 20"'Couldn't you have left my few days alone and stayed away from me so I could have a little cheer</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> before I leave permanently for the land of darkness and deep shadow,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> the realm of gloom and doom, where darkness is as intense as light at noon?'"</span>
