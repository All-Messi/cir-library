## Job Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Aren't people forced into hard labor? Aren't their days like those of a hired hand?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like a slave panting for shade, like an employee waiting for wages,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I've been allotted months of emptiness and given restless nights.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When I'm in bed, I say, 'When is morning ever going to get here?' But night goes on and on, and I toss and turn till dawn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> My body is covered with maggots and scabs; my skin hardens and breaks open and festers. 6"My days fly by faster than a weaver's shuttle and end without hope. 7"Remember that my life is only a breath, God; I won't see good times again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People won't see me for long because I'll be gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Like a dissipating cloud, those who go down to Sheol don't come up again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They won't come home or ever be seen again. 11"So I won't hold back; I'll speak with anguished spirit; I'll complain from my bitter soul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Am I the sea or a sea monster that you set a guard over me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my discomfort,'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with nightmares;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> so I'd have chosen strangulation and death instead of these pains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'm wasting away; I won't live forever; leave me alone; my life is just a breath. 17"What are people that you pay so much attention to them, that you concern yourself with them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> that you examine them every morning and test them all day?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Won't you ever look the other way or let me alone long enough to swallow?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Have I sinned? What have I ever done to you that you keep hounding me? Why do you target me and burden yourself with me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Why don't you just pardon my sin, take away my guilt? Soon I'll lie down in the ground and die; you'll look for me, but I wouldn't be there."</span>
