## Job Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"I've heard a lot of things like that; you're miserable comforters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Is there no end to windy words? What's your problem that you answer me like that?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I could talk to you like you're talking if I was in your place. I could string out words and shake my head at you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Or, I could encourage you so my comfort could lessen your pain. 6"If I speak, it doesn't take away my pain; if I don't speak, how much of it goes away?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> God has worn me out; he's taken away my family.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He has made me skin and bones and used it as a witness against me. My haggard body shows in my gaunt face.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> His anger hunts me down and tears me up; he gnashes his teeth at me; my adversary glares at me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> People gape at me with their mouth and slap me on the cheek in their contempt; they gang up on me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God has handed me over to ungodly people and thrown me away to sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I was at ease, but he tore me apart; he grabbed me by the neck and dashed me to pieces.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> His arrows have pierced me all over; he's slashed open my kidneys without mercy and poured out my gall on the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He's broken me down time after time and charged at me like a soldier.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I sewed burlap on my skin and laid my strength in the dust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> My face is flushed from crying; I have dark circles around my eyes</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> although I haven't been violent, and my prayer is pure. 18"Earth, don't cover up my blood; don't let my outcry cease.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Even now my witness is in heaven; my Advocate is on high.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> My friends make fun of me; I shed my tears to God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Oh that I could plead with him like a person does with his friend!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> In a few years, I'll go the way of no return.</span>
