## Job Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Why doesn't the Almighty maintain a regular court schedule for judging? Why do those who know him wait for him in vain?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Some remove landmarks, seize flocks and eat them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> drive away donkeys that belong to the fatherless, take widows' oxen for pledges.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They run the needy off the road; the poor people have to hide from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor labor at foraging for food, looking for prey in the wild to feed their children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They gather fodder in the field and glean sinners' vineyards.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They spend the night without enough clothes to protect them against the cold.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They're soaked from mountain rain and huddle in the rocks for lack of shelter. 9"Others snatch the fatherless from the breast and take pledges against the poor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They make the naked go without clothes and take away sheaves from the hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They press out oil between the olive rows and tread winepresses for others, yet suffer thirst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From the city, the people groan, the wounded cry out for help, but God ignores their prayers. 13"Others rebel against the light; they refuse to know its ways or stay on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> A murderer gets up at dawn to kill the poor and needy; at night he's a thief.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> An adulterer waits for twilight and says, 'Nobody will see me'; he disguises himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> In the dark they break into houses and sleep in the daytime; they're not accustomed to light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Morning is the same to them as dense darkness; they're allies with the terrors of deep gloom. 18"But they're swiftly carried away like foam on a creek; their land is cursed; they're afraid to go into their own vineyards.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Sheol consumes sinners like drought and heat consume snow.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Their mothers forget about them, maggots feed on them till they're not remembered; they're blown over like trees in a windstorm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They prey on barren and childless women and fail to help needy widows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But God uses his power to drag away the rich; they may get established, but they have no guarantee of life</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He may let them live in security, but he keeps an eye on their progress in life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They're honored for a little while; then they're gone; they're brought low and fade away like everything else, cut off like heads of grain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> If that's not so, who can prove me wrong and make my speech pointless?"</span>
