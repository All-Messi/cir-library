## Job Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eliphaz the Temanite answered. 2"What benefit can a mortal be to God? Aren't even the wise only useful to themselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Is the Almighty delighted if you're good? What good is it to him if you're perfect?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Surely it's not because you revere him that he's reproving you, that he's bringing judgment against you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Isn't it more likely that you're sinful, that your sins are endless?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Maybe you've exacted pledges from your friends and stripped off their clothes as security.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Maybe you've withheld water from the fainting and food from the hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Maybe you think the land belongs to the powerful, that only you honorable types have a right to live in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Maybe you've sent widows away with nothing and crushed the fatherless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So, there are traps everywhere around you, and panic overwhelms you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Your light's so dim you can't see, and a flood is surging over you. 12"Isn't God high in the sky, higher than the stars?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But you say, 'So how can he see what I'm doing? Can he judge through such darkness?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Dark clouds wrap around him so he can't see; he walks on the vaulted sky.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Will you stay on the ancient way that sinful people have walked,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> people snatched away before their time, whose foundations a river washed away?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They tell God, 'Get away!' 'What good is the Almighty to us?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yet he's filled their houses with good things— (but I stay away from sinners' counsel).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Good people are glad to see the wicked get destroyed; the innocent laugh and say, 20'Our adversaries are destroyed; fire has consumed their wealth.' 21"Submit to God; make peace with him, and good things will happen to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Accept his instruction; take his words to heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> If you come back to the Almighty, he'll restore you; if you remove sinfulness far from your home,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> if you throw your gold in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones in the wadis,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> then the Almighty will be your gold; he'll become your choice silver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then you'll delight in the Almighty and look up at God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You'll pray to him, and he'll hear you; and you'll keep your vows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When you decide something, it'll happen; light will shine on your path.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When people put you down, you'll still be confident because he saves the humble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He delivers innocent people; so you'll be delivered because you have clean hands."</span>
