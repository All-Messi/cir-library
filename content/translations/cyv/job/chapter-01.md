### ,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys; and many servants. 4His sons would hold feasts in each other’s houses and invite their three sisters. 5When the feasting days had completed their cycle, Job would consecrate them, getting up early and offering burnt offerings for each one, “Maybe my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.”


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>One day when the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahveh, Satan came too. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Yahveh asked him, <em>“Where’d</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> come from?”</em><em> </em> <em>“From roaming </em><em>around </em><em>in the world.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Have</em><em> you noticed my </em><em>servant</em><em> Job?</em><em> </em><em>There’s nobody in the world like him, </em><strong><em>a blameless, </em></strong><strong><em>godly</em></strong><strong><em> man that </em></strong><strong><em>respect</em></strong><strong><em>s </em></strong><strong><em>me </em></strong><strong><em>and </em></strong><strong><em>shuns</em></strong><strong><em> evil</em></strong><em>.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Does</em><em> </em><em>he</em><em> </em><em>respect</em><em> </em><em>you </em><em>for nothing?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Haven’t</em><em> you planted a hedge around him, hi</em><em>s home, and everything he owns? </em><em>You’ve blessed his work, and his possessions have increased in the </em><em>world</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Reach</em><em> out and touch everything he has, and he’ll curse you to your face.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“Everythi</em><em>ng</em><em> he has is under your authority. J</em><em>ust do</em><em>n</em><em>’t do </em><em>anything</em><em> to </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>.”</em> So Satan left.<strong>	  </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>One day when his sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>a messenger came to Job, <em>“The oxen were plowing</em><em>,</em><em> the donkeys were feeding alongside them, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> the Sabeans attacked and stole them.</em><em> </em><em>They killed the servants with the sword</em><em>. </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“God’s fire fell from </em><em>the sky</em><em> and burned up the sheep and the servants</em><em>. </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“The Chaldeans formed three bands</em><em>, and raided the camels, stole</em><em> them</em><em>,</em><em> and killed the servant</em><em>s</em><em> with the sword.</em><em> </em><strong><em>I’m the only one that escaped to tell you</em></strong><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>While he was still talking, another servant came, <em>“Your sons and daughters were </em><em>drinking wine and </em><em>eating </em><em>in their oldest brother’s house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> </em><em>violent</em><em> </em><em>gale</em><em> from the </em><em>desert</em><em> </em><em>demolished </em><em>the house.</em><em> It collapsed</em><em> on the young people and </em><em>killed them</em><strong><em>. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.</em></strong><em>”</em><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; he fell on the ground and worshiped, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em> “I came naked from my mother’s womb, </em> <em>	</em><em>	a</em><em>nd I’ll </em><em>leave</em><em> naked.</em> <em>Yahveh</em><em> gave and </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has taken away.</em> <em>	</em><em>Bless </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Through all that, Job didn’t sin by blaming God.<strong> </strong><strong>                       </strong><strong>	   </strong></span>
