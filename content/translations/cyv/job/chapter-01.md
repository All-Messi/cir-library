## Job Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job lived in the land of Uz, a blameless, godly man that respected God and shunned evil. 2He had seven sons and three daughters; 3and owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys; and many servants. 4His sons would hold feasts in each other's houses and invite their three sisters. 5When the feasting days had completed their cycle, Job would consecrate them, getting up early and offering burnt offerings for each one, "Maybe my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> One day when the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahveh, Satan came too. 7Yahveh asked him, "Where'd you come from?" "From roaming around in the world." 8"Have you noticed my servant Job? There's nobody in the world like him, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil." 9"Does he respect you for nothing? 10Haven't you planted a hedge around him, his home, and everything he owns? You've blessed his work, and his possessions have increased in the world. 11Reach out and touch everything he has, and he'll curse you to your face." 12"Everything he has is under your authority. Just don't do anything to him." So Satan left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> One day when his sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother's house, 14a messenger came to Job, "The oxen were plowing, the donkeys were feeding alongside them, 15and the Sabeans attacked and stole them. They killed the servants with the sword. I'm the only one that escaped to tell you." 16While he was still talking, another servant came, "God's fire fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants. I'm the only one that escaped to tell you." 17While he was still talking, another servant came, "The Chaldeans formed three bands, and raided the camels, stole them, and killed the servants with the sword. I'm the only one that escaped to tell you." 18While he was still talking, another servant came, "Your sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother's house. 19A violent gale from the desert demolished the house. It collapsed on the young people and killed them. I'm the only one that escaped to tell you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; he fell on the ground and worshiped, 21 "I came naked from my mother's womb, and I'll leave naked. Yahveh gave and Yahveh has taken away. Bless Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Through all that, Job didn't sin by blaming God.</span>
