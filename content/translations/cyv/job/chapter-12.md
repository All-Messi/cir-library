## Job Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"No doubt, you're the people, and wisdom will die with you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But I'm as smart as you are; I'm not your inferior. Who doesn't know things like that?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I'm a laughingstock to my friends, one who called on God and he answered, a just and blameless man; yet I'm a laughingstock.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> In the thoughts of people at ease, there's contempt for disaster; they're ready to give a shove to those whose feet are slipping.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Destroyers prosper; those who provoke God may feel secure, but he'll bring them under his control. 7"Ask the animals, they'll teach you; the birds will explain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Speak to the earth; it will inform you; have the fish in the sea tell you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Who among them doesn't know that Yahveh has brought this disaster on me?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The life of every living thing lies in his hand, including the breath of each person.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Doesn't the ear test words like the palate tastes food?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Old people have wisdom; long life brings insight. 13"He has wisdom and power; counsel and insight lie in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He tears down, and no one can rebuild; he shuts people in, and nobody can release them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> If he withholds water, things dry up; if he sends it, the land floods.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Strength and sound wisdom lie in him; deceived and deceiver are under his control.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He makes advisors walk barefoot and makes fools out of judges.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He takes off kings' belts and binds their waists with a rope.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He makes priests walk barefoot and overthrows those who feel secure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He silences the ones that people trust and takes away the discernment of elders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He reveals what's deep in the dark and brings darkness into light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He makes nations great, then destroys them; he enlarges nations, then lets them go into exile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people and makes them wander in pathless desolation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They grope in the dark with no light; he makes them stagger like drunks.</span>
