## Job Chapter 39

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Do you ever see a deer calving?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Can you count the months of their gestation or learn when they have their fawns?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They crouch down to deliver their young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Their offspring grow strong out in the open; they leave home and never return. 5"Who turned the wild donkey loose? Who untied its ropes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I gave it the open country for a home, desert land to live in?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> It scorns city turmoil and doesn't have to listen to a driver shout at it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> It roams the mountains for pasture, looking for anything green. 9"Will a wild ox consent to serve you and spend the night at your manger?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Can you harness it to plow in a furrow? Will it harrow your fields?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Will you depend on it because it's strong and leave your work for it to do?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Will you trust it to bring your grain home and deliver it to your threshing floor? 13"The ostrich's wings flap happily, but they don't compare with the wings and feathers of a stork.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> She abandons her eggs in the ground to stay warm in the sand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> She forgets that a foot may crush them or a wild ox may tramp on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She's harsh toward her young as if they weren't hers; though her work may be pointless, she doesn't care,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> because God hasn't made her wise or given her intelligence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When she jumps up to run, she laughs at a horse and its rider. 19"Do you give a horse its strength or cover its neck with a mane?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Can you make it leap like a locust? Its majestic snorting is terrifying!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> It paws in the valley and frolics in its strength and charges out to battle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> It mocks fear and doesn't shy away from the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The quiver rattles against it, the flashing spear and javelin too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> It doesn't stand still when the bugle signals; with trembling rage, it races over the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> As often as the bugle blows, it says, 'Aha!' It smells a battle a long way off, the captain's thundering, and the battle cry. 26"Does a hawk soar because you're so smart as it stretches its wings toward the south?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Does an eagle mount up at your command and build its nest up high?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> It lives and lodges on the cliffs, in inaccessible places on the rocky crag.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> From there it spies out prey that it can see from far away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Even its young gulp down blood; they're right there when the kill goes down.</span>
