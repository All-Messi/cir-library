## Job Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Mortals born of women are short-lived and filled with turmoil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They come out and wither like a flower; they pass away like a shadow and don't last.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> You keep your eyes open at them and bring them under your judgment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who can make unclean into clean? Nobody!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Since their days are set, you determine the number of their months and set limits they can't pass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Turn your gaze away so they can relax and finish their day in peace like a hired hand.	Job 14: 1-6 7"There's hope for a tree when it's cut down that it will sprout again and grow new branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Though its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the dry soil,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> at the scent of water it revives and puts out new sprouts like a plant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But people die and just lie there; they expire; where are they?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As water evaporates from the sea and a river dries up,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> people lie down and don't get up. Until the sky ceases to be, they don't wake up. 13"Oh that you'd hide me in Sheol, that you'd conceal me till your anger's over, that you'd set a limit on it for me and remember me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Can the dead live again? I'd have hope, then, all the days I struggle till my release came.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You'd call and I'd answer; you'd look forward to what I'd do,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> because then you'd number my steps instead of counting my sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You'd seal up my sin in a bag and wrap up my iniquity. 18"Like a mountain crumbles and falls and a rock slides from its place,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> like water erodes stone and its torrents wash away soil, so you destroy people's hope.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> You overpower them and they pass away; you disfigure them and send them off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> If their offspring achieve honor, they don't know it; if they're insignificant, they're not aware of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They feel only the pains in their own body and mourn only for themselves."</span>
