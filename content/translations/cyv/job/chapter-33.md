## Job Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But now, Job, listen to what I have to say; hear me out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'm opening my mouth now; the tongue in my mouth is speaking.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> What I'm saying expresses my uprightness; my lips declare knowledge sincerely.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Answer me if you can; state your case; take your stand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I belong to God like you do; I've been formed out of clay too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I shouldn't be a threat you; I won't come down hard on you. 8"You've spoken where I could hear you; I've heard what you said: 9'I'm pure, without sin, innocent, not guilty of anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He invents pretexts against me and considers me his enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He puts my feet in stocks and watches my paths.' 12"Let me tell you, you're not right in this, because God is greater than you are.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Why do you complain that he won't account for everything he does?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> God speaks in one way, maybe two; though people don't notice it—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> in a dream, in a vision at night, when people are sound asleep in bed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then he opens their ears and warns them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> so he can turn them aside from doing wrong and keep them from their pride.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He holds them back from the Pit and their lives from death by the sword. 19"God disciplines people with pain on their beds, with constant aching in their bones;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> so they lose their appetites and even their favorite food disgusts them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Their bodies waste away, and their bones show.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then they draw near the Pit; they come close to the angels that bring death. 23"If there's an angel to mediate for some people— one out of a thousand— to say what's right about them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> then let him be gracious to them and say, 'Deliver them from the Pit; I've found a ransom for these lives.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Let their bodies become fresh with youth and return to their youthful vigor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then they'll pray to God, and he'll accept them so they can see his face with joy and restore their good standing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They'll sing to other people and say, 'I sinned and perverted what's right, but he didn't hold it against me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> He's rescued me from the Pit, and I'll see the light.' 29"God does these things more than once for people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> he brings them back from the Pit so they can see the light of life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Pay attention, Job; listen; keep quiet and let me talk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then if you have anything to say, you can answer me, because I want to see you justified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> If not, listen, and I'll teach you wisdom."</span>
