## Job Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job continued his comments: 2"As God lives, who has taken away my rights, the Almighty, who has made me bitter,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> as long as I'm alive and God's breath is in me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I won't speak wickedness or lie.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I'll never concede that you're right; I'll defend my integrity till I die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll hold onto my claim about my goodness, and my conscience won't accuse me for it. 7"May my enemies be like the wicked; may my attackers be like the sinful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> What hope do the godless have when God cuts them off, when he takes their life away?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Will he listen to their outcry when they get in trouble?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Will they be able to delight in the Almighty and call on him at any time?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Let me teach you about God's power; I won't conceal anything about the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You've all seen that; so why are you saying such foolish things to me? 13"This is sinful people's lot from God, the fate tyrants receive from the Almighty:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> their many sons he destines for the sword; their descendants won't have enough to eat;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> disease buries the ones that outlive them; their widows won't feel like crying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Though sinners pile up silver like dust and make clothes as plentiful as clay,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> the good are the ones that will wear them; the innocent will divide up their silver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The house they build is as fragile as a spider's web or a watchman's hut.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They go to bed rich, but only once; when they open their eyes, their wealth is gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Panic overwhelms them like a flood; a tornado carries them off at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The east wind picks them up and sweeps them away;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> it whirls around them without sparing though they try to escape its power.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> People will clap their hands and jeer at them.</span>
