## Job Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Job answered: 2"Oh that my adversity was properly weighed in the balances with my sins!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> It would outweigh the sand by the seashore; that's why I've been rash.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The arrows of the Almighty are piercing me; my spirit is absorbing their poison; God's terrors are attacking me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass? Does an ox bawl over its hay?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Does anyone eat tasteless food without salting it? Is there any flavor in egg whites?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> My mouth won't touch them; they're disgusting to me. 8"Oh that I could receive what I ask for, that God would grant me what I long for!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Oh that he'd be willing to crush me, that he'd reach out and kill me!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> This is my consolation: I can take comfort in my unsparing pain because I haven't denied the words of the Holy One.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I don't have enough strength to endure. What hope do I have that I should be patient?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Am I as hard as rock? Is my body as firm as bronze?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I can't get any help from inside me; I can't deliver myself. 14"Friends should be kind to people in despair; otherwise, they'll lose reverence for the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> My brothers have been unreliable, like water in wadis you can't depend on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Now they're turbulent with melting ice and snow;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> now they're dry and silent; when it's hot, they stop running.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Their course winds into wasteland and disappears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Caravans from Tema look for them; travelers from Sheba hope to find them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They're disappointed; when they arrive, they're frustrated.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You've been like that to me; you see my misfortune and get scared.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Have I said, 'Give me something'; 'pay a ransom for me from your wealth'; 23'deliver me from my adversary'; or 'ransom me from oppressors'? 24"Teach me and I'll be quiet; show me where I'm wrong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Honest words carry force, but what does your criticism show?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Do you think you can rebuke me by treating my despairing words like wind?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You'd cast lots for orphans and barter your friend!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Look me in the eye; am I'm lying to your face?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Just stop supposing I've done something wrong; my good reputation is at stake here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Has there been anything false about what I've said? Can't I distinguish guilt from disaster?</span>
