## Judges Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After Abimelech, Tola Ben-Puah Ben-Dodo from Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel. He lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim, 2and judged Israel 23 years. He died and was buried at Shamir. Jair Judges Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then Jair from Gilead arose and judged Israel 22 years. 4He had 30 sons that rode 30 donkeys and had 30 "towns" people still call Havvoth-jair in Gilead. 5He died and was buried in Kamon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Again, Israel sinned and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites and Philistines. They forsook Yahveh. 7His anger flared at them, and he sold them to the Ammonites and Philistines. 8They crushed and oppressed Israel that year. For 18 years they oppressed Israel beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites (Gilead). 9The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim; Israel was severely distressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Israel cried out to Yahveh, "We've sinned against you; we've left our God and served the images of Baal."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He said to them, "Didn't I deliver you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines? 12The Sidonians, Amalekites, Maonites oppressed you too. You appealed to me and I delivered you from them. 13Yet you've left me and served other gods; so I won't deliver you anymore. 14Call out to the gods you've chosen. Have them deliver you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> They said to Yahveh, "We've sinned. Do whatever you think's good. Just deliver us today, please." 16They put away the foreign gods and served Yahveh; he couldn't bear Israel's misery any longer. 17The Ammonites called to arms and encamped in Gilead. Israel came together and camped in Mizpah. 18The leaders in Gilead said to one another, "Whoever will lead the fight against the Ammonites will rule everyone in Gilead." Jephthah Judges Israel</span>
