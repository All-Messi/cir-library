## Judges Chapter **14**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He came up and told his parents, <em>“I saw </em><em>a young Philistine woman</em><em> at Timnah.</em><em> Get her for me for</em><em> a wife.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>They said, <em>“Is</em><em>n’t there</em><em> a woman among your </em><em>relatives</em><em> or </em><em>all our people that you have to marry</em><em> </em><em>a woman from the</em><em> uncircumcised Philistines?”</em><em> </em> But he told his father, <em>“Get her for me; </em><em>I really like her</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His parents didn’t know it was all right with Yahveh because he was looking for an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines controlled Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Samson went down to Timnah with his parents and came to the vineyards at Timnah. A young lion roared at him, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and the Spirit of Yahveh came mightily on him. Barehanded he tore the lion apart like it was a kid. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased him well. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>After a while, he went back to take her and turned aside to see the lion’s carcass. There was a swarm of bees and honey in it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. He came to his parents and gave them some to eat; but he didn’t tell them he got it out of the lion’s carcass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Samson said to them, <em>“Let me put a riddle to you.</em><em> </em><em>If you can figure it out and tell me </em><em>during</em><em> the </em><em>week</em><em> of the feast, I’ll give you </em><em>30</em><em> </em><em>linen tunics</span>

### festive robes. 13If you can’t, you’ll give me that many.”  “Let’s hear it.”


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Out of the eater came something to eat.</em> <em>	</em><em>   </em><em> </em><em>	</em><em>  </em><em> </em><em>   </em><em>Out of the strong came something sweet.”</em> In three days, they couldn’t explain the riddle.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 14:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>The fourth day, they told Samson’s wife, <em>“Entice your husb</em><em>and to tell us what the riddle mean</em><em>s</em><em>, or</em><em> we</em><em>’ll</em><em> burn you and your father’s </em><em>family</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Have you invited us here to </em><em>make</em><em> us</em><em> poor</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Samson’s wife cried in front of him, <em>“You </em><em>just hate me, you don’t love me. Y</em><em>ou’ve put a riddle to my countrymen and haven’</em><em>t told me what it mean</em><em>s.</em><em>” </em> He told her, <em>“I haven’t told my </em><em>own parents.</em><em> </em><em>Am I going to</em><em> tell you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>She cried in his presence the week the feast lasted. The seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told her countrymen the riddle. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The men of the city told him on the seventh day before the sun set, <em>“What’</em><em>s sweeter than honey?</em> <em>	</em><em>	What’</em><em>s stronger than a lion?”</em> He told them, <em>“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>y</em><em>ou wouldn’t have </em><em>solved</em><em> my riddle.”</em></span>
