## Judges Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He came up and told his parents, <em>“I saw </em><em>a young Philistine woman</em><em> at Timnah.</em><em> Get her for me for</em><em> a wife.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They said, <em>“Is</em><em>n’t there</em><em> a woman among your </em><em>relatives</em><em> or </em><em>all our people that you have to marry</em><em> </em><em>a woman from the</em><em> uncircumcised Philistines?”</em><em> </em> But he told his father, <em>“Get her for me; </em><em>I really like her</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>His parents didn’t know it was all right with Yahveh because he was looking for an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines controlled Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Samson went down to Timnah with his parents and came to the vineyards at Timnah. A young lion roared at him, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and the Spirit of Yahveh came mightily on him. Barehanded he tore the lion apart like it was a kid. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased him well. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>After a while, he went back to take her and turned aside to see the lion’s carcass. There was a swarm of bees and honey in it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. He came to his parents and gave them some to eat; but he didn’t tell them he got it out of the lion’s carcass.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there. That’s the way young men used to do. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When the people saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Samson said to them, <em>“Let me put a riddle to you.</em><em> </em><em>If you can figure it out and tell me </em><em>during</em><em> the </em><em>week</em><em> of the feast, I’ll give you </em><em>30</em><em> </em><em>linen tunics and 30 festive</em><em> </em><em>robe</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f</em><em> you can’t, you’ll give me </em><em>that many</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Let’</em><em>s</em><em> hear it.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He said, <em>“Out of the eater came something to eat.</em> <em>	</em><em>   </em><em> </em><em>	</em><em>  </em><em> </em><em>   </em><em>Out of the strong came something sweet.”</em> In three days, they couldn’t explain the riddle.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 14:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The fourth day, they told Samson’s wife, <em>“Entice your husb</em><em>and to tell us what the riddle mean</em><em>s</em><em>, or</em><em> we</em><em>’ll</em><em> burn you and your father’s </em><em>family</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Have you invited us here to </em><em>make</em><em> us</em><em> poor</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Samson’s wife cried in front of him, <em>“You </em><em>just hate me, you don’t love me. Y</em><em>ou’ve put a riddle to my countrymen and haven’</em><em>t told me what it mean</em><em>s.</em><em>” </em> He told her, <em>“I haven’t told my </em><em>own parents.</em><em> </em><em>Am I going to</em><em> tell you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> She cried in his presence the week the feast lasted. The seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told her countrymen the riddle. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The men of the city told him on the seventh day before the sun set, <em>“What’</em><em>s sweeter than honey?</em> <em>	</em><em>	What’</em><em>s stronger than a lion?”</em> He told them, <em>“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>y</em><em>ou wouldn’t have </em><em>solved</em><em> my riddle.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Spirit of Yahveh came on him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 men from the city. He took their spoil and gave the festive robes to the ones that told him the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>So Samson’s father-in-law gave his wife to his companion, who had been his best man.</span>
