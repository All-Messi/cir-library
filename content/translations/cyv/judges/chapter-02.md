## Judges Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The angel of Yahveh went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, "I brought you up from Egypt to this land that I swore to give your ancestors. I said, 'I'll never break my covenant with you. 2Don't make any covenant with the people here. Tear down their altars.' But you haven't obeyed me. 3So I won't drive them out. They'll become adversaries, and their gods will be a snare to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When the angel of Yahveh told the people that, they "cried" out loud. 5They called the place Bochim and sacrificed to Yahveh there. The Death of Joshua</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Joshua dismissed the people to their inheritances, 7they served Yahveh while he was alive and the elders that outlived him, who'd seen Yahveh's great work for Israel. 8He died at 110. 9They buried him in his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 10That whole generation passed on to their ancestors, and another generation grew up that hadn't known Yahveh or seen his work for Israel. Disobedience and Defeat</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The people did sin and served the images of Baal 13and Ashtoreth 12and forsook their ancestors' God. They worshiped the gods of people around them. That made Yahveh angry; 14so he let plunderers sell them to their enemies so they couldn't stand against them any longer. 15Whenever they marched out, he opposed them like he'd sworn. They were in dire straits.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Yahveh raised up judges to save them from their plunderers, 17but they wouldn't listen to them. They carried on prostitution with other gods and soon turned aside from the way their ancestors lived. 18Whenever he raised up a judge for them, he was with him and saved them as long as the judge was alive. He took pity on their groaning. 19But whenever the judge died, they'd turn back and do worse than their ancestors and wouldn't quit 20Yahveh was angry and said, "They've sinned against my covenant like their ancestors. 21From now on, I won't drive out any nation Joshua left when he died. 22I'll use them to test Israel to see if they'll follow meY like their ancestors."
