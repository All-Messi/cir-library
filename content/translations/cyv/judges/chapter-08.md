## Judges Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The men in Ephraim said to him, <em>“What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?”</em> They were in animated contention with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>He said, <em>“What </em><em>have I done compared to you? Isn’</em><em>t the gleaning </em><em>of grapes in</em><em> Ep</em><em>hraim better than the vintage in</em><em> Abiezer</em><em>? </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> </em><em>delivered </em><em>O</em><em>reb and Zeeb to you. What have I</em><em> do</em><em>ne</em><em> </em><em>compared</em><em> </em><em>to that</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> They calmed down.</span>

### crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. 5He said to the men in Succoth, “Give loaves of bread to the ones with me. I’m afraid they’re worn out, and I’m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>The officials in Succoth said, <em>“Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should </em><em>feed</em><em> your army?</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Gideon said, <em>“</em><em>All right, then. W</em><em>hen </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>delivers</em><em> </em><em>them to me</em><em>, I’ll fla</em><em>il you with wild briers and thorns</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He told them, <em>“When I come back </em><em>after</em><em> peace</em><em> is restored</em><em>, I’ll </em><em>tear</em><em> down this tower.”</em><em>	         </em> <em>	    </em></span>

### ,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east of the Jordan; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and caught them in a surprise attack. 12Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the <em>names of the </em>77 officials and elders in Succoth. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Gideon</em> came and said, <em>“</em><em>Look, </em><em>Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, ‘Are Ze</em><em>bah and Zalmunna already in </em><em>hand that we should </em><em>feed you</em><em>r </em><em>exhausted </em><em>men?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He disciplined the city elders with wild thorns and briers from the countryside. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>He asked Zebah and Zalmunna,<em> “</em><em>What kind of</em><em> men </em><em>did you kill</em><em> at Tabor?”</em><em> </em> They answered, <em>“</em><em>E</em><em>very one of</em><em> them was like you, like </em><em>a king</em><em>’s son</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>He</em><em> </em>said, <em>“They were my brothers, my mother</em><em>’s sons</em><em>.</em><em> As sure as Yahveh</em> <em>lives, if you had </em><em>let them live, I wouldn’</em><em>t </em><em>have </em><em>kill</em><em>ed</em><em> you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>He told Jether his firstborn to <em>get up and kill them.</em><em> </em> But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, <em>“</em><em>Be a man. Come do it yourself</em><em>.”</em><em>  </em><em>	</em></span>

### Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels’ necks.


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Then the Israelites said to him, <em>“Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve delivered us from Midian.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> won’t</em><em> </em><em>be your </em><em>rule</em><em>r. My son won’t</em><em> </em><em>either</em><em>.</em><em> Yahveh</em> <em>will b</em><em>e you</em><em>r ruler</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>et</em><em> me </em><em>ask you for one thing, though. Each </em><em>of you</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>give me the earrings from your</em><em> spoil.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>We’ll</em><em> </em><em>be glad to</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The gold earrings we</span>

### pounds 1700 shekels of gold—plus the camels’ crescents. 27Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 28So Israel subdued Midian; they didn’t threaten anymore. The land had peace for 40 years during Gideon’s life.


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Jerubbaal/<em>Gideon</em> went and lived in his own house. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He</span>
<p class="section-ref">had 77</p>

### sons from many wives. 31A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. 32Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.


<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>They didn’t remember Yahveh their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>or show kindness to Jerubbaal’s family in return for everything he’d done for Israel.</span>
