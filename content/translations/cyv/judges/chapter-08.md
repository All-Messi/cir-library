## Judges Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The men in Ephraim said to him, "What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?" They were in animated contention with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He said, "What have I done compared to you? Isn't the gleaning of grapes in Ephraim better than the vintage in Abiezer? 3God delivered Oreb and Zeeb to you. What have I done compared to that?" They calmed down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gideon and the 300 crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. 5He said to the men in Succoth, "Give loaves of bread to the ones with me. I'm afraid they're worn out, and I'm chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The officials in Succoth said, "Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your army?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Gideon said, "All right, then. When Yahveh delivers them to me, I'll flail you with wild briers and thorns." 8He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told them, "When I come back after peace is restored, I'll tear down this tower."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east of the Jordan; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and caught them in a surprise attack. 12Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, 14he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the names of the 77 officials and elders in Succoth. 15Gideon came and said, "Look, Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, 'Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your exhausted men?' 16He disciplined the city elders with wild thorns and briers from the countryside. 17He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" They answered, "Every one of them was like you, like a king's son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He said, "They were my brothers, my mother's sons. As sure as Yahveh lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn't have killed you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He told Jether his firstborn to get up and kill them. But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Be a man. Come do it yourself." Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels' necks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the Israelites said to him, "Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well. You've delivered us from Midian." 23"I won't be your ruler. My son won't either. Yahveh will be your ruler. 24Let me ask you for one thing, though. Each of you, give me the earrings from your spoil." 25"We'll be glad to." They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. 26The gold earrings weighed 50 pounds 1700 shekels of gold—plus the camels' crescents. 27Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 28So Israel subdued Midian; they didn't threaten anymore. The land had peace for 40 years during Gideon's life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jerubbaal/Gideon went and lived in his own house. 30He had 77 sons from many wives. 31A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. 32Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. 34They didn't remember Yahveh their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, 35or show kindness to Jerubbaal's family in return for everything he'd done for Israel. Abimelech's Conspiracy</span>
