## Judges Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong>Jephthah</strong> from Gilead was a strong soldier, but he was a prostitute’s son. His father was Gilead. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Gilead’s <u>wife</u> also bore him sons. When her sons grew up, they shoved Jephthah out, <em>“You won’</em><em>t inherit in our father’s house. Y</em><em>ou’re </em><em>another woman’s son</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He ran away and lived in the land of Tob. Ruffians gathered around him and went on raids with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>After a time the Ammonites went to war against Israel. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The elders in Gilead went to bring Jephthah from Tob, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“Come</em><em>, </em><em>lead</em><em> </em><em>us </em><em>so we can fight the Ammonites.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jephthah went with them, and the people made him their leader. He swore in at Mizpah in front of Yahveh.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 11:1-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He sent messengers to the Ammonite king, <em>“What </em><em>do</em><em> you </em><em>have </em><em>against me that you’ve </em><em>attacked</em><em> my land?”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The king answered his messengers, <em>“Because when Israel came out of Egypt, he took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok to the Jordan.</em><em> R</em><em>e</em><em>turn</em><em> it peacefully.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jephthah sent messengers back to him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But the Ammonite king of the Ammonites wouldn’t listen. 	<strong>Jud 11:</strong><strong>12-</strong><strong>28</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The Spirit of Yahveh stirred up Jephthah, and <em>he</em> went through Gilead and Manasseh to Mizpah in Gilead and on to the Ammonites. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He vowed to Yahveh, <em>“If you’ll give the Ammonites to me, </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>what</em><em>ever</em><em> comes out of my house to meet me when I </em><em>get back, I’</em><em>ll offer up for a burnt offering.”</em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He crossed over to fight them, and Yahveh gave them to him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>He massacred them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, 20 towns, and as far as Abel-keramin. So Israel subdued the Ammonites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah, and his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She was his only child. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>When he saw her, he tore his clothes, <em>“My daughter!</em><em> You’ve brought me</em><em> low</em><em>! Y</em><em>ou’ve </em><em>brought</em><em> me great trouble! </em><em>I’ve opened my mouth to </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, and I can’t take back my vow.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> She said, <em>“Father, if you’ve </em><em>vowed</em><em> to </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, do to me what </em><em>you’ve vowed</em><em>, now that he has avenged you o</em><em>f</em><em> the Ammonites.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> this for me: l</em><em>et me alone two months </em><em>so</em><em> my companions </em><em>and I can wander i</em><em>n the mountains and </em><em>mourn</em><em> my virginity.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He said, <em>“Go ahead.”</em> He sent her away; she and her companions left to mourn her virginity for two months. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>She came back to her father, who did with her according to his vow. She never knew a man. It became a custom in Israel <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>that the young women went four days a year to mourn the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.</span>
