## Judges Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh left those nations to the test the Israelites that hadn't experienced war in Canaan. [2] 3The nations were the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, Sidonians, the Hivites on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They served to test whether Israel would obey Yahveh's commandments to their ancestors by Moses. 5So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 6They intermarried with them and served their gods. Othniel Judges Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Israel forgot Yahveh its God and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. 8He was angry and sold Israel to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for 8 years. 9When they appealed to Yahveh, he raised up Othniel Ben-Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, to deliver them. 10The Spirit of Yahveh stirred him up to judge Israel. He went out to war, and Yahveh delivered Cushan-rishathaim to him. 11The land had peace for 40 years. Then Othniel died. Ehud Judges Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The people sinned again, and Yahveh strengthened Eglon, king of Moab. 13He gathered the Amorites and Amalekites, defeated Israel, and took the City of Palms. 14Israel served him for 18 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But when Israel appealed to Yahveh, he raised up Ehud Ben-Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon. 16Ehud made a double-edged sword 18ins long and fastened it under his right thigh under his clothes. 17He presented the tribute to Eglon, an obese man. 18When he'd presented it, he sent away the people that carried it. 19At the idols near Gilgal, he turned back and said, "I have a private message for you, King." He said, "Just a minute." His attendants went out. 20Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof room. He said, "I have a message from God for you." He got up from his seat. 21Ehud reached with his left hand, took his sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon's belly. 22The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. He didn't pull it out, and the refuse came out. 23Ehud went out to the anteroom, closed the doors to the roof room, and locked them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When he'd gone, the servants came and saw the doors locked, and thought he was relieving himself in the cool room. 25They waited till they were completely confused. When he still didn't come out, they took the key and opened the doors. There he was, on the floor, dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> While they delayed, Ehud escaped past the idols to Seirah. 27When he arrived, he blew the ram's horn in the hill country of Ephraim. The people went down from the hill country with him leading. 28He told them, "Follow me. Yahveh will deliver the Moabites to you." They went down and seized the fords of the Jordan from the Moabites and wouldn't let anybody cross. 29They killed about 10,000 Moabites, strong, able-bodied men. No one escaped. 30Israel subdued Moab that day. The land had peace for 80 years. Shamgar Judges Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> After him came Shamgar Ben-Anath, who killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad and delivered Israel. Deborah Judges Israel</span>
