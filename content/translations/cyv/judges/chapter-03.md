## Judges Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh left those nations to the test the Israelites that hadn’t experienced war in Canaan. [<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The nations were the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, Sidonians, the Hivites on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They served to test whether Israel would obey Yahveh’s commandments to their ancestors by Moses. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They intermarried with them and served their gods. 	<strong>Othniel Judges Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Israel forgot Yahveh its God and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was angry and sold Israel to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for 8 years. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When they appealed to Yahveh, he raised up <strong>Othniel</strong> Ben-Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, to deliver them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The Spirit of Yahveh stirred him up to judge Israel. He went out to war, and Yahveh delivered Cushan-rishathaim to him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The land had peace for 40 years. Then Othniel died.</span>

### Ehud Judges Israel


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The people sinned again, and Yahveh strengthened Eglon, king of Moab. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He gathered the Amorites and Amalekites, defeated Israel, and took the City of Palms. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Israel served him for 18 years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But when Israel appealed to Yahveh, he raised up <strong>Ehud</strong> Ben-Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Ehud made a double-edged sword 18ins long and fastened it under his right thigh under his clothes. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He presented the tribute to Eglon, an obese man. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When he’d presented it, he sent away the people that carried it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>At the idols near Gilgal, he turned back and said, <em>“I have a </em><em>private</em><em> message for you, King.”</em><em> </em>He said, <em>“</em><em>Just</em><em> a </em><em>minute</em><em>.”</em> His attendants went out. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof room. He said, <em>“I have a message from God for you.”</em> He got up from his seat. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Ehud reached with his left hand, took his sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into <em>Eglon’s</em> belly. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. He didn’t pull it out, and the refuse came out. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Ehud went out to the anteroom, closed the doors to the roof room, and locked them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When he’d gone, the servants came and saw the doors locked, and thought he was relieving<em> </em>himself in the cool room<em>.</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They waited till they were completely confused. When he still didn’t come out, they took the key and opened the doors. There he was, on the floor, dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> While they delayed, Ehud escaped past the idols to Seirah. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>When he arrived, he blew the ram’s horn in the hill country of Ephraim. The people went down from the hill country with him leading. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“Follow me. Yahveh</em> <em>will deliver</em><em> the Moabites to you.”</em><em> </em>They went down and seized the fords of the Jordan from the Moabites and wouldn’t let anybody cross. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They killed about 10,000 Moabites, strong, able-bodied men. No one escaped. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Israel subdued Moab that day. The land had peace for 80 years. 	<strong>Shamgar Judges Israel</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> After him came <strong>Shamgar</strong> Ben-Anath, who killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad and delivered Israel.</span>
