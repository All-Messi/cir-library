## Judges Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The men of Ephraim gathered an army, crossed over <em>the Jordan </em>to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, <em>“Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites and not call us to go with you?</em><em> </em><em>We’ll burn your house </em><em>on top of</em><em> you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>Jephthah told them, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>y people </em><em>and </em>I <em>had a </em><em>major</em><em> </em><em>conflict</em><em> with the Ammonites.</em><em> </em><em>When I called you, you didn’t deliver me from them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I saw that you wouldn’t deliver me, I took my life in hand and crossed over against the</em><em>m</em><em>, and </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>delivered</em><em> them to me.</em><em> Why then have you come up </em><em>to fight me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Jephthah gathered the men from Gilead and struck Ephraim because they said, <em>“You Gileadites are refugees from Ephraim in</em><em> Ephraim and Manasseh.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Gileadites captured the Jordan fords. When a refugee from Ephraim asked to go across, the Gileadites would ask him, <em>“Are you an</em> <em>Ephraimite?”</em> If he said, <em>“No,” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>they’d tell him to say<em> shibboleth.</em><em> </em>He’d say <em>s</em><em>ibboleth</em><em> </em>because he couldn’t pronounce it right; so they’d kill him. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites fell.</span>
