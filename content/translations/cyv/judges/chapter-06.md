## Judges Chapter 6

### Gideon Judges Israel

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel did what <em>Yahveh</em> considered evil; so he gave them over to Midian for 7 years. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Because of Midian, the Israelites made dens and caves and barricades in the mountains. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Whenever they sowed anything, the Midianites, Amalekites, and people from the east would come up and attack them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’d camp against them and destroy their crops as far as the territory around Gaza. They wouldn’t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They’d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and brought Israel low. The people appealed to Yahveh,</span>

### [7] 8and he sent a prophet, “Yahveh God of Israel says,’ I led you out of slavery in Egypt, 9and delivered you from other oppressors. I drove them out and gave you their land. 10I told you, “I’m Yahveh your God. Don’t be afraid of the Amorites’ gods where you’re living.” But you ignored me.’”


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now the angel of Yahveh came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son <strong>Gideon</strong> was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The angel appeared to him, <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>is with you, </em><em>brave soldier!</em><em>”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 6:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gideon said, <em>“</em><em>Sir, if he</em><em>’s</em><em> with us, why </em><em>i</em><em>s this happen</em><em>ing</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Where are his wonderful deeds our ancestors </em><em>talked about when he</em><em> br</em><em>ought us</em><em> up from Egypt?’</em><em> He’</em><em>s </em><em>thrown</em><em> us </em><em>away now</em><em> and </em><em>delivered</em><em> us to Midian.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“</em><em>Take</em><em> you</em><em>r</em><em> strength and deliver Israel from the</em><em>m</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Haven’t I sent you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, how can I deliver Israel?</em><em> </em><em>My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I’m the least in my family</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“l’ll</em><em> be with you. Y</em><em>ou’ll strike the Midianites </em><em>as if they were one man</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“If</em><em> I’</em><em>m pleasing to </em><em>you, </em><em>give</em><em> me a sign th</em><em>at it’s you </em><em>speaking to me.</em><em>  </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Don’</em><em>t</em><em> leave till I come back</em><em> </em><em>with your</em><em> present.”</em> <em>“I’ll wait</em><em>.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 6:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Gideon went into the house and fixed a kid and cakes without yeast from 1.1 bushels     <sup>1</sup> <sup>ephah </sup>of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and took them to him under the terebinth tree. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>God’s angel said, <em>“</em><em>Put</em><em> the meat and cakes on this rock and pour the broth over them.”</em>  When he did that, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>the angel touched the meat and cakes with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed them, and he vanished. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Then Gideon surmised that he was the angel of Yahveh, <em>“Lord </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>I’ve seen the angel of </em><em>Yahveh</em> <em>directly</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But Yahveh said, <em>D</em><em>on’t be afraid.</em><em> </em><em>You won’t die.”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then Gideon built an altar to him and called it Yahveh Is Peace [<em>Yahveh</em><em> Shalom</em>]. It’s still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That night Yahveh told him, <em>“Take your father’s bull</em><em> and a</em><em> second bull </em><em>seven</em><em> years </em><em>old, and</em><em> pull down </em><em>your father’s altar to Baal. C</em><em>ut down the </em><em>Asherah pole</em><em> beside it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Build</em><em> an a</em><em>ltar to Yahveh</em> <em>your God on</em><em> top of the </em><em>fortress</em><em> here, with stones laid in order.</em><em> Offer</em><em> the second bull as a burnt offering wi</em><em>th the wood from the Asherah pole </em><em>you cut down.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Gideon took ten servants and did that. He was too afraid of family and townspeople to do it in the daytime, so he did it at night.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 6:19-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When people in town got up early, Baal’s altar was pulled down, the Asherah pole was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar <em>Gideon</em> built. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They asked one another who did it<em>.</em> After they asked around, <em>people</em> said, <em>“Gideon Ben-Joash</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They told Joash, <em>“Bring your son out</em><em> to die. H</em><em>e </em><em>pulled</em><em> down </em><em>Baal’s</em><em> altar and cut down the </em><em>Asherah pole</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Joash said to everybody lined up against him, <em>“Will you defend Baal or his cause?</em><em> </em><em>Whoever fights for him </em><em>will be put to death</em><em> by morning.</em><em> </em><em>If he’s a god, </em><em>he can</em><em> defend himself</em><em>. It’s</em><em> his altar </em><em>that </em>Gideon<em> tore down!</em><em>”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 6:28-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That day he called him Jerubbaal (“Let Baal fight him.”) because he tore down his altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then the Midianites, Amalekites, and people east <em>of the Jordan</em> joined forces, crossed the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>The Spirit of Yahveh stirred up Gideon. He blew the ram’s horn and called the Abiezrites to follow him. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>He sent messengers all over Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to follow him too. They went up to meet them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then Gideon said to God, <em>“</em><em>If you’re going to </em><em>deliver Israel by </em><em>me</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> laying a </em><em>wool </em><em>fleece on </em><em>the threshing floor. If there’s</em><em> dew on </em><em>it</em><em> </em><em>but</em><em> the ground</em><em> around it’s dry</em><em>, I’</em><em>ll know you’</em><em>ll deliver Israel by </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> That’s what happened. When he got up early, he wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Then he said to God, <em>“Don’t be an</em><em>gry with me. L</em><em>et me </em><em>test </em>you<em> one </em>more <em>time with the</em><em> fleece. Let it be dry and</em><em> the ground </em><em>around it have</em><em> dew</em><em> on it</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> That’s what God did that night. It was dry just on the fleece; the ground was wet.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
