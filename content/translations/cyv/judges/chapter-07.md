## Judges Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Jerubbaal (Gideon) and the people got up early and camped beside the Spring of Harod. Midian's camp was in the valley north of them by the Hill of Moreh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh told Gideon, "You have too many for me to deliver the Midianites to you. I don't want Israel to pride themselves in thinking they've delivered themselves.  3Tell whoever is afraid and trembling to go home." Gideon tested them; 22,000 went back, 10,000 stayed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh told Gideon, "There are still too many. Take them down to the creek; I'll test them. The one I tell you, will go with you. The others won't."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He took them down to the water. Yahveh told Gideon, "The ones that lap water like a dog, put in a group. Those who kneel down to drink put in another group." 6300 put their hands to their mouths. The rest got on their knees to drink from the water. 7Yahveh told Gideon, "I'll deliver the Midianites to you with 300 men. Send the rest home." 8He took the people's jars and rams' horns and sent the rest home. Midian camped below them in the valley.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> That night Yahveh told him, "Get up and go down against the camp. I'll deliver it to you. 10If you're afraid, go down with your servant Purah. 11You'll hear what they're saying and be confident about attacking the camp." He went down with Purah to the outposts of the camp. 12The Midianites, Amalekites, and people from east of the Jordan lay along the valley like locusts. Their camels were without number, like sand on the shore. 13When Gideon got there, a man was telling his friend about a dream, "I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp. It knocked a tent over and flattened it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> His friend answered, "That's the sword of Gideon, a man of Israel. God is going to deliver Midian and the rest of the army to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship and went back to camp. He said, "Get up! Yahveh is going to deliver Midian's army to you." 16He divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them all rams' horns and empty jars with torches inside. 17He told them, "Do what I do when I get to the edge of the camp. 18When I and the ones with me blow the rams' horns, then blow your rams' horns all around the camp, and raise the battle cry, 'For Yahveh and Gideon!'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Gideon and the 300 got to the edge of the camp when they'd just set the middle watch. 20They blew the rams' horns and broke the jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the rams' horns in their right, and raised the battle cry, "A sword for Yahveh and Gideon!" 21Every man stood in place all around the camp, and Midian's whole army screamed and fled. 22When the Israelites blew the 300 rams' horns, Yahveh set every man's sword against his fellow soldier throughout Midian's army. The army fled all the way to Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. 23Gideon called out Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to chase them. 24He sent messengers all over the hill country of Ephraim, "Come down against the Midianites and seize control of the water, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan." Ephraim came out and seized it. 25They captured Oreb and Zeeb, Midian's two rulers. In the chase they killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</span>
