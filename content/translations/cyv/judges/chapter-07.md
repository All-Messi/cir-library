## Judges Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Jerubbaal (Gideon) and the people got up early and camped beside the Spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was in the valley north of them by the Hill of Moreh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh told Gideon, <em>“You hav</em><em>e too many for me to </em><em>deliver the Midianites to you.</em><em> I don’t want Israel to</em><em> pride themselves in thinking they’ve delivered themselves.  </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>ell</em><em> </em><em>w</em><em>hoever is afraid and </em><em>trembl</em><em>ing</em><em> to</em><em> go home.”</em> Gideon tested them; 22,000 went back, 10,000 stayed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Yahveh told Gideon, <em>“There are still too many.</em><em> </em><em>Take them down to the </em><em>creek;</em><em> I’ll test them.</em><em> </em><em>The one I tell </em><em>you,</em><em> will go with you.</em><em> The others </em><em>won’t.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He took them down to the water. Yahveh told Gideon, <em>“</em><em>The ones that lap </em><em>water like </em><em>a dog, put in a group.</em><em> </em><em>Those who </em><em>kneel</em><em> down</em><em> to drink</em><em> put in another group</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>300 put their hands to their mouths. The rest got on their knees to drink from the water. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Yahveh told Gideon, <em>“I’ll deliv</em><em>er the Midianites to you with 300 </em><em>men.</em><em> Send the rest </em><em>home.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He took the people’s jars and rams’ horns and sent the rest home. Midian camped below them in the valley.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> That night Yahveh told him, <em>“Get up and</em><em> go down against the camp</em><em>. I’ll</em><em> </em><em>deliver</em><em> it to you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f</em><em> you’re afraid, go down with your servant</em><em> Purah</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> hear what they’re saying and</em><em> be </em><em>confident about attacking</em><em> the camp.”</em><em> </em> He went down with Purah to the outposts of the camp. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The Midianites, Amalekites, and people from east <em>of the Jordan </em>lay along the valley like locusts. Their camels were without number, like sand on the shore. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When Gideon got there, a man was telling his friend about a dream, <em>“I dreamed that a </em><em>loaf of barley bread tumbled into the </em><em>camp</em><em>. It knocked</em><em> </em><em>a tent over and </em><em>flat</em><em>tened it.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> His friend answered, <em>“That’</em><em>s the sword of Gideo</em><em>n, a man of Israel. God is going to deliver</em><em> Midian and the </em>rest of the<em> </em><em>army</em><em> to him</em><em>.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 7:9-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship and went back to camp. He said, <em>“Get up! Yahveh</em> <em>is going to deliver</em><em> Midian</em><em>’s army to you</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them all rams’ horns and empty jars with torches inside. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“</em><em>D</em><em>o what I do when I </em><em>get</em><em> to the </em><em>edge</em><em> of the camp.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I and the ones with me blo</em><em>w the rams’ horns, then blow </em>your<em> ram</em><em>s’ horns all around the camp, and </em><em>raise the battle cry</em><em>, ‘Fo</em><em>r Yahveh</em> <em>and </em><em>Gideon</em><em>!</em><em>’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Gideon and the 300 got to the edge of the camp when they’d just set the middle watch. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They blew the rams’ horns and broke the jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the rams’ horns in their right, and raised the battle cry, <em>“A sword for Yahveh</em> <em>and </em><em>Gideon!”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Every man stood in place all around the camp, and <em>Midian’s</em> whole army screamed and fled. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When the <em>Israelites</em> blew the 300 rams’ horns, Yahveh set every man’s sword against his fellow soldier throughout <em>Midian’s</em> army. The army fled all the way to Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Gideon</em><em> </em>called out Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to chase them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He sent messengers all over the hill country of Ephraim, <em>“Come</em><em> down against the Midianites and seize </em>control of <em>the water, as far as Be</em><em>th-</em><em>barah and the Jordan.”</em> Ephraim came out and seized it. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They captured Oreb and Zeeb, Midian’s two rulers. In the chase they killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon beyond the Jordan.<strong></span>
