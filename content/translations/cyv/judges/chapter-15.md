## Judges Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After a while at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid. He said, <em>“I’ll </em><em>sleep with</em><em> my wife in </em>her<em> room.”</em> But her father wouldn’t let him go in, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> thought you utterly hated her; </em><em>so</em><em> I gave her to your companion.</em><em> </em><em>Isn’t her younger sister better looking?</em><em> </em><em>Take her instead.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Samson told them, <em>“This time I’ll be blameless </em><em>for harming the Philistines</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Samson caught 300 foxes, turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each set of tails. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He lit the torches and released the foxes in the Philistines’ standing grain and olive orchards. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The Philistines asked, <em>“Who did this?”</em> They said, <em>“Samson, </em><em>the Timnite</em><em>’s son-in-law</em><em>, because he </em><em>gave</em><em> his wife to his companion.”</em> The Philistines came up and burned her and her father. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Samson told them, <em>“If this is what you do, I swear I’ll </em><em>take my revenge</em><em> on you, and after that I’ll quit.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He struck them hip and thigh with great slaughter and went down to stay in the cave at Etam.	<strong>Jud</strong><strong> </strong><strong>15:1-8</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The men in Judah said, <em>“Why have you come up against us?”</em><em> </em> They said, <em>“</em><em>We’ve come</em><em> to </em><em>tie up</em><em> Samson, to do to him as he did to us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then 3,000 men from Judah went down to the cave at Etam and said to Samson, <em>“Don’t you know the Philistines rule u</em><em>s? What have you</em><em> done to us?</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>We’</em><em>ve</em><em> come down to </em><em>tie you up and</em><em> give you to the Philistines.” </em> <em>“Swear that you won’t fall on me yourselves.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him, and the Spirit of Yahveh came on him powerfully. The ropes on his arms became like smoldering flax, and his bonds melted off his hands. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He found a fresh jawbone from a donkey and killed 1,000 men with it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He said, <em>“With </em><em>a donkey’s</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>jawbone</em><em>’</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	piles on piles.</em> <em>	With </em><em>a donkey’s</em><em> jawbone </em> <em>	</em><em>	I’ve killed </em><em>1,000</em><em> men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> After he said that, he threw it away. That place was called Ramath-lehi [<em>Jawbone Hill</em>].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He was thirsty and “cried out” to Yahveh, <em>“You’</em><em>ve granted </em><em>me this great deliverance. Am I to die from</em><em> thirst and fall into the hands of uncircumcised</em><em> men</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God split open the hollow place that’s in Lehi, and water started coming out of it. When he drank it, his energy returned, and he revived; so he named it En-hakkore; it’s still at Lehi. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>He judged Israel 20 years during the time of the Philistines.</span>
