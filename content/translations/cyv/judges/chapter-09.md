## Judges Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Abimelech went to his mother’s relatives in Shechem and said to her clan, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Ask</em><em> </em><em>the leaders</em><em> in</em><em> Shechem</em><em> w</em><em>hich is better, for Jerubbaal’s </em><em>70</em><em> sons to rule you, or for one </em>man <em>to rule </em><em>you. R</em><em>emember</em><em>,</em><em> I’m your flesh and bone.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His mother’s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him<em> because </em>he was their<em> </em>kin<em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They gave</span>
<p class="section-ref">him 70</p>

### pieces of silver from Baal-berith’s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows 5to go with him to his father’s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, hid. 6The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem. 	Jud 9:1-6


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>When Jotham heard about it, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted, <em>“Listen, men of Shechem, so God will listen to you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> trees went </em><em>out</em><em> to anoint a king.</em><em> </em><em>They </em><em>asked</em><em> the olive tree</em><em> to r</em><em>ule </em><em>them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> the olive tree said, ‘</em><em>Should I leave my richness</em><em> that honors gods and m</em><em>en, and go sway over the tree</em><em>s?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> trees said to the fig tree, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come</em><em> and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> the fig tree said, ‘Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go sway over the trees?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> trees said to the </em><em>grape</em><em>vine, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> the </em><em>grape</em><em>vine said, ‘Should I leave my wine that cheers gods and m</em><em>ortals</em><em>, and go</em><em> </em><em>sway over the trees?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Then</em><em> the trees said to the bramble, ‘</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> come and rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> bramb</em><em>le said, ‘If you’</em><em>re anointing me king</em><em> </em><em>in good faith</em><em>, then come and take refuge in my shade.</em><em> </em><em>If not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’</em> <em>“[</em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>]</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>M</em><em>y</em><em> father fought for you and risked his life </em><em>to rescue you from Midian.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ve</em><em> </em><em>risen up against</em><em> </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>family</em><em> and killed his </em><em>70 </em><em>sons on one </em><em>rock. You’ve</em><em> made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king of Shechem because he’</em><em>s your relative. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f</em><em> you’ve acted </em><em>honorably </em><em>in good faith with Jerubbaal and his </em><em>family</em><em> as his deeds deserv</em><em>ed</em><em>, the</em><em>n</em><em> </em><em>be happy with one another</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> not, let fire come out from </em><em>Abimelech and consume the people in Shechem and Beth-millo.” </em></span>

<p class="section-ref">for 3</p>

### years. 23God put animosity between him and the people in Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with him. 24That was so the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come on Abimelech who murdered them and on the men who helped him. 25The men in Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops and robbed everybody that went by. Abimelech heard about it.


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Gaal Ben-Ebed moved to Shechem with his relatives and gained the confidence of the people there. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>They went out and gathered grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and held a feast. They went to the temple of their god and ate and drank, and ranted about Abimelech. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Gaal said, <em>“Who</em><em> is Abimelech? Why should we serve</em><em> him?</em><em> </em><em>Didn’t the </em><em>son of </em><em>Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem?</em><em> </em><em>Why then should we serve </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> these</em><em> people were under my command!</em><em> </em><em>I’d remove Abimelech.</em><em> </em><em>I’d </em><em>tell</em><em> him</em><em> to muster an</em><em> army and come out</em><em> and fight</em><em>.”</em><em>   </em> <em>   </em><em>	</em><em>   </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 9:22-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard what Gaal said, he was mad, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>and sent ambassadors to Abimelech at Arumah, <em>“Gaal and his relatives have come</em><em> to Shechem; they’</em><em>re stirring up the city against you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> you and your men go during the night and lie in </em><em>ambush</em><em> in the fields.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>In</em><em> the morning</em><em> at sun</em><em>up, rush on the city.</em><em> </em><em>When he and his men come out against you, do to them what you can.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>Abimelech and his men got up during the night and laid in ambush against Shechem in four companies. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Gaal went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and his men rose up from the ambush. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>When Gaal saw them, he told Zebul, <em>“Look, men are coming down from the mountain!”</em> Zebul said, <em>“You</em><em>’re</em><em> </em><em>just </em><em>see</em><em>ing</em><em> the mountains</em><em>’</em><em> shadow</em><em>s</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>Gaal said again, <em>“Look, men are coming down from the center of the land, and </em><em>another</em><em> company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>Then Zebul said, <em>“</em><em>Where’</em><em>s </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em>bragging</em><em> now, you that said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’</em><em> </em><em>Aren’t these the men you despised?</em><em> </em><em>Go fight them.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Gaal led the men out to fight him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Abimelech chased him and he fled. Many fell wounded all the way back to the entrance of the gate. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so they couldn’t keep living in Shechem.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jud 9:30-41</p>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>The next day the men went out to the fields. Abimelech heard about it. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He divided his men into three companies and laid in wait there. When the men come out of the city, he attacked them and killed them. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Abimelech and his company rushed up and stood at the entrance to the city gate while the two companies attacked and killed the ones in the fields. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Abimelech fought the city all day and took it. He killed the people in it, tore it down, and scattered salt all over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>When people in the tower at Shechem heard about it, they went into the fortress of El-berith’s temple. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>When Abimelech found out they were in the tower, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>he and his men went up to Mount Zalmon. He cut a bundle of brush with an axe and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing<em>.</em> <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>Each one cut a bundle and followed him. He piled the bundles against the fortress and set it on fire over the ones inside. Everybody in the tower died,</span>
<p class="section-ref">about 1</p>

### ,000 men and women.	Jud 9:42-49


<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and took it. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>But the city had a strong tower. The men and women fled to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>He attacked it and came to burn down the tower door. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>A woman threw an upper millstone down on him and cracked his skull. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>Right away he called to his young armor bearer, <em>“Draw your sword and kill me so people wo</em><em>n’t</em><em> say</em><em> a</em><em> woman killed </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em>His young man thrust him through, and he died. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>When Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they went home. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>So God repaid him for his crime against his father in killing</span>
<p class="section-ref">his 70</p>

### brothers. 57God also made the sinfulness of the men in Shechem come back on their heads and made Jotham’s curse fall on them.	Jud 9:50-57 Tola Judges Israel
