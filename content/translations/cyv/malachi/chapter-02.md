## Malachi Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Priests, I'm talking to you. 2If you don't get serious about honoring me, I'll put a curse on you and even curse the blessings you receive. Actually, I already have, because you're not taking me seriously. 3I'll bring misfortune on your descendants and spatter your faces with the offal from your feasts. I'll throw you out with it. 4You'll find out that I'm the One that sent this commandment so my covenant with Levi can continue. 5My covenant with him gives life and peace. I gave it to him so he'd show me reverence, and he did 6and gave true instruction. He followed me in peace and goodness and turned people back from sin. 7A priest should preserve knowledge, and people should look to him for instruction because he's a messenger from Yahveh of hosts. 8But you've gone off-road and made people stumble with your instruction; you've corrupted my covenant with Levi. 9So people despise you because you show favoritism in how you execute the Law. Judah Profaned the Covenant 10"Don't we all have the same father? Hasn't the same God created us? Why are we unfaithful to one another and violate our ancestors' covenant? 11Judah has been unfaithful and created an abomination in Israel and Jerusalem. He's profaned the sanctuary Yahveh loves and married the daughter of a foreign god. 12May Yahveh cut off from Jacob anyone who does that and then tries to present him an offering. 13"Another thing you do is cover Yahveh's altar with tears, weeping, and groaning because he doesn't accept your offerings anymore. 14"You ask, 'Why?' "Because he's seen how unfaithful you've been to the wife you've had from your youth though she's your partner, your wife by covenant. 15Nobody does that who has even an ounce of the spirit and wants godly offspring; so pay attention to your spirit so you won't be unfaithful to her. 16I despise divorce and the one that tries to cover up his adultery with cruelty by divorcing his wife." 17"You've worn Yahveh out with your talk." "How?" "By saying, 'People that sin are as good in hisY sight as anybody else; he delights in them'; or 'Where's there a just God?'"</span>
