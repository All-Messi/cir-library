## Malachi Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The time's coming when the arrogant people you admire will be like stubble that burns up in a furnace—root, stem, and all. 2But for you that respect me, goodness will rise up like the sun with healing in its wings. You'll break out, jump around for joy, and run all over like calves let out of a stall. 3At the time I'm planning for, you'll stomp on sinners like ashes under your feet. 4"Remember the Law of Moses my servant, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him at Horeb/Sinai for you. 5I'll send you Elijah the prophet before that awesome day comes. 6He'll turn fathers' hearts back to their children and children's hearts back to their fathers, so I won't put a curse the land." Version by Virgil Warren, PhD						      christir.org</span>
