## Genesis Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, a message from Yahveh came to Abram in a vision, "Don't worry, Abram; I'm your shield. You'll have a great reward."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Abram asked, "Yahveh God, what will you give me? I don't have any children; Eliezer of Damascus is my heir. 3Since you haven't given me any offspring, a man born in my household will inherit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A message from Yahveh came to him, "He won't inherit. Your heir will come from your body." 5He took him outside, "Look at the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you'll have,"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abram trusted him, and Yahveh considered him good because of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> God said, "I'm Yahveh who brought you out of Ur in Chaldea to give you this land."	8"What guarantee do I have of that?" 9"Bring me a three-year-old heifer, goat, and ram, and a turtledove and young pigeon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He brought them, cut them in half—except for the birds—and laid the halves across from each other. 11Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but he shooed them away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As the sun was going down, he fell into a deep sleep, and an eerie darkness came over him. 13God told him, "Your descendants will be foreigners in a country that enslaves them and oppresses them for 400 years. 14I'll judge that nation, and your descendants will come out with lots of possessions. 15You will pass on to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 16In the fourth generation, they'll come back here. The sinfulness of the Amorites hasn't climaxed yet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> After sundown, it was pitch dark. A fire pot and flaming torch passed between the halves of the carcasses. 18That day Yahveh made a covenant with Abram, "I'll give your descendants this land from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River, along with 19the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 20Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim, 21Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."
