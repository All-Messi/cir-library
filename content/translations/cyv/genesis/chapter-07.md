## Genesis Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh told Noah, "Get in the ark with your family. I've seen that you're good. 2Take every clean animal by sevens, male and female. Take every ceremonially unclean animal by twos, male and female. 3Take birds by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive. 4A week from now, I'll make it rain for 40 days and nights, and wipe out every living thing I've made."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Noah followed hisY instructions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Noah was 600 years old when the flood came. 7He, his wife, sons, and their wives went into the ark because the flood was coming. 8Ceremonially clean and unclean animals, birds, and small animals 9went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female—like God told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> After a week the flood started. 11In Noah's 600th year, on the seventeenth day, second month, the fountains in the great deep burst, and the flood gates in the sky opened. 12Rain fell for 40 days and nights.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Noah, his wife, his sons, and their wives went into the ark the same day. 14So did every wild animal, all the cattle, every small animal that moves around on the ground, and every kind of bird after their kind. 15Two by two everything that breathes went into the ark to Noah—like God told him. 16Yahveh closed the door behind him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The flood kept coming for 40 days. 18As it got deeper and deeper, the ark floated on it. 19-20Water covered the tall mountains everywhere by some 22ft. 21Land animals died—birds, cattle, wild animals, swarming things, people—22everything that breathed. 23Only Noah and what was with him in the ark were left. 24The water prevailed over the world for 150 days.</span>
