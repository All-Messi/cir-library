<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Yahveh told Noah, <em>“</em><em>Get</em><em> in the ark</em><em> with</em><em> your family</em><em>.</em><em> I’</em><em>ve seen that you’</em><em>re good.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Take</em><em> every clean animal by sevens, male and female.</em><em> </em><em>Take every </em><em>ceremonially </em><em>unclean animal by twos, male and female.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>ake</em><em> birds by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> week</em><em> from now</em><em>,</em><em> I’ll </em><em>make it</em><em> rain for </em><em>40 days and </em><em>nights, and</em><em> wipe</em><em> out every living thing I’ve made.</em><em>”  </em></span>

<p class="section-ref">Gen 7:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Noah was 600 years old when the flood came. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He, his wife, sons, and their wives went into the ark because the flood was coming. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Ceremonially clean and unclean animals, birds, and small animals <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female—like God told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> After a week the flood started. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>In <strong>Noah’s</strong> <strong>600</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong> year</strong>, on <strong>the seventeenth day, second month</strong>, the fountains in the great deep burst, and the flood gates in the sky opened. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Rain fell for 40 days and nights.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 7:6-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Noah, his wife, his sons, and their wives went into the ark the same day. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So did every wild animal, all the cattle, every small animal that moves around on the ground, and every kind of bird after their kind. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Two by two everything that breathes went into the ark to Noah—like God told him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Yahveh closed <em>the door</em> behind him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The flood kept coming for <strong>40 days</strong>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As it got deeper and deeper, the ark floated on it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Water covered the tall mountains everywhere by some 22ft. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Land animals died—birds, cattle, wild animals, swarming things, people—<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>everything that breathed. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Only Noah and what was with him in the ark were left. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The water prevailed over the world for <strong>150 days</strong>. <strong>Gen 7:13-24</strong></span>
