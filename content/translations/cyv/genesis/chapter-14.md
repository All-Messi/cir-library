## Genesis Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim 2fought Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Adman, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (Zoar). 3Those 5 joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Dead Sea). 4They'd served Chedorlaomer for 12 years, then revolted. 5That year, he and his allied kings came and defeated the Rephaim in Asheroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 6and the Horites in Mount Seir, as far as El-paran by the open country. 7Then they turned back to En-mishpat (Kadesh) and conquered the Amalekites and Amorites in Hazazon-tamar. 8The kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (Zoar) pitched battle against them in the Valley of Siddim—95 kings against 4. 10The valley was full of tar pits. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them. The ones that survived escaped to the hills. 11The four kings took the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and left. 12They also took Lot and what he had because he was living in Sodom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> One man escaped to tell Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner, Abram's allies. 14When Abram heard they'd captured his nephew, he mustered 318 trained men born in his house, and pursued them all the way to Dan. 15He divided his men against them at night. He and his forces defeated them and chased them all the way to Hobah, north of Damascus. 16He brought back the goods, Lot, and Lot's possessions, along with the women and other captives. Melchizedek Blesses Abram</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When he got back from defeating Chedorlaomer and his allies, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (the King's Valley). 18Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, brought out bread and wine 19and blessed Abram, "May you be blessed by God Most High, owner of earth and sky, 20who delivered your enemies to you." Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the captives and keep the goods."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Abram said, "I've sworn to Yahveh God Most High, owner of earth and sky, 23that I won't take a thread, a sandal thong, or anything else that's yours. I don't want you to claim you made me rich. 24I'll only take what the young fighting men have eaten, and the share that belongs to Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre." The LORD's Covenant with Abraham</span>
