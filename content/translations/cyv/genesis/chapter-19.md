## Genesis Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The two angels went to Sodom in the evening as Lot sat in Sodom’s gate. When he saw <em>them</em>, he got up to meet them and bowed to the ground. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Sirs</em><em>, turn aside to </em><em>my </em><em>house, wash your fee</em><em>t,</em><em> </em><em>and spend the night. </em><em>You can get up early and go on.”</em> <em>“No, we’ll spend the night in the square.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But he urged them strongly, so they went to his house. He fixed them a meal and baked flat bread, and they ate. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Before they went to bed, men from all over the city surrounded the house—young and old. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They called out to Lot, <em>“Where are the men that came tonight?</em><em> </em><em>Bring them out so we can </em><em>rape</em><em> them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But Lot went out and shut the door behind him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The <em>two</em> angels said to Lot, <em>“Who else do you have here?</em><em> </em><em>Bring out a</em><em>ny</em><em> son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever </em>else<em> </em><em>you have in the city.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>We’re</em><em> about to destroy this place; their outcry has become so great before Yahveh that he has sent us to destroy it.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Gen 19:9-13</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Lot went out to tell his daughters’ fiancés, <em>“Get up</em><em>! Get out of here! Yahveh is</em><em> going to destroy the city.”</em><em> </em>But they acted like he was joking. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When it started to get daylight, the angels urged Lot, <em>“Get up! T</em><em>ake your wife and two daughters so you won’t get</em><em> swept away in the punishment of</em><em> the city.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He hesitated so the angels grabbed his hand and his wife’s and daughters’ hands. Yahveh had mercy on him and took him outside the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then one of them said, <em>“Escape for your life!</em><em> </em><em>Don’t look back or stay anywhere in the valley.</em><em> </em><em>Escape to the mountains so you won’t be swept away.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Lot said, <em>“No, </em><em>Sir</em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> </em><em>pleasing</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>you</em><em>, and you’ve shown me </em><em>great </em><em>kindness by saving </em><em>me</em><em>; but I can’t escape to the mountains</em><em>. T</em><em>he disast</em><em>er would overtake me, and I’d</em><em> die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> town is near enough to </em><em>run</em><em> to.</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em>sn’t it small?</em><em> </em><em>L</em><em>et me escape there </em><em>to</em><em> save my life.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The sun had climbed high by the time Lot got to Zoar. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Then Yahveh rained fire and sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He overthrew those towns, the whole valley, its people, and what grew there. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>But <em>Lot’s</em> wife, behind him, looked <em>back</em>, and became a pillar of salt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham got up early <em>and went</em> to where he’d stood with Yahveh. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>He looked down toward Sodom, Gomorrah, and the valley, and saw smoke coming up as from a furnace. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>When God destroyed the towns in the valley, he remembered Abraham and got Lot away from his house.</span>

### Lot and His Daughters


<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Lot went up from Zoar and stayed in the mountains with his two daughters. He was afraid to keep staying in Zoar. They were living in a cave. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The older daughter told the younger one, <em>“There’s not a man </em><em>around</em><em> to come into us </em><em>in the </em><em>normal</em><em> way</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Let’s</em><em> get our father drunk on wine and lie with him so we can preserve our family through him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They got him drunk that night, and the older one went in and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down or got up. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>The next day the older one said, <em>“Last night I lay with my father.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s get him drunk again tonight.</em><em> </em><em>You go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family.”</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>They got their father drunk that night too, and the younger daughter lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down or got up. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>So both daughters got pregnant from their father. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>The firstborn had a boy she named Moab (ancestor of today’s Moabites). <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>The younger <em>daughter</em> had a boy too and named him Ben<em>-</em>ammi (ancestor of the Ammonites).</span>
