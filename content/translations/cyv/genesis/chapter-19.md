## Genesis Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The two angels went to Sodom in the evening as Lot sat in Sodom's gate. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed to the ground. 2"Sirs, turn aside to my house, wash your feet, and spend the night. You can get up early and go on." "No, we'll spend the night in the square."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But he urged them strongly, so they went to his house. He fixed them a meal and baked flat bread, and they ate. 4Before they went to bed, men from all over the city surrounded the house—young and old. 5They called out to Lot, "Where are the men that came tonight? Bring them out so we can rape them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But Lot went out and shut the door behind him, 7"Brothers, don't be wicked. 8Look, I have two daughters that haven't slept with men. Let me bring them out, and you can do to them whatever you like. Just don't do anything to those men, since they've come under my roof." 9"Get out of the way." Besides, they said, "This foreigner has come in already acting like a judge. We'll treat you worse than them." They pressed toward Lot to break down the door. 10But the angels reached out and pulled him in and shut the door. 11They struck the men blind, big and small; so they wore themselves out groping around for the door.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The two angels said to Lot, "Who else do you have here? Bring out any son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever else you have in the city. 13We're about to destroy this place; their outcry has become so great before Yahveh that he has sent us to destroy it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Lot went out to tell his daughters' fiancés, "Get up! Get out of here! Yahveh is going to destroy the city." But they acted like he was joking. 15When it started to get daylight, the angels urged Lot, "Get up! Take your wife and two daughters so you won't get swept away in the punishment of the city." 16He hesitated so the angels grabbed his hand and his wife's and daughters' hands. Yahveh had mercy on him and took him outside the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then one of them said, "Escape for your life! Don't look back or stay anywhere in the valley. Escape to the mountains so you won't be swept away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Lot said, "No, Sir! 19I'm pleasing to you, and you've shown me great kindness by saving me; but I can't escape to the mountains. The disaster would overtake me, and I'd die. 20That town is near enough to run to. Isn't it small? Let me escape there to save my life." 21"All right, I won't overthrow it. 22Hurry and get on over there! I can't do anything till you do." The town was Zoar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The sun had climbed high by the time Lot got to Zoar. 24Then Yahveh rained fire and sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah. 25He overthrew those towns, the whole valley, its people, and what grew there. 26But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and became a pillar of salt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham got up early and went to where he'd stood with Yahveh. 28He looked down toward Sodom, Gomorrah, and the valley, and saw smoke coming up as from a furnace. 29When God destroyed the towns in the valley, he remembered Abraham and got Lot away from his house. Lot and His Daughters</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Lot went up from Zoar and stayed in the mountains with his two daughters. He was afraid to keep staying in Zoar. They were living in a cave. 31The older daughter told the younger one, "There's not a man around to come into us in the normal way. 32Let's get our father drunk on wine and lie with him so we can preserve our family through him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They got him drunk that night, and the older one went in and lay with him. He didn't know when she lay down or got up. 34The next day the older one said, "Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him drunk again tonight. You go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family." 35They got their father drunk that night too, and the younger daughter lay with him. He didn't know when she lay down or got up. 36So both daughters got pregnant from their father. 37The firstborn had a boy she named Moab (ancestor of today's Moabites). 38The younger daughter had a boy too and named him Ben-ammi (ancestor of the Ammonites). Abraham and Abimelech</span>
