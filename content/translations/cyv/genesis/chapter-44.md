## Genesis Chapter **44**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Then he told his palace overseer, <em>“Fill </em><em>their sacks with as much as they can transport. Put each man’s money in his sack, </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> p</em><em>ut my silver cup </em><em>with the</em><em> money in the </em><em>top</em><em> of the youngest man’s sack.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>At daylight they sent them away with their donkeys. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’d just got out of the city when Joseph told his palace overseer, <em>“</em><em>F</em><em>ollow </em><em>them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>When you catch up with them, say, </em><em>‘</em><em>Wh</em><em>y repay good with bad</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Isn’t</em><em> this what my lord drinks </em><em>out of</em><em> </em><em>and uses for fortunetelling? You’</em><em>ve done wrong.</em><em>’” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He caught up with them and told them that. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Why</em><em> </em><em>say </em><em>something like that</em><em>?</em><em> We wouldn’t do that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> brought back the money we found in our sacks.</em><em> </em><em>Why would we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Kill</em><em> whoever you find it with, and we’ll be your slaves.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“All</em><em> right. The one that has it will be my slave. The rest of you will go free.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>They hurried and lowered their sacks to the ground and opened them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He searched from the oldest to the youngest and found the cup in Benjamin’s sack. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They tore their clothes and loaded their donkeys and went back to the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>When Judah and his brothers got to Joseph’s house, he was still there. They prostrated themselves on the floor. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He asked, <em>“</em><em>What’ve you</em><em> done?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t you know a man like me can </em><em>tell</em><em> </em><em>fortunes</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Judah said, <em>“What can we say?</em><em> </em><em>How can we </em><em>explain this? God has found out our</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>in</em><em>. We’re your slaves</em><em>, we and the one he found the cup </em><em>with.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He said, <em>“I wouldn’t do </em><em>that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The one the cup was </em><em>with</em><em> will be my slave</em><em>. T</em><em>he rest of you can go up to your father in peace.”</em><em>	 </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Judah came up to him and said, <em>“</em><em>M</em><em>ay</em><em> I </em><em>say something to you?</em><em> </em><em>Don’t be mad</em><em>;</em><em> you’re equal to Pharaoh.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>asked </em><em>us if we had a father or brother. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> </em><em>told you we </em><em>ha</em><em>d</em><em> an </em><em>elderly</em><em> father and a </em><em>young</em><em> </em>brother<em> that was</em><em> born when </em>our father<em> was ol</em><em>d. He’</em><em>s the only one left from his mo</em><em>ther, and his father loves him (a full brother of his is dead).” </em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Bring</em><em> h</em><em>im down so I can see him.”  </em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>The</em><em> boy can’t leave his father</em><em>. His father would die.” </em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Unless</em><em> </em><em>he</em><em> comes wi</em><em>th you, you won’t see me again.” </em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“W</em><em>e</em><em> went up </em><em>and</em><em> told him what you said.</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“L</em><em>ater</em><em>,</em> <em>he</em><em> </em><em>told us to come back and buy </em>more <em>food.</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>“B</em><em>ut</em><em> we said, ‘We c</em><em>an’t</em><em>.</em><em> If our youngest brother’</em><em>s </em><em>not with us, w</em><em>e </em><em>won’t be able to</em><em> see the man.’</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>You</em><em> know my wife</em><em> </em><em>had</em><em> two sons.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>One</em><em> of </em><em>them went out and must have been torn to pieces </em>by wild animals<em>. </em><em>I</em><em> haven’t</em><em> seen him since.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you take this one and </em><em>something happens</em><em> to him, you’ll </em><em>send</em><em> my gra</em><em>y hair down to Sheol in </em><em>grief.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

### 30-31“If I go back and he sees the boy’s not with us, he’ll die. His life is wrapped up in the boy’s life. We’ll send his gray hair down to Sheol in grief. 32I became a guarantee for the boy, I said I’d bear the blame permanently if I didn’t bring him back. 33Let me stay in his place so he can go with his half-brothers. 34How could I go up to my father if he’s not with me? I’d see how hard it would be on him.” 	Gen 44:30-34  Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers
