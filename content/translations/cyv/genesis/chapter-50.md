## Genesis Chapter 50

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joseph fell on his father's face and cried and kissed him. 2He told the physicians to embalm him. 3The embalming took 40 days, and the Egyptians mourned him 70 days.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 49:33-50</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> After the time of mourning, Joseph told Pharaoh's advisors, "If I'm pleasing to you, tell Pharaoh 5my father had me swear, 'I'm about to die. Bury me in the grave I dug for myself in Canaan.' Let me go up and bury him. Then I'll be back."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury him like he had you swear." -8So Joseph went up to bury him. Pharaoh's officials, the senior members of his household, the senior officers of Egypt, Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's family went with him. They left only their little ones, flocks, and herds in Goshen. 9A large company of chariots and cavalry also went up. 10When they came to Atad's threshing floor, not far from the Jordan, they mourned greatly. Joseph observed a week of mourning. 11When the Canaanites saw the mourning, they said, "This is extreme 'mourning' for 'Egyptians'"; so they named it Abel-mizraim. 12His sons did for him what he'd said. 13They carried him to the Cave of Machpelah east of Mamre, which Abraham had bought for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite along with the field. 14After he'd buried him, Joseph and the whole company went back to Egypt. Joseph Reassures His Brothers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When Joseph's brothers thought about the fact that their father was dead, they said "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for what we did to him?" 16They sent him a message, "Before our father died, he charged us 17to tell you, 'Forgive your brothers' sin; they did wrong.' Forgive the servants of your father's God." Joseph cried when they spoke to him. 18Then his brothers came and prostrated themselves, "We're your servants." 19But Joseph said, "I'm not God, am I? 20You meant to harm me, but he turned it out for good to bring about saving lots of people. 21Don't worry. I'll keep taking care of you and your little ones." He reassured them and dealt with them graciously. The Death of Joseph</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Joseph and his father's family stayed in Egypt. 23He saw three generations of Ephraim's descendants and claimed the sons of Machir Ben-Manasseh as his own. 24He told his brothers, "I'm about to die, but God will take care of you, and take you up to the land he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." 25He had the sons of Israel swear, "Take my bones up from here." 26Joseph died at 110; his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
