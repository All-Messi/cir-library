## Genesis Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God told Jacob, <em>“Go up to Bethel and live and build</em><em> an altar to </em><em>me. </em>I’m the One<em> that appeared to you when you were running</em><em> from Esau.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jacob told his household and everybody with him, <em>“Put away your foreign gods, purify yourselves,</em><em> and </em><em>change clothes</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Let’s</em><em> go to Bethel.</em><em> I’m going to</em><em> build an altar to God</em><em> there</em><em>, who answered me in </em><em>my distress</em><em> and </em><em>was</em><em> with me wherever I’ve gone.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They gave Jacob their foreign gods and earrings, and he buried them under a terebinth tree near Shechem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> As they moved along, a deep dread hovered over the towns around them, and they didn’t pursue Jacob’s sons. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So Jacob and his people were able to reach Luz (Bethel) in Canaan. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He built an altar, and called the place El-Bethel, because “God” revealed himself to him there when he was running from his brother. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and <em>Jacob</em> buried her below Bethel under the oak named Allonbacuth<em> </em>[Oak of Weeping].</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 35:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> God appeared to Jacob again after he came from Paddan-aram and blessed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> God Almighty</em><em> </em>[El-Shaddai]. <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	Have children and </em><em>multiply</em><em>.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	A group of nations will come from </em><em>you;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>kings will </em><em>descend</em><em> from you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I’</em><em>ll</em><em> give </em><em>you</em><em> a</em><em>nd your descendants</em><em> </em> <em>the land I </em>promised <em>Abraham and Isaac.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> God ascended from him, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and Jacob set up a stone marker “where God” had spoken to him. He poured out a liquid offering on it, poured olive oil on it, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and named the place Bethel.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong> <strong></span>

### The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They moved on from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel started to have contractions and suffered hard labor. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The midwife said, <em>“</em><em>Don’t be afraid</em><em>; you have another son.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As her life was draining away, she named him Benoni; but his father called him Benjamin. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Rachel died and was buried along the road to Ephrath. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Jacob set up a marker over her grave that’s still there. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Jacob kept traveling and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>While he was living there, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel found out about it.</span>

He’d lived to a ripe age, and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.<strong>	Gen </strong><strong>35:22b-29</strong></span>
