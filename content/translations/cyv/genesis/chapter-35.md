## Genesis Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God told Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and live and build an altar to me. I'm the One that appeared to you when you were running from Esau."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Jacob told his household and everybody with him, "Put away your foreign gods, purify yourselves, and change clothes. 3Let's go to Bethel. I'm going to build an altar to God there, who answered me in my distress and was with me wherever I've gone."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They gave Jacob their foreign gods and earrings, and he buried them under a terebinth tree near Shechem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> As they moved along, a deep dread hovered over the towns around them, and they didn't pursue Jacob's sons. 6So Jacob and his people were able to reach Luz (Bethel) in Canaan. 7He built an altar, and called the place El-Bethel, because "God" revealed himself to him there when he was running from his brother. 8Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and Jacob buried her below Bethel under the oak named Allonbacuth [Oak of Weeping].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> God appeared to Jacob again after he came from Paddan-aram and blessed him. 10"You're Jacob, but you won't be called Jacob anymore. Your name will be Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'm God Almighty [El-Shaddai]. Have children and multiply. A group of nations will come from you; kings will descend from you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll give you and your descendants the land I promised Abraham and Isaac."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> God ascended from him, 14and Jacob set up a stone marker "where God" had spoken to him. He poured out a liquid offering on it, poured olive oil on it, 15and named the place Bethel. The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They moved on from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel started to have contractions and suffered hard labor. 17The midwife said, "Don't be afraid; you have another son." 18As her life was draining away, she named him Benoni; but his father called him Benjamin. 19Rachel died and was buried along the road to Ephrath. 20Jacob set up a marker over her grave that's still there. 21Jacob kept traveling and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder. 22While he was living there, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel found out about it.	 Gen 35:16-22a Jacob had 12 sons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jacob went to see his father Isaac at Mamre near Kiriath-arba (Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived temporarily. 28Isaac lived 180 years, 29breathed his last, and passed on to his people. He'd lived to a ripe age, and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.	Gen 35:22b-29</span>
