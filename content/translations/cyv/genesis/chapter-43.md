## Genesis Chapter **43**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The famine continued to be severe. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When they’d eaten their grain from Egypt, their father said, <em>“Go back and buy us a little food.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But Judah told him<em>, </em> <em>“The man strictly warned us that we</em><em> wo</em><em>uld</em><em>n’t see </em><em>him unless </em><em>o</em><em>ur brother came with us. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you send our</em><em> brother with </em><em>us,</em><em> we’ll go down and buy you food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>f</em><em> you don’t, we won’t go.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Israel said, <em>“Why did you </em><em>do</em><em> me </em><em>such a bad turn</em><em> by telling the man</em><em> you </em><em>had another brother?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>They said, <em>“</em><em>He</em><em> questioned </em><em>us closely</em><em> about </em><em>us </em><em>and our relatives,</em><em> ‘Is your father still alive?</em><em> </em><em>Do you have another brother?</em><em>’ W</em><em>e</em><em> were</em><em> </em>just <em>answer</em><em>ing</em><em> his questions.</em><em> Could we possibly know he’d say, ‘</em><em>Bring your brother down</em><em> </em>here<em>’?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Judah said, <em>“Send the </em><em>boy</em><em> with me, and we, you, and your </em><em>children will live</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> be </em><em>his guarantee</em><em>.</em><em> H</em><em>old me responsible.</em><em> </em><em>If I don’t bring him back</em><em>, you can blame me</em><em> permanently.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> we hadn’t</em><em> delayed, we </em><em>could </em><em>have </em><em>gone back</em><em> twice.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 43:1-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Israel told them, <em>“If it </em><em>has to</em><em> be that way, in your bags</em><em> </em><em>take </em><em>some of the best </em><em>things our land produces. Take </em>them<em> to the man a</em><em>s a gift—some salve, </em><em>honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts</em><em>,</em><em> almonds.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Take</em><em> </em><em>twice</em><em> the money that </em><em>someone</em><em> </em><em>put back</em><em> in your sacks.</em><em> </em><em>Maybe it was a </em><em>m</em><em>istake.</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Take</em><em> your brother too.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>May</em><em> God Almighty </em>[El-Shaddai]<em> </em><em>grant you </em><em>mercy</em><em> so he’ll release your other brother and Benjamin.</em><em> I</em><em>f </em><em>I grieve</em><em>, I</em><em> grieve</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>They took the gift, twice the money, and Benjamin, and went down to meet Joseph.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 43:11-15</p>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his palace overseer, <em>“Bring the</em><em>m into</em><em> the house, </em><em>butcher an animal, and</em><em> prepar</em><em>e</em><em> for the</em><em>m </em><em>to eat with me at noon.”</em> [<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>They were afraid, <em>“B</em><em>ecause of</em> <em>the</em> <em>money </em><em>brought back</em><em> the first ti</em><em>me, he’s taking us in to arrest</em> <em>us and make </em><em>slaves </em><em>out of us and</em><em> our donkeys.”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They went and talked to the overseer at the entrance to Joseph’s house, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“Sir</em><em>, we really did come down the first </em><em>time </em><em>to buy food.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> we </em><em>stopped at</em><em> </em><em>a place to stay</em><em> and opened our </em><em>sacks,</em><em> each man’s money was </em><em>in</em><em> the </em><em>top</em><em> of the sack.</em><em> W</em><em>e’ve brought it back.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>We’ve</em><em> brought other money to buy food</em><em> </em>this time<em>.</em><em> </em><em>We don’t know who put our money </em><em>back </em><em>in our sacks</em><em> </em>before<em>.”</em><em>	</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“Don’t</em><em> worry. Your and your father’s God put your treasure in your sacks. I handled it.”  </em> Then he brought Simeon out. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He took the brothers into Joseph’s house, gave them some water to wash their feet, and fed their donkeys some hay. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>They got <em>their</em> gift ready for when Joseph came at noon; they’d heard they were to eat a meal there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>When he came home, they brought their gift into the house and bowed to the floor. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He asked them how they were doing, <em>“How’</em><em>s your </em><em>elderly</em><em> father?</em><em> </em><em>Is he still alive?”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“He’s</em><em> alive and well.”</em> They bowed again in homage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>He looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, <em>“Is this your youn</em><em>gest brother you told me about? God be gracious to you, </em><em>son.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>He hurried out because he was deeply moved over his brother, and looked for a place to cry. He went back to his room and cried, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>then washed his face and came back. He controlled himself and said, <em>“Serve the meal.”</em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They served him by himself, <em>the brothers</em> by themselves, and the Egyptians that ate with him by themselves. (Egyptians wouldn’t eat with Hebrews. That would have been demeaning.) <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>They were sitting, the firstborn according to his birthright, the youngest according to his youth. They looked at one another amazed. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He took portions to them from his own table; Benjamin’s portion</span>
