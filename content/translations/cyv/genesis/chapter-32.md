## Genesis Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> As Jacob was going along, angels from God met him. 2When he saw them, he said, "This is God's 'camp'"; so he named the place Mahanaim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He sent messengers to his brother Esau in Seir (Edom). 4"Tell Esau that his servant Jacob says, 'I've lived temporarily with Laban till now. I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male and female servants. 5I've sent to tell you so I'll be pleasing to you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The messengers came back to Jacob and said, "We went to Esau; he's coming to meet you with 400 men." 7Jacob was terribly afraid and distressed. He divided the people, the flocks, herds, and camels into two companies. 8"If Esau attacks one drove, the other can escape."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He said, "God of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac, Yahveh who told me to go back to my country and my relatives, and you'd make me prosper, 10I don't deserve the kindness and faithfulness you've shown me. I crossed this Jordan with just a staff. Now I've become two companies. 11Protect me from Esau. I'm afraid he might attack me and the mothers of my offspring. 12You did say, 'I'll make you prosper and make your descendants like sand on the shore that can't be counted.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He spent the night there. Then he chose from what he had with him a gift for Esau: 14200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 1530 milking camels and their colts, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. 16He gave them to his servants, "Go on ahead and space out the droves." 17He told the first drove, "When Esau meets you and asks who they belong to and where you're going, 18say, 'They belong to Jacob. They're a gift to you. Jacob is behind us.'" 19He told the second and third drove, and everybody that followed the droves, 20"Tell Esau when you meet him, 'Your servant Jacob is behind us too.'" He said, "I'll appease him with the gift first. Then when I see him, maybe he'll accept me." 21His gift passed on ahead while he spent that night in the camp. Jacob Wrestles with a Man</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He got up that night and took his 2 wives, 2 maids, and 11 children, and crossed the Jabbok ford. 23He sent them across the stream along with what he had. 24He was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till dawn. 25When the man saw he hadn't won, he struck the socket of Jacob's hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. 26Then the man said, "Let me go; it's getting daylight." "I won't let you go unless you bless me." 27"What's your name?" "Jacob." 28"It won't be Jacob anymore. It'll be Israel; you've 'wrestled with God' and men and prevailed." 29"Tell me your name." "Why are you asking?" That's where he blessed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jacob named the place Peniel; "I've seen 'God face to face,' but I'm still alive." 31The sun was coming up as he crossed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 32Israelites still don't eat the sinew that's on the hip socket, because the man struck the sinew on Jacob's hip socket.
