## Genesis Chapter 39

### Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Ishmaelite traders had taken Joseph down to Egypt, and sold him to Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, captain of the bodyguard. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Yahveh was with him, so he became successful in his master’s house. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His master saw Yahveh was with him to make everything he did succeed. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He was pleased with Joseph and made him his personal servant. Joseph oversaw his household and everything he owned. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>From the time he made him overseer, Yahveh blessed his house, everything in it and in the field. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So he left everything in his charge. With him around, he didn’t concern himself with anything except what to eat.</span>

### a Joseph was good looking. 7His master’s wife looked at him with lust and said, “Lie with me.” 8But he refused, “With me here, my master doesn’t concern himself with anything in the house. He’s put me in charge of everything. 9There’s nobody higher than me, and he hasn’t withheld anything from me except you because you’re his wife. How could I do such a thing and sin against God?”


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> She hounded Joseph day after day, but he wouldn’t give in to her. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>One day he went into the house to work; none of the other men were inside. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>She grabbed his cloak, <em>“Lie </em><em>with me!”</em><em> </em>He left his cloak in her hand and ran outside. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When she saw his cloak in her hand, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>she yelled to the other men in her household, <em>“Look, he </em><em>brought </em><em>us </em><em>a Hebrew to </em><em>abuse</em><em> us.</em><em> He came in to rap</em><em>e </em><em>me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I screamed, he </em><em>ran out</em><em> and left his </em><em>cloak</em><em> beside me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She left his cloak lying beside her till her husband came home. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then she told him, <em>“</em><em>The Hebrew slave you brought us came in to</em><em> </em><em>abuse</em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I screamed</em><em>,</em><em> he left his </em><em>cloak</em><em> and fled outside.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> When she said, <em>“That’</em><em>s what you</em><em>r</em><em> slave did to me,”</em> he was mad <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and put him in jail with his prisoners. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Yahveh was with Joseph and made him a favorite of the chief jailer. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He committed the prisoners to his charge and made him responsible for whatever happened there. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The chief jailer didn’t supervise anything under his charge. Yahveh prospered whatever <em>Joseph</em> did.</span>
