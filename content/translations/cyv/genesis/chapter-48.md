## Genesis Chapter 48

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After this, they told Joseph, "Your father is failing." So he took his sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him. 2When they told Jacob, "Joseph's here," Israel gathered his strength and sat up in bed. 3He told Joseph, "God Almighty [El-Shaddai] appeared to me in Luz and blessed me: 4'I'll make you countless, a group of nations. I'll give your descendants this land as a permanent possession.' 5Your two sons born in Egypt before I came will be considered mine alongside Reuben and Simeon. (6Your later offspring will be yours.) They'll inherit with their brothers. 7When I was coming from Paddan, sadly, Rachel died in Canaan on the way before we got to Ephrath (Bethlehem). I buried her there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he asked, "Who are these?" 9"They're the sons God gave me here." "Bring them to me so I can bless them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Israel's sight was so weak from age he could hardly see. Joseph brought them, and he kissed them and hugged them. 11He told Joseph, "I never expected to see you, and God has let me see your children too!" 12Joseph took them from his knees and bowed to the ground. 13Joseph took Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right. 14But Israel put his right hand on Ephraim's head, crossing his hands, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. 15He blessed Joseph, "God in whose presence my forefathers Abraham and Isaac lived, God that's been my shepherd my whole life,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> the angel that redeemed me from every misfortune, bless the boys. May I and my forefathers live on in them, and they become a large number."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When Joseph saw his father put his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him. He took hold of his father's hand to move it to Manasseh's head, 18"Not that way, father. This is the firstborn. Put your hand on his head."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But his father refused, "I know, son; I know. He'll become numerous too. But his younger brother will be more numerous. Many nations will descend from him." 20He blessed them that day, "By you Israel will pronounce blessing and say, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!'" He put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then he told Joseph, "I'm about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to where your ancestors lived. 22I'm giving you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the Amorite with my sword and bow." Jacob Blesses His Sons</span>
