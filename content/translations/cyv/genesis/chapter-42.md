## Genesis Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob found out that Egypt had grain and said to his sons, "Why are you just looking at one another? 2I've heard that Egypt has grain. Go down and buy some so we can stay alive." 3Ten of Joseph's brothers went down, 4but Jacob didn't send Joseph's full brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid something would happen to him. 5His sons went with other people from Canaan because the famine wore on in Canaan too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Joseph governed the country and was the one that sold people the grain. His brothers came and bowed to the ground. 7When he recognized them, he disguised himself and was gruff with them, "Where are you from?" "Canaan; we came to buy food."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They didn't recognize him. 9He remembered his dreams about them, and said, "You're spies. You've come to look for weak places in our country." 10"No, my lord; we've come to buy food. 11We're honest men, not spies." 12"No, you've come to look for weak places in our country!" 13"We're 12 brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest is with our father and one has died." 14"The truth is, you're spies. 15I'll check out your claims. By Pharaoh's life, you won't leave here unless your youngest brother comes! 16One of you, go back to get him while the others stay here confined so I can verify what you claim."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He put them in prison together for three days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The third day, he said, "Do this and live; I respect God: 19if you're telling the truth, one of you can remain in custody. The rest can take grain for your households. 20Bring your youngest brother, and you won't die." That's what they did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They said to one another, "We're guilty about our brother. We saw his distress when he pleaded with us, but we didn't care. That's why this distress has come on us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Reuben answered, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen. Now comes the reckoning for his blood."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> They didn't know Joseph understood them; there had been a translator between them. 24He turned the other way and got tears in his eyes. But when he turned back around and spoke to them, he had Simeon bound right in front of them. 25He gave orders to fill their bags with grain, put each man's money back in his sack, and give them supplies for the return trip.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They loaded their donkeys with grain and left. 27When one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey where they stopped for the night, he saw his money in the top of the sack. 28He told his brothers, "My money's been put back in my sack!" Their hearts sank, and they turned to one another shaking, "What's God done to us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When they got to Canaan, they told their father what had happened, 30"The lord of the land was gruff with us and accused us of being spies. 31But we told him, 'We're honest men, not spies. 32We're 12 brothers. One's dead and the youngest is with our father in Canaan.' 33The man said, 'Here's how I'll find out if you're telling the truth: leave one of your brothers. Take the grain for your households and go. 34Bring your youngest brother to me so I can tell you're not spies. I'll release your brother, and you can do business here.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When they emptied their sacks, every man's bag of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their money, they were scared. 36Jacob said, "You've deprived me of my children: Joseph's gone, Simeon's gone, and you want to take Benjamin! Everything's going against me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Reuben told him, "You can put my two sons to death if I don't bring him back. Put him in my care."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But Jacob said, "He's not going. His brother's dead; he's the only one left. If something happens to him on the trip, you'll send my gray hair down to Sheol in grief." Joseph's Brothers Return to Egypt</span>
