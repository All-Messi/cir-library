## Genesis Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Another famine came over the region besides the one in Abraham’s time. Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech, king of the Philistines. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Yahveh appeared to him, <em>“Don’t go down to Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Stay</em><em> </em><em>here</em><em>, and I’ll be with you and bless you.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll give </em><em>your descendants</em><em> these lands and</em><em> keep</em><em> the oath I swore to you</em><em>r</em><em> father.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I</em><em>’ll</em><em> multiply your </em><em>descendants</em><em> like stars in the sky.</em><em> Your seed</em><em> will bless </em><em>all the nations</em><em> in the world </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> Abraham obeyed me, kept my charge</em><em>s</em><em>, commandments, statutes, and laws.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So Isaac lived in Gerar. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When the men there asked about his wife, he said, <em>“</em><em>She’s</em><em> my sister</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> He was afraid to say, <em>“M</em><em>y wife,”</em> afraid the men would kill him on account of Rebekah; she was beautiful. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When he’d been there a long time, Abimelech looked out the window, and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He called him, <em>“</em><em>She </em><em>has to</em><em> be your wife! Why say she was your sister?”</em> <em>“</em><em>For fear that I’d </em><em>die on account of her.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Abimelech said, <em>“</em><em>What have you</em><em> done to us?</em><em> </em><em>One of the </em><em>men</em><em> might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Abimelech charged everybody, <em>“</em><em>I’ll execute whoever</em><em> touches this man or his wife.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### times as much as he planted. Yahveh blessed him, 13and he kept getting richer and richer till he was extremely wealthy. 14He had flocks, herds, and such a large household that the Philistines got jealous. 15They filled the wells his father’s servants had dug. 16Abimelech told Isaac, “Go away from us. You’re too big to be around us.” 17Isaac left and settled down in the Valley of Gerar.


<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>He dug again the wells they’d dug in Abraham’s time. The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. He named them the same as his father did. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well with flowing water, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>the herdsmen at Gerar “quarreled” with his herdsmen, <em>“</em><em>That’s our water</em><em>!”</em> so he named the well Esek. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They dug another well, and they “quarreled” over that one too; so he named it Sitnah. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He moved and dug another well. They didn’t quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth because he said, <em>“</em><em>Finally,</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh has made ‘room’ for us to</em><em> </em><em>prosper here</em><em>.”</em><em>	  </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 26:12-22</p>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He went up to Beersheba, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and Yahveh appeared to him that night, <em>“</em><em>I’</em><em>m your father</em><em>’s</em><em> </em><em>God</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t be afraid; I’m with you.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll bless you and multiply your descendants </em><em>out of regard </em><em>for Abraham.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He built an altar and called on Yahveh. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his advisor and Phicol his commander. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Isaac asked them, <em>“Why </em><em>did</em><em> you come to me</em><em>? You despise me and drov</em><em>e </em><em>me </em><em>away.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>We</em><em> can see Yahveh’s been with you, s</em><em>o we said, ‘Let</em><em>’s take </em><em>an oath between us</em><em> now.’  Let us make a treaty with you:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>you</em><em> won’t harm</em><em> us</em><em> </em><em>like</em><em> we haven’t done anything but good to you and sent you away </em><em>on good terms</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>You’re </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>’s blessed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>He held a feast for them, and they ate <em>together</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>In the morning they got up early and exchanged oaths. Isaac saw them off, and they left on good terms. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The same day, Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the “well” they’d dug, <em>“We found water.”</em> <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>So he called it Shibah. The town’s name is still Beersheba.</span>
