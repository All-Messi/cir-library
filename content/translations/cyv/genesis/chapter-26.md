## Genesis Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Another famine came over the region besides the one in Abraham's time. Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech, king of the Philistines. 2Yahveh appeared to him, "Don't go down to Egypt. 3Stay here, and I'll be with you and bless you. I'll give your descendants these lands and keep the oath I swore to your father. 4I'll multiply your descendants like stars in the sky. Your seed will bless all the nations in the world 5because Abraham obeyed me, kept my charges, commandments, statutes, and laws."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So Isaac lived in Gerar. 7When the men there asked about his wife, he said, "She's my sister." He was afraid to say, "My wife," afraid the men would kill him on account of Rebekah; she was beautiful. 8When he'd been there a long time, Abimelech looked out the window, and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah. 9He called him, "She has to be your wife! Why say she was your sister?" "For fear that I'd die on account of her.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Abimelech said, "What have you done to us? One of the men might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us." 11Abimelech charged everybody, "I'll execute whoever touches this man or his wife."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Isaac sowed grain, and the same year it yielded 100 times as much as he planted. Yahveh blessed him, 13and he kept getting richer and richer till he was extremely wealthy. 14He had flocks, herds, and such a large household that the Philistines got jealous. 15They filled the wells his father's servants had dug. 16Abimelech told Isaac, "Go away from us. You're too big to be around us." 17Isaac left and settled down in the Valley of Gerar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He dug again the wells they'd dug in Abraham's time. The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. He named them the same as his father did. 19But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found a well with flowing water, 20the herdsmen at Gerar "quarreled" with his herdsmen, "That's our water!" so he named the well Esek. 21They dug another well, and they "quarreled" over that one too; so he named it Sitnah. 22He moved and dug another well. They didn't quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth because he said, "Finally, Yahveh has made 'room' for us to prosper here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He went up to Beersheba, 24and Yahveh appeared to him that night, "I'm your father's God. Don't be afraid; I'm with you. I'll bless you and multiply your descendants out of regard for Abraham." 25He built an altar and called on Yahveh. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his advisor and Phicol his commander. 27Isaac asked them, "Why did you come to me? You despise me and drove me away." 28"We can see Yahveh's been with you, so we said, 'Let's take an oath between us now.'  Let us make a treaty with you: 29you won't harm us like we haven't done anything but good to you and sent you away on good terms. You're Yahveh's blessed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He held a feast for them, and they ate together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> In the morning they got up early and exchanged oaths. Isaac saw them off, and they left on good terms. 32The same day, Isaac's servants came in and told him about the "well" they'd dug, "We found water." 33So he called it Shibah. The town's name is still Beersheba.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When Esau was 40, he married two Hittite wives: Judith Bat-Beeri and Basemath Bat-Elon. 35They were a grief to Isaac and Rebekah. Isaac Blesses Jacob</span>
