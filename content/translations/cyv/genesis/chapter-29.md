## Genesis Chapter 29

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob continued on his trip to the country in the east. 2Up ahead he saw a well in a pasture where they watered the flocks. Three flocks of sheep were lying by it, and it had a big stone over it. 3When all the flocks got there, they'd roll the stone off the well, water the sheep, and put it back. 4Jacob asked them, "Brothers, where are you from?" "Haran." 5"Do you know Laban Ben-Nahor." "Yes." 6"How is he?" "He's good. That's his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jacob said, "It's still the middle of the day, not time to herd the livestock. Why aren't you watering the sheep and taking them to pasture?" 8"We can't water them till all the flocks get here and they roll the stone off the well."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> While he was still talking to them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. 10When Jacob saw her and Laban's sheep, he went and rolled the stone off the well and watered Laban's flock. 11He kissed Rachel and cried out loud. 12He told her he was Rebekah's son, a relative of her father. She ran to tell her father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When Laban heard it, he rushed to meet Jacob, hugged him, kissed him, and took him to his house. Jacob told him what all had happened. 14Laban said, "For sure, you're my flesh and bone." Jacob stayed with him a month.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Laban said, "Because you're my relative doesn't mean you have to work for nothing. What do you want for pay?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Laban had two daughters, Leah, the older one, and Rachel. 17Leah had less beautiful eyes, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 18Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I'll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Laban said, "It's better to give her to you than to anybody else. Stay on with me." 20Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, but they seemed like just a few days because he loved her so much.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Jacob told Laban, "Give me my wife so I can sleep with her. I've completed my time." 22Laban gathered the men in the place and made a feast. 23In the evening he brought Leah to him, and Jacob slept with her. 24Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to Leah as a servant. 25In the morning, it was Leah! Jacob said to Laban, "What've you done to me? Didn't I work for you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> But Laban said, "It's not the custom here to marry off the younger before the firstborn. 27Complete the bridal week for this one, and we'll give you the other one too for another seven years' work."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jacob completed her week, and Laban gave him Rachel as a wife. 29He also gave his servant Bilhah to Rachel as her maid. 30Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved her more than Leah and worked for Laban for seven more years. Jacob's Children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Yahveh saw that Leah wasn't loved, and opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 32Leah had a son she named Reuben, "Because Yahveh has 'seen' my misery. Surely my husband will love me now." 33She had another son, "Because Yahveh has 'heard' that I'm not loved, he gave me this son too"; so she named him Simeon. 34She had another son, "This time my husband will be 'attached' to me, because I've borne him three sons"; so she named him Levi. 35She became pregnant again and bore Jacob a son and said, "This time I'll 'praise' Yahveh"; so she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.</span>
