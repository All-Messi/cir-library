### Joseph and the Famine in Egypt


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> There wasn’t any food in the whole region because the famine was so severe. Egypt and Canaan were starving. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan for the grain people bought, and brought it to Pharaoh’s house. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When the money was gone in Egypt and Canaan, the Egyptians came to Joseph, <em>“Give us food.</em><em> </em><em>Why should we die in </em><em>front of you</em><em>? Our money’s gone.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Joseph said, <em>“Trad</em><em>e your livestock for food.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So they brought their livestock, and he gave them food in exchange for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys that year.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> At the end of the year, they came and said, <em>“We won’t hide it from you that we’ve spent all our money, and the livestock belong to you. We don’t have anything left except our bodies and land. </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Why</em><em> should we and our land die in front of you? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed so we can stay alive, and the land won’t be desolate.” </em><em>	</em><strong>Gen 47:13-19</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Joseph bought the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was so severe. The land became Pharaoh’s. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He moved the people to the cities from all over Egypt. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He didn’t buy the priests’ lands because they lived off their allotments from Pharaoh. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Joseph told the people, <em>“I’ve bought you an</em><em>d your land for Pharaoh today. Here’</em><em>s seed so you can sow the land.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>At</em><em> harvest, give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours for planting and for feeding your household and little ones.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> They said, <em>“You’ve saved </em><em>us</em><em>!</em><em> Be gracious to us,</em><em> my lord, and we’ll be Pharaoh’s slaves.”</em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Joseph made it a statute about land in Egypt <em>that’s</em> still <em>in force</em>: Pharaoh would have a fifth. The priests’ land was all that didn’t become Pharaoh’s.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Israel kept living in Goshen, acquired property, and became very numerous. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, 147 years in all. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>When the time came to die, he called Joseph, <em>“</em><em>Do me a favor.</em><em> </em><em>P</em><em>ut your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth.</em><em> </em><em>Don’t bury me in Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I lie down with my ancestors, carry me out</em><em> of Egypt and bury me in their b</em><em>urial place.”</em><em> </em> <em>“I’ll do that</em><em>.”</em></span>
