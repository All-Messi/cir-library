## Genesis Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sarah lived 127 years 2and died in Kiriath-arba (Hebron) in Canaan. Abraham went in to mourn for her and cry. 3Then he got up from beside his dead and said to the descendants of Heth, 4"I'm a foreigner among you. Let me have a place to bury my dead." [5] 6"Listen, Sir, you're a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best grave we have. None of us will refuse you his grave."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Abraham stood up and bowed to the local people, 8"If you'll let me bury my dead, approach Ephron Ben-Zohar for me, 9to let me have the Cave of Machpelah at the end of his field. Will he let me buy it at full price for a burial place among you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Ephron was sitting there and answered Abraham in front of everyone that was going in his city gate, 11"No, Sir; listen. In my people's presence, I'll give you the field and the cave that's in it. Bury your dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Abraham bowed 13and told him, "I'll pay you the price for the field. Accept it so I can bury my dead there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He answered, 15"Listen, a piece of land worth 10 lbs 400 shekels of silver—what's that between us? Bury your dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Abraham listened and weighed out 10 lbs 400 shekels of silver, merchant's standard. 17Ephron deeded the field, its trees, and the cave 18to Abraham in front of everyone in his city gate. It became a possession among the descendants of Heth. 19Abraham buried Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah east of Mamre (Hebron) in Canaan. [20] A Wife for Isaac</span>
