## Genesis Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After this, God tested Abraham, <em>“Abraham.”</em> <em>“</em><em>Yes”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Abraham got up early, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men and Isaac. He split wood for the burnt offering and left for the place God told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> On the third day, Abraham saw it in the distance. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He told his young men, <em>“Stay here with the donkey</em><em>. The boy and </em><em>I </em><em>are going up there to worship and come back</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac and carried the fire and knife by hand; so the two of them walked on together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Isaac said, <em>“</em><em>Dad</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>Yes?</em><em>”</em> <em>“There’s fire and wood, but where’s the lamb for the burnt offering?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They came to where God had told him. Abraham built an altar, arranged the wood, bound <em>Isaac</em>, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He took a knife to kill him, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>but the angel of Yahveh called from the sky, <em>“Abraham!</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Abraham looked up and noticed a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He took it and offered it for a burnt offering in place of his son. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He called the place Yahveh Will Provide<em> </em>[Yahveh-jireh], as it’s still said, <em>“In </em><em>‘Yahveh’s’ mountain</em><em> </em><em>he‘</em><em>ll</em><em> </em><em>‘provide</em><em>.</em><em>’” </em><em>	  </em><strong>Gen 22:9-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The angel called to Abraham again from the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Abraham returned to his young men, and they went back to Beersheba to live. <strong>Nahor’s Sons</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> After that, Abraham heard, <em>“Milcah has also had children to your brother Nahor:</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Uz</em><em> his oldest,</em><em> Buz</em><em> his brother; Kemuel Avi-</em><em>Aram; </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Chesed</em><em>, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph; and Beth</em><em>u</em><em>el</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>[Rebekah’s father]<em>—those eight.</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Nahor’s<em> </em><em>concubine Reumah had Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.”</em></span>
