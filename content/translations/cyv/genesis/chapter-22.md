## Genesis Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After this, God tested Abraham, "Abraham." "Yes" 2"Take Isaac, that you love, your only son, and go to the area around Moriah. Offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain where I tell you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Abraham got up early, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men and Isaac. He split wood for the burnt offering and left for the place God told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> On the third day, Abraham saw it in the distance. 5He told his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I are going up there to worship and come back." 6Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac and carried the fire and knife by hand; so the two of them walked on together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Isaac said, "Dad." "Yes?" "There's fire and wood, but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?" 8"God will provide it, Son"; so the two of them walked on together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They came to where God had told him. Abraham built an altar, arranged the wood, bound Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. 10He took a knife to kill him, 11but the angel of Yahveh called from the sky, "Abraham!" 12"Yes?" "Don't do anything to him. I know now that you respect me; you haven't withheld your only son from me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Abraham looked up and noticed a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He took it and offered it for a burnt offering in place of his son. 14He called the place Yahveh Will Provide [Yahveh-jireh], as it's still said, "In 'Yahveh's' mountain he'll 'provide.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The angel called to Abraham again from the sky, 16"I've sworn by myself 17to multiply your descendants like stars in the sky and sand on the shore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies 18and bless all nations because you've obeyed me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Abraham returned to his young men, and they went back to Beersheba to live. Nahor's Sons</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> After that, Abraham heard, "Milcah has also had children to your brother Nahor: 21Uz his oldest, Buz his brother; Kemuel Avi-Aram; 22Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph; and Bethuel 23[Rebekah's father]—those eight. 24Nahor's concubine Reumah had Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."
