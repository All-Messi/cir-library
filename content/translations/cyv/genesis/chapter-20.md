## Genesis Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Abraham moved toward the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur, living for a while in Gerar. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said of Sarah, <em>“She’</em><em>s my sister”</em>; so Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took her. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But God came to him in a dream at night, <em>“You’re a dead man. T</em><em>he woman you’ve taken</em><em> is</em><em> married.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Abimelech hadn’t come near her, and he said, <em>“Lord, will you </em><em>kill</em><em> a </em><em>blameless </em><em>nation?</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Didn’t</em><em> he </em><em>say</em><em> she was his sister, and she say he was her brother? </em><em>I’ve done this</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>n integrity </em><em>a</em><em>nd innocence.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>God said to him in the dream, <em>“I know. I’ve kept you from sinning against me and didn’t let you touch her. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Give</em><em> the man his wife. He’s a prophet; he’ll pray for you, and you’ll live. If you don’t, you can be sure you and everybody you have will </em><em>die.”</em><em>   </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 20:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Abimelech got up early and called his officials and told them. They were really afraid. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He called Abraham, “<em>What have you done to us?</em><em> </em><em>How have I sinned against you that you brought a </em><em>serious</em><em> sin on me and my kingdom?</em><em> T</em><em>hat shouldn’t be done.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>What</em><em> </em><em>made </em><em>you</em><em> do it</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> thought, there’s no respect for</em><em> God here.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll kill me </em><em>for</em><em> my wife.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Besides</em><em>, she really is my sister, my father</em><em>’s daughter</em><em>, but not my mother</em><em>’s</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> God </em><em>had me</em><em> wander from my father’</em><em>s </em><em>family,</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>told her to s</em><em>how me</em><em> kindness wherever we went by</em><em> say</em><em>ing I was her brother.</em><em>”</em><em>   </em><em>	  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, cattle, male and female servants, and gave Sarah back to him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He said, <em>“My land is </em><em>open to you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Settle </em><em>anywhere</em><em> you like.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He told Sarah, <em>“I’ve given your brother </em><em>1,000</em><em> pieces of silver</em><em> to exonerate you to</em><em> everybody with you and </em><em>anywhere else</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Abraham prayed and God restored Abimelech, his wife, and maids so they could have children again. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Yahveh had closed the wombs in his household because of Sarah.</span>
