## Genesis Chapter 41

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Two years later, Pharaoh dreamed he was standing by the Nile. 2Seven healthy, well-fed cows came up from the river and started grazing on the marsh grass. 3Seven scrawny, bony cows came up 4and ate the seven healthy, well-fed ones. Then he woke up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He went back to sleep and had another dream. Seven heads of filled-out, good grain grew on a single stalk. 6Seven thin, wind-scorched grain heads sprouted up 7and swallowed the filled-out heads. Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream. 8In the morning, the dreams haunted him. He sent for Egypt's astrologers and wise men. He told them the dreams, but no one could figure out what they meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my own sins today. 10You were furious with us and confined me and the chief baker in the captain of the bodyguard's house. 11We both had a dream the same night. 12A Hebrew young man was with us there, a servant to the captain. We told him the dreams, and he interpreted them for us. 13Things came about like he said. You gave me back my office but impaled the chief baker."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Pharaoh called for Joseph, and they hurried and brought him out of the dungeon. He shaved and changed clothes and went to Pharaoh. 15Pharaoh told him, "I've had a dream that no one can interpret. I've heard that you can interpret dreams." 16"It's not me. God will give you a sensible answer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Pharaoh told Joseph, "I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile. 18Seven healthy, well-fed cows came up from the river and started grazing on the marsh grass. 19Seven unhealthy, scrawny, boniest cows I'd ever seen anywhere in Egypt, 20came up and ate the first seven cows. 21Yet when they'd eaten them, you couldn't tell it. They were as scrawny as before. Then I woke up. 22"I also dreamed about seven filled-out, good grain heads that grew on a single stalk. 23Seven withered, thin, wind-scorched grain heads sprouted up, 24and swallowed the seven good heads. When I told the astrologers the dream, none of them could explain it to me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Joseph told him, "Your dreams both mean the same thing. God has told you what he's going to do. 26The seven good cows and seven good ears represent seven years. 27The seven bony, scrawny cows that came up after them and the seven thin heads scorched by the east wind represent seven years of famine. [28] 29Seven abundant years are coming on Egypt. [30] 31The seven-year famine that follows will ruin the land. It'll be severe enough to erase the memory of previous abundance. 32Repeating the dream emphasizes that God is determined to do it. He'll make it happen soon. 33Now you can look for a discerning man to appoint over Egypt. 34He can appoint land managers and exact a fifth of the crop during the seven abundant years. 35They can gather the food during those years, store it up in cities under your authority, and guard it. 36It can remain in reserve for the seven famine years so the land won't perish from the famine. Joseph Made Ruler of Egypt</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The plan made sense to him and his officials. 38He asked, "Can we find anyone else like this who has a divine spirit in him?" 39Pharaoh told Joseph, "Since God has informed you about this, there's nobody more discerning and wise than you. 40You'll be over my house, and my people will pay you homage. Only in regard to the throne will I have more authority than you. 41I've set you over Egypt."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph's finger, dressed him in fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. 43He had him ride in his second chariot, and they declared ahead of him, "Bend the knee!" 44Pharaoh told him, "I'm Pharaoh, but without your permission nobody will lift hand or foot anywhere in Egypt." 45Pharaoh named him Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Joseph was 30 when he stood in front of Pharaoh. He went out from Pharaoh all over Egypt. 47During the seven abundant years, the ground produced abundantly. 48He gathered food during those years and put it in each city from its own fields. 49He stored up so much grain that he stopped trying to measure it—like sand on the seashore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Before the first famine year, Asenath bore Joseph two sons. 51He named the first son Manasseh, "God has 'made me forget' my problems and my father's family." 52He named the second son Ephraim, "God has made me 'productive' in the country where I suffered adversity." 53The seven abundant years came to an end, 54and seven famine years set in—like Joseph had said. The famine spread over all the surrounding countries, but Egypt had food. 55The entire country was famished, and the people appealed to Pharaoh for food. He told them to go to Joseph and do what he said. 56When the famine had spread over the whole region, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. 57People from all over the region came to Egypt to buy grain from him because the famine was severe everywhere.
