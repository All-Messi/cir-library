## Genesis Chapter **41**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Two years later, Pharaoh dreamed he was standing by the Nile. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Seven healthy, well-fed cows came up from the river and started grazing on the marsh grass. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Seven scrawny, bony cows came up <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and ate the seven healthy, well-fed ones. Then he woke up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>He went back to sleep and had another dream. Seven heads of filled-out, good grain grew on a single stalk. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Seven thin, wind-scorched grain heads sprouted up <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and swallowed the filled-out heads. Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>In the morning, <em>the dreams </em>haunted him. He sent for Egypt’s astrologers and wise men. He told them the dreams, but no one could figure out what they meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>The cupbearer said to Pharaoh, <em>“I remember </em><em>my own sins today.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> were </em><em>furious with </em><em>us</em><em> and confined me and the chief baker </em><em>in</em><em> the captain of the bodyguard</em><em>’s house</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> </em>both<em> </em><em>had a dream the same night.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> Hebrew young man was with us there, a servant to</em><em> the captain.</em><em> </em><em>We told him the dreams, and he interpreted them for us.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Things</em><em> came about</em><em> like </em><em>he said</em><em>.</em><em> You</em><em> </em><em>gave me back my office but impal</em><em>ed </em>the chief baker<em>.”</em><em>	      </em> <em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Pharaoh called for Joseph, and they hurried and brought him out of the dungeon. He shaved and changed clothes and went to Pharaoh. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Pharaoh told him, <em>“I’ve had a dre</em><em>am that no one can interpret. </em><em>I’ve heard that</em><em> you can interpret dreams</em><em>.”</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“It’s</em><em> not </em><em>me.</em><em> </em><em>God will give </em><em>you </em><em>a </em><em>sensible</em><em> answer</em>.<em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Pharaoh told Joseph,<em> </em> <em>“I dream</em><em>ed</em><em> I was standing on the bank of the Nile.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Seven</em><em> healthy, </em><em>well-fed</em><em> cows ca</em><em>me up from the river and started grazing</em><em> on the marsh grass.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Seven</em><em> </em><em>unhealthy, scrawny, boniest cows I’d ever seen anywhere in Egypt,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>came</em><em> up and ate </em><em>the first seven cows. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>et</em><em> when they’d eaten them, you couldn’t tell </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They were as </em><em>scrawny</em><em> as before.</em><em> </em><em>Then I woke up.</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> also </em><em>dreamed about</em><em> </em><em>seven</em><em> filled-out, good </em><em>grain </em><em>heads that </em><em>grew</em><em> on a single stalk.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>even</em><em> withered, thin, wind-s</em><em>corched grain heads sprouted up, </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> swallowed the </em><em>seven</em><em> good heads.</em><em> </em><em>When I told t</em><em>he astrologers the dream, none of them</em><em> could explain it to me.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Joseph told him, <em>“</em><em>Your</em><em> dreams both mean the same thing.</em><em> </em><em>God has told </em><em>you </em><em>what he’s </em><em>going</em><em> to do.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>seven</em><em> good cows </em><em>and </em><em>seven good ears represent </em><em>seven</em><em> years.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>seven</em><em> bony, </em><em>scrawny</em><em> cows that came up after them and the </em><em>seven</em><em> thin </em><em>heads</em><em> scorched by the east wind </em><em>represent</em><em> </em><em>seven</em><em> years of famine.</em><em> [</em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>]</em><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>Seven</em><em> abundant years are coming on Egypt.</em><em> [</em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>] </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>seven-year </em><em>famine that foll</em><em>ows will ruin the land.

### Joseph Made Ruler of Egypt


<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The plan made sense to him and his officials. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>He asked, <em>“Can we find </em><em>anyone else</em><em> l</em><em>ike this who</em><em> has a divine spirit in him?”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Pharaoh told Joseph, <em>“Since God has </em><em>informed you about this, there’s </em><em>nobody </em><em>more discerning and wise</em><em> than you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>You’</em><em>ll</em><em> be over my house, and my people will </em><em>pay</em><em> </em><em>you homage</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Only </em><em>in </em><em>regard to</em><em> </em><em>the throne will I have more authority than you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> set you over Egypt.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph’s finger, dressed him in fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>He had him ride in his second chariot, and they declared ahead of him, <em>“Bend</em><em> the knee!”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>Pharaoh told him, <em>“I’m Pharaoh, but without your permission nobody will </em><em>lift</em><em> hand or foot </em><em>anywhere in</em><em> Egypt.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Pharaoh named him Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.</span>

### when he stood in front of Pharaoh. He went out from Pharaoh all over Egypt. 47During the seven abundant years, the ground produced abundantly. 48He gathered food during those years and put it in each city from its own fields. 49He stored up so much grain that he stopped trying to measure it—like sand on the seashore.


<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Before the first famine year, Asenath bore Joseph two sons. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>He named the first son Manasseh, <em>“God has </em><em>‘</em><em>made me forget</em><em>’</em><em> my </em><em>problems</em><em> and my father’s </em><em>family</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>52</sup></strong>He named the second son Ephraim, <em>“God has made me </em><em>‘productive’</em><em> in the </em><em>country</em><em> where I </em><em>suffered adversity</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup>The seven abundant years came to an end, <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>and seven famine years set in—like Joseph had said. The famine spread over all the surrounding countries, but Egypt had food. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>The entire country was famished, and the people appealed to Pharaoh for food. He told them to go to Joseph and do<em> </em>what he said. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>When the famine had spread over the whole region, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold <em>grain </em>to the Egyptians. <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>People from all over the region came to Egypt to buy grain from him because the famine was severe everywhere.</span>
