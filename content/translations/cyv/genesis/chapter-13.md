## Genesis Chapter 13

### Abram and Lot Separate

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abram, his wife, Lot, and everything he had, went up from Egypt to the Negev. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He was wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>From the Negev he traveled back to the place between Bethel and Ai where he’d pitched his tent before. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He went to the altar he’d built there and called on Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Lot had flocks, herds, and tents too, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and the land couldn’t support them both. They had too many possessions, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and conflict kept breaking out between their herdsmen. There were Canaanites and Perizzites in the land as well. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Abram told Lot, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>et’s not have conflicts between us or our herdsmen; we’re </em><em>relatives</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>he</em><em> whole land </em><em>lies open to you. S</em><em>eparate from me.</em><em> </em><em>If you go left, I’ll go right</em><em>; or vice versa</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Lot could see that the Jordan valley was well-watered—like Yahveh’s orchard, like Egypt on the way to Zoar. (That was before Yahveh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So Lot chose the Jordan valley and moved east. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Abram settled in Canaan; Lot settled in the towns in the valley and moved his tents as far as Sodom. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The men in Sodom were especially wicked.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 13:1-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After Lot separated from Abram, Yahveh said, <em>“Look around </em><em>in every direction</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> going to</em><em> give your descendants </em><em>permanently </em><em>the land you see.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> make </em><em>them like </em><em>dust</em><em>;</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>f</em><em> you could count it, that’s how many there’d be</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Travel</em><em> around all over it</em><em>.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Abram moved and settled by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre at Hebron and built an altar to Yahveh.</span>
