## Genesis Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abram, his wife, Lot, and everything he had, went up from Egypt to the Negev. 2He was wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold. 3From the Negev he traveled back to the place between Bethel and Ai where he'd pitched his tent before. 4He went to the altar he'd built there and called on Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Lot had flocks, herds, and tents too, 6and the land couldn't support them both. They had too many possessions, 7and conflict kept breaking out between their herdsmen. There were Canaanites and Perizzites in the land as well. 8Abram told Lot, "Let's not have conflicts between us or our herdsmen; we're relatives. 9The whole land lies open to you. Separate from me. If you go left, I'll go right; or vice versa."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Lot could see that the Jordan valley was well-watered—like Yahveh's orchard, like Egypt on the way to Zoar. (That was before Yahveh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). 11So Lot chose the Jordan valley and moved east. 12Abram settled in Canaan; Lot settled in the towns in the valley and moved his tents as far as Sodom. 13The men in Sodom were especially wicked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> After Lot separated from Abram, Yahveh said, "Look around in every direction. 15I'm going to give your descendants permanently the land you see. 16I'll make them like dust; if you could count it, that's how many there'd be. 17Travel around all over it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Abram moved and settled by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre at Hebron and built an altar to Yahveh. Abram Rescues Lot</span>
