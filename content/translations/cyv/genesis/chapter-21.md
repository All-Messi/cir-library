## Genesis Chapter 21

### The Birth of Isaac

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh kept his promise to Sarah. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time God had indicated. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He named him Isaac <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and circumcised him the eighth day—like God said. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Abraham was 100 when <em>Isaac</em> was born. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Sarah said, <em>“God made me </em><em>‘</em><em>laugh</em><em>.’ E</em><em>verybody that hears </em>about this <em>will laugh </em><em>too</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Who</em><em> would’ve told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I’ve borne him a son in his old age.”</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 21:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a big feast the day he was weaned. 	<strong>Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Sarah saw Hagar’s son making fun of <em>Isaac</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and told Abraham, <em>“</em><em>Get rid of</em><em> </em><em>her</em><em> and her son</em><em>. He’s not going to </em><em>inherit with </em><em>my son</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Abraham agonized over it, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>but God told him, <em>“Don’t </em><em>agonize</em><em> </em><em>over the boy and your maid. Take Sarah’s advice. Y</em><em>our lineag</em><em>e will descend through Isaac, </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> I’ll make a nation out of the maid’s son too because he’s your descendant.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Abraham got up early and gave Hagar bread and a skin of water. He put <em>them</em> on her shoulder, <em>gave her</em> the boy, and sent her away. She wandered in the desert around Beersheba. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>When the water in the skin was gone, she left him under a bush <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and sat down about a bowshot away, “<em>Don’t let me watch </em><em>him</em><em> die.</em><em>”</em> She cried out loud. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>God heard the boy crying, and his angel called to Hagar from the sky, <em>“What’</em><em>s </em><em>wrong</em><em>, Hagar?</em><em> Don’t be afraid.</em><em> God has heard the boy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>o</em><em> get</em><em> </em><em>him </em><em>up and ho</em><em>ld him by the hand; I’ll </em><em>make a </em><em>big</em><em> nation out of him.</em><em>” </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God caused her to notice a well. She went and filled the skin with water and gave him a drink. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>God was with him. He grew up and lived in the Wilderness of Paran and became an archer. His mother took a wife for him out of Egypt.</span>

### Treaty with Abimelech


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, commander of his army, said to Abraham, <em>“</em><em>God’</em><em>s</em><em> with you </em><em>whatever</em><em> you</em><em> do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> swear </em><em>by </em><em>him</em><em> </em><em>here </em><em>that you won’t deal falsely with me</em><em> </em><em>or my descendants.</em><em> T</em><em>he kindness I’ve shown you </em><em>please s</em><em>how</em><em> </em><em>me and the land where you’ve lived</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>“I</em><em> swear it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Abraham complained to him about the well his servants had seized.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Abimelech said, <em>“I don’t know who did th</em><em>at</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>ha</em><em>dn’t hear</em><em>d</em><em> about it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham gave Abimelech sheep and cattle, and the two made a treaty. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Abraham also set aside 7 ewe lambs. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Abimelech asked, <em>“What </em><em>are they</em><em> </em><em>for?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>“Take</em><em> </em><em>them as</em><em> </em><em>a sign </em>of agreement<em> that I dug this well.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He called the place Beersheba because the two of them took an “oath” at that “well.” <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistine territory. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there and called on Yahveh, the eternal God. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He lived in Philistine territory quite a while.</span>
