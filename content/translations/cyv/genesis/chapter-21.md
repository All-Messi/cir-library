## Genesis Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh kept his promise to Sarah. 2She became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time God had indicated. 3He named him Isaac 4and circumcised him the eighth day—like God said. 5Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born. 6Sarah said, "God made me 'laugh.' Everybody that hears about this will laugh too. 7Who would've told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I've borne him a son in his old age."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a big feast the day he was weaned. Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Sarah saw Hagar's son making fun of Isaac 10and told Abraham, "Get rid of her and her son. He's not going to inherit with my son." 11Abraham agonized over it, 12but God told him, "Don't agonize over the boy and your maid. Take Sarah's advice. Your lineage will descend through Isaac, 13but I'll make a nation out of the maid's son too because he's your descendant."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Abraham got up early and gave Hagar bread and a skin of water. He put them on her shoulder, gave her the boy, and sent her away. She wandered in the desert around Beersheba. 15When the water in the skin was gone, she left him under a bush 16and sat down about a bowshot away, "Don't let me watch him die." She cried out loud. 17God heard the boy crying, and his angel called to Hagar from the sky, "What's wrong, Hagar? Don't be afraid. God has heard the boy. 18Go get him up and hold him by the hand; I'll make a big nation out of him." 19God caused her to notice a well. She went and filled the skin with water and gave him a drink. 20-21God was with him. He grew up and lived in the Wilderness of Paran and became an archer. His mother took a wife for him out of Egypt. Treaty with Abimelech</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God's with you whatever you do. 23So swear by him here that you won't deal falsely with me or my descendants. The kindness I've shown you please show me and the land where you've lived." 24"I swear it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Abraham complained to him about the well his servants had seized.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Abimelech said, "I don't know who did that. I hadn't heard about it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham gave Abimelech sheep and cattle, and the two made a treaty. 28Abraham also set aside 7 ewe lambs. 29Abimelech asked, "What are they for?" 30"Take them as a sign of agreement that I dug this well." 31He called the place Beersheba because the two of them took an "oath" at that "well." 32Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistine territory. 33Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there and called on Yahveh, the eternal God. 34He lived in Philistine territory quite a while.
