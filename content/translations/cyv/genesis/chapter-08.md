## Genesis Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> God remembered Noah and the animals in the ark. He made wind blow over the whole world, and the water started to recede. 2The fountains in the deep and the floodgates in the sky closed, and the rain stopped. 3The water receded steadily for 150 days. 4On the seventeenth day, seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 5The water kept going down till the tenth month. The first day, tenth month, mountains became visible.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> After 40 days Noah opened the window of the ark, 7and sent out a raven that flew around till the water dried up. 8Then he sent out a pigeon to see if the water had gone down, 9but it didn't find anywhere to land and came back. The water was still covering the ground. Noah held out his hand and brought the pigeon into the ark. 10After a week he sent it out again. 11It came back toward evening with a new olive leaf in its beak. So Noah knew the water had gone down. 12Another week later he sent it out again, and it didn't come back. 13-14On the first day, first month, 601st year, the water had dried up. The twenty-seventh day, second month Noah took the roof off the ark and saw that the ground was dry. 14-15God told him 16to leavepl the ark 17and take the animals out so they could reproduce and multiply. 18Noah's family went out, 19and the animals left the ark after their kind. Life After the Flood</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Noah built an altar to Yahveh and took one from every ceremonially clean animal and bird, and offered burnt offerings on it. 21Yahveh smelled the pleasing aroma and said to himself, "I'll never curse the ground again because of people's evil motives from their youth up. I'll never destroy every living thing again. 22As long as the world is here, seedtime and harvest, heat and cold, summer and winter, day and night will keep happening."</span>
