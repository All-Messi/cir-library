## Genesis Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The snake was more devious than any other wild animal Yahveh God had made. It asked the woman, "Did God really tell youpl not to eat the fruit of any tree in the orchard?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> She said, "We're free to eat fruit from any tree 3but the one in the middle of the orchard. God said not to eat its fruit or touch it. We'll die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The snake said, "You'repl not going to die! 5God knows that when youpl eat its fruit, it'll open yourpl eyes, and you'llpl be like gods, knowing good and bad."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When she saw that the tree was good for food, looked nice, and was desirable for making a person wise, she ate some of its fruit and gave it to her husband, and he ate some. 7Their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made loin cloths. Punishments for Sin</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When they heard Yahveh walking in the orchard in the evening, they hid from him Yahveh among the trees. 9HeY called out for the man, "Where are you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The man said, "When I heard you walking in the orchard, I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." 11"Who told you you were naked? Did you eat some fruit from the tree I told you not to?" 12"The woman you made to be with me gave me some, and I ate it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh God asked her, "What did you do?" "The snake lied to me, and I ate the fruit."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh God told it, "Because you've done that, you're more accursed than any cattle or animals in the field. You'll slither around on your belly, and eat dust your whole life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll put hostility between you and the woman, between your offspring and hers. Her offspring will crush your head, and you'll bruise her offspring's heel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He told the woman, "I'll significantly increase your pain in childbirth. Though you'll bear children in pain, you'll still desire your husband, and he'll have authority over you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He told the man, "Because you've listened to your wife and eaten fruit from the tree I told you not to, the ground is cursed. Your whole life you'll work to eat from it. 18-19It'll grow thorns and thistles for you; you'll eat by sweating till you go back to the ground. You were taken from dust, and you'll go back to it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Adam called his wife Eve because she was the mother of everyone that's "lived." 21Yahveh God made clothes for them out of skin. 22HeY said, "People have become like one of us, knowing good and bad. Now, to keep them from taking fruit from the tree of life, eating it, and living forever . . . ." 23HeY sent them out of the orchard to cultivate the ground he'd taken them from. 24He stationed cherubs east of the orchard in Eden, and a flaming sword that pointed in every direction to block access to the tree of life.
