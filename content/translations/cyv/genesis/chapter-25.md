<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Isaac’s Generations</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Isaac was 40 when he married Rebekah. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He prayed for her because she wasn’t having children. Yahveh answered him, and she became pregnant, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>but the children struggled with each other inside her. She said, <em>“Why am I this way?”</em><em> </em>She went to ask Yahveh. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>You have t</em><em>wo nations</em><em> </em><em>in your </em><em>womb;</em> <em>	</em><em>t</em><em>wo nations </em><em>will come </em><em>from</em><em> your body.</em> <em>	</em><em>	One will be stronger than the </em><em>other;</em> <em>	</em><em>the older will serve the younger.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When it came time to deliver, she had twins. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The first was born red all over like a “hairy” piece of clothes. They named him Esau. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>His brother was born “holding” onto Esau’s “heel”; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 when she had them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob stayed around home, living in tents. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Isaac liked Esau because he had a taste for game; Rebekah liked Jacob. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>One day when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the countryside famished. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He told Jacob, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>et me have</em><em> some</em><em> of that </em><em>‘</em><em>red</em><em>’</em><em> </em>stew<em>.</em><em> I’m </em><em>starving.” </em>(So he was called Edom.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <em>“</em><em>S</em><em>ell</em><em> me your birthright</em><em> first</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> <em>“I’m</em><em> </em><em>about to</em><em> die</em><em>. What good’</em><em>s </em><em>a</em><em> birthright?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> <em>“</em><em>S</em><em>wear</em><em> to me</em><em> first;</em><em>”</em><em> </em>so he swore to him and gave him his birthright. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Then Jacob gave him bread and lentil stew. He ate it, got up, and left.</span>
