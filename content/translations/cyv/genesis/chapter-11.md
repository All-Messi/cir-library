## Genesis Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Yahveh came down to see the city and tower they were building, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>They’</em><em>re</em><em> one </em><em>set of </em><em>people with the same language.</em><em> T</em><em>hey’re starting to do</em><em> this</em><em>, and they’ll be a</em><em>ble to do anything they want to. </em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Let’s</em><em> confuse their language so they can’t understand each other.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Yahveh scattered them across the world, and they stopped building their city. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They called the city Babel because that’s where Yahveh “confused” the language of the world.<strong> </strong><strong>   </strong></span>
