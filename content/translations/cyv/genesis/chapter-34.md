## Genesis Chapter 34

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Leah's daughter Dinah went out to visit the daughters in the area. 2When Shechem Ben-Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the territory, saw her, he took her and lay with her. 3He was deeply attracted to her, and loved her, and spoke tenderly to her. 4Shechem spoke to his father, "Get me this young girl for a wife." 5Jacob heard that he'd defiled Dinah, but his sons were with his livestock in the pasture; he kept quiet till they came in. 6Then Hamor went to speak to Jacob. 7Jacob's sons came in from the pasture when they heard. They were grieved and mad, because Shechem had done such an awful thing in Israel. Something like that shouldn't be done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But Hamor said to them, "My son longs for your daughter. Let him marry her. 9Intermarry with us. 10That way you'll live with us, and the country will be open to you. Live, carry on business, and buy property in it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Shechem also told her father and brothers, "If I'm pleasing to you, I'll give whatever you say. 12Ask me whatever bridal price and gift, and I'll give it, but let me marry the girl."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father with deception because Shechem had defiled their sister, 14"We can't give our sister to someone that's not circumcised. That would be offensive to us. 15There's only one way we'll consent. If you'll become like us by circumcising every male among you, 16we'll intermarry with you and live with you as one people. 17If you won't be circumcised, we'll take our daughter and go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Their proposal seemed agreeable to Hamor and Shechem. 19The young man didn't delay doing what they asked because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. He was more respected than anybody else in his father's family. 20He and Hamor went to their city gate and said, 21"These men are peaceful with us. Let them live in the land and do business here. The land is big enough for them. Let them intermarry with us. 22Only on this condition will they agree to live with us and become one people: every male among us must be circumcised like they are. 23Won't their livestock, property, and animals be ours? Let's agree with them, and they'll live with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Everybody that went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and Shechem, and every male was circumcised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> On the third day, when the men in Shechem were very sore, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took a sword apiece and attacked the city by surprise and killed every male. 26They killed Hamor and Shechem, took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and left. 27Jacob's sons came on the slain and looted the city because they'd defiled their sister. 28They took their flocks, herds, donkeys, what was in the city and in the countryside. 29They captured and looted their wealth, took their little ones, their wives, and everything in the houses. 30Jacob told Simeon and Levi, "You've created a problem for me and made me repulsive to the Canaanites and Perizzites here. We only have a few men. They'll gather against me and destroy me and my household."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They said, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?" Jacob Returns to Bethel</span>
