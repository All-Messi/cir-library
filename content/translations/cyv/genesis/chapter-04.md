## Genesis Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Adam had relations with Eve, and she had Cain. She said, <em>“</em><em>I’</em><em>ve </em><em>‘produced’</em><em> a man with </em><em>Yahveh’s help</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>She also had Abel. Abel herded sheep; Cain cultivated the ground. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In time, Cain brought some produce to offer to Yahveh. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Abel brought some firstborn from the best in his flock. Yahveh regarded Abel and his offering favorably, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>but not Cain and his offering. It made Cain mad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Yahveh God asked him, <em>“Wh</em><em>at are you mad about</em><em>?</em><em> Why are you sad? </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Won’t</em><em> you feel happy i</em><em>f you do well?</em><em> </em><em>If you don’t</em><em>, sin’</em><em>s making its den at </em>your<em> door.</em><em> </em><em>It wants you, but you </em><em>have to</em><em> overrule it.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Cain told Abel <em>about it</em>. While they were in the field, Cain attacked him and killed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh God asked him, <em>“Where’s your brother?”</em> <em>“I don’t know. </em><em>I’m not his shepherd, am I?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Cain said, <em>“I can’t </em><em>take s</em><em>uch punishment!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>You’ve</em><em> driven me </em><em>away from the ground, you’re</em><em> </em><em>withdrawing from me, and </em><em>I’ll </em><em>be roaming</em><em> </em><em>around </em><em>and </em><em>on the run</em><em> in the </em><em>world. W</em><em>hoever finds me will kill me!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Yahveh told him, <em>“Whoever kills</em><em> you</em><em> </em><em>I’ll pay back seven times as much</em><em>.”</em> He<sup>Y</sup><sup> </sup>put a<sup> </sup>mark on him so nobody would kill him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He went away from Yahveh and settled in Nod, east of Eden.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Cain had relations with his wife, and she had Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Enoch was father of Irad Avi-Mehujael Avi-Methushael Avi-Lamech.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Adah had Jabal, the forerunner of nomads and herdsmen. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>His brother Jubal was the forerunner of musicians that play lyres and flutes. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Zillah had Tubalcain, the forerunner of artisans in bronze and iron. His sister was Naamah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Lamech told his wives, <em>“Adah and Zillah, </em><em>listen;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>w</em><em>ives of Lamech, </em><em>attend to</em><em> what I</em><em>’m</em><em> say</em><em>ing</em><em>.</em> <em>	I killed a man for wounding me, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em> young man for </em><em>striking</em><em> me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> Cain </em><em>wa</em><em>s avenged </em><em>7 times over</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>Lamech </em>will be avenged<em> </em><em>77</em><em> times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Adam had relations with his wife again, and she had a son she named Seth, because <em>“God gave me an</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>offspring</em><em>’</em><em> to replace Abel</em><em> that </em><em>Cain killed.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Seth had a son he named Enosh. People began to call on Yahveh.<strong></span>
