## Genesis Chapter 33

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his 400 men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two maids. 2He put the maids and their children in front, Leah and her children next, Rachel and Joseph last. 3He went on ahead of them and bowed to the ground seven times as he got closer to his brother. 4Then Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged him, and kissed him. They cried together. 5Esau looked up and saw the women and children, "Who are these?" "Children God has graciously given me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The maids came with their children and bowed. 7Leah came up with her children and bowed. Last, Joseph and Rachel came and bowed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Esau asked, "What do you mean by all this?" Jacob said, "To please you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But Esau said, "I have plenty, brother. Keep what you have." 10"No, if I'm pleasing to you, accept my present; I look up to you like someone looks up to God, and you've received me graciously. 11Take the gift I've brought you; God has been generous to me; I have plenty." He kept urging him, so he took it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Esau said, "Let's travel on. I'll go ahead of you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But he told him, "You know the children are young, and I'm concerned about the flocks and herds that are nursing. If they're driven hard for a day, they'll die. 14Go on ahead. I'll go at the pace of the livestock and children till I come to you in Seir." 15"Let me leave some of my people." "What's the need? Be gracious to me on this."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Esau went back that day to Seir. 17Jacob traveled to Succoth, built a house, and made "corrals" for his livestock; so the name of the place became Succoth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jacob went safely to Shechem in Canaan and camped by the city. 19The piece of land where he'd pitched his tent, he bought from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for 100 pieces of silver. 20He built an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel [El the God of Israel].
