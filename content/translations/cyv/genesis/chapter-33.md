### men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two maids. 2He put the maids and their children in front, Leah and her children next, Rachel and Joseph last. 3He went on ahead of them and bowed to the ground seven times as he got closer to his brother. 4Then Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged him, and kissed him. They cried together. 5Esau looked up and saw the women and children, “Who are these?”						 “Children God has graciously given me.”	Gen 33:1-5


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>The maids came with their children and bowed. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Leah came up with her children and bowed. Last, Joseph and Rachel came and bowed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Esau</em> asked, <em>“What do y</em><em>ou mean by all this</em><em>?”</em> <em>	Jacob</em> said, <em>“To </em><em>please you</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But Esau said, <em>“I have plenty, </em><em>brother.</em><em> Keep what you have</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“No</em><em>, if I</em><em>’m pleasing to </em><em>you, </em><em>accept</em><em> my present</em><em>;</em><em> I </em><em>look up to you like</em><em> </em><em>someone</em><em> </em><em>looks up to</em><em> God, and you’ve received me</em><em> graciously</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>ake</em><em> the gift I’</em><em>ve brought you; G</em><em>od has </em><em>been </em><em>g</em><em>enerous to me;</em><em> I have plenty.</em><em>” </em> He kept urging him, so he took it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Esau said,<em> “</em><em>Let’</em><em>s </em><em>travel on.</em><em> I’ll go ahead of you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But he told him, <em>“</em><em>You</em><em> know </em><em>the children are </em><em>young,</em><em> and </em><em>I’m concerned about </em><em>the flocks and herds that are nursing</em><em>. If they’</em><em>re driven hard for a day, </em><em>they’ll</em><em> die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>o</em><em> on ahead.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll go </em><em>at </em><em>the pace of the </em><em>livestock</em><em> and children till I </em><em>come</em><em> to </em><em>you </em><em>in Seir.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“L</em><em>et</em><em> me leave some</em><em> of my</em><em> people.”</em> <em>“What’s the need?</em><em> Be gracious to me</em> on this<em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Esau went back that day to Seir. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Jacob traveled to Succoth, built a house, and made “corrals” for his livestock; so the name of the place became Succoth.</span>
