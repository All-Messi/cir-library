## Genesis Chapter 49

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob called for his sons, "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Gather together, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel." 3"Reuben, my firstborn, my power and the first issue of my virility, preeminent in dignity and power,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> uncontrolled like water. You won't have preeminence, because you defiled your father's bed; you got on my marriage couch." 5"Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords are violent tools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Let my soul not join their council; let my honor not agree with their assembly; because in their anger they killed people, in their unrestraint they lamed oxen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Cursed be their fierce anger, their cruel wrath. I'll disperse them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel." 8"Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on your enemies' neck; your father's sons will bow to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Judah is a lion's whelp; son, you've risen up from the prey. He crouches and lies down like a lioness; who dares to rouse him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The scepter won't leave Judah, or the ruler's staff from between his feet till Shiloh comes. The nations will obey him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He ties his foal to a grapevine, his donkey colt to the best vine. He washes his clothes in wine, his robes in the juice from grapes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> His eyes are stained from wine; his teeth are white from milk." 13"Zebulun will live by the lake; he'll be a haven for boats; his border will extend toward Sidon." 14"Issachar is a strong donkey, lying between the sheepfolds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he sees how good his resting place is and how pleasant his land is, he'll bend his shoulder to carry burdens and submit to forced labor." 16"Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He'll be a snake along the road, a pit viper in the path that bites a horse's heels, so its rider falls off backward.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I wait for your salvation, Yahveh." 19"Raiders will raid Gad, but he'll raid back. 20"Asher will eat tasty food and produce food fit for kings." 21"Naphtali is an untamed doe that bears beautiful fauns." 22"Joseph is a fruitful limb, a fruitful bough beside a spring; its branches extend out over the wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The archers bitterly attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> but his bow stayed strong, and his arms maintained their endurance because of the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> because your father's God helps you, because the Almighty blesses you with blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the animals and the womb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Your father's blessings have surpassed his ancestors' blessings up to the utmost boundary of the everlasting hills. May they be on Joseph's head, the distinguished one among his brothers." 27"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. He eats prey in the morning and divides spoil at dusk." Jacob's Death and Burial</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> That's what their father told his sons when he blessed them, each with an appropriate blessing. 29Then he charged them, "I'm about to pass on to my people. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in Machpelah east of Mamre, in Canaan, in the cave Abraham bought for a burial site. 31They buried Abraham and his wife Sarah there. They buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah there. That's where I buried Leah." [32]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into bed, breathed his last, and passed on to his people.</span>
