<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Yahveh appeared to Abram, <em>“I’m going to</em><em> give your descendants</em><em> </em><em>this land</em><em>”</em>;<em> </em>so he built an altar to him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He went on from there to the mountain east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to Yahveh and called on him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He kept on migrating toward the Negev.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>A severe famine arose in the land; so he went on down to Egypt to stay awhile. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When he got close to Egypt, he told Sarai, <em>“You’</em><em>re a beautiful woman.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> the Egyptians see you, they’ll say</em><em> you’re my wife</em><em> and kill me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>ay</em><em> you’re my sister so </em><em>they will treat me well</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><em>	  </em> <em>	</em></span>

### Abram and Sarai in Egypt


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Abram got to Egypt, the Egyptians did see she was really beautiful. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Pharaoh’s officials praised her to Pharaoh and took her to his palace. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He treated Abram well out of regard for her, and gave him sheep, cattle, donkeys, male and female servants, and female donkeys and camels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>But Yahveh struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of her. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Pharaoh called Abram, <em>“What have you done to me?</em><em> </em><em>Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Why</em><em> </em><em>did you say she was your sister;</em><em> </em><em>so</em><em> I took her for my wife</em><em>? H</em><em>ere’s your wife; take her and </em><em>get out</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Pharaoh told his men to escort him away with his wife and everything he had.</span>
