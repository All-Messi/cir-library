## Genesis Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jacob overheard Laban's sons say, "Jacob has taken everything our father had and created that wealth." 2He saw that Laban's attitude had changed. 3Yahveh told him, "Go back to the land of your ancestors and relatives. I'll be with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to his flock in the pasture. 5He told them, "Your father's attitude toward me has changed, but my father's God has been with me. 6You know I worked hard for him, 7but he cheated me and switched my pay ten times. But God didn't let him hurt me. 8If he said, 'The speckled will be your pay,' the flock brought forth speckled. If he said, 'The striped will be your pay,' the flock brought forth striped. 9That's how God took your father's livestock and gave them to me. 10At the time when the flock was mating, I looked up and saw in a dream that the male goats were striped, speckled, and mottled. 11Then God's angel said in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Yes?' 12'Look up and see that the male goats that are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled, because I've seen what Laban's been doing to you. 13I'm the God in Bethel, where you anointed a marker and took a vow to me. Now leave this country and go back where you were born."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Rachel and Leah answered, "Do we still have any inheritance in our father's family? 15Doesn't he treat us like foreigners? He's sold us and completely used up our purchase price. 16The wealth God has taken from him clearly belongs to us and our children; do what God has told you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then Jacob put his wives and offspring on camels, 18and drove away the livestock and property he'd accumulated in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in Canaan. 19When Laban went to shear his flock, Rachel stole his household idols. 20Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving. 21He left with everything he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed toward the hill country in Gilead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Three days later, Laban heard Jacob had left. 23He took some of his relatives and chased him for a week. He caught up with him in the hill country in Gilead. 24God came to Laban in a dream at night, "Don't say anything to Jacob good or bad." 25Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his relatives also camped there. 26Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, deceiving me and taking my daughters like captives of the sword? 27Why did you leave secretly so I couldn't send you away with joy and songs, with tambourine and harp? 28You didn't let me kiss my sons and daughters. You've done foolishly. 29I can do you harm, but your father's God told me last night not to say anything to you good or bad. 30Okay, you've indeed gone away because you longed for your father's family, but why steal my gods?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jacob answered him, "I left secretly because I was afraid you'd take your daughters away from me by force. 32The one you find your gods with will die. In front of everybody, point out what's yours in my belongings and take it." Jacob didn't know Rachel had stolen them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Laban went to Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, the two maids' tent, but didn't find them. He left Leah's tent and went to Rachel's. 34She'd put the household idols in a camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban rummaged through the tent but didn't find them. 35She told her father, "Don't be mad at me for not getting up. The way of women is on me." He looked around but didn't find them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Jacob fussed at Laban, "What's my transgression? What's my sin that you've hotly chased me? 37You've rummaged through everything. What have you found from your household goods? Set it here in front of my relatives so they can decide between us. 38For the 20 years I've been with you, your ewes and female goats haven't miscarried. I haven't eaten the rams from your flocks. 39I didn't bring you what wild animals tore apart; I took the loss myself. You required from me what was stolen day or night. 40That's how I was: in the daytime the heat consumed me; at night the frost kept me awake. 41I worked 14 years for your two daughters and 6 for your flocks. You switched my pay ten times. 42If the God of my grandfather Abraham, the one Isaac fears, hadn't been on my side, you would've sent me away with nothing. He's seen my mistreatment and hard work, and he rendered judgment last night."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Laban answered him, "By rights, the daughters belong to me, the little ones and flocks too; everything you're looking at is mine. But what can I do about my daughters and their children now? 44Let's make a treaty, a witness between us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Jacob set up a stone marker. 46He told his relatives to gather up some rocks; they made a cairn of rocks and ate a covenant meal beside it. 47Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha; Jacob called it Galeed. 48Laban said, "This 'mound' serves as a 'witness' between us"; so they named it Galeed 49(also called Mizpah) because he said, "May Yahveh 'watch over' us while we're apart. 50If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, though no one is with us, God is 'witness' between us. 51This 'cairn' 52signifies that neither of us will go past it to harm the other. 53The God of Abraham, Nahor, and their father judge between us." Jacob swore out of respect for his father Isaac. 54He offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his relatives to eat and spent the night there. 55In the morning, Laban got up early, kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and went home.
