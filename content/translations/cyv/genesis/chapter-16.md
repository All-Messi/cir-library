## Genesis Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sarai, Abram's wife, hadn't had any children. She had an Egyptian maid named Hagar. 2Sarai told Abram, "Yahveh has kept me from having children. Sleep with my maid. Maybe I can have children through her." Abram took her advice. 3That happened after Abram had lived in Canaan for 10 years. 4He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting her mistress. 5Sarai told Abram, "You're responsible for the way she's acting toward me. I gave you my servant; but when she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting me. Yahveh decide between you and me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abram said, "She's under your authority. Deal with her as you see fit." Sarai was so rough on her that she ran away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The angel of Yahveh found her by a spring in the desert on the way to Shur. 8"Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from? Where are you going?" "I'm getting away from my mistress."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The angel told her, "Go back and submit to her. 10I'll multiply your descendants till they'll be too many to count. 11You'll have a son. Call him Ishmael because 'Yahveh has listened' to your plight. 12He'll be like a wild donkey, opposed to everybody and by everybody. He'll live east of his relatives."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> She called Yahveh Elroi because she said, "I'm still alive after 'I saw him.'" 14So the well was called Beer-lahai-roi between Kadesh and Bered. 15Hagar gave Abram a son he named Ishmael. 16He was 86 when she had him. Abram Renamed Abraham</span>
