## Genesis Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Isaac grew old, his eyesight was bad. He called for his older son Esau. "Yes?" 2"I'm getting old, and I don't know how long I'll live. 3Take your bow and quiver, and hunt game for me. 4Make the kind of dish I like and bring it to me so I can eat it and bless you before I die."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Rebekah overheard it. When Esau went out into the countryside to hunt, 6she told Jacob, "I overheard your father tell your brother, 7'Bring me some game and make me a tasty dish. I'll bless you in Yahveh's presence before I die.' 8Listen, son. 9Bring me two choice kids from the flock so I can make a dish your father likes. 10Then take it to him so he can bless you before he dies." 11"I'm not hairy like Esau. 12My father may feel me. I'll be a liar in his mind and bring a curse on myself, not a blessing." 13"That curse be on me. Just do what I'm telling you. Go get them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He got them and she made a meal Isaac liked. 15Then she took Esau's best clothes, which were in the house, and put them on her younger son. 16She put the kids' skins on his hands and neck, 17and gave Jacob the tasty food and bread she'd made.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He went to his father and said, "Father." "Yes, who are you, son?" 19"Esau your firstborn. I've done like you said. Sit up and eat my game so you can bless me." 20"How did you get it so quick?" "Yahveh our God helped me." 21"Come here so I can feel if you're really Esau."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jacob went up to him, and he felt him, "It's Jacob's voice but Esau's hands." 23He didn't recognize him because his hands were hairy like Esau's; so he blessed him. 24"Are you really Esau?" "Yes." 25"Bring it to me, and I'll eat your game so I can bless you." He took it to him, and he ate it. He took him wine to drink too. 26Then he said, "Come and kiss me, son." 27He went and kissed him. When he smelled his clothes, he blessed him, "You smell like a field Yahveh has blessed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Now may God give you dew from the sky, fertility from the ground, and abundant grain and new wine.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> May nations serve you; may they bow to you. Have authority over your relatives; may your mother's sons bow to you. Cursed be the ones that curse you; blessed be those who bless you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> No sooner had Isaac finished blessing him and he'd left than Esau came in from hunting. 31He made delicious food too and took it to his father, "Sit up, Father, and eat your son's game so you can bless me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Isaac said, "Who are you?" "Esau, your firstborn."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Isaac shook terribly "Then who was it that hunted game and brought it to me to eat and I blessed him? Yes, and he'll stay blessed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When Esau heard it, he let out a bitter cry, "Bless me too, father!" 35"Your brother came and deceived me and took your blessing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Esau said, "Isn't 'Jacob' a good name for him? He's 'usurped' my position twice. He took my birthright; now he's taken my blessing. Haven't you kept a blessing for me?" 37"I've put him over you and given him his relatives as servants. I've sustained him with grain and new wine. What's left that I can do, son?" 38"Don't you even have one blessing for me, father?" Esau cried out loud.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Isaac said, "You'll live away from fertile ground and dew from the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> You'll live by your sword and serve your brother. But when you break free, you'll break his yoke from off your neck."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Esau held a grudge against Jacob because his father had given Jacob the blessing. He said under his breath, "The days for mourning my father's death are coming. Then I'll kill Jacob."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> When his threat reached Rebekah, she called Jacob, "Your brother is consoling himself with the thought of killing you. 43Run off to my brother in Haran. 44Stay with him 45till your brother's anger wears off. Then I'll send for you. Why should I mourn for both of you the same day?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Rebekah told Isaac, "I'm as grieved as I can be over these Hittite women. If Jacob marries a woman like them, what good will my life be to me?" Jacob Sent to Laban</span>
