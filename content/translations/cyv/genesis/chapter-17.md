## Genesis Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Abram was 99, Yahveh appeared to him, "I'm God Almighty [El-Shaddai]. Follow me faithfully, 2and I'll multiply you many times over." 3Abram fell on his face, and God told him, 4"This is my side of the covenant with you: you'll be the ancestor of many nations. 5Your name won't be Abram anymore; it'll be Abraham because I'll make you 'the ancestor of many nations.' 6I'll make you really numerous. Nations will descend from you; kings will come out of you. 7With you and your descendants I'll establish my permanent covenant to be your God. 8I'll give you and your descendants an ongoing possession—Canaan, where you've lived as a nomad. Circumcision as the Covenant Sign 9-10"This is your and your descendants' side of the covenant: circumcise every male among you 11as a covenant sign between us. 12Circumcise them when they're eight days old. Circumcise a servant that's not your descendant whether born in your house or bought from a foreigner. 13Circumcision will be the ongoing, physical covenant sign in sons and servants. 14Any uncircumcised male will be excluded from the community because he hasn't observed the terms of my covenant. Sarai Renamed Sarah 15"Your wife's name won't be Sarai anymore; it'll be Sarah. 16I'll bless her and give you a son by her. She'll be the mother of many nations; kings will come from her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Abraham fell on his face and "laughed" to himself, "Can a man that's 100 years old become a father? Can Sarah have a baby when she's 90? 18If only Ishmael would live under your blessing!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God said, "No, Sarah will have a child. Name him Isaac. I'll make a permanent covenant with him and his descendants. 20I've listened to you about Ishmael. I'll bless him and make him really numerous, the father of 12 princes, a large nation. 21But my covenant will be with Isaac that Sarah will have next year."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When God finished talking, he ascended. 23That same day Abraham circumcised Ishmael, the male servants born in his house, and the ones he'd bought—like God said. 24He was 99 when he was circumcised; 25Ishmael was 13.
