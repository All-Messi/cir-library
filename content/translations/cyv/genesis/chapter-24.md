### A Wife for Isaac

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Abraham was getting older, and Yahveh had blessed him in every way. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He told his oldest servant that managed everything he owned, <em>“P</em><em>ut</em><em> your hand under my thigh </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> swear by Yahveh God of</em><em> </em><em>earth and sky </em><em>that you</em><em> won’t</em><em> </em><em>choose</em><em> a wife for my son from the Canaanites </em><em>where </em><em>I</em><em>’m living</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> to my relatives in my country to find him a wife.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> <em>“What</em><em> if she doesn’t want to come back with me? Should I take your son there?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“Make</em><em> sure you don’t! </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Yahveh God in heaven took me from my father’s family in the land where I was born. He swore to me he’d give my descendants</em><em> </em><em>this land. He’ll send his angel ahead of you. Choose a wife for my son from there. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she doesn’t want to come with </em><em>you,</em><em> you’ll be free from this oath. Just don’t take my son back there.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The servant put his hand under Abraham’s thigh and swore to him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 24:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The servant took 10 camels and left with lots of his master’s good things and went to Nahor’s city in Mesopotamia. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well in the evening when the women came out to draw water. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Yahveh, my master’s God, mak</em><em>e me success</em><em>ful</em><em> today and </em><em>be kind to my master. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> standing by the </em><em>well</em><em>,</em><em> and the daughters of men in</em><em> the city are coming out to draw water.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> girl I ask to let her</em><em> jar down so I can have a drink, and she says, ‘Take a drink</em><em>.</em><em> I’ll water your camels too’—may she b</em><em>e the one you’</em><em>ve </em><em>chosen</em><em> for Isaac.</em><em> </em><em>That way I</em><em>’ll</em><em> know you’ve </em><em>been gracious</em><em> to my master.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Before he’d finished talking, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was a daughter of Bethuel, son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The girl was beautiful, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came back up. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The servant hurried over to her, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>et me </em><em>have a </em><em>drink from your jar.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 24:10-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“Take</em><em> a drink, </em><em>S</em><em>ir.”</em> Right away she lowered her jar and gave him a drink. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Then she said, <em>“I’ll draw </em>water<em> for your camels too</em><em>,</em><em> till they finish drinking.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>She emptied her jar into the trough and hurried back to the well to draw <em>water</em> for his camels. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>In the meantime, the man was gazing at her silently to know if Yahveh had made his journey successful. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When the camels finished, he took a gold ring weighing .2 oz <sup>a half-shekel</sup> and two bracelets for her wrists weighing 4 lbs <sup>ten shekels</sup> of gold, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and asked, <em>“Who</em><em>’s your father</em><em>?</em><em> Does he have</em><em> room</em><em> </em><em>for us</em><em> to stay</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>“Bethuel</em><em> Ben-</em><em>Milcah, Nahor’s wife.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> have plenty of straw and feed, and room </em><em>for you to</em><em> </em><em>stay</em><em>.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The man bowed low in worship to Yahveh <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>and said, <em>“Bless Yahveh</em><em> God of Abraham, who hasn’t </em><em>abandoned</em><em> his kindness and truth</em><em>fulness</em><em> toward my master. </em><em>He </em><em>has guided </em><em><u>me</u></em><em> to my master’s relatives.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Gen 24:18-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The girl ran to tell her mother’s household. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Rebekah’s brother Laban rushed out to <em>meet</em> the man at the spring. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and heard her tell what the man had told her, he went to him standing with his camels. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>“Come</em><em> in, blessed by</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>stand out here?

<p class="section-ref">Gen 24:28-31</p>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He went in. Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and feed. He brought water to wash the feet of <em>Abraham’s</em> <em>servant</em><em> </em>and the ones that were with him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>But when <em>Laban </em>brought him<em> food</em>, <em>Abraham’s servant</em> said, <em>“I won’t eat till I’ve told </em><em>you</em><em> my business.”</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>“Go ahead.”</em></span>
