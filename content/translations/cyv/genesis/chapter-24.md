## Genesis Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Abraham was getting older, and Yahveh had blessed him in every way. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He told his oldest servant that managed everything he owned, <em>“P</em><em>ut</em><em> your hand under my thigh </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> swear by Yahveh God of</em><em> </em><em>earth and sky </em><em>that you</em><em> won’t</em><em> </em><em>choose</em><em> a wife for my son from the Canaanites </em><em>where </em><em>I</em><em>’m living</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> to my relatives in my country to find him a wife.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> if she doesn’t want to come back with me? Should I take your son there?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“Make</em><em> sure you don’t! </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Yahveh God in heaven took me from my father’s family in the land where I was born. He swore to me he’d give my descendants</em><em> </em><em>this land. He’ll send his angel ahead of you. Choose a wife for my son from there. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> she doesn’t want to come with </em><em>you,</em><em> you’ll be free from this oath. Just don’t take my son back there.” </em></span>

### camels and left with lots of his master’s good things and went to Nahor’s city in Mesopotamia. 11He had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well in the evening when the women came out to draw water. 12He said, “Yahveh, my master’s God, make me successful today and be kind to my master. 13I’m standing by the well, and the daughters of men in the city are coming out to draw water. 14The girl I ask to let her jar down so I can have a drink, and she says, ‘Take a drink. I’ll water your camels too’—may she be the one you’ve chosen for Isaac. That way I’ll know you’ve been gracious to my master.”


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Before he’d finished talking, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was a daughter of Bethuel, son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The girl was beautiful, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came back up. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The servant hurried over to her, <em>“</em><em>L</em><em>et me </em><em>have a </em><em>drink from your jar.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

### 18“Take a drink, Sir.” Right away she lowered her jar and gave him a drink. 19Then she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, till they finish drinking.” 20She emptied her jar into the trough and hurried back to the well to draw water for his camels. 21In the meantime, the man was gazing at her silently to know if Yahveh had made his journey successful. 22When the camels finished, he took a gold ring weighing .2 oz a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing 4 lbs ten shekels of gold, 23and asked, “Who’s your father? Does he have room for us to stay?”  	24“Bethuel Ben-Milcah, Nahor’s wife. 25We have plenty of straw and feed, and room for you to stay.”


<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>The man bowed low in worship to Yahveh <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>and said, <em>“Bless Yahveh</em><em> God of Abraham, who hasn’t </em><em>abandoned</em><em> his kindness and truth</em><em>fulness</em><em> toward my master. </em><em>He </em><em>has guided </em><em><u>me</u></em><em> to my master’s relatives.”</em><em>   </em><em>	  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>The girl ran to tell her mother’s household. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Rebekah’s brother Laban rushed out to <em>meet</em> the man at the spring. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and heard her tell what the man had told her, he went to him standing with his camels. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>“Come</em><em> in, blessed by</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>stand out here?

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>He went in. Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and feed.

### 42“I came to the spring today and said, ‘Yahveh, God of Abraham, make my journey successful. 43I’m standing by the spring. The young woman who comes out to draw water, and I say, ‘Let me have a drink from your jar,’ 44and she says, ‘Take a drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too’—may she be the woman you’ve chosen for my master’s son.’ 45Before I’d finished talking to myself, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, ‘Let me have a drink.’ 46Right away she lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Take a drink. I’ll water your camels too.’ I took a drink, and she watered them.	 Gen 24:42-46 47“Then I asked her whose daughter she was. She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son that Micah had.’ I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 48I bowed in worship and blessed my master’s God, who had guided me on the right road to choose the daughter of my master’s relative for his son. 49Tell me now if you’re going to deal graciously and honestly with my master. If not, let me know so I can decide what to do.”


<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Laban and Bethuel said, <em>“Since t</em><em>he</em><em> thing comes from Yahveh, there’s nothing for us to say</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>Rebekah</em><em>’</em><em>s</em><em> her</em><em>e; take her and go.

<span class="verse" id="v52"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When Abraham’s servant heard it, he bowed to the ground in front of Yahveh. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>He brought out silver and gold articles, and clothes for Rebekah, and gave precious things to her brother and mother. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>He and his men ate and spent the night. When they got up, he said, <em>“Let me go to my master.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Her brother and mother said, <em>“Let the girl stay with us a few days, maybe ten.</em><em> </em><em>Then she can go.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They sent away their sister and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men. <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>They blessed Rebekah, <em>“May you, our sister, become thousands of ten </em><em>thousand</em><em>s</em><em>.</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>May you</em><em>r</em><em> descendants </em><em>conquer the cities</em><em> of the</em><em>ir enemies</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Isaac had come from a trip to Beer-lahai-roi because he was living in the Negev. <strong><sup>63</sup></strong>He had gone out to meditate in the field toward evening and looked up and saw camels coming. <strong><sup>64</sup></strong>Rebekah saw him and got down from the camel. <strong><sup>65</sup></strong>She asked the servant, <em>“Who is the</em><em> man walking in the field to meet us?”</em> <em>“</em><em>He’s</em><em> my master.”</em><em> </em> She put on her veil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The servant told Isaac what all he’d done. <strong><sup>67</sup></strong>Isaac took Rebekah into his mother’s tent, and she became his wife. He loved her, and she was a comfort to him after his mother died.</span>
