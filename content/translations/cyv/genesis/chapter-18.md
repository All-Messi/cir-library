## Genesis Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh appeared to Abraham by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the heat of the day. 2He looked up and saw three men standing a little way off. He ran to meet them and bowed to the ground, 3"Sir, if yousg please, 4let me bring some water so you can wash your feet and rest under the tree. 5I'll bring a loaf of bread so you can refresh yourselves. Then you can go on." "All right."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abraham hurried to Sarah in the tent, "Quick! Get three measures of fine flour ready, knead it, and make bread cakes." 7He ran to the herd and took a choice, tender calf, and gave it to a servant to fix quickly. 8He took yogurt, milk, and the veal he'd fixed and set it in front of them. He stood there under the tree while they ate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then they asked, "Where's Sarah?" "In the tent."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He said, "I'll come back next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son." She was listening at the entrance to the tent behind him. 11Abraham and Sarah were getting old. She was too old to have children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Sarah laughed to herself, "At this age, am I really going to have that delight? My husband [lord] is old too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child when I'm so old?' 14Is there anything IY can't do? Like I said, at this time next year Sarah will have a son."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Sarah denied it, "I didn't laugh." (She was afraid.) "Oh yes, you did." Abraham Intercedes for Sodom</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The men got up and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to see them off. 17Yahveh said, "Should I keep from Abraham what I'm about to do?  18He'll certainly become a large, strong nation, and bless every nation. 19I've chosen him to command his children and household after him to keep myY way by doing what's good and just; so I can bring on him what I've promised."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> HeY told Abraham, "The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah is extreme. Their sin is awful. 21I'm going down to see if they're as bad as their outcry. If not, I'll know."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The other men turned and started toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing in front of Yahveh, 23Abraham came and said, "Will you sweep away the good with the bad? 24Supposing there are 50 good people in the city; won't you spare it for their sake? 25Surely you wouldn't kill the good with the bad and treat them alike! Surely not! Won't the Judge of the whole world do what's right?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Yahveh said, "If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I'll spare the whole place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Abraham answered, "I've dared to speak to you though I'm only dust and ashes, 28Suppose there are 45, will you destroy the whole city because of 5?" "I won't destroy it if I find 45." 29"Suppose there are 40?" "I won't do it for the 40." 30"Lord, don't be angry. I'll ask again: suppose you find 30 there?" "I won't do it if I find 30 there." 31"I've dared to speak to the Lord; suppose there are 20?" "I won't destroy it for the 20." 32"Lord, don't be angry, and I'll speak just one more time. Suppose there are 10?" "I won't destroy it for the 10."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As soon as he'd finished talking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham went back. The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</span>
