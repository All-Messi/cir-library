<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joseph couldn’t control himself in front of everybody that was standing there. He cried out, <em>“Everybody out!</em><em>”</em> Nobody was with him when he introduced himself to his brothers. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He cried so loud the Egyptians heard it, and Pharaoh’s household heard <em>about it</em>. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He told his brothers, <em>“I’m Joseph.</em><em> </em><em>Is my father still alive?”</em><em> </em> They were so overwhelmed by his presence they couldn’t answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then he said, <em>“Come closer.”</em><em> </em> <em>“I’m Joseph that you sold into Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> grieve</em><em> or</em><em> be</em><em> angry with yourselves</em><em>. </em><em>God sent me ahead of you to save you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> famine has been in the land for </em><em>two</em><em> years.</em><em> </em><em>There won’t be any plowing or harvesting</em><em> for five more years</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> sent me </em><em>ahead</em><em> to preserve you as a remnant </em><em>here</em><em> and keep you alive by a great </em><em>rescue</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>It</em><em> wasn’t so much you as God.</em><em> He’</em><em>s made me like a father to Pharaoh</em><em>, manager over</em><em> his household and ruler over Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Hurry</em><em> ba</em><em>ck and tell my father his son Joseph says, ‘</em><em>God has made me lord over Egypt.</em><em> </em><em>Come down to me</em><em> right away</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> live in t</em><em>he territory of Goshen near me—you, your children, grandchildren, flocks and herds, </em><em>everything you </em><em>own</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> </em><em>take care of</em><em> you there</em><em> </em><em>so your household and </em><em>possessions</em><em> won’t perish</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The famine’s going to last five more years</em><em>.</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>nd my brother Benjamin can see </em><em>I’m telling you this directly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> my father about my</em><em> splendor</em><em> in Egypt</em><em> and </em><em>everything</em><em> you’ve seen.</em><em> </em><em>Hurry and bring him down here.”</em></span>
