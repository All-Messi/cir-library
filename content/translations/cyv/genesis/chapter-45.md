## Genesis Chapter 45

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Joseph couldn't control himself in front of everybody that was standing there. He cried out, "Everybody out!" Nobody was with him when he introduced himself to his brothers. 2He cried so loud the Egyptians heard it, and Pharaoh's household heard about it. 3He told his brothers, "I'm Joseph. Is my father still alive?" They were so overwhelmed by his presence they couldn't answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then he said, "Come closer." "I'm Joseph that you sold into Egypt. 5Don't grieve or be angry with yourselves. God sent me ahead of you to save you. 6The famine has been in the land for two years. There won't be any plowing or harvesting for five more years. 7God sent me ahead to preserve you as a remnant here and keep you alive by a great rescue. 8It wasn't so much you as God. He's made me like a father to Pharaoh, manager over his household and ruler over Egypt. 9Hurry back and tell my father his son Joseph says, 'God has made me lord over Egypt. Come down to me right away. 10You'll live in the territory of Goshen near me—you, your children, grandchildren, flocks and herds, everything you own. 11I'll take care of you there so your household and possessions won't perish. The famine's going to last five more years.' 12You and my brother Benjamin can see I'm telling you this directly. 13Tell my father about my splendor in Egypt and everything you've seen. Hurry and bring him down here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then he embraced Benjamin and cried, and Benjamin cried and embraced Joseph. 15Joseph kissed his brothers and cried on them. Afterward they talked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> When Pharaoh's household heard that Joseph's brothers had come, they were happy. 17Pharaoh said, "Tell them to load their animals and go to Canaan, 18get their father and households, and come to me. I'll give them the best land in Egypt. They'll eat off the rich land. 19Have them take wagons for their wives and little ones, and bring their father. 20Tell them not to worry about their personal belongings; they'll have the best in Egypt.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Joseph gave them wagons and supplies for their trip. 22He gave each of them a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin 300 pieces of silver and 5 changes of clothes. 23He sent his father 10 donkeys loaded with the best things Egypt had to offer and 10 female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for his father's trip back. 24He sent them off, "Don't quarrel on the trip." 25They went up to Canaan 26and told their father, "Joseph's still alive! He's actually the ruler of Egypt!" He was stunned! He couldn't believe it! 27When they told him what Joseph had said and he saw the wagons he sent to take him back, he revived. 28"Joseph must still be alive! I'll go see him before I die."
