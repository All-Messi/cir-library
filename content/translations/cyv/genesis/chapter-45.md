## Genesis Chapter **45**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Joseph couldn’t control himself in front of everybody that was standing there. He cried out, <em>“Everybody out!</em><em>”</em> Nobody was with him when he introduced himself to his brothers. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He cried so loud the Egyptians heard it, and Pharaoh’s household heard <em>about it</em>. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He told his brothers, <em>“I’m Joseph.</em><em> </em><em>Is my father still alive?”</em><em> </em> They were so overwhelmed by his presence they couldn’t answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Then he said, <em>“Come closer.”</em><em> </em> <em>“I’m Joseph that you sold into Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Don’t</em><em> grieve</em><em> or</em><em> be</em><em> angry with yourselves</em><em>. </em><em>God sent me ahead of you to save you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> famine has been in the land for </em><em>two</em><em> years.</em><em> </em><em>There won’t be any plowing or harvesting</em><em> for five more years</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>God</em><em> sent me </em><em>ahead</em><em> to preserve you as a remnant </em><em>here</em><em> and keep you alive by a great </em><em>rescue</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>It</em><em> wasn’t so much you as God.</em><em> He’</em><em>s made me like a father to Pharaoh</em><em>, manager over</em><em> his household and ruler over Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Hurry</em><em> ba</em><em>ck and tell my father his son Joseph says, ‘</em><em>God has made me lord over Egypt.</em><em> </em><em>Come down to me</em><em> right away</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>You’ll</em><em> live in t</em><em>he territory of Goshen near me—you, your children, grandchildren, flocks and herds, </em><em>everything you </em><em>own</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> </em><em>take care of</em><em> you there</em><em> </em><em>so your household and </em><em>possessions</em><em> won’t perish</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The famine’s going to last five more years</em><em>.</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>nd my brother Benjamin can see </em><em>I’m telling you this directly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> my father about my</em><em> splendor</em><em> in Egypt</em><em> and </em><em>everything</em><em> you’ve seen.</em><em> </em><em>Hurry and bring him down here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Then he embraced Benjamin and cried, and Benjamin cried and embraced Joseph. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Joseph kissed his brothers and cried on them. Afterward they talked.</span>

### pieces of silver and 5 changes of clothes. 23He sent his father 10 donkeys loaded with the best things Egypt had to offer and 10 female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for his father’s trip back. 24He sent them off, “Don’t quarrel on the trip.” 25They went up to Canaan 26and told their father, “Joseph’s still alive! He’s actually the ruler of Egypt!” He was stunned! He couldn’t believe it! 27When they told him what Joseph had said and he saw the wagons he sent to take him back, he revived. 28“Joseph must still be alive! I’ll go see him before I die.” 	 Gen 45:21-28 Joseph Brings His Brothers to Egypt
