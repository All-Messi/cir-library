## Nahum Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Attackers are advancing to crush you, Nineveh. Man the ramparts, guard the road, muster your forces, get ready.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh is going to restore majesty to Jacob, splendor to Israel; because plunderers have stripped it and cut the branches off its grapevines.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The shields of the valiant flash red; the soldiers wear scarlet uniforms; the chariots glitter like steel as they muster into formation; they rattle their cypress spears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The chariots rush madly down the streets and race wildly around the squares. They shine like torches, dashing here and there like lightning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The king orders his officers; they scramble around in their haste and hurry to the wall to set up defenses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But their enemy tears open the gates of the river to undermine the palace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They strip it and loot it. Its young women moan like pigeons and beat their chests.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nineveh is like a leaking reservoir. "Stop! Stop! deserting residents!" but none of them even look back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! Treasure without limit, wealth of all kinds!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The city is desolate and in ruins! Hearts melt and knees knock! Loins throb in pain; faces turn pale!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Where's that lion's den now, that feeding place for young lions, where the lion brought its prey, where its cubs stayed unthreatened,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> where it tore off enough for its cubs and strangled prey for its lionesses? It filled its lair with prey, with mutilated meat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Yahveh of Hosts says, "I'm your enemy. I'll burn your chariots in smoke, kill your young lions with a sword, and leave you with no nations to prey on. Your ambassadors won't be bringing reports anymore." Woe to Nineveh</span>
