## Nahum Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Misfortune awaits bloody <em>Nineveh,</em> filled with lies and pillage and plunder without limit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><em>Do</em><em> you </em><em>hear</em><em> </em>the crack of whips, rattling wheels, galloping horses, rushing chariots!?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup><em>Do</em><em> you s</em><em>ee </em>cavalry charging, swords flashing, spears gleaming, many slain, piles of corpses, countless bodies, and people stumbling over them!?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>That’s</em><em> </em>all because of your continual prostitution, that charming mistress of sorceries; you sell nations by your prostitution, countries by your sorceries. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“I’m</em><em> </em><em>your enemy,</em><em>”</em> Yahveh of hosts says; <em>“I’ll pull your skirts u</em><em>p</em><em> over your face</em><em>s</em><em>,</em> <em>	and show the nations your nakedness</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>the kingdoms your disgrace.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> throw filth on you</em> <em>	make you </em><em>disgusting</em><em>,</em> <em>	make</em><em> a spectacle</em><em> out of you!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>Everybody</em><em> that sees you will </em><em>back </em><em>away </em><em>and </em><em>say,</em> <em>	‘Nineveh lies in </em><em>ruins</em><em>!</em> <em>	Who’s going to grieve over</em><em> her?’</em> <em>	Where </em><em>will her</em><em> comforters </em><em>come from</em><em>?”</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Nah 3:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Are you any better than Thebes that sat by the Nile with water all around it, with the river as its wall and rampart?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Nubia was its strength, Egypt too, with no limit; Put and the Libyans allied with it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Yet <em>Thebes</em> was carried away into captivity. Its little ones were dashed to pieces at the head of every street; they cast lots for its honorable men and tied up its leaders with chains.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Nah 3:8-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>You’ll get drunk too, <em>Nineveh, </em>go into a stupor, and look for refuge from your enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit; if you shake them, their figs fall into your mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Your <em>troops</em> are women! Your gates stand wide open for your enemies; fires consume your bars.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Nah 3:11-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Draw water for your siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Get in the clay pits to tread mortar! Put it in brick molds!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>But fire will burn you up; the sword will cut you down and eat you up like locusts. Though <u>you</u> have multiplied like crawling locusts and propagated like grasshoppers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>though your traders have come to outnumber the stars— nevertheless, like crawling locusts <em>your enemy </em>will strip your land and fly away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Though <u>your</u> guards are also like grasshoppers and your marshals resemble locust swarms settling in stone walls on a cold day, when the sun comes up, they fly away, nobody knows where.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Nah 3:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria; your nobles lie dead on the ground. Your people have scattered to the mountains, and there’s nobody to round them up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>There’s no relief for your injury; your wound won’t heal. Everybody that hears about your destruction claps their hands. Who hasn’t come under your endless cruelty?	<strong>Nah </strong><strong>3:15b-19</strong> Version by Virgil Warren: christir.org</span>
