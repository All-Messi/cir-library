## Nahum Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Misfortune awaits bloody Nineveh, filled with lies and pillage and plunder without limit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Do you hear the crack of whips, rattling wheels, galloping horses, rushing chariots!?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Do you see cavalry charging, swords flashing, spears gleaming, many slain, piles of corpses, countless bodies, and people stumbling over them!?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> That's all because of your continual prostitution, that charming mistress of sorceries; you sell nations by your prostitution, countries by your sorceries. 5"I'm your enemy," Yahveh of hosts says; "I'll pull your skirts up over your faces, and show the nations your nakedness, the kingdoms your disgrace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'll throw filth on you make you disgusting, make a spectacle out of you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Everybody that sees you will back away and say, 'Nineveh lies in ruins! Who's going to grieve over her?' Where will her comforters come from?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Are you any better than Thebes that sat by the Nile with water all around it, with the river as its wall and rampart?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Nubia was its strength, Egypt too, with no limit; Put and the Libyans allied with it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Yet Thebes was carried away into captivity. Its little ones were dashed to pieces at the head of every street; they cast lots for its honorable men and tied up its leaders with chains.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You'll get drunk too, Nineveh, go into a stupor, and look for refuge from your enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit; if you shake them, their figs fall into your mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Your troops are women! Your gates stand wide open for your enemies; fires consume your bars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Draw water for your siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Get in the clay pits to tread mortar! Put it in brick molds!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But fire will burn you up; the sword will cut you down and eat you up like locusts. Though you have multiplied like crawling locusts and propagated like grasshoppers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> though your traders have come to outnumber the stars— nevertheless, like crawling locusts your enemy will strip your land and fly away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Though your guards are also like grasshoppers and your marshals resemble locust swarms settling in stone walls on a cold day, when the sun comes up, they fly away, nobody knows where.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria; your nobles lie dead on the ground. Your people have scattered to the mountains, and there's nobody to round them up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> There's no relief for your injury; your wound won't heal. Everybody that hears about your destruction claps their hands. Who hasn't come under your endless cruelty?	Nah 3:15b-19</span>
