## Ezekiel Chapter 46

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Lord Yahveh says, "The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. 2The prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He'll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won't be shut till that evening. 3The people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before Yahveh on Sabbaths and new moons. 4The prince's burnt offering on the Sabbath will be 6 lambs and 1 ram without blemish. 5The grain offering will be 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah.  6On the new moon, he'll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. 7He'll provide a grain offering 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil for each 4½ pecks bushels 1 ephah. 8The prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way. 9"When the people present themselves to Yahveh at the stated festivals, the one that goes in through the north gate to worship will leave through the south gate. The one that goes in through the south gate will leave through the north gate. Nobody will leave through the same gate they entered. 10When they go in, the prince will go in with them; when they go out, he'll go out. 11At the feasts and stated festivals, the grain offering will be 4½ pecks 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and with the lambs as much as a person can give, together with 1½ gallons   1 hin of oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 12When the prince provides a freewill offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He'll provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he'll go out, and the gate will be shut behind him. 13"Each morning, provide a year-old lamb without blemish for a burnt offering to Yahveh. 14Provide a grain offering with it, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah and ½ gallon ⅓ hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to Yahveh continually by ongoing ordinance. 15So a lamb and a grain offering with the olive oil will be provided every morning. 16'The Lord Yahveh says, "If the prince gives a son a gift out of his inheritance, it will be a permanent possession. 17But if he gives a servant a gift from his inheritance, it will go back to the prince at the Year of Jubilee. His inheritance will belong only to his sons. 18The prince won't confiscate people's inheritance or chase them off their land. He'll give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so my people won't be separated from their possessions."'"</span>

There was a place at the far back toward the west. 20He said, "This is where the priests will boil the guilt offerings and sin offerings, and bake the grain offering so they won't bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people." 21Then he took me to the four corners of the outer court. There was a small court in each corner, 22four enclosed corner courts, all the same size—69' x 51' 8" 40 x 30 cubits. 23There was a row of masonry around them, and boiling places were made under the rows all the way around. 24He told me, "These places are where the ministers of the Temple will boil the nations' sacrifices."
