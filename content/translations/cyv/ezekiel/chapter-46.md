## Ezekiel Chapter 46

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>‘The</em><em> Lord </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> says,</em><em> “The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He’ll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won’t be shut till that evening. </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before Yahveh on Sabbaths and new moons. </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince’s burnt offering on the Sabbath will be 6 lambs and 1 ram without blemish. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> grain offering will be 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> </em><em>with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons </em><em><sup>1</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>hin</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>of oil with each 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em>.  </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>On</em><em> the new moon, he’ll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He’ll</em><em> provide a grain offering 4½ pecks </em><em><sup>1</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em> with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons </em><em><sup>1</sup></em><em> </em><em><sup>hin</sup></em><em> of olive oil for each 4½ pecks bushels </em><em><sup>1 </sup></em><em><sup>ephah</sup></em><em>. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way. </em></span>

He’ll provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he’ll go out, and the gate will be shut behind him.</span>
