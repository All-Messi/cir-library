### 8“Adjoining Judah from east to west will be the allotment set aside from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits wide and equal to one of the portions. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it. 9-10The allotment set aside to Yahveh will be 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits, running east and west. The allotment will be for the priests 11that are sanctified from the descendants of Zadok, who kept my charge and didn’t go astray when Israel went astray—like the Levites did. 12It will be an allotment to them from the land, a most holy place beside the Levites’ portion. 13Alongside the boundary of the priests, the Levites will have a portion 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits. 14They won’t sell or temporarily exchange any of it or pass the first part of its harvest to anyone else, because it’s holy to Yahveh.      				Ezek 48:8-14 15“The remainder, 1.63 x 8.2 miles 5,000 x 25,000 cubits, will be for common use by the city, for houses and open spaces. The city will lie in the middle of it. 16It will be square, measuring 1.47 miles on a side. 17The city will have an open space 430' 7" 250 cubits wide all the way around it. 18The rest of the length alongside the holy allotment will be 3¼ miles 10,000 cubits wide running east and west. Its crops and produce will feed the workmen in the city. 19The workmen in the city—from all the tribes—will cultivate it. 20The whole allotment will be 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits square. Set it aside with the city’s property. 21“What’s left on both sides of the holy portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince, extending from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits parallel to the holy portion. The holy portion with the Temple in the middle, 22the property of the Levites, and the property of the city will be inside the prince’s portion, which will lie between Judah and Benjamin. 	Ezek 48:15-22 23“For the rest of the tribes from east to west: Benjamin, one portion; 24then Simeon, one portion; 25then Issachar, one portion; 26then Zebulun, one portion; 27then Gad, one portion. 28Joining Gad at the south side, the boundary will be from Tamar to the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. 29That’s the land you’ll divide by lot to the tribes of Israel,”  				the Lord Yahveh says. 	Ezek 48:23-29 The Gates of the City 30“The city, which is 1¼ mile on a side, 31will have gates that bear the names of the tribes: three gates on the north side: Reuben, Judah, and Levi;
