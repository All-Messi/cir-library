## Ezekiel Chapter 42

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me north to the outer court, to the rooms across from the Temple yard and the north building. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The length of the building on the north side was 172' 5" x 86' 3" <sup>50 x 100 cubits</sup>. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Beside the 34' 6" <sup>20 cubits</sup> that belonged to the inner court and facing the pavement of the outer court, there was a three-story gallery. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>In front of its rooms was an inner walkway 17' 3" wide x 172' 5" long <sup>10 x </sup><sup>100</sup><sup>l</sup><sup>cubits</sup> with doorways on the north. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The upper rooms were narrower, because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle floors of the building. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The rooms had three stories and didn’t have any pillars like the pillars in the courts. So the upper rooms were set back more than the lower two levels. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The outer wall beside the rooms toward the court was 86' 3" <sup>50 cubits</sup><sup> </sup>long. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The rooms in the outer court were 86' 3" <sup>50 cubits</sup><sup> </sup>long. The rooms facing the Temple were 172' 5" <sup>100 cubits</sup> long. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Below those rooms, was the east entrance as you enter them from the outer court, where the outside wall begins.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Ezek 42:1-9</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> On the east across from the yard and the building there were rooms <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>with a passage in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and with the same exits, arrangements, and doors. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Below the south rooms, there was an entrance on the east side—where a person goes into the passage—and across from them there was a dividing wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then he told me, <em>“The north and south </em><em>room</em><em>s, across from the separate area, are holy </em><em>room</em><em>s where the priests that are near </em><em>Yahveh are to</em><em> eat the most holy things.</em><em> They’</em><em>ll lay the most holy things there—the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering; because the place is holy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> the priests go in, they’re not to go out to the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there the holy vestments that they minister in. </em><em>They’ll put on other clothes so they can go to the parts of the building that’s open to the public.”   </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When he’d finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out through the east gate, and measured all the way around the Temple: <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>5170' <sup>500 reeds</sup> on the east, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>north, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>south, and <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>west sides. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The Temple had a wall all the way around it, 5170' <sup>500</sup> <sup>reeds</sup> long in both directions, to separate the holy from the common.<strong>	 </strong><strong>Ezek 42:10-20</strong> <strong>Yahveh</strong><strong>’s Glory Returns to the Temple</strong></span>
