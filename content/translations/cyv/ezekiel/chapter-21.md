## Ezekiel Chapter 21

### Babylon, God’s Sword of Judgment

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> <em>“Son</em><em> of man, face Jerusalem. Speak against </em>its<em> sanctuaries and prophesy against Israel, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>‘Yahveh</em><em> says, “I’ll draw my sword and slay the good and the bad in you, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>everybody</em><em> from south to north. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Everyone</em><em> will know I’ve drawn it, and it won’t go back into its sheath.”’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>“Son</em><em> of man, moan with breaking heart and bitter grief. </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> they ask why you’re moaning, say, ‘Over the news that’s coming. Hearts will melt, hands will go limp, spirits will faint, knees will be as weak as water.’”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 21:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Again, a message from Yahveh came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>“Son</em><em> of man, p</em><em>rophesy, </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>‘A sword, a sword,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	sharpened and polished!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>sharpened</em><em> for slaughter,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	polished to flash like lightning!</em> <em>Or should we be happy? Son, you’ve despised the rod and everything wood. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> sword is sharpened and polished for the executioner. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Cry</em><em> out and wail, son of man. </em><em>It’s</em><em> against my people and their officials. They’ve been delivered to the sword, so strike your thigh. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>It</em><em> won’t be for disciplining. What good would that do if you despise the rod?</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 21:8-13</p>

### 14‘So prophesy, son of man. Clap your hands; bring the sword down twice, three times on the slain, for the great slaughter on everyone around. 15Their hearts will melt and many will fall at their gates. I’ve provided the glittering sword, made for striking like lightning, wrapped and ready for slaughter, 16to cut sharp wherever it’s aimed. 17I’ll clap my hands and vent my fury. I’ve said so.’” 	    	 				Ezek 21:14-17

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“Son</em><em> of man,</em><em> mark two roads for the king of Babylon to take that fork off from the same land. Put up a sign at the beginning of the road to </em>each<em> city. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Mark</em><em> a way for the sword to come to Rabbah in Ammon and Jerusalem in Judah. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> king of Babylon is standing at the fork in the road ready to use fortunetelling, to shake arrows, to consult household idols, to inspect the liver. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> lot for Jerusalem</em><em> </em><em>comes into his right hand, to set up battering rams against </em>its<em> gates, to lift up the battle cry for slaughter, to build mounds and a siege wall. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>It</em><em> will seem to them like false fortunetelling; they’ve sworn solemn oaths. But he’s remembering </em>their<em> sin; so he’ll seize them.</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>“So</em><em> the Lord Yahveh says, ‘Because you’ve made your sin memorable and your transgressions evident in everything you do, they’ll take you. </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> slain sinful, prince of Israel, whose time has come for final punishment, </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>take</em><em> off your turban, remove your crown.

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> <em>“So</em><em> prophesy, son of man, ‘The Lord Yahveh says about the Ammonites and their disgrace: ‘a sword drawn, polished to slaughter like lightning—</em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>while</em><em> they see false visions for you, while they tell you lying fortunes—to place </em>that sword<em> on the necks of the sinful slain at their time of final punishment. </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Put</em><em> it back in its sheath.

You’ll be forgotten. I’ve said so.’”</span>
