## Ezekiel Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, face Jerusalem. Speak against its sanctuaries and prophesy against Israel, 3'Yahveh says, "I'll draw my sword and slay the good and the bad in you, 4everybody from south to north. 5Everyone will know I've drawn it, and it won't go back into its sheath."' 6"Son of man, moan with breaking heart and bitter grief. 7When they ask why you're moaning, say, 'Over the news that's coming. Hearts will melt, hands will go limp, spirits will faint, knees will be as weak as water.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Again, a message from Yahveh came to me: 9"Son of man, prophesy, 'A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Or should we be happy? Son, you've despised the rod and everything wood. 11A sword is sharpened and polished for the executioner. 12Cry out and wail, son of man. It's against my people and their officials. They've been delivered to the sword, so strike your thigh. 13It won't be for disciplining. What good would that do if you despise the rod? 14'So prophesy, son of man. Clap your hands; bring the sword down twice, three times on the slain, for the great slaughter on everyone around. 15Their hearts will melt and many will fall at their gates. I've provided the glittering sword, made for striking like lightning, wrapped and ready for slaughter, 16to cut sharp wherever it's aimed. 17I'll clap my hands and vent my fury. I've said so.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 19"Son of man, mark two roads for the king of Babylon to take that fork off from the same land. Put up a sign at the beginning of the road to each city. 20Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah in Ammon and Jerusalem in Judah. 21The king of Babylon is standing at the fork in the road ready to use fortunetelling, to shake arrows, to consult household idols, to inspect the liver. 22The lot for Jerusalem comes into his right hand, to set up battering rams against its gates, to lift up the battle cry for slaughter, to build mounds and a siege wall. 23It will seem to them like false fortunetelling; they've sworn solemn oaths. But he's remembering their sin; so he'll seize them. 24"So the Lord Yahveh says, 'Because you've made your sin memorable and your transgressions evident in everything you do, they'll take you. 25You slain sinful, prince of Israel, whose time has come for final punishment, 26take off your turban, remove your crown. Things are going to be different. Raise up what's low, abase what's high. 27I'll make it a ruin. There won't be any trace of it till the one comes that I've given the right to have it.' 28"So prophesy, son of man, 'The Lord Yahveh says about the Ammonites and their disgrace: 'a sword drawn, polished to slaughter like lightning—29while they see false visions for you, while they tell you lying fortunes—to place that sword on the necks of the sinful slain at their time of final punishment. 30Put it back in its sheath. I'll condemn you where you originated. 31I'll pour out my indignation on you, blow fire on you out of my anger, and turn you over to brutal men that know how to destroy. 32You'll be fuel for the fire; your blood will be spilled in your own land. You'll be forgotten. I've said so.'" Israel's Sins</span>
