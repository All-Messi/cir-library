## Ezekiel Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, prophesy against Israel's prophets who prophesy their own ideas, 3'The Lord Yahveh says, "Misfortune awaits foolish prophets that follow their own imagination and haven't seen anything. 4Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins. 5You haven't gone up into the breaches or built the wall around the House of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of Yahveh. 6They see falsehood and lying fortunetelling who say, 'Yahveh says,' when heY hasn't sent them. They're just hoping their message will be what happens. 7Didn't you see a false vision and say a lying fortunetelling when you said, 'Yahveh says'? I'm not the one that spoke."'" 8"So because you've lied, 9I'm against the prophets that see false visions and say lying fortunetelling. You won't be in the council of my people, be recorded in the registry of Israel, or go to the land of Israel. You'll know I'm the Lord Yahveh. 10That's because you've misled my people by saying, 'Peace!' when there isn't any. When somebody builds a wall, he daubs it with whitewash. 11Tell him it will fall. A downpour will come, hailstones will fall, violent wind will blow. 12When it falls, won't they ask you where the plaster is you daubed on it?'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So the Lord Yahveh says, "In my anger I'll make a violent wind break out with hailstones and a downpour to bring down that wall. 14What you daubed with whitewash I'll bring down till its foundation shows. When it falls, it will bring you down with it. You'll know I'm Yahveh. 15I'll spend my anger on the wall and the ones that whitewashed it. I'll tell you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers too, 16along with the prophets in Jerusalem that see visions of peace for it when there isn't any.' 17"Now, son of man, set your face against your people that are prophesying from their own imagination. Prophesy against them, 18'Misfortune awaits women that sew magic bands on everybody's wrists and make every size of veil for the people's heads to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down my people, but preserve others for yourselves? 19For handfuls of barley and scraps of bread, you've profaned me to my people, killing some who shouldn't die and protecting others that shouldn't live. You've done it by lying to my people.' 20"I'm against the magic bands you use to hunt lives like birds. I'll tear them off your arms and let go the ones you hunt like birds. 21I'll tear off your veils and deliver my people from you. They won't be in your hands to be hunted. 22Since you disheartened good people with falsehood when I didn't cause them grief, since you've encouraged the wicked not to turn from their sins and have kept them alive, 23your women won't see false visions anymore or practice fortunetelling. I'll deliver my people from you. That's how you'll know I'm Yahveh." Israel's Idolatrous Leaders Condemned</span>
