## Ezekiel Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Eat this scroll and go speak to Israel." 2So I opened my mouth, and he fed it to me. 3It tasted sweet like honey.	   Ezek 2:8-3:3 [4] 5-6"I'm not sending you to people that speak a hard foreign language you can't understand. I'm sending you to people that should listen; 7but they won't listen to you, because they won't listen to me. The whole house is stubborn. 8I've made your face and forehead as hard as theirs, 9like corundum, harder than flint. So don't be afraid of them or be intimidated by them though they're rebellious people. 10Listen closely and take everything to heart that I tell you. 11Go to your people in exile and tell them, 'The Lord Yahveh says,' whether they listen or not."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The Spirit picked me up, and I heard a loud rumbling behind me, "Bless Yahveh in his place." 13I was hearing the wings of the living beings that touched one another and had the wheels beside them. 14The Spirit took me away; I felt bitter and angry, and Yahveh's hand weighed heavy on me. 15I went to the exiles by the Chebar River at Tel-abib and sat there with them for a week, feeling overwhelmed.

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> A week later a message came from Yahveh: 17"Son of man, I've appointed you to be a watchman for Israel. Whenever you hear something from me, warn them. 18When I tell sinful people they're going to die, and you don't warn them so they can live, they'll die in their sin, but I'll hold you responsible for it. 19If you've warned them, and they don't change, they'll die in their sin, but you've delivered yourself. 20On the other hand, when good people start sinning and I block them, they'll die. Since you didn't warn them, they'll die in their sin. I won't consider the good they'd done, but I'll hold you responsible for their death. 21But if you've warned them and they quit sinning, they'll live because they listened, and you'll deliver yourself."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh put hand on me there ad said, "Get up and go out to the plain, and I'll talk to you." 23The glory of Yahveh was there, glory like I'd seen by the Chebar River; I fell on my face. 24The Spirit came into me and stood me up, and said, "Go shut yourself up in your house. 25They'll tie you up with ropes so you can't go out among them. 26I'll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you can't talk. You won't be able to rebuke them because they're a rebellious house. 27But when I speak to you and you tell them, 'The Lord Yahveh says,' the ones that listen will listen; the ones that won't, won't. They're a rebellious house. Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized</span>
