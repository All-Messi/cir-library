## Ezekiel Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sing this funeral song for Israel's officials: 2'What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions; she raised her cubs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When she brought up one of her cubs, he became a young lion, learned to catch prey, and devoured people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then nations heard about him. They captured him in their pit, and brought him with hooks to Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> As time went on, she saw that her hope was lost, and took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He walked around among the lions. He became a young lion learned to catch prey, and devoured people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He destroyed their fortresses and laid waste their towns; everybody in the were terrified at his roaring.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then nations attacked him on every side from their provinces. They threw their net over him, and captured him in their pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> With hooks they put him in a cage, and took him to the king of Babylon. They took him in hunting nets so people could hear him anymore on the mountains in Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted near water. It was fruitful and lots of branches because it had plenty of water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Its strong stems became rulers' scepters. It was taller than the clouds, so it could be seen with its mass of branches.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But it was plucked up in fury and dashed to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. and tore off and withered its strong branches. Fire burned it up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now it stands in the wilderness, in a dry, thirsty land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The fire that broke out in its branches and burned up its fruit didn't leave any branch strong enough to be a ruler's scepter.'" A Dirge Israel's Rebellion</span>
