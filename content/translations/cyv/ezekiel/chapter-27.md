## Ezekiel Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre 3that sits at the port to the sea, the nations' merchant to many ports, The Lord Yahveh says, 'Tyre, you've said "I'm perfectly beautiful."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Your borders extend into the heart of the sea; your builders have perfected your beauty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They've made your planks out of fir trees from Seir; they've taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They shaped your oars out of oaks from Bashan; with ivory they've inlaid your deck with boxwood from the coasts of Cyprus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Your sail was made out of fine embroidered linen from Egypt; it became your identifying mark. Your awning was blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The residents of Sidon and Arvad rowed for you; your wise men, Tyre, were on board as your navigators.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The elders of Gebal and its skilled men caulked your seams. All the ships in the sea and their sailors were with you, dealing in your merchandise.' 10"Persia, Lud, and Put were soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls and set forth your splendor. 11Men from Arvad and your army stood all around on your walls, and brave soldiers were in your towers. Their shields hung on your walls and completed your beauty. 12"Tarshish was your customer because you had such a store of all kinds of wealth; they bought your merchandise with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they bought your merchandise with men's lives and bronze containers. 14Beth-togarmah gave horses, war horses, and mules for your wares. 15Dedan traded with you. Distant lands served as your markets; they paid with ivory tusks and ebony. 16Syria was your customer because you had an abundance of goods; they bought your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 17Judah and Israel traded with you; they bought your merchandise with wheat from Minnith, cakes, honey, olive oil, and salve. 18Damascus was your customer because you had an abundance of goods, an abundance of all kinds of wealth, and because of the wine from Helbon and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan paid for your casks of wine from Izal with wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane. 20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 21Arabia and the princes of Kedar traded with you; 22they paid with gold, precious stones, and the finest spices. 23Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you 24for choice garments, clothes made out of blue and embroidered work, carpets of many colors and in tightly wound cords.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The ships of Tarshish carried your wares. You were full and quite magnificent in the heart of the seas. 26"Your rowers have taken you onto stormy high seas; the east wind has capsized you in the middle of the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Your wealth, your wares and your merchandise, your sailors and captains, ship builders and merchants, all the soldiers and everyone on board— sink into the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> At the outcry of your terrified captains, the countryside shakes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The ones that row, the captains of the sea, abandon ship and stand on shore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They wail over you and cry bitterly. They throw dust on their heads and wallow in ashes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> They shave their heads for you and put on burlap. They weep bitterly for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> As they wail, they take up a funeral song for you: 'Who is like Tyre that's silent at the bottom of the sea?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> When your wares came from the sea, you satisfied many nations. With your great wealth and merchandise, you enriched the kings everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Now the sea has wrecked you in open water; your merchandise and your crew have sunk with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The people that live along the coasts are appalled at what's happened to you. Their kings are horribly afraid; their countenance has fallen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The merchants among the nations gasp at you; you've come to a horrible end and won't exist anymore.'" A Message for Tyre's King</span>
