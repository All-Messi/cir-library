## Ezekiel Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me again: 2"Son of man, prophesy, 'The Lord Yahveh says, "Wail, 'Oh for the day!'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The day of Yahveh is near, a cloudy day of doom for the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> A sword will come at Egypt; there'll be anguish in Nubia when the slain fall in Egypt. They'll carry away its wealth and tear up its foundations.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Nubia, Put, Lud, Arabia, Libya, and the people of any land allied with them will fall by the sword with them. 6'Yahveh says: "Those who support Egypt will fall; its proud power will collapse. From Migdol to Syene they'll fall by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They'll be desolate among desolate lands; its cities will desolate among devastated cities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll know I'm Yahveh when I set Egypt on fire and break down its helpers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> At that time, I'll send messengers in ships to terrify secure Nubia; anguish will come down on them as at Egypt's doom. It's coming!" 10'The Lord Yahveh says, "By Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, I'll put an end to Egypt's wealth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Him and his people, the most ruthless of the nations, I'll bring in to destroy the land. They'll draw their swords against it, and fill the country with the slain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'll dry up the Nile's canals, and sell the land to evil men. I'll use foreigners to make the land desolate and everything that's in it, I Yahveh have said it." 13'The Lord Yahveh says, "I'll destroy the idols and make images cease in Memphis. There won't be a prince in Egypt anymore; I'll put fear in Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I'll make Pathros desolate; I'll set fire to Zoan, and carry out judgment on Thebes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I'll pour out my anger on Sin, Egypt's fortress; I'll slay the population in Thebes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I'll set Egypt on fire. Sin will writhe in anguish; Thebes will be breached; Memphis will endure daily distress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The young men of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword; the women will go into captivity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> It will be a dark day in Tehaphnehes when I break the yoke bars of Egypt there. The pride in its power will be gone; a cloud will cover it, and Egypt's inhabitants will go into captivity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So I'll carry out judgments on Egypt, and they'll know I'm Yahveh."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The seventh day, first month, eleventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me: 21"Son of man, I've broken the arm of Pharaoh, Egypt's king. It hasn't been put in a sling to mend or wrapped with a bandage to get strong enough to hold a sword.' 22So the Lord Yahveh says, 'I'll break both of his arms, the good arm and the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand. 23I'll scatter the Egyptians among the nations. 24I'll strengthen the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. Pharaoh will groan from his wounds. 25I'll strengthen the king of Babylon's arms, but Pharaoh's arms will fall. When the king of Babylon holds out his sword against Egypt 26and I scatter the Egyptians among the nations, they'll know I'm Yahveh.'" A Cedar in Lebanon</span>
