## Ezekiel Chapter 37

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh's hand was on me. He took me out in spirit and put me down in a valley full of dry bones, 2and had me walk around among them. 3"Son of man, can these bones come alive?" "Lord Yahveh, you know." 4"Prophesy over them, 'Dry bones, listen to Yahveh. 5I'll put breath in you so you can come to life. 6I'll put sinews on you, make flesh grow back, and cover you with skin. You'll know I'm Yahveh.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As I prophesied, there was a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8I saw sinews on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but they weren't breathing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told me to prophesy to their breath, "The Lord Yahveh says to come from the four winds and breathe on these slain so they can come to life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So I prophesied. Breath came into them, they came to life, and stood up, a big army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then he said, "Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They're saying, 'Our bones are dried up. Our hope is gone. We're completely cut off.' 12So prophesy that the Lord Yahveh says, 'I'll open your graves and resurrect you, and take you to Israel. 13You'll know I'm Yahveh when 14I've put my breath in you, you've come to life, and I've put you in your own land.'" Reunion of Israel and Judah</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me again: 16"Son of man, take a stick and write on it, 'For Judah and the people of Israel, his companions.' Take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and the House of Israel, his companions.' 17Then put them together in your hand to become one stick. 18When your people ask you what these sticks mean, 19say that the Lord Yahveh says, 'I'll take Joseph's stick—which is in Ephraim's hand—and the tribes of Israel, his companions, and put them with Judah's stick to make one stick in my hand.' 20The sticks you write on they'll see in your hand. 21Tell them the Lord Yahveh says he'll gather the people of Israel from among the nations where they've gone and bring them to their own land. 22He'll make them one nation under one king. 23They won't defile themselves with idols, detestable things, or any of their sins. He'll deliver them from the places where they live, where they've sinned, and cleanse them. They'll be his people, and he'll be their God." 24-25"My servant David will be their king, their one shepherd forever. They'll follow my ordinances and keep my statutes. They and their descendants will live permanently on the land I gave Jacob, where your ancestors lived. 26I'll make an everlasting peace treaty with them, bless and multiply them, set my sanctuary among them, 27live with them, and be their God; and they'll be my people. 28The nations will know I'm Yahveh who sanctifies Israel when my sanctuary is with them forever."'"
