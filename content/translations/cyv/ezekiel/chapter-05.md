## Ezekiel Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Son of man, take a sharp sword and shave off your hair and beard. Divide up the hair on a scales. 2Burn a third of it in the center of the city when the siege is over. Strike a third of it with a sword all around the city. Scatter another third of it in the wind, because I'm going to chase my people with a drawn sword. 3Attach a few to the hem of your robe. 4Throw a few in the fire. They'll spread from the fire to the whole House of Israel.  5I've set Jerusalem in the center of the nations. 6It rebelled against my ordinances and statutes more than those other nations did."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So the Lord Yahveh says, "I'm against you; there's more turmoil in you than in the nations around you. You haven't followed my statutes or observed my ordinances or even [LXX] the ordinances of surrounding nations. 8I'll carry out judgments on you for the nations to see. 9Because of your detestable deeds, I'll do to you what I've never done before or will ever do again. 10Fathers will eat their own sons and sons will eat their fathers. My condemnations will scatter your remnant in every direction. 11As I live, I'll withdraw from you because you've defiled my sanctuary with your detestable idols and graven images. I won't pity or spare. 12A third of you will die by disease and starvation, a third will fall by the sword, a third I'll scatter in every direction from a drawn sword. 13"That's how I'll vent my fury on you. You'll know I've said so. 14I'll make a wasteland out of you among the nations, something everyone that passes by will consider a disgrace, 15a taunt, a warning, something they'll abhor when I carry out condemnations on you in anger and rebuke. 16When I send you the deadly arrows of famine meant for your foes, I'll intensify it to break your staff of bread. 17Wiild animals will bereave you of your children. Disease, sword, and bloodshed will surge through you. I've said so." A Prophecy Against the Mountains of Israel</span>
