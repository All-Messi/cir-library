## Ezekiel Chapter **29**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><strong>The</strong><strong> twelfth day, tenth month, tenth year</strong>, a message from Yahveh came to me: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, turn toward Pharao</em><em>h,</em><em> Egypt</em><em>’s king</em><em>, and prophesy against him and Egypt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>’The</em><em> Lord Yahveh says, </em> <em> “I’m against you, Pharaoh Egypt’s king,</em> <em>	the big crocodile that lies in your streams,</em> <em>	that has said, ‘My Nile belongs to me; I made it.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> put hooks in your jaws,</em> <em>	and make the fish in your streams stick to your scales.</em> <em>I’ll drag you out on your shore</em> <em>	with fish clinging to your scales.</em><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 29:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> abandon you to the wilderness,</em> <em>	you and the fish in your streams.</em> <em>You’ll fall in the open field,</em> <em>	and not be buried.</em> <em>I’ll make you food for scavengers on the ground</em> <em>	and buzzards in the sky.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>Then</em><em> you residents in </em><em><u>Egypt will know I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em>, </em> <em>	because to Israel you’ve been only a staff made out of reeds.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>When</em><em> he took hold of you,</em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>you cut his hands;</em> <em>when he leaned on you,</em> <em>	you broke and his loins buckled.</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 29:5-7</p>

### 8’So the Lord Yahveh says, “I’m going to bring a sword on you, and slay people and animals. 9Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, I made it,’ 10I’m against you and your streams. Egypt will become a wasteland from Migdol to Syene to the border of Nubia. 11People and animals won’t travel through it; nobody will live there for 40 years. 12So I’ll make Egypt desolate among desolate lands and its cities desolate among desolate cities for 40 years. I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations.  13‘The Lord Yahveh says, “After 40 years, I’ll gather the Egyptians back from where they’ve scattered. 14I’ll return their fortunes and make them go back to the land of Pathros and become a minor kingdom there. 15Egypt will be low among the kingdoms and never again raise itself above them. I’ll make it too small for that. 16Israel will never rely on it again. They’ll be reminded of their sin in going back to Egypt. They’ll know I’m the Lord Yahveh.’” 	Ezek 29:8-16


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>The <strong>first day, first month, twenty-seventh year</strong>, a message from Yahveh came to me: <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, Nebuchadnezzar</em><em>,</em><em> king of Babylon</em><em>,</em><em> made his army </em><em>struggle</em><em> hard against Tyre.</em><em> </em><em>Every head </em><em>became</em><em> bald, and every shoulder was rubbed </em><em>raw</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>But he and his army didn’t get </em><em>enough</em><em> from Tyre to pay for </em><em>the</em><em> </em><em>struggle</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> I’ll give him Egypt so he can carry off its wealth, capture its spoil, and seize its plunder to pay his army. </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em><em> given him Egypt for his struggle because he acted on my behalf. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>At</em><em> that time, I’ll make a horn sprout for Israel and open your mouth among them. </em><em><u>They’ll know I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong></span>
