## Ezekiel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The <strong>fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year</strong>, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The <strong>fifth</strong> <strong>month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile</strong>, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and four figures like living beings with human forms. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Each one had four faces and four wings. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>There were hands under their wings, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The living beings darted back forth like bolts of lightning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A wheel appeared on the ground beside each living being. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The wheels looked like glowing chrysolite built with a wheel inside a wheel. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When they moved in any of the four directions, they moved without turning. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Their rims were tall with eyes all the way around.            <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When the living beings left the ground or moved, the wheels moved with them. The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. [<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A bright expanse glowed like crystal above them. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Under it their wings stretched out toward one another, and two wings covered the sides of their bodies. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Their wings sounded like rushing water, like the Almighty, like war, like an army camp. When they stood still, they lowered their wings, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and a voice spoke from the expanse above them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> High above the expanse was a throne the color of lapis lazuli; the One sitting on it resembled a man. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>From the waist up, he glowed like metal on fire; from the waist down, he resembled fire. The radiance around him was <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>like a rainbow on a rainy day. This scene looked like the glory of Yahveh. When I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice,<strong></span>
