## Ezekiel Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, how does the wood in a grapevine compare to the wood in a tree limb? 3Can you make anything out of grapevine wood, say, a peg to hang a bucket on? 4If it's been put in the fire for fuel, is burned on both ends and charred in the middle, can you make anything out of it? 5If it's intact and you can't make it into anything, how much less when fire has burned and charred it." 6So the Lord Yahveh says, "Like grapevine wood that I've put in the fire for fuel, I've given up the people in Jerusalem. 7Though they've come out of the fire, it's charred them. You'll know I'm Yahveh when I set myself against them. 8I'll make the country desolate because they've been unfaithful." Jerusalem, an Unfaithful Wife</span>
