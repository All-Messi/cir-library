## Ezekiel Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> So, prostitute, listen to what Yahveh says, <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>“Because</em><em> your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your </em><em>prostitution</em><em> with your lovers and your detestable idols, and because of your sons’ blood that you gave to idols, </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> gather </em><em>the</em><em> lovers you</em><em> had pleasure with, the ones both</em><em> loved and hated.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>That’s</em><em> how I’ll judge you—like women that commit adultery or shed blood. I’ll bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> deliver you to your lovers. They’ll tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip off your clothes, steal your jewels, and leave you naked. </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> stir up a mob against you, stone you, and cut you to pieces with swords. </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Many</em><em> women will watch me burn your houses and carry out judgments on you. I’ll make you quit being a prostitute. You won’t be paying your lovers anymore. </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> calm my fury </em><em>against you. My jealousy will leave you, and I’ll be at peace. </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>Since</em><em> you’ve forgotten your youth and angered me with those things, I’ll bring your deeds down on your own head. So you won’t continue to commit that lewdness in addition to your other disgusting deeds.</em><strong> </strong><strong></span>
