## Ezekiel Chapter **32**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The <strong>first day, twelfth month, twelfth year</strong>, a message from Yahveh came to me: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh, Egypt’s king. Tell him,</em> <em>‘You co</em><em>nsider</em><em> yourself a young lion among the nations,</em> <em>	</em><em>bu</em><em>t you’re like </em><em>a sea monster</em><em> in the </em><em>ocean</em><em>.</em> <em>You </em><em>splash around</em><em> in your rivers,</em> <em>	</em><em>stir up</em><em> the water with your feet</em><em>,</em> <em>	and </em><em>muddy the</em><em> rivers.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>The Lord Yahveh says, <em>	</em><em>	“I’ll cast my net over you</em> <em>	</em><em>	along with a host of nations;</em> <em>	</em><em>	they’ll haul you up from the water.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> dash you on the ground,</em> <em>	</em><em>	toss you in an open field,</em> <em>	</em><em>	let the birds light on you,</em> <em>	</em><em>	and have the animals gorge on you.</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 32:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> scatter your bodies on the mountains,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and fill the valleys with your carcasses.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><em>	</em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> land will soak up your blood</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	all the way to the mountains;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I’ll fill the ravines with you.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I blot you out,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	I’ll veil the sky, darken the stars,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and cover the sun with a cloud;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	the moon won’t shine.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><em>	</em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> darken the lights in the sky above you</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and cover your land in darkness.</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 32:5-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup><em>I’ll</em><em> trouble many nations when I take you captive among them to lands you haven’t known. </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> be appalled at what’s happened to you. Because of you their kings will be horribly afraid when I brandish my sword at them. When you fall, they’ll shudder every minute for their whole life.”</em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 32:9-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The Lord Yahveh says, <em>“The sword of </em><em>Babylon’s</em><em> king will come on you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> mak</em><em>e your </em><em>large army </em><em>fall by the swords of </em><em>powerful men, all of them tyrants over nations.</em> <em>	They’ll </em><em>crush</em><em> </em><em>Egypt’s</em><em> pride</em> <em>	</em><em>	and destroy its </em><em>army</em><em>. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> destroy its livestock from beside the waterways;</em> <em>	</em><em>	nobody’s foot or animal’s hoof</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	will muddy them anymore.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> make their waterways soak up the water</em> <em>	</em><em>	and make their streams flow like olive oil.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I make Egypt desolate</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and the land lacking in what filled it,</em> <em>	</em><em>	when I strike everybody that lives there,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em><u>they’ll know I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>That’s</em><em> the dirge the nations will chant over Egypt and its army.”</em><strong> </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 32:11-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The <strong>fifteenth day, first month, twelfth year</strong>, a message from Yahveh came to me: <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man,</em><em> wail for Egypt’s army. Along with the powerful nations, take it down to the nether world with those who go down to the Pit. </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>‘Who</em><em> are you more beautiful than?  </em> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><em>Go make your bed with the uncircumcised.’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup><em>They’ll</em><em> fall among those slain by the sword. Egypt will be delivered to the sword; they’ll take it and its army away. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Out</em><em> of Sheol the strong among the powerful will talk about Egypt and its allies. ‘The uncircumcised have gone down, they lie still, slain by the sword.’ </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 32:17-21</p>

### 22“Assyria is there with all its company, all slain by the sword. 23They who had spread terror among the living lie in the most remote parts of the Pit. 24“Elam is there with its army around its grave, all of them fallen by the sword. They who had spread terror among the living bore their disgrace with the ones they sent down to the Pit. 25They’ve made a bed for Elam among the slain—all uncircumcised.  26“Meshech, Tubal, and their armies are there, their graves around them, all slain by the sword, uncircumcised, though they’d spread terror among the living. 27They don’t lie beside the fallen heroes of old, the uncircumcised who went down to Sheol with their weapons, whose swords were laid under their heads, whose shields rested on their skeletons, though the living once feared them, 28they’ll be broken among the uncircumcised and lie with the ones they’d slain.    				Ezek 32:22-28 29“Edom is there, its kings and princes, who, despite their power, lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword with those who go down to the Pit. 30“All the chiefs from the north are there too, and all the Sidonians, who, for the terror resulting from their power, went down in disgrace with the ones they’d slain. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit.”


<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>The Lord Yahveh says, <em>“Pharaoh will see them, and be comforted for his army slain. </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Though</em><em> I had spread the fear of him among the living, he and his army will lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.” </em><em>	</em></span>
