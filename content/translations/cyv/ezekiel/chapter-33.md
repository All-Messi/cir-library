## Ezekiel Chapter **33**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>A message from Yahveh came to me: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> your people, ‘If I bring the sword on a country, and the people’s watchman </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>blows</em><em> the ram’s horn to warn them—</em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>then</em><em> those who don’t pay attention are responsible for their own death. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> they’d taken warning, they would’ve saved their life. </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> the watchman sees the sword coming and doesn’t warn the people, if the sword takes some people, they’ll be taken away in their sin, but I’ll hold the watchman responsible for it.’</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, I’ve made you a watchman for Israel so you’ll hear a message from me to warn them. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>When</em><em> I tell sinful people they’re going to die, but you don’t warn them, they’ll die in their sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for it.  </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if you warn them and they don’t turn from your way, they’ll die in their sin, but you’ve saved your life.</em><strong>	   </strong></span>

### 10“Now, son of man, tell Israel, ‘You’ve said, “Our sins are on us and we’re rotting away in them. How can we survive?”’ 11Tell them, ‘As I live,’ the Lord Yahveh says, ‘I don’t get any satisfaction out of seeing sinful people die. I want them to turn from their way and live. Turn back from your sinful way! Why die, Israel?’ 12Son of man, tell your fellow citizens, ‘People’s goodness won’t deliver them when they sin. People’s sinfulness won’t prevent them from living when they quit doing it. Good people can’t have life from goodness when they practice sin. 13When I say to a good man he’ll surely live and he presumes on his goodness and starts sinning, I won’t consider his good deeds; he’ll die in that sin. 14But when I say to a sinful man, ‘You’ll surely die,’ and he quits sinning—15if he returns a pledge, repays what he stole, follows the statutes that give life and doesn’t sin—he’ll surely live. 16I won’t hold his past sins against him. He is doing good; he’ll live.		  					Ezek 33:10-16 17“Yet your people say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right,’ when it’s their own way that’s not right. 18When a good man turns from his goodness, he’ll die because he practices sin. 19When a wicked man turns from his wickedness, he’ll live because he’s practicing goodness. 20Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right.’ House of Israel, I’ll judge each of you by your own ways.” 	  Ezek 33:17-20 Israel’s Fall Explained


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>The <strong>fifth day, tenth month, twelfth year</strong> of our exile, refugees from Jerusalem came to tell me the city had fallen<em>.</em><strong><sup>  </sup></strong><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Yahveh’s hand had been heavy on me the evening before. When they came the next morning, he made me able to talk again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>A message from him came to me: <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Son</em><em> of man, those who live in Israel’s waste places are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land. So to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.’ </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> them the Lord Yahveh says, ‘You eat meat with blood in it, and look up to your idols as you shed innocent blood. Should </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> have the land? </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> rely on your sword, you commit disgusting deeds, you defile your neighbor’s wife. Should </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> have the land? </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>As</em><em> I live, those who live in the waste places will fall by the sword. Whoever is in the open country wild animals will kill. The ones in strongholds and caves will die from disease. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> make the land desolate; pride about its power will stop. Israel’s mountains will be so desolate nobody can get through them. </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em><u>They’ll</u></em><em><u> know I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em> when I make the land desolate because of their disgusting deeds.’</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	 </sup></strong><strong>   </strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

### 30“Son of man, your fellow citizens talk about you by the walls and in the doorways, ‘Come on, let’s hear a message from Yahveh.’ 31They come and sit with you like my people, but they do the lustful things they talk about and set their hearts on making money. 32As far as they’re concerned, you’re someone with a beautiful voice that plays an instrument well and sings love songs. They hear what you’re saying, but they don’t do it. 33So when what you say does happen—as it surely will—they’ll know a prophet was among them.” 	Ezek 33:30-33 Prophecy Against Israel’s Shepherds
