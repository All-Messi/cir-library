## Ezekiel Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>He shouted, <em>“Executioners, come here with your weapons.” </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Six men holding a shattering weapon, came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. One of them was wearing linen with a scribe’s inkhorn on his hip. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>The glory of God rose up from the cherub it rested on and went to the threshold of the Temple. He called out to the man with the inkhorn,<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>	  </sup></strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 9:1-3</p>

### 4“Go all over the city and mark the foreheads of people who sigh and groan over the detestable things going on here.” 5-6He told the others, “Follow him and kill old men, young men, girls, little children, and women. Don’t pity or spare, but don’t touch anybody with the mark. Start at my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders that were in front of the Temple. 7He told them, “Defile the Temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down the people in the city. 8While they were striking them down and I was by myself, I fell on my face and shouted, “Lord Yahveh! Are you going to destroy the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out your anger on Jerusalem?”


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>He told me, <em>“The </em><em>sinfulness</em><em> of Israel and Judah is </em><em>extreme</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The land is filled with blood</em><em>;</em><em> the city is full of perversion.</em><em> </em><em>They</em><em>’re saying</em><em>, ‘</em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has </em><em>abandoned</em><em> the land; he</em><em>’s not watching us</em><em>!</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> won’t pity or spare</em><em>.</em><em> I’ll bring </em>the consequences of<em> the</em><em>ir</em><em> actions on their own heads.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The man with the inkhorn reported, <em>“I’ve done </em><em>what</em><em> you</em><em> said</em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>                         </strong></span>
