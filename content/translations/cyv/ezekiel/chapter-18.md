## Ezekiel Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 2"What do you mean by the proverb about Israel, 'The parents ate sour grapes, and the children's mouths puckered'?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As I live, you're not going to use that proverb in Israel anymore. 4Every soul belongs to me, the parent's as well as the children's. The soul that sins is the one that dies. 5"If a man practices goodness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> doesn't eat at the mountain shrines or look up to the idols in Israel, defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her period;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> if he doesn't oppress anybody, but restores the debtor's pledge; if he doesn't steal, but feeds the hungry and clothes the naked,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> if he doesn't lend money with interest or take increase, if he keeps from sinning and carries out true goodness between people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> if he follows my statutes and ordinances to deal faithfully— he's good; he'll live." 10"If he has a violent son that sheds blood and does any of those sins to a brother 11(though the father didn't do any of them himself)— eats at the mountain shrines and defiles his neighbor's wife,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> oppresses the poor and needy, steals, doesn't return a pledge, but looks up to idols and commits disgusting acts,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> lends money with interest— will he live? No! He's committed detestable acts; put him to death. His blood will be on himself. 14"If he has a son that's seen his father's sins and doesn't do them—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> if he doesn't eat at the mountain shrines or look up to idols in Israel or defile his neighbor's wife,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> if he doesn't oppress anybody or keep a pledge or steal, but gives bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> refuses to hurt the poor, doesn't take interest or increase, but carries out my ordinances and follows my statutes— he won't die for his father's sins; he'll live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Because the father practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what wasn't good, he'll die for his own sins. 19"Yet you say, 'Why shouldn't a child take the punishment for a parent's sins?' When children practice goodness and observe my statutes, they'll live. 20The one that sins is the one that dies. An offspring won't take the punishment for a parent's sins or vice versa. A person's goodness or sinfulness applies to the one that does it. 21"If sinful people quit sinning, keep my statutes, and practice goodness, they'll live. 22The sins they've committed I won't hold against them. Because they're practicing goodness now, they'll live. 23Do I get any satisfaction out of seeing a sinner die," the Lord Yahveh says, "instead of turning from sin and living? 24"But when good people turn away from their goodness, and do what sinful people do, will they live? I won't consider their good deeds before; they'll die for the treachery they're committing now. 25Yet you say Yahveh's way's not right. Listen, Israel! Aren't your ways the ones that aren't right? 26When good people turn away from their goodness, they'll die in their sin. 27When sinful people quit sinning and practice what's right, they'll save their life. 28They'll live because they thought it over and turned away from their sin. 29But Israel says, Yahveh's way isn't right.' Aren't my ways right, Israel? Aren't your ways the ones that aren't? 30"So I'll judge you, Israel, each person by their own behavior. Repent and quit sinning so your sins won't make you stumble. 31Get rid of them. Make a new heart and spirit for yourselves! Why die, Israel? 32I don't get any satisfaction out of seeing anybody die. So repent and live." A Funeral Song for Israel's Princes</span>
