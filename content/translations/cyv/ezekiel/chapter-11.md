## Ezekiel Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of theY Temple. There were 25 men at the entrance of the gate, including Jaazaniah Ben-Azzur and Pelatiah Ben-Benaiah, leaders of the people. 2He told me, "Those men devise sin and give bad advice in this city. 3They say, 'Isn't it time to build houses? This city is the pot and we're the meat.' 4So prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The Spirit of Yahveh fell on me: "Say, 'Yahveh says, "I know your thoughts. 6You've multiplied the slain in this city and filled its streets with them. 7'So the slain are the meat, and the city is the pot; but I'll take you out of it. 8You've been afraid of the sword; so I'll bring the sword on you. 9I'll remove you from the city and deliver you to foreigners to carry out your condemnation. 10You'll fall by the sword all the way to Israel's border. 11This city won't be a pot for you, and you won't be the meat in it. 12You'll know I'm Yahveh because you haven't followed my statutes or carried out my ordinances. You've followed the ordinances of the nations around you."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> As I prophesied, Pelatiah died. I fell on my face and shouted, "Lord Yahveh! Are you going to put an end to the remnant of Israel completely?" A New Heart and Spirit for Israel</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 15"Son of man, your brothers, relatives, fellow exiles, and the whole House of Israel are the ones the people in Jerusalem have told, 'Go far away from Yahveh; we've received this land.' 16So say, 'The Lord Yahveh says, "Though I've removed them far away, yet I've been a sanctuary for them a little while where they've gone. 17I'll gather them out of those countries back to Israel."' 18They'll get rid of its abominations and detestable things. 19I'll give them one heart and a new spirit. I'll take out their stone heart and give them a real one 20so they can follow my statutes and keep my ordinances. They'll be my people and I'll be their God. 21Those who go after detestable things will have the consequences of their conduct come down on their own heads," the Lord Yahveh says.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the cherubs lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of God hovered over them. 23His glory went up from the city and stood above the mountain east of it. 24The Spirit of God lifted me up and took me in a vision to the exiles in Babylonia. So the vision I'd seen left me. 25I told the exiles what Yahveh had shown me. Judah's Exile Symbolized</span>
