## Ezekiel Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The first day of the month, eleventh year, a message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, Tyre has said about Jerusalem, 'Ha! its gate's broken; it has swung open to me. I'll be filled now that it's laid waste.' 3But the Lord Yahveh says, 'I'll bring nations against you, Tyre, like waves in the sea. 4They'll destroy your walls and tear down your towers. I'll scrape away the rubble and make you a bare rock, 5a place for spreading nets by the sea. I've spoken: you'll become spoil for the nations, 6and your inhabitants on the mainland will die by the sword. You'll know I'm Yahveh.'" 7"From the north I'll bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and an enormous army. 8He'll slay your inhabitants on the mainland with the sword, build siege walls, put up a mound and a roof of shields against you. 9He'll aim his battering rams at your walls and tear down your towers with his axes. 10The huge number of his horses will cover you with dust; your walls will shake from his cavalry, wagons, and chariots when they pour through your gates like men overwhelming a breached city. 11He'll trample your streets with his horses and slay your people with the sword. He'll tear down your strong pillars, 12make spoil out of your wealth, and plunder out of your merchandise. He'll tear down your walls, destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea. 13So I'll silence your songs and harps. 14You'll be a bare rock, a place to spread nets. You won't rebuild; I've said so." 15"The Lord Yahveh says to Tyre, 'Won't the whole coastline quake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter is taking place in you? 16Then the rulers of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, strip off their embroidered clothes, and dress themselves with trembling. They'll sit on the ground, shaking every moment, appalled at you. 17They'll take up a lamentation over you, "How you've disappeared from the seas, renowned city. You and your residents were powerful seafarers. You imposed fear on people everywhere!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The islands trembled the day you fell. Yes, the islands in the sea were distressed at your passing."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Lord Yahveh says, "When I make you a desolate city, like towns with no residents, when I wash the deep up over you and big rivers flood you, 20then I'll take you down to the Pit to the people of old, and make you live in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places. So people won't live in you, but I'll set glory among the living. 21I'll bring terrors on you, and you won't exist anymore. Though people look for you, they'll never find you." A Lament for Tyre</span>
