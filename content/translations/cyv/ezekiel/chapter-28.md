## Ezekiel Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me again: 2"Son of man, tell the leader of Tyre; 'The Lord Yahveh says, "You're arrogant; you've said, 'I'm a god; I sit in God's seat in the heart of the sea.' But you're a mortal, not God, though you exalt yourself as if you were God. (3You think you're wiser than Daniel, that no secret is a match for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> By your wisdom and intelligence, you've become rich, and gained gold and silver for your treasuries.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> By your great wisdom and trade, you've increased your wealth, and you're arrogant because of it.)" 6'So the Lord Yahveh says, "Because you've exalted yourself as if you were God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I'll bring foreigners on you, the most ruthless of nations. They'll draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They'll bring you down to the Pit, and you'll die like those killed in the middle at sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Will you still say, 'I'm a god,' in the presence of your slayer? Though you're a mortal, not God, will you still say, 'I'm a god,' in the hands of the ones who mortally wound you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You'll die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners. I've said so!"'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 12"Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre. Tell him, 'The Lord Yahveh says, "You had the seal of perfection; wise and perfectly beautiful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You were in Eden, God's orchard. You wore every precious stone: rubies, topaz, diamonds, beryl, onyx, and jasper lapis lazuli, turquoise, emeralds. There was gold workmanship for your settings and engravings. They were prepared the day you were created.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I placed an anointed cherub to guard you. You were on God's holy mountain, and walked among the burning stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You were blameless in your ways from the time you were created till sin became obvious in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> By the abundance of your trade, you became violent and sinned. So I've thrown you as profane from God's mountain. I've destroyed you, guardian cherub, from among the burning stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You became proud of your beauty, and corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I threw you on the ground; I put you in front of kings so they could see you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> By the great number of your sins committed in your trading, you profaned your sanctuaries. So I've brought fire out of you, and it's you up. I've turned you to ashes in the world in front of everybody that sees you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Everybody that knows you is appalled at what's happened to you. You've panicked, and won't exist anymore."'" A Message for Sidon</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 21"Son of man, face Sidon and prophesy against it. 22'The Lord Yahveh says, "I'm against you, Sidon, and I'll be honored by what I do to you. They'll know I'm Yahveh, when I carry out judgments on you; I'll demonstrate my holiness in you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I've sent a disease to you and blood in your streets. The wounded will fall in you by the sword everywhere. You'll know I'm Yahveh. 24"For Israel there won't any longer be a briar to prick or a thorn to hurt them from any that scorn them. They'll know I'm the Lord Yahveh." 25'The Lord Yahveh says, "When I gather Israel back from the nations where they're scattered and demonstrate my holiness in them in front of the nations, then they'll live in the land I've given Jacob. 26They'll live in it securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. I'll carry out judgment on everybody that scorns them. They'll know I'm Yahveh their God."'" A Message for Egypt</span>
