## Ezekiel Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me back to the Temple door. Water was running east from under the threshold of the Temple, which faced east. It was running down from under the right side of the Temple, from south of the altar. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. Water was trickling from the south side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured 1723ft <sup>1,000 cubits </sup>and led me through the water, which was up to my ankles. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Again he measured 1723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> and led me through water up to my knees. He measured another 1723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> and led me through water up to my waist. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He measured 1723ft <sup>1,000 cubits</sup> again, a river I couldn’t cross because it was too deep to ford; it was deep enough to swim in. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em>Do you see</em><em> th</em><em>at</em><em>?”</em><em>            </em><strong> </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ezek 47:1-</p>

### 6a	  He took me back to the riverbank. 7Lots of trees were growing on both sides of the river now. 8He said, “This water runs east down to the Arabah, to the sea and makes it fresh. 9Wherever the water goes, everything that forms schools will live. There’ll be lots of fish because the water will be fresh. 10Fishermen will spread their nets from En-gedi to En-eglaim. There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 11But its swamps and marshes will stay salty. 12On both riverbanks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves won’t wither, and their fruit won’t fail. They’ll bear year around because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will provide food and their leaves will provide healing.”	      				Ezek 47:6b-12 The Boundaries of the Land


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Lord Yahveh says, <em>‘</em><em>When you divide up</em><em> the land among the </em><em>12 tribes, give </em><em>Joseph two portions</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>divide</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> the inheritance</em><em> </em><em>equally like </em><em>I swore to your ancestors</em><em>. </em></span>
