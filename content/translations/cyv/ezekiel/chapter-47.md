## Ezekiel Chapter 47

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then he took me back to the Temple door. Water was running east from under the threshold of the Temple, which faced east. It was running down from under the right side of the Temple, from south of the altar. 2He brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. Water was trickling from the south side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through the water, which was up to my ankles. 4Again he measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my knees. He measured another 1723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my waist. 5He measured 1723ft 1,000 cubits again, a river I couldn't cross because it was too deep to ford; it was deep enough to swim in. 6He said, "Do you see that?" He took me back to the riverbank. 7Lots of trees were growing on both sides of the river now. 8He said, "This water runs east down to the Arabah, to the sea and makes it fresh. 9Wherever the water goes, everything that forms schools will live. There'll be lots of fish because the water will be fresh. 10Fishermen will spread their nets from En-gedi to En-eglaim. There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 11But its swamps and marshes will stay salty. 12On both riverbanks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves won't wither, and their fruit won't fail. They'll bear year around because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will provide food and their leaves will provide healing." The Boundaries of the Land</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The Lord Yahveh says, 'When you divide up the land among the 12 tribes, give Joseph two portions 14and dividepl the inheritance equally like I swore to your ancestors. 15"These will be the boundaries for the land. The north boundary will run from the Mediterranean Sea past Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad; 16Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, (on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazerhatticon by the border of Hauran. 17So the boundary will run from the Sea to Hazarenan on the north border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. 18The east boundary will run from Hazarenan between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel. From the north border to the Dead Sea as far as Tamar. 19The south boundary will extend from Tamar as far as the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. 20The west boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea from the southern boundary to a point across from Lebo-hamath. 21-22"So divide the land by lots as an inheritance for the tribes and the foreigners that live among you; and have sons. Treat foreigners like native-born Israelites. Allot them an inheritance 23in the tribe where each one lives," the Lord Yahveh says. Division of the Land</span>
