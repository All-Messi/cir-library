## Ezekiel Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year, a message from Yahveh came to me: 2"Son of man, write down the date. The king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem today. 3Tell the rebellious people a parable, 'The Lord Yahveh says, "Put a pot on and pour water in it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> put good pieces in it, thigh and shoulder; fill it with choice bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Take the best of the flock, and put wood under the pot. Boil it hard; seethe its bones with the meat." 6'The Lord Yahveh says, "Misfortune awaits the bloody city; it awaits the rusty pot! Take out piece after piece without choosing which ones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The blood she shed is in her; she put it on a bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground and cover it with dirt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> To cause anger to rise up and take revenge, I've put her blood on a bare rock so it won't be covered." 9'So the Lord Yahveh says, "Misfortune awaits the bloody city! I'll make it a big pile.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Pile on the wood, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, burn the bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then set it empty on its coals To get it hot so its bronze will glow, its dross will dissolve, its rust burn off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I've worked hard for nothing, because its extreme rust isn't gone; let it rust in the fire!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In your filthiness is lewdness; I wanted to clean you up, but you didn't want to be clean. You won't be clean from your filthiness, till I've spent my wrath on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I Yahveh have said it; it's coming, I'll do it. I won't hold back, I won't pity or be sorry. I'll judge you according to your ways and deeds."'" Ezekiel's Wife Dies</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A message from Yahveh came to me: 16"Son of man, I'm about to take away the delight of your eyes in one stroke, but don't mourn or cry or shed tears. 17Groan silently; don't perform ritual mourning for the dead. Wrap your turban on, put your shoes on, don't cover your mouth in sorrow, or eat the bread of mourning."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I told the people about it in the morning; that evening my wife died. The next morning I did what God told me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The people said, "Won't you tell us what you're doing means for us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I told them, "A message from Yahveh came to me, 21'Tell Israel, "I'm about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes and soul. The children you've left behind will fall by the sword. 22Do what I've done. Don't cover your mouth in sorrow or eat the bread of mourning. 23Put your turbans on your heads and your shoes on your feet. Don't mourn or weep, but pine away in your sins and groan to one another. 24Follow Ezekiel's example. When it comes, you'll know I'm the Lord Yahveh."' 25"Son of man, won't that be when I take their fortresses away from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, their children—26when somebody escapes and comes to you with the news? 27Then you can speak to the one that escaped. You'll be a sign to them. They'll know I'm Yahveh." A Message for Ammon</span>
