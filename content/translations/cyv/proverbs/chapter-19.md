## Proverbs Chapter **19**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The honest poor are better off than dishonest fools.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>It’s not good to not know; enthusiasm doesn’t compensate for ignorance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>When people’s foolishness brings them to ruin, they blame Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wealth draws lots of friends that desert you if poverty comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>False witnesses will get their just due; perjurers won’t get off free.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Many ask for generous people’s blessing; everybody makes friends with bighearted people.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Relatives of the poor despise them, and their friends leave! Appealing to them won’t bring them back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>People that gain wisdom care about themselves; they prosper who cherish understanding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>False witnesses won’t go unpunished; liars perish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Living in luxury isn’t fitting for a fool, much less for a slave to rule over princes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>Discretion gives you control over anger; you learn to delight in overlooking sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>A king’s anger is like a lion’s roar; his blessing falls like dew on grass.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>A foolish child destroys a father; a nagging wife is like constant dripping.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Houses and wealth people inherit from parents, but a prudent wife comes from Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Laziness lulls people to sleep; shiftless people go hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Those who keep the commandments keep their life; people that are careless about their way will lose it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Those gracious to the poor lend to Yahveh; he’ll reward them for the good they do.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Discipline your children while there’s hope so you won’t ruin their lives.<strong>	</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Let angry people suffer the consequences; bail them out, and you’ll have it to do again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Listen to advice and respond to discipline so you can gain wisdom for later on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>People make their plans, but Yahveh’s counsel is what prevails.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Loyalty makes everyone better; poor people are better <em>at it </em>than liars.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Respecting Yahveh leads to life; you can sleep in peace without worrying about misfortune.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate, but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 19:19-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Punish scoffers so the simpleminded can learn prudence; reprove the wise and they’ll be wiser still.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Children that mistreat their parents are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>If you stop paying attention to discipline, child, you’ll never learn what you need to know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>A worthless witness makes mockery of justice; a sinful mouth eats sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Penalties are designed for scoffers, and scourging for the backs of fools.<strong>	</strong></span>
