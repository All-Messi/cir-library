## Proverbs Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Take my advice, son; treasure up my commandments inside you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Keep my commands so you can have a life; guard my teachings like the pupil in your eye.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tie them on your fingers; write them on your heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Call wisdom your sister and insight your friend,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> so they can keep you away from the adulteress that flatters with her words.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> and saw among the naïve a young man with no sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He was going down the street near her corner on the way to her house,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> in the evening at dusk. During the night after dark,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> a woman comes to meet him, dressed like a prostitute, coy at heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> She's loud and rebellious, not content to stay home—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> now in the streets, now in the squares, lurking at every corner.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> She grabs him and kisses him, and says to him with a brazen face, 14"It was time for me to offer peace offerings; I paid my vows today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So I've come out to meet you, to look for you eagerly, and I found you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I've decorated my couch with covers, with colored linens from Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Come on, let's drink our fill of love till morning; let's delight ourselves with love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My husband's gone on a long trip;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> he's taken a moneybag with him and won't be back till full moon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> She entices him with persuasion, and seduces him with flattery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Finally he follows her like a bull to slaughter, like a stag heading for a trap.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> An arrow pierces his liver; like a bird swooping to a snare, he doesn't realize it will cost him his life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> So pay attention to what I'm saying, sons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't let your heart turn to its own ways or stray into its own paths;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> doing that has thrown down so many victims and slain them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Her house lies on the road to Sheol, that descends to the den of death.</span>
