## Proverbs Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sinners run when no one’s chasing, but the good are as bold as lions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When a country sins, lots of leaders vie for control; but wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The poor that oppress the poor are like a driving rain that destroys crops.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Those who leave the Law commend the sinful, but those who keep it contend with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Bad people don’t understand justice, those who look to Yahveh understand it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Being poor and honest is better than being rich and dishonest.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 28:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Young people that keep the Law are wise offspring, but companions of gluttons humiliate their parents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Whoever increases wealth by charging high interest, gathers it for the one that’s kind to the poor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> When people quit listening to the Law, even their prayers become offensive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They who mislead the godly fall into their own pit, but the honest inherit good things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The rich may think they’re smart, but poor people with insight can see through them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When the godly triumph, everybody’s glad; but when the sinful take over, people leave.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 28:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Concealing your sins won’t make you prosper, but confessing and abandoning them will foster mercy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>How blessed they are who fear doing wrong, but those who harden their hearts are headed for trouble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> An evil ruler is as dangerous to poor people as a roaring lion or a charging bear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>A leader that oppresses isn’t using good judgment; anyone that hates unjust gain prolongs life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Corrupt leaders, loaded down with the guilt of human blood, will be fugitives till death; nobody will take their side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>People that live with integrity will be rescued, but those who are perverse will suddenly fall.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 28:13-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The man that plows his ground will have plenty to eat, but one that follows fantasies will be poor in the midst of plenty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Reliable people receive many blessings, but those who want to get rich quick get into trouble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Showing partiality is never good; yet some would sin to get a piece of bread.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>A miser hurries to get rich and doesn’t realize that want will overtake him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Someone that rebukes finds more approval than someone that flatters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>People that steal from their parents, and claim it’s not sin, are no better than murderers.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 28:19-24</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Arrogant people stir up conflict, but those who trust in Yahveh prosper.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>People are foolish to trust in themselves; it’s the ones that live wisely that stay safe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> If you give to the poor, you’ll never be poor; but if you close your eyes <em>to poverty</em>, you’ll be cursed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When corrupt leaders rise to power, people go into hiding; when they meet disaster, the godly flourish. <strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 28:25-28</strong></span>
