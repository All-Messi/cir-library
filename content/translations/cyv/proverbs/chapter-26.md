## Proverbs Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor is out of place on a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Like a flitting sparrow, like a fluttering swallow, an undeserved curse doesn’t land on its intended victim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A whip is for a horse, a bridle is for a donkey, a rod is for the back of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t answer fools’ arguments; you’ll dignify them with a response.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Answer fools’ arguments; otherwise, they’ll think they’ve won.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Trusting a fool to deliver a message is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 26:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like legs hanging from the lame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Honoring a fool is as dangerous as putting a stone in a sling.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like a thorn in the hand of a drunk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever hires a fool or passerby is like an archer that shoots at random.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A fool that repeats his folly is like a dog that returns to its vomit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There’s more hope for fools than for people that think they’re smart.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 26:7-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Lazy people claim there’s a lion in the road! There’s surely a lion in the public square!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Like a door swinging on its hinges, lazy people turn on their beds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Lazy people think their smarter than seven wise advisors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A passerby that meddles in other people’s conflict is like someone taking a dog by the ears.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 26:13-17</strong> <strong><sup>18-</sup></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Someone that lies and says, <em>“</em><em>J</em><em>ust kidding,”</em> is as dangerous as a maniac that’s shooting flaming arrows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> For lack of wood a fire goes out; where there’s no gossip, quarreling dies down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Contentious people spark conflict like charcoal on hot embers or wood on fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Rumors are like delicious morsels; they work their way down deep inside you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Warm lips and a base heart are like silver glaze on a clay pot.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 26:18-23</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> People disguise disdain with words while storing up deceit in their heart;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>don’t trust them when they pretend to be kind to you, because they have seven evils in their minds;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>though they coat their disdain with lies, it’ll eventually come out for all to see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You dig a pit for others, only to fall in it yourself; you roll a boulder uphill only to have it roll back and crush you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>A lying tongue despises its victims; a flattering mouth brings ruin.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 26:24-28</strong></span>
