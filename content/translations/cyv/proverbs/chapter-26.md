## Proverbs Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor is out of place on a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Like a flitting sparrow, like a fluttering swallow, an undeserved curse doesn't land on its intended victim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> A whip is for a horse, a bridle is for a donkey, a rod is for the back of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don't answer fools' arguments; you'll dignify them with a response.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Answer fools' arguments; otherwise, they'll think they've won.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Trusting a fool to deliver a message is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like legs hanging from the lame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Honoring a fool is as dangerous as putting a stone in a sling.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like a thorn in the hand of a drunk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Whoever hires a fool or passerby is like an archer that shoots at random.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> A fool that repeats his folly is like a dog that returns to its vomit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> There's more hope for fools than for people that think they're smart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Lazy people claim there's a lion in the road! There's surely a lion in the public square!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Like a door swinging on its hinges, lazy people turn on their beds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate but they don't even bring the food to their mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Lazy people think their smarter than seven wise advisors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A passerby that meddles in other people's conflict is like someone taking a dog by the ears. 18-19Someone that lies and says, "Just kidding," is as dangerous as a maniac that's shooting flaming arrows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> For lack of wood a fire goes out; where there's no gossip, quarreling dies down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Contentious people spark conflict like charcoal on hot embers or wood on fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Rumors are like delicious morsels; they work their way down deep inside you!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Warm lips and a base heart are like silver glaze on a clay pot.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> People disguise disdain with words while storing up deceit in their heart;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> don't trust them when they pretend to be kind to you, because they have seven evils in their minds;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> though they coat their disdain with lies, it'll eventually come out for all to see.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> You dig a pit for others, only to fall in it yourself; you roll a boulder uphill only to have it roll back and crush you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> A lying tongue despises its victims; a flattering mouth brings ruin.</span>
