## Proverbs Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Listen to my instruction, children; pay attention and learn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I'll give you helpful guidance; don't abandon it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When I was my father's son, my mother's tender only boy,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> he taught me, "Hold fast to what I say; keep my commandments and live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Gain wisdom! Get insight! don't forget it or leave it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Keep it with you, and it'll protect you; love it, and it'll watch over you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> This is the main thing about wisdom: get it; whatever else you get, get that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Value it highly, and it'll elevate you; it will bring you honor if you embrace it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> It will put a beautiful wreath on your head and present you with a splendid crown."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Accept what I'm telling you, son, and you'll live a long time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I've directed you in the way of wisdom, and led you in godly paths.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When you walk, you won't be hampered; when you run, you won't stumble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Latch hold of instruction and don't let it go; guard it, and it will determine your destiny.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Don't follow the road that sinners travel or walk the path of perverse people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Avoid it; don't pass by it; turn and go the other way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They can't sleep unless they mistreat someone; they lose sleep unless they can trip somebody up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But the path of goodness is like dawn's early light; it shines brighter and brighter till it's fully day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The way of sinners is like darkness; they don't know what they're stumbling over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Pay attention to me, son; listen to what I'm telling you;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> don't let it out of your sight; keep it inside you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> It gives life to those who find it and health to their whole body.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Watch over your heart diligently, because the springs of life flow out of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Put away a deceitful mouth; put devious lips far from you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Look straight ahead; fix your gaze in front of you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Keep your eye on the path you're walking, and all your ways will be safe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Don't stray from them; go the other way from sin.</span>
