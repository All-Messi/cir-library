## Proverbs Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Words of King Lemuel The Oracle His Mother Taught Him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Please listen, son, son of my womb, son of my vows;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> don't waste your strength on the kind of women that destroy kings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Lemuel, it's not for kings to guzzle wine or for rulers to get addicted to alcohol;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> the fear is that they'll forget the Law and not give justice to the oppressed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Give alcohol to the dying and wine to those in pain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> let them drink and forget their condition, and not remember their suffering anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Speak up for those who can't speak for themselves;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> judge justly and defend the poor and needy. Tribute to a Worthy Woman</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Who can find a capable wife of noble character? She's worth more than jewels.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Her husband can rely on her, and he'll not lack anything of value.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> She'll do him good her whole life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> She looks for wool and linen, and enjoys working with her hands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Like a merchant ship, she brings her food from a distance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> She gets up before daylight to feed her family and assign the day's jobs to her maids.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> She inspects a field and buys it, and plants a vineyard from her earnings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> She wraps her waist with strength and makes her arms strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> She makes sure her efforts are profitable, and her lamp doesn't go out at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> She reaches for the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> She reaches out to the poor and needy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> She's not worried when it snows because she has dressed her family in scarlet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> She wears purple and fine linen and makes her own bedclothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The community knows her husband in the city gates, where he sits among the leaders of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> She makes sashes and linen garments to sell to the merchants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> She dresses in strength and dignity and smiles at the future.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> She speaks wisely and teaches kindly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> She takes care of her household and doesn't idle away her time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Her children grow up and bless her; her husband, too, and praises her: 29"Lots of women do nobly, but you excel them all."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but praise a woman that respects Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Reward her for what she does, and let her work speak for her in the community. Version by Virgil Warren: christir.org</span>
