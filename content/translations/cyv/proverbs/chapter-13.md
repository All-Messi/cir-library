## Proverbs Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wise children accept their father’s discipline, but scoffers don’t pay attention to correction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> From the influence of your words, people respond willingly; but treacherous people want to force things through.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Be careful what you say, and you’ll save yourself; talk too much, and you’ll do yourself in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Lazy people want but don’t get; the diligent have a rich supply.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Good people hate lies, but sinners act disgracefully.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Goodness protects the blameless; sinfulness undermines the sinful.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 13:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> One person acts rich but is poor; another pretends to be poor but is wealthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The rich can pay a ransom to save their lives, but the poor don’t get kidnapped for ransom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The light of the godly shines bright, but the lamp of the sinful flickers out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Insolence causes division; accepting advice brings wisdom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Easy wealth soon dwindles away; what we work for increases.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Hope delayed makes a heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 13:7-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Instruction destroys people that hate it; a commandment rewards those who respect it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Good sense leads to blessing, but a treacherous mind creates hardship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Prudent people act with insight; fools flaunt their foolishness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble, but a faithful envoy can bring detente.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> We risk poverty and shame by neglecting self-discipline; honor comes to us if we value correction.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 13:13-18</p>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Seeing dreams come true is pleasant to the soul, but fools hate to quit sinning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Those who spare the rod don’t love their children; if you care about them, you’ll discipline them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Good people have enough to satisfy their appetite, but a sinner’s stomach never feels full.</span>
