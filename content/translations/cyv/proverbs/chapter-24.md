<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The wise are strong; knowledge increases their strength;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> they wage war with effective strategy; they win the victory because of their many advisors.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Wisdom is out of the reach of fools; they have nothing to say in the city gate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> People call them schemers who plot misfortune;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> devising foolishness is sin; scoffing is detestable.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If you try to excuse yourself by claiming ignorance, won't he know better than that who weighs your heart? Doesn't he know you that keeps your soul? Won't he render to you what you deserve?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Son, eat honey; it's good; honeycomb tastes sweet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Understand that wisdom is like that to your soul; if you find it, you'll have a bright future, and your hope won't fade away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Don't lie in wait at godly people's house, you wicked; don't raid their resting place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Good people fall seven times and get up again; but for sinners, one disaster is more than enough.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Don't be glad when your enemies stumble or celebrate when they fall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yahveh won't be pleased; he'll turn his anger away from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Don't worry about sinners or envy them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> they have no future; their lamp will flicker out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Son, revere Yahveh, respect the king, and don't associate with unstable people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> their disaster will rise up unexpectedly, and ruin you with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> These are sayings of the wise: Showing partiality in judgment is unjust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Anyone that tells sinners they're good, people will curse and nations abhor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But those who rebuke sinners will receive delight; blessing will come to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Giving an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Finish your work in the field first; then come and build your house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Don't testify against someone for no reason or deceive by what you say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Don't say, "I'll do to him what he's done to me; I'll render to him his deeds in return."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I went past a lazy person's field, past the vineyard of someone without common sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Thistles had taken it over; nettles covered the ground; its walls were broken down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> I thought about what I saw; I looked and learned: 33"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Your poverty will descend on you like a raider; your need will attack you like an armed robber.</span>
