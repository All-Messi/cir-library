<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If you try to excuse yourself by claiming ignorance, won’t he know better than that who weighs your heart? Doesn’t he know you that keeps your soul? Won’t he render to you what you deserve?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Son, eat honey; it’s good; honeycomb tastes sweet.</span>

<p class="section-ref">Prov 24:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Don’t lie in wait at godly people’s house, you wicked; don’t raid their resting place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Good people fall seven times and get up again; but for sinners, one disaster is more than enough.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Don’t be glad when your enemies stumble or celebrate when they fall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Yahveh won’t be pleased; he’ll turn his anger away from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Don’t worry about sinners or envy them;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>These are sayings of the wise: Showing partiality in judgment is unjust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Anyone that tells sinners they’re good, people will curse and nations abhor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But those who rebuke sinners will receive delight; blessing will come to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Giving an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>I thought about what I saw; I looked and learned: <strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>“A</em><em> little sleep, a little slumber,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a little folding of the hands to rest.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Your poverty will descend on you like a raider; your need <em>will </em><em>attack you</em> like an armed robber.<strong>	</strong></span>
