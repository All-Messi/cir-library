## Proverbs Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A gentle answer deflects anger; harsh words make tempers flare.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The wise dispense knowledge; fools expound foolishness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Yahveh sees everything; he watches the evil and the good.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Gentle words are a tree of life, but perverse talk breaks people's spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Fools reject their father's discipline, but those attentive to correction become prudent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> There's wealth in the house of the godly, but the earnings of the sinful bring trouble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The lips of the wise give good advice; the hearts of fools have nothing to offer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh detests the sacrifices of sinners, but delights in the prayers of the righteous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He detests the way of the wicked, but loves people who pursue goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Those who abandon the way incur harsh discipline; those who reject discipline die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon lie open before Yahveh; how much more our hearts!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Scoffers don't like people that rebuke them; so they stay away from the wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A cheerful heart makes a happy face, but a sad heart breaks the spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The mind of the wise is hungry for insight, but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Negative people have nothing but bad days, but with a happy heart they enjoy a continual feast.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> It's better to have a little with reverence for Yahveh than to have a lot with turmoil attached.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A plate of vegetables with someone you love tastes better than a roast from a grain-fed cow with someone you don't like.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Hot-tempered people stir up quarrels, but controlling anger calms contentions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Briers overgrow lazy people's paths, but the upright travel on an open road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Wise children make a happy father; foolish ones despise their mother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Foolishness is fun for the foolish, but the wise walk on a straight path.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Without advice plans go awry, but with many advisors they succeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Everyone enjoys giving a good answer, and a timely word delights those who hear it!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The path of the wise leads upward away from Sheol below.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh tears down the house of the proud but protects the widow's home.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Yahveh detests evil plans but delights in pure words.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Those greedy for gain bring trouble home; those who refuse bribes live in peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> The godly think before they speak; sinners blurt out evil without thinking.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Yahveh stands far away from the sinful, but he listens to the prayers decent people offer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> A cheerful look makes the heart happy; good news refreshes us deep inside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> If you listen to constructive correction, you'll live among the wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> If you ignore instruction, you only hurt yourself; by heeding correction, you gain insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Respecting Yahveh teaches wisdom; humility comes before honor.</span>
