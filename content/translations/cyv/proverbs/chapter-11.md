## Proverbs Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh detests a false balance; he delights in accurate weights.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Dishonor follows pride; but wisdom lies with the humble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The integrity of the wise gives them direction; the dishonesty of the treacherous destroys them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wealth won’t help you when judgment comes, but goodness delivers you from death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Goodness smooths the way for the blameless, but the sinful collapse under the weight of their own sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Their goodness delivers the godly, their greed snares deceivers.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 11:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When sinners die, their aspirations die as well; hope perishes with the godless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Good people leave trouble behind, but sinners head right for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The godless destroy their neighbors with their mouths, but knowledge lets the righteous escape.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>A city celebrates when things go well for the godly; there’s also happy shouting over the demise of the sinful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The godly are a blessing that builds up a city; the mouths of sinners tear it down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Belittling you neighbor doesn’t help anybody; be silent and just let it rest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Gossips go around telling secrets; reliable people keep private matters private.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Without wise leaders a nation falls; victory comes from having many advisors.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 11:7-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Standing good for a stranger’s debt means you’re likely to pay it; avoid guaranteeing it and stay safe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>A gracious woman earns respect; a violent man just gets rich.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Kindness repays you; cruelty destroys you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Sinners get rich by deception; people that sow goodness make a legitimate living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Steadfast goodness promotes life; chasing after evil gets you killed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Yahveh detests the perverse in heart; he delights in those blameless in their living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Sinful people will certainly suffer for it, but the children of the just will be rescued.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>A beautiful woman with no discretion is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 11:15-22</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The godly look forward to good things; the sinful are simply waiting for wrath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Give liberally and grow richer; withhold what you should give and be in need.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The generous prosper; those who refresh other people will be refreshed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>People curse the one that hoards grain but bless the one that sells it to people that need it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Whoever seeks the good finds favor, and trouble comes to the one that’s looking for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>People that rely on their wealth will fall; but the godly will flourish like green leaves.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Prov 11:23-28</p>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Bring trouble on your family, and you’ll inherit the wind; the foolish serve the wise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Good people become a tree of life, the wise win friends.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> If the righteous are rewarded on earth, how much more godless sinners!<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 11:29-31</strong></span>
