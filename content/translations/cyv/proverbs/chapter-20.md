<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Don't love sleep too much; you'll end up poor; keep your eyes open, and you'll have enough to eat. 14"It's no good," buyers say; but when the seller's gone, they brag about the bargain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> A wise king winnows sinners and drives the threshing wheel over them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The human spirit is Yahveh's lamp; it searches out the inner self.</span>
