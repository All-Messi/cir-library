<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> for knowing wisdom and instruction, for understanding words that give insight,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> for receiving instruction in smart living, goodness, justice, and equity;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> for giving prudence to the simple, and knowledge and discretion to the young;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> for increasing learning in the wise and gaining skill at understanding;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> for understanding proverbs and wise sayings, riddles and profound speech.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Respect for Yahveh is the first thing about being wise; foolish people despise wisdom and instruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Listen, son, to your father's instruction; don't leave your mother's teaching;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> they'll be a crown for your head and a garland for your neck.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Son, if sinners tempt you, don't give in to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> If they say, "Come on, let's lie in wait to shed blood and ambush innocent people for fun.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Let's swallow them alive and whole like Sheol, like people that go down to the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> We'll get precious wealth and fill our houses with plunder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Throw in your lot with us, and we'll share the take"—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> don't go with them; stay off that road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They hurry to do harm; they rush to shed blood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> There's no point in spreading a net while the bird's watching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Sinners lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> That's how it is with people that profit from violence; it steals their own lives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Wisdom shouts in the street; it raises its voice in the marketplace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> It cries out from the top of the wall, and says at the city gate: 22"How long, simpletons, will you like being simpletons, and you scoffers delight in scoffing, and you foolish people hate knowledge?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Pay attention when I correct you; I'll pour out my spirit on you and tell you what you need to know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I called and you wouldn't listen; I held out my hand, and you paid no attention.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> You ignored my advice; you didn't want me to correct you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> So I'll laugh at your misfortune and mock you when panic strikes,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> when what you dread comes like a tornado, when distress come crashing down on you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then you'll call out to me, and I won't answer; you'll look for me, but not find me</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> because you disregarded knowledge and chose not to respect Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> You wouldn't accept my advice; you despised being corrected;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> so you'll eat the fruit of how you lived founder on your own schemes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The waywardness of simpleminded people gets them killed; the complacency of fools destroys them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> But the ones that listen to me, live securely; they're at ease without dreading misfortune."</span>
