## Proverbs Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Son, if you sign for your neighbor or give a pledge for a stranger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> if you get snared by a promise you've made or caught by what you've said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> do this to deliver yourself: since you're at his disposal, humble yourself and plead with him to take away your obligation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Don't sleep or slumber;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from a fowler.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Go observe ants, lazy guy; watch what they do and wise up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Though they don't have a chief, an officer, or ruler,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> they prepare their food in the summer; at harvest time they gather provisions for winter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> How long will you lie around? When will you get up from napping? 10"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest"—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> your poverty will come on you like a bandit; your need will attack you like an armed man.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> A worthless, wicked man is one that goes around lying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> that winks with his eye, signals with his feet, gestures with his fingers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> that plots in his mind and constantly stirs up conflict.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Tragedy will come crashing down on him; all at once he'll be crushed beyond recovery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Six things the LORD despises; no, make that seven that disgust him:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> arrogant eyes, lying tongues, blood-shedding hands,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> plotting hearts, feet in a hurry to do harm,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> witnesses who perjure themselves and people that stir up conflict between friends.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Son, observe your father's commands; don't leave your mother's teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Tie them next to your heart; hang them around your neck.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They'll guide you when you walk, watch over you while you sleep, and advise you when you wake up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> A commandment is a lamp; teaching is a light; corrections that discipline lead to life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> They keep your eyes off an immoral woman, a loose woman with smooth talk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Don't desire her beauty or let her catch your attention with her eyes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> A prostitute leaves a man with little to eat; an immoral woman stalks his very life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Can a man carry fire in his arms and not singe his clothes?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Can he walk on hot coals and not burn his feet?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Can a man go to his neighbor's wife and not suffer for it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> People don't despise a thief that steals because he's hungry;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> but when he's caught, he still needs to repay it seven times over; even if he has to sell everything in his house to make it right.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> A man that commits adultery lacks good judgment; he's looking to destroy himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He'll find wounds and disgrace and shame he can't erase.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jealousy makes a husband furious; he won't restrain his revenge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He won't accept ransom or be content with your gifts.</span>
