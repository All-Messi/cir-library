## Proverbs Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A dry morsel eaten in peace tastes better than a feast in a house full of conflict.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A wise servant will rule a shameful son and share in the inheritance among brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Fire refines silver and a furnace purifies gold, but Yahveh assays the heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wrongdoers pay attention to gossip; liars latch onto slander.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People that mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice over <em>their </em>misfortune will get their just due.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Grandchildren are the crown of old age; parents are the pride of their children.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 17:1-6</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Fine speech doesn’t fit with being a fool; much less is lying appropriate for leaders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>A bribe is a lucky charm in its owner’s sight; whoever uses it prospers!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Forgiving fosters love, but dwelling on faults alienates friends.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>A rebuke penetrates deeper into thoughtful people than 100 blows affect a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Rebellious people are looking for trouble; so a cruel messenger will confront them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Facing a bear robbed of her cubs is safer than confronting a fool for his folly.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 17:7-12</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Misfortune never leaves the house of anyone that repays a good deed with a bad one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Starting an argument is like opening a floodgate; so stop a quarrel before it starts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent are equally detestable to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Why spend money on educating fools when they don’t care about learning?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A friend loves despite the circumstance; adversity forges friendship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>It’s not good judgment to guarantee another person’s debt.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 17:13-18</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Loving sin amounts to loving conflict; trusting in tall walls invites invasion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>A crooked heart doesn’t prosper; a lying tongue calls for retaliation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The parents of a fool feel discouraged; there’s no joy in life for the father of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>A happy heart is good medicine; a broken spirit weakens health.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Sinners accept secret bribes to pervert the course of justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Sensible people find wisdom nearby; fools think they’ll find it far away.<strong>	</strong><strong>Prov 17:19-24</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Foolish children are a grief to their father and bring bitterness to the one that gave them birth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>It’s wrong to punish the godly for their godliness or flog noble people for being noble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Wise people speak with restraint; cool heads display better insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Even fools, people consider wise as long as they keep their mouth shut; people suppose fools are smart when they close their lips.<strong> </strong> <strong>Prov 17:25-28</strong></span>
