## Proverbs Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A dry morsel eaten in peace tastes better than a feast in a house full of conflict.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> A wise servant will rule a shameful son and share in the inheritance among brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Fire refines silver and a furnace purifies gold, but Yahveh assays the heart.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Wrongdoers pay attention to gossip; liars latch onto slander.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> People that mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice over their misfortune will get their just due.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Grandchildren are the crown of old age; parents are the pride of their children.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Fine speech doesn't fit with being a fool; much less is lying appropriate for leaders.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> A bribe is a lucky charm in its owner's sight; whoever uses it prospers!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Forgiving fosters love, but dwelling on faults alienates friends.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A rebuke penetrates deeper into thoughtful people than 100 blows affect a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Rebellious people are looking for trouble; so a cruel messenger will confront them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Facing a bear robbed of her cubs is safer than confronting a fool for his folly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Misfortune never leaves the house of anyone that repays a good deed with a bad one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Starting an argument is like opening a floodgate; so stop a quarrel before it starts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent are equally detestable to Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Why spend money on educating fools when they don't care about learning?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> A friend loves despite the circumstance; adversity forges friendship.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> It's not good judgment to guarantee another person's debt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Loving sin amounts to loving conflict; trusting in tall walls invites invasion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> A crooked heart doesn't prosper; a lying tongue calls for retaliation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The parents of a fool feel discouraged; there's no joy in life for the father of a fool.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> A happy heart is good medicine; a broken spirit weakens health.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Sinners accept secret bribes to pervert the course of justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Sensible people find wisdom nearby; fools think they'll find it far away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Foolish children are a grief to their father and bring bitterness to the one that gave them birth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> It's wrong to punish the godly for their godliness or flog noble people for being noble.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Wise people speak with restraint; cool heads display better insight.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Even fools, people consider wise as long as they keep their mouth shut; people suppose fools are smart when they close their lips.</span>
