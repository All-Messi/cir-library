## Proverbs Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wisdom has built her house; She's carved its seven columns.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> She's done her butchering, mixed her wine, and set her table.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> She's sent her maids to call out from the heights of the city: 4"Whoever is naïve, turn in here!" She says to the one that lacks good judgment, 5"Come in and eat my food; drink the wine I've mixed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Abandon your foolish ways and start having a life; conduct yourself with good judgment."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If you correct a scoffer, you'll be abused; if you reprove sinners, you'll get insulted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Don't reprove scoffers; they'll hate you. reprove the wise, and they'll love you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Instruct the wise, and they'll be wiser still; teach the good, and they'll be better yet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Respect for Yahveh is basic to wisdom; knowing the Holy One clarifies your thinking.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> It'll multiply your days and add years to your life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If you're wise, you're wise for yourself; if you scoff at wisdom, it'll be to your detriment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> A foolish woman is loud; she's naïve and ignorant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> She sits in the doorway of her house or takes a seat on the high places in town.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> She calls out to those who are going by, who are following straight paths: 16"Whoever is naïve, turn in here," she claims to the one that doesn't know any better. 17"Stolen water is refreshing; bread eaten in secret tastes good."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But they don't know that the dead are there, that her guests lie in Sheol.</span>
