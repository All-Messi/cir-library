## Proverbs Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wisdom calls out, and intelligence raises its voice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> It takes its stand on high places, where footpaths meet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> It shouts at the city gates, 4"I'm calling out to you; my voice is aimed at everyone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Learn prudence, simple ones; gain wisdom, foolish people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Listen, so I can tell you nobler things; important things come from me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I tell the truth because I detest sinfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Everything I say is good; there's nothing devious in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What I say makes sense to anyone that has insight; it's right to those who learn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Take instruction rather than silver; receive knowledge instead of gold</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> because wisdom is worth more than jewels; nothing you want compares with it. 12"I, wisdom, and good judgment live together; I discover knowledge and discretion.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Respecting Yahveh means hating sin, pride and arrogance, corrupt behavior and perverse speech.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I offer advice about wise living and provide insight and strength.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Kings reign by me, and rulers decree justice.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Officials and nobles govern by me, as does everyone that judges justly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> I love the ones that love me, that diligently search me out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I have wealth and honor to offer, lasting riches and goodness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> My fruit has more value than pure gold; my yield outperforms the finest silver.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I walk in the way of goodness, on the paths of justice,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> to endow with wealth the ones that love me. 22"Yahveh created me at the very beginning, before anything else he did in ancient times.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> I was in place from everlasting, from the beginning of time on earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I came before there were any oceans or any springs abounded with water,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> before the mountains were born or any hills existed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> before he made soil and fields and dust on the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> I was there when he put the heavens in place, and drew the horizons around the ocean;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> when he set the sky above and established the fountains in the deep;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> when he set the shorelines for the seas so water couldn't cross their boundaries; when he marked out the foundations for the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I stood beside him like a general contractor, serving as his daily delight, celebrating with him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> rejoicing in the world he was making, and delighting in humankind. 32"So now, my children, listen to me because I bless those who keep my ways.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Obey instruction in order to be wise; don't neglect it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Blessed are those who pay attention to what I say, who watch at my gates each day and wait at my doorpost.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The ones that find me find life and gain Yahveh's blessing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But those who miss out on me hurt themselves; The ones that hate me love death."</span>
