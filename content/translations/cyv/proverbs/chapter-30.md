## Proverbs Chapter 30

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Words of Agur Ben-Jakeh, an Oracle Agur says to Ithiel and Ucal:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Surely I'm too stupid to be human; I don't have common sense.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I haven't mastered wisdom; I don't know the Holy One.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who but God goes up to the sky and back down or grasps the wind in his fist? Who wraps up the ocean in his cloak or sets the boundaries of land? What's his name? What's his son's name? Tell me if you know!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Every message from God proves true; he's a shield for those who take refuge in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Don't add to what he says; otherwise, he'll reprove you and expose you as a liar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> I ask you for two things before I die:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> first, keep me from being deceived*; second, don't give me poverty or wealth; just give me what I need;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> so, on the one hand, I won't be full and deny you, saying, "Who needs Yahveh?" or, on the other hand, lack what I need and steal to get it, and so profane the name of my God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Don't slander a slave to his master, or he'll curse you and you'll pay for it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Some curse their father and don't bless their mother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Some consider themselves pure, but they're unwashed and filthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Some—how lofty their eyes! how high their brows!—</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> some have teeth like swords and fangs like knives; they devour the poor and needy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> A leech has two daughters that cry, "More, give me more." Three things are never satisfied, no, make that four that never say, "That's enough":</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Sheol, a barren womb, desert ground, and a blazing fire</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The eye that mocks father or scorns mother the ravens in the valley will pluck out, the vultures will eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Three things are too amazing for me, no, make that four I don't understand:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> how an eagle flies in the sky, how a snake slithers on a ledge, how a ship moves on the ocean, and how a man is drawn to a maiden.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> An adulterous woman "consumes" a man, "wipes her mouth," and says, "I haven't done anything wrong."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Under three things the ground trembles, no, make that four, it can't endure:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> a slave that becomes king, a well-fed fool,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> an unloved woman that gets a husband, and a maid that replaces her mistress.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Four things are small but especially wise:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> ants aren't strong, but they store up their food in the summer;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> rock badgers aren't powerful, but they make their homes in the rocks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> locusts don't have a king, but they march out in ranks;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> lizards are easy to catch with your hands, yet they're in kings' palaces.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Three things are stately in their stride, no, four that walk with majestic bearing:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> a lion, powerful and unafraid among the animals;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> a strutting rooster, a billy goat, and a king leading his army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> If you've been foolish by acting proud or putting other people down, cover your mouth in shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As churning cream makes butter and punching a nose makes it bleed, so stirring up anger causes quarrels.</span>
