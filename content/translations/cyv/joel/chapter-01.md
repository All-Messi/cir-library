## Joel Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> A Message from Yahveh to Joel Ben-Pethuel Mourning over a Locust Invasion</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Listen to this, elders; pay attention, everybody in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your lifetime or your ancestors' lifetime?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tell your descendants about it; they need to tell their descendants, and so on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> What the cutting locusts left the swarming locusts have eaten. What the swarming locusts left the hopping locusts have eaten. What the hopping locusts left the stripping locusts have eaten.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Wake up, you drunks, and cry; wail, wine drinkers, for the sweet wine you can't find anymore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> A nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number. Its teeth are like a lion's teeth; it has fangs like a lioness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> It's destroyed my grapevines and ruined my fig trees. It's stripped off their bark and thrown it away, so their branches are bare and white.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Wail like a virgin wearing burlap for her young groom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The grain offering and liquid offering have stopped in Yahveh's Temple. The priests, Yahveh's ministers, mourn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The fields are ruined, the land is bare because the grain has been destroyed, the new wine has dried up, the fresh oil has failed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Despair, farmers; wail, vinedressers, for the wheat and barley; the harvest is ruined.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The grapevines have shriveled up, the fig trees have withered; the pomegranate, palm, and apple trees as well. The fruit trees in the orchard have dried up, the joy among the people too. A Call to Repentance</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Put on burlap and chant a dirge, priests; wail, ministers at the altar! Come, spend the night in burlap, ministers of God, because the grain offerings and liquid offerings have stopped in his Temple.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Consecrate a fast, declare a solemn assembly; gather the elders and the people to Yahveh's Temple, and cry out to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Dread the day! The day of Yahveh is upon us, a day of destruction that's coming from the Almighty.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Hasn't food disappeared in front of us, and happiness left the Temple?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Seeds shrivel under the clods; barns stand empty; granaries are abandoned because the crops have failed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The cattle are bawling! Herds are wandering aimlessly because there's no pasture; flocks of sheep are bleating in misery.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I'm calling out to you, Yahveh, because fire has burned off the open range; flames have burned up the trees in the fields.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Even the wild animals pant for you because the streams have dried up and fire has scorched the pastures. The Day of Yahveh</span>
