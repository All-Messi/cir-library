## Joel Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Blow a bugle in Zion; sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Let the people in the land tremble because the day of Yahveh is coming. It's near,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> a dark and gloomy day, a cloudy day with deep blackness. A numerous, powerful army is spreading out like shadows in the mountains. There's never been anything like them before, and there won't be for ages to come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Fire consumes ahead of them; flames burn behind them. The land is like the Orchard of Eden in front of them, but desolation lies behind them; nothing escapes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They look like horses; they run like steeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> With rumbling like chariots, they leap along on the hilltops— like a crackling flame consuming stubble, like a powerful army in battle formation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Defenders are in anguish in front of them with faces turned pale.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They run like warriors and scale walls like soldiers; they march in line without breaking rank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They don't bump into one another; each one marches straight ahead. When they break through the defenses, they just keep going.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They rush at the city and run along its walls; they climb into houses through windows like thieves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The ground quakes in front of them, the sky shakes, the sun and moon go out, the stars grow dim.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Yahveh raises his voice in front of his army; his camp is large because he's strong that carries out his word. The day of Yahveh is terrifying; who can survive it? A Call to Repentance 12"Yet even now," Yahveh says, "come back to me with all your heart, with fasting, tears, and mourning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Tear you hearts, not your clothes." Come back to him; he's gracious and merciful, slow to get angry, full of enduring love, and relents from carrying out destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Who knows if he'll relent and leave behind a blessing for you, the possibility of offering again a grain offering and a liquid offering for Yahveh your God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Blow a bugle in Zion, consecrate a fast, declare a solemn assembly,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> bring the people together, sanctify the community, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing infants. Have the groom come out of his room and the bride leave her quarters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Let the priests, Yahveh's ministers, weep between the porch and altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, Yahveh. Don't make your permanent possession a disgrace, a byword the world over. Why should they say, 'Where's their God?'" Yahveh Promises Restoration</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then Yahveh will become zealous for his land and take pity on his people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He'll answer them, "I'm going to send you grain, new wine, and olive oil; you'll be satisfied. I'll never again make you a byword the world over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> I'll remove the northern threat far from you and drive him into a parched, desolate land. I'll drive his vanguard into the Dead Sea, his rear guard into the Mediterranean. The stench from rotting bodies will rise over the land." The Lord has done great things!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Don't be afraid, O land; celebrate and be happy because Yahveh has done great things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Don't be afraid, animals in the field, because the pastures in the countryside have turned green. The trees have borne their fruit; the fig tree and vine have given their full yield.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So celebrate, people of Zion; be happy in Yahveh your God because he's given you the autumn rains to vindicate you. He has poured down rain for you, the autumn and spring rains like before.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The threshing floor will be full of grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil. 25 "Then I'll make up to you for the years the swarming locusts, crawling locusts, stripping locusts, and cutting locusts have eaten— the enormous army I sent at you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> You'll have plenty to eat; praise Yahveh your God, who has dealt with you amazingly; then you'll never be disgraced.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> That's how you'll know I'm in the land, that I'm Yahveh your God, and there's no other. Yahveh Promises His Spirit 28"After that, I'll pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people: sons and daughters will prophesy, old men will dream dreams, young men will see visions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> I'll even pour out my Spirit on male and female servants.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> I'll display wonders in the sky and on the earth: blood, fire, and columns of smoke.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> The sun will turn dark, and the moon will turn red before that great, notable day of Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> At that time, he'll save whoever calls on him. On Mount Zion and in Jerusalem people will escape like Yahveh said; among the survivors will be the people Yahveh calls. Judgment Against Enemy Nations</span>
