### Obligations of the Covenant


<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> <u>T</u><u>he rest of the people</u>—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, Temple servants, everybody that separated from the people in the land, their wives, their sons and daughters, everybody that had knowledge and understanding—<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>are joining their kinsmen and nobles in taking a curse and an oath. <em>They</em><em> swear</em> to follow God’s Law through Moses, to observe his commandments, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>and not to intermarry with the people in the territory. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>If any people in the land bring wares or grain to sell on the Sabbath or a holy day, we won’t buy them. We won’t plant crops in the seventh year or exact any debt <em>that year</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> We’ve obligated ourselves to contribute yearly .13 oz <sup>⅓ of a shekel</sup> of silver for the service in God’s Temple: <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>for the showbread, the continual grain offering and burnt offering; the Sabbaths, new moon, and appointed times; for the holy things, the sin offerings to atone for Israel, and the work on God’s Temple.<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Neh 10:</strong><strong>28</strong><strong>-33</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Likewise, we cast lots for supplying wood to the priests, Levites, and the people so they could bring it to God’s Temple by families at set times each year. It was for burning on the altar as the Law requires. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>We committed to</em> bringing the first part of the harvest from our ground and trees to Yahveh’s Temple every year; <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>to bringing our male firstborns, cattle, herds, and flocks as the Law requires, especially in written form, for the priests that minister in God’s Temple. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>We’ll also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the olive oil to the priests at the rooms of God’s Temple. <em>We’ll bring</em> a tenth from our ground to the Levites, because they’re the ones that receive the tithes in the rural towns. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>The priest, the descendant of Aaron, will be with the Levites when they receive the tithes. The Levites will bring up a tenth of the tithes to the storerooms in God’s Temple. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>The people of Israel and the Levites will bring the contribution of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the chambers.  There are the utensils for the sanctuary, the priests that are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers.  That way we won’t neglect the Temple of our God.<strong>	      </strong><strong></span>
