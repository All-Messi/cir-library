## Nehemiah Chapter 11

### The Leaders in Jerusalem

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The people’s leaders <em>already </em>lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one in ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths stayed in the other towns. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The people commended those who volunteered to move to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem, but in the towns of Judah each lived on his own property: the Israelites, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Some of the people of Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From Judah <em>was</em> Athaiah Ben-Uzziah (Ben-Zechariah Ben-Amariah Ben-Shephatiah) Ben-Mahalalel. From Perez <em>was</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Maaseiah Ben-Baruch (Ben-Col-hozeh Ben-Hazaiah Ben-Adaiah Ben-Joiarib) Ben-Zechariah son of the Shilonite. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The descendants of Perez that lived in Jerusalem were 468 capable men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> These are the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu Ben-Meshullam (Ben-Joed Ben-Pedaiah Ben-Kolaiah Ben-Maaseiah Ben-Ithiel) Ben-Jeshaiah; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and after him Gabbai and Sallai: 928. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Joel Ben-Zichri was their overseer.
