## Nehemiah Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> There was a loud outcry by husbands and wives against their fellow Jews. 2Some were saying, "There are a lot of us along with our sons and daughters. We need more food to survive." 3Others said, "We're mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and houses for grain because of the famine." 4Yet others were saying, "We've borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and vineyards. 5Our flesh is like our brothers' flesh, our children like their children; yet we're forcing our children to be slaves. Some of our daughters have already been forced into slavery. We're helpless because we've mortgaged our fields and vineyards to other people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I was irate when I heard their outcries. 7I thought it over and contended with the nobles and rulers, "You're charging your fellow Jews interest?!" I convened a large assembly against them 8and said, "As far as we were able, we've redeemed our Jewish brothers that were sold to Gentiles. Would you even sell your fellow Jews so they can be sold to us?" They couldn't think of anything to say.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Again I said, "What you're doing is not right. Shouldn't you fear God over the mockery by other nations, our enemies? 10I, my brothers, and servants are also lending them money and grain. Quit charging interest! 11Right now, give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves, houses, the hundredth part of the money and grain, new wine, and olive oil that you've been taxing them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They said they'd do it. I called the priests and made them swear to it. 13I shook out the front of my garment, "May God shake out every man's house and possessions who doesn't fulfill that oath. May he shake him out this way and empty him." The assembly said, "Amen!" and praised Yahveh. The offenders did what they vowed. Nehemiah's Generosity</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> From the day the king appointed me governor of Judah, my kinsmen and I had never eaten the governor's food allowance—from the twentieth to thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes (12 years). 15The former governors had laid burdens on the people and took bread and wine from them besides 1 lb 40 shekels of silver. Even their assistants lorded it over the people. I didn't do that because I respected God. 16I applied myself to the work on the wall. We didn't buy any land; my servants gathered there to work. 17There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides those who came from nations around. 18I had an ox and six choice sheep prepared each day as well as birds; every 10 days I provided wine in abundance. But I still didn't demand the governor's food allowance; the people were in heavy servitude. 19God, remember me for the good I've done for them. Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</span>
