## Nehemiah Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>There was a loud outcry by husbands and wives against their fellow Jews. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some were saying, <em>“There are a lot of us along with our sons and daughters.</em><em> We need more food to survive</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Others said, <em>“We’re mortgaging our fields, </em><em>vineyards, and houses for</em><em> grain because of the famine.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Yet </em>others were saying, <em>“We’ve borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>O</em><em>ur flesh is like our brothers</em><em>’ flesh</em><em>, our children like their children</em><em>; yet we’</em><em>re forcing our </em><em>children</em><em> to be slaves</em><em>. S</em><em>ome of our daughters have already been forced into slavery</em><em>. We’</em><em>re helpless because </em><em>we’ve mortgaged </em><em>our fields and vineyards to other people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I was irate when I heard their outcries. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I thought it over and contended with the nobles and rulers, <em>“You’re </em><em>charging </em><em>your </em><em>fellow Jews interest?</em><em>!</em><em>” </em>I convened a large assembly against them <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and said, <em>“As far as we were able, we’ve</em><em> redeemed our Jewish brother</em><em>s that were sold to Gentiles. W</em><em>ould you eve</em><em>n sell your fellow Jews so they can</em><em> be sold to us?”</em><em> </em> <em>	</em>They couldn’t think of anything to say. <strong>	</strong><strong>	  </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Neh 5:1-8</p>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Again I said, <em>“</em><em>What </em><em>you’re doing is </em><em>not right</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Shouldn’t you fear God </em><em>over</em><em> the </em><em>mockery by</em><em> </em><em>other</em><em> nations, our enemies?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I, my brothers, and servants</em><em> are </em><em>also </em><em>lending them money and grain.</em><em> Quit charging interest! </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Right now, g</em><em>ive </em><em>them </em><em>back their fields, vineyard</em><em>s</em><em>, olive groves, houses, the hundredth part </em><em>of the money and grain, new wine, and</em><em> </em><em>olive </em><em>oil that you’</em><em>v</em><em>e </em><em>been taxing</em><em> them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They said they’d do it<em>.</em><em> </em>I called the priests and made them swear to it. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I shook out the front of my garment, <em>“May God shake out e</em><em>very man’s house and </em><em>possessions </em><em>who doesn’t fulfill that oath. M</em><em>ay he shake</em><em> him</em><em> out this way and empt</em><em>y him</em><em>.”</em> The assembly said, <em>“Amen!”</em> and praised Yahveh. The offenders did what they vowed.<strong>	</strong><strong>	 </strong></span>

### Nehemiah’s Generosity


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>From the day the king appointed me governor of Judah, my kinsmen and I had never eaten the governor’s food allowance—from the <strong>twentieth to thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes</strong> (12 years). <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The former governors had laid burdens on the people and took bread and wine from them be</span>

### lb 40 shekels of silver. Even their assistants lorded it over the people. I didn’t do that because I respected God. 16I applied myself to the work on the wall. We didn’t buy any land; my servants gathered there to work. 17There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides those who came from nations around. 18I had an ox and six choice sheep prepared each day as well as birds; every 10 days I provided wine in abundance. But I still didn’t demand the governor’s food allowance; the people were in heavy servitude. 19God, remember me for the good I’ve done for them.	      	  Neh 5:14-19 Conspiracy Against Nehemiah
