<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The heads of the Levites' families were registered at the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua; so were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian. 23The Levites, heads of families, were registered in The Book of Chronicles up to the time of Johanan Ben-Eliashib. 24The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua Ben-Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite to them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division. 25Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub watched over the storehouses by the gates. 26These served at the time of Joiakim Ben-Jeshua Ben-Jozadak, Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe. Dedication of the Walls</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At the dedication of the wall at Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from wherever they were living, to bring them to Jerusalem so they could celebrate the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 28The singers gathered from the district around Jerusalem and the villages around Netophah, 29from Beth-gilgal and their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, because the singers had built villages around Jerusalem. 30The priests and Levites purified themselves, the people, the gates, and the wall.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on the wall, and I appointed two large choirs. The first choir went right on the wall toward the Refuse Gate. 32Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, 33with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 35some of the priests with trumpets; Zechariah Ben-Jonathan (Ben-Shemaiah Ben-Mattaniah Ben-Micaiah Ben-Zaccur Ben-Asaph, 36and his relatives), Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe went ahead of them. 37At the Fountain Gate they went up the steps of The City of David by the stairway of the wall above David's palace to the Water Gate on the east.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> The second choir went left, while I followed them with half the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the broad wall, 39and above the Ephraim Gate, by the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Guard Gate. 40Then the two choirs took their place in God's Temple. So did I and half of the officials with me; 41and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with the trumpets; 42and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang with Jezrahiah their leader, 43and on that day they offered a great number of sacrifices and celebrated because God had made them happy. The women and children celebrated too; the joy in Jerusalem was heard a long way off. Provisions for Temple Worship</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> On that day, men were also appointed to oversee the rooms for storing contributions, firstfruits, and tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites; because Judah celebrated over the priests and Levites that served. 45They performed the worship of God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers according to the command of David and Solomon. 46In the time of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers, and there were songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. 47Israel at the time of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and gatekeepers as each day required. They set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the descendants of Aaron. Nehemiah's Final Reforms</span>
