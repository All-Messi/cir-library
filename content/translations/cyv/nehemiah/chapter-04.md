## Nehemiah Chapter 4

### Opposition to the Work

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and ridiculed the Jews. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>In front of his relatives and wealthy men in Samaria, he asked, <em>“What are these feeble Jews doing?</em><em> </em><em>Are they going to restore it for themselves?</em><em> </em><em>Can they offer sacrifices?</em><em> </em><em>Can they finish</em><em> it</em><em> in a day?</em><em> </em><em>Can they </em><em>remake something out of</em><em> the </em><em>charred </em><em>stones from dusty rubble?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Tobiah the Ammonite was close by and said, <em>“Even </em><em>a fox could jump on </em><em>that stone wall</em><em> they’re building</em><em> and break it down</em><em>!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> <em>“Listen how they despise us, God! Turn their mockery back on their heads and give them up for plunder in a land that takes them captive. </em><strong><em><sup>5</sup></em></strong><em>Don’t forgive them; don’t blot out their sin.</em> <em>They’ve tried to demoralize the builders.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> We were able to join the whole wall together to half its original height because the people were willing to work.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Neh 4:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that repairing the walls was continuing and that we were closing up the breaks in it. They were really mad. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They conspired to fight Jerusalem and create confusion in it, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>but we prayed to God and set up a guard day and night. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The people from Judah were saying, <em>“The </em><em>laborers</em><em> </em><em>were getting worn out</em><em>,</em> <em>but there’s still a lot of rubble to move. We can’t </em><em>rebuild the wall</em><em> ourselves</em><em>.”</em><strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Our enemies said, <em>“They won’</em><em>t know </em><em>it</em><em> ti</em><em>l</em><em>l we </em><em>attack</em><em> them, kill them, and </em><em>stop</em><em> the work.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When the Jews that lived close to them came and told us ten times, <em>“They’</em><em>ll come up against us from every direction</em><em>,”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I stationed men behind the wall in the lowest parts, the exposed places. I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When I saw how afraid they were, I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, <em>“</em><em>You don’t have to be afraid</em><em> of them.</em><em> Remember our great awesome Lord. F</em><em>ight for your brothers, your </em><em>children, your wives and</em><em> houses.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Neh 4:7-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When our enemies heard that we knew about <em>their plan</em><em>s</em> and that God had frustrated it, each of us went back to work on the wall. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>From then on, half of my men worked while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the people of Judah. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The ones that were rebuilding the wall and carrying burdens did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Each one attached his sword to his side as he built while the bugler stood close to me. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, <em>“The work is </em><em>important</em><em> and extensive,</em><em> and we’re a long way</em><em> </em><em>apart</em><em> </em><em>on the wall.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Wherever </em><em>you hear the </em><em>bugle</em><em>, rally there.</em><em> </em><em>Our God will fight for us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> We carried out the work with half of them holding spears from dawn till the stars came out. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>I told the people then, <em>“Each man and his servant</em><em>,</em><em> spend the night inside Jerusalem so </em><em>you can be </em><em>guard</em><em>s at night and workmen</em><em> during the day.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>I, my brothers, servants, and guards didn’t change clothes. Everybody kept a weapon on them.</span>
