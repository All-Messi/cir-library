## Nehemiah Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The wall had been rebuilt, and I'd set up the doors and appointed gatekeepers, singers, and Levites. 2I put Hanani my brother—along with Hananiah commander of the fortress—in charge of Jerusalem because he was a reliable man that respected God more than most. 3I told them, "Don't open the gates till the sun is hot. While they're standing guard, shut and bolt the doors. Appoint guards from the people that live inside Jerusalem, each at his post by his own house."</span>
