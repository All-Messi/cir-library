## Exodus Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 2"Set aside to me every firstborn human and animal."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses told the people, "Think back to today when you came out of slavery in Egypt. With a strong hand Yahveh took you out of here. Don't eat anything with yeast in it. 4Today in the month Abib, you're about to leave. 5When Yahveh takes you to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Hivite, and Jebusite—the land he swore to your ancestors he'd give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—observe this rite in this month. 6Eat bread without yeast for a week. The seventh day, observe a feast to Yahveh. 7Don't have anything containing yeast among you or in your territory. 8Tell your son that day, 'It's because of what Yahveh did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 9It will serve as a sign to you on your hand, a reminder on your forehead, that the Law of Yahveh may be in your mouth, because he brought you out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 10Keep this ordinance every year at its scheduled time. 11"When Yahveh takes you to the territory of the Canaanites, 12devote to him every woman's male firstborn and the first male firstborn of every animal you own. They belong to himY. 13But use a lamb to redeem every firstborn donkey. If you don't redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn son. 14"When your son asks what this means, tell him, 'With a great demonstration of power, Yahveh brought us out of slavery in Egypt. 15When Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, Yahveh killed every firstborn male of people and animals in Egypt; so I sacrifice the firstborn males to Yahveh, but I redeem every firstborn son.' 16It will serve as a reminder on your hand and bands on your forehead that Yahveh brought you out of Egypt with a tremendous demonstration of power." Crossing the Sea</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> When Pharaoh did let the people go, God didn't lead them on the road toward the Philistines, even though it was closer. He said, "They may change their minds when they see war, and head back to Egypt." 18He led them through open country to the Red Sea, and they went up in martial array from Egypt. 19Moses took Joseph's bones with him because he'd made the Israelites solemnly swear, "It's certain that God will take care of you, so carry my bones with you when you leave." 20They set out from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of open country. 21Yahveh went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud during the day, and in a pillar of fire at night to give them light. So they could travel day or night. 22He never took away the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire.</span>
