## Exodus Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Moses was pasturing Jethro’s/<em>Reuel’s </em>flock and led it to the west side of the open country around Horeb/<em>Sinai</em>, the mountain of God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The angel of Yahveh appeared to him in a blazing bush. <em>Moses</em> looked up and saw the bush on fire, but it didn’t burn up. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I have to go over and see this curious thing. Why isn’t it burning up?” </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Yahveh saw him coming to look, he called from the bush, <em>“Moses!”</em> <em>“Yes?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Moses said, <em>“So I’m going to the Israelites to say their ancestors’ God has sent me. What if they ask me what your name is? What will I tell them?” </em></span>
