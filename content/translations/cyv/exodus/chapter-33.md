## Exodus Chapter **33**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Yahveh told Moses, <em>“Leave here and g</em><em>o to the land I swore</em><em> I’d give the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>I’ll send an angel </em><em>ahead</em><em> of you </em><em>to</em><em> drive out the Canaanite, Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey.</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> won’t </em><em>go up </em><em>with you</em><em>, because you’re stubborn, so I won’t destroy you on the way.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>When the people heard that discouraging word, they went into mourning; nobody put on jewelry. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Yahveh had told Moses,<em> </em><em>“Tell them, ‘You’re being stubborn. If I’d go up among you for a moment, I’d destroy you. So take off your jewelry so I’ll know what I’m to do with you.’” </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They didn’t wear jewelry from Mount Horeb/<em>Sinai</em> on.</span>

### The Tent of Meeting


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Moses would pitch a tent a good distance outside the camp—what he called The Tent of Meeting. Anybody that wanted to consult Yahveh would go out to it. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Whenever Moses went out, everybody would stand at the entrance of his tent and watch him till he went into the tent. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance, and Yahveh would talk to him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When people saw the pillar, they would worship at their own tents. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Yahveh would speak to Moses directly, the way you talk to a friend. When Moses would come back to the camp, his assistant Joshua Ben-Nun, a young man, would stay behind at the tent.</span>

### Moses Sees the Glory of the LORD


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then Moses told Yahveh, <em>“You </em><em>tell</em><em> me</em><em> to bring</em><em> t</em><em>he people up, but you haven’t let me know who you’</em><em>ll send with me.</em><em> </em><em>You’ve s</em><em>aid you knew me by name, and you’ve been gracious to me. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>et me kn</em><em>ow your ways so I can know you and please</em><em> you.</em><em>  C</em><em>onsider this nation your people.</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“My presence will go with you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>, and I’ll give you rest.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“If you don’t go with us, don’t take us away from here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>How can your people </em><em>and I know we’r</em><em>e</em><em> being</em><em> </em><em>pleasing to</em><em> you?</em><em> </em><em>Isn’t it by having you with us so we can tell the difference between </em><em>ourselves</em><em> </em><em>and</em><em> other people?”</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 33:12-16</p>

### 17“I’ll do what you’ve asked, because you’re pleasing to me, and I know you by name.” 18“Show me your glory.” 19“I’ll make my goodness pass by in front of you, and show you who I am. I’ll decide who to give grace to and who to show mercy to. 20But you can’t see my face. Nobody can see me and live! 21Here’s a place beside me; stand on that rock. 22While my glory is passing by, I’ll put you in a crevice in the rock and cover you with my hand till I’m past. 23Then I’ll take my hand away, and you can see my back; but you won’t see my face.”	 Ex 33:17-23 The New Stone Tablets
