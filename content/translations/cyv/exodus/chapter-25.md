### The Ark of the Covenant	  10“Have them build an Ark out of acacia wood 45 x 27 x 27ins high. 11Overlay it with pure gold inside and out and make a gold molding around it. 12Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four bottom corners.  13“Make poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 14Put them into the rings on each side of the Ark for carrying it, 15and leave them in the rings.  16“The Testimony I’m going to give you, put in the ark  17“Make a mercy seat out of pure gold 45 x 27 x 27ins.  18“Make two cherubs out of hammered gold for the two ends of the mercy seat. 19Make each of them one piece 20with wings spread upward and facing each other. 21Put the mercy seat on top of the Ark. 22I’ll meet you above the mercy seat. From between the two cherubs, I’ll tell you the commandments to give Israel.	 	   Ex 25:10-22 The Table for the Bread of Presence 23“Make a table out of acacia wood 36 x 18 x 27ins high. 24Overlay it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 25Make a rim around it a hand’s width and a gold border for the rim. 26Make four gold rings and put them on the four bottom corners. 27Put the rings close to the rim to hold the poles that carry the table. 28Make the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold.  29“Make for it pure-gold dishes, jars, and bowls for pouring liquid offerings.  30“Keep the Bread of the Presence in front of me on the table at all times. 								     		       Ex 25:23-30 The Golden Lampstand 31“Make a lampstand out of pure gold with a base and shaft. Its cups, bulbs, and flowers will be one piece. 32It’ll have 6 branches, 3 on a side. 333 cups shaped like almond blossoms will be on one branch—a bulb and flower, and 3 cups shaped like almond blossoms on the other branch—a bulb and flower, 34and on the lampstand 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms—its bulbs and flowers. 35Put a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches—coming out of it. That makes 6 branches coming out of the lampstand. 36The whole thing will be one piece of hammered pure gold. 37Make its lamps so they shine forward. 38Its snuffers and their trays will be pure gold. 39Make it from 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold, with all its utensils. 40Be sure to make them in the design I showed you on the mountain.
