<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“Present</em><em> these ordinances </em><em>to</em><em> the people.</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em>f you buy a Hebrew slave, he’ll serve </em><em>six</em><em> years </em><em>and go free on</em><em> the seventh </em><em>without pay</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If he came alone, he’ll go out alone. I</em><em>f he</em><em> has </em><em>a wife, they</em><em>’ll </em><em>go out </em><em>together</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her child</em><em>ren belong to her master, and the slave wi</em><em>ll go out alone.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>But if the slave says he</em><em> lo</em><em>ves his</em><em> master, </em><em>his wife</em><em> and children</em><em>, and won’t leave</em><em> </em><em>them to be a free man,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>his master is to take him to the judges—</em><em>to the door or doorpost</em><em>—and pierce his ear with an awl.

### Cases About Personal Injury 12“Execute anyone that assaults and kills someone. 13If it was an accident, I’ll designate a safe place the slayer can flee to. 14But take even from the horns of my altar anyone that does premeditated murder.		 15“Executef anybody that hits his father or mother. 16“Executef kidnappers whether they hold in possession or sell the one they kidnapped.   17“Executef anybody that cusses at father or mother.	 Ex 21:12-17 18“If men are fighting and one strikes the other with a stone or his fist and he doesn’t die, but is laid up, 19if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then don’t punishf the one that hit him. He’ll pay for the man’s loss of time and take care of him till he fully recovers. 20“If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies, punish him. 21If the slave survives a day or so, there’s no punishment; he’s his property. 22“If men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she miscarries without further injury, fine him as her husband requires and the judges determine. 23But if there’s further harm, punishf life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.	Ex 21:18-25 26“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he’ll free the slave for the eye. 27If he knocks out his male or female slave’s tooth, he’ll free the slave for the tooth. 28“If an ox gores a man or woman to death, stone it, don’t eat it, and don’t punish the owner. 29But if it has gored before and its owner knew it and didn’t pen it up, if it kills somebody, stone the ox and execute the owner. 30If a ransom is demanded from him, he’ll give whatever the relatives demand for loss of life. 31If it gores a son or daughter, the same rule applies. 32If it gores a male or female slave, the owner has to give the slave’s master 12 oz 30 shekels of silver. Stone the ox. Ex 21:26-32	 33“If someone digs a pit without covering it up and an ox or donkey falls in it, 34the pit’s owner has to pay the animal’s owner for the loss, and the dead animal becomes his.  35“If one man’s ox kills another man’s ox, sell the live ox, divide the sale price, and divide the dead ox between them. 36If it was previously known to gore and its owner didn’t pen it up, he’ll pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.
