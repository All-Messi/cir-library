## Exodus Chapter 31

### Bezalel and Oholiab

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I've specifically called Bezalel Ben-Uri Ben-Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 3I've filled him with my spirit in wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> in cutting stones for settings and carving in wood.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I've appointed with him Oholiab Ben-Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan. In the hearts of everybody that's skilled, I've put the skill to make everything:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, the mercy seat on top of it, the furniture in the tent,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> the table and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with its utensils, the altar of incense,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> the altar of burnt offering with its utensils, the laver with its stand,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> the holy woven vestments for Aaron and his sons for carrying out their priesthood,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They're to make them the way I told you. The Sabbath [12] 13"Tell the Israelites to observe my Sabbaths. They're a sign between you and me throughout your generations so you can know I'm Yahveh who sanctifies you. 14The Sabbath is set aside for you. Execute anybody that profanes it. Exclude from the community whoever works on it. 15Work for six days, but the seventh day will be a complete rest set aside to meY. 16Israelites will observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a continuing covenant. 17It's a permanent sign between them and me, because IY made earth and sky in six days, but stopped working on the seventh day and was refreshed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When God finished speaking to him on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the Testimony that God wrote with his own finger. The Golden Calf</span>
