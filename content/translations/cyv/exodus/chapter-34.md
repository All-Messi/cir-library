<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses, <em>“Carve out </em><em>two stone tablets like the first ones, and I’ll write on them what was on the tablets you shattered.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Be ready by morning.</em><em> </em><em>Come up</em><em> to the top of Mount Sinai</em><em> and present yourself</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>alone. N</em><em>obo</em><em>dy can be on the mountain. F</em><em>locks and herds can’t graze </em><em>by</em><em> </em><em>it</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He carved two stone tablets like the first ones, got up early, and took them up to Mount Sinai. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Yahveh came down in a cloud and stood there with him as he called on Yahveh. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He passed by <em>Moses</em> and proclaimed, <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> God, </em><em>merciful</em><em> and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness</em><em>; </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>who </em><em>shows</em><em> kindness </em><em>to</em><em> thousand</em><em>s;</em><em> forgives i</em><em>niquity, transgression, and sin;</em><em> yet </em><em>doesn’t leave</em><em> guilty </em><em>people </em><em>unpunished </em><em>and visits</em><em> </em>the consequences of <em>parents’ sins on their descendants for</em><em> </em><em>three or four</em><em> generations</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

### The Glowing Face of Moses


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (with the tablets in hand), he didn’t realize his face was glowing because he’d been speaking with <em>Yahveh</em>. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>When Aaron and the Israelites saw<em> </em>his face glowing, they were afraid to get close to him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>He called out to them, and Aaron and the rulers in the community came back to him. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>He told them <em>to do</em> everything Yahveh had told him on Mount Sinai. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When he finished talking, he put on a veil. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Whenever he went to speak to Yahveh, he’d take it off till he came out to report what Yahveh had said. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>The <em>people</em> would see his face glowing, and he’d put the veil <em>back </em>on till he went in to speak to <em>Yahveh again.</em><em>	</em><strong>Ex 34:29-35</strong> <strong>Sabbath Regulations</strong></span>
