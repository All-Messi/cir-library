N</em><em>obo</em><em>dy can be on the mountain. F</em><em>locks and herds can’t graze </em><em>by</em><em> </em><em>it</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>He carved two stone tablets like the first ones, got up early, and took them up to Mount Sinai. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Yahveh came down in a cloud and stood there with him as he called on Yahveh. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He passed by <em>Moses</em> and proclaimed, <em>“</em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> God, </em><em>merciful</em><em> and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness</em><em>; </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>who </em><em>shows</em><em> kindness </em><em>to</em><em> thousand</em><em>s;</em><em> forgives i</em><em>niquity, transgression, and sin;</em><em> yet </em><em>doesn’t leave</em><em> guilty </em><em>people </em><em>unpunished </em><em>and visits</em><em> </em>the consequences of <em>parents’ sins on their descendants for</em><em> </em><em>three or four</em><em> generations</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Moses immediately bowed to the ground in worship<em>. </em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“If I’m pleasing to</em><em> you, </em><em>Yahveh</em><em>, go along </em><em>with us</em><em>, even though </em><em>we’ve been</em><em> so stubborn.</em><em> Pardon our sin</em><em> and take us as your own.”</em><em>	 </em></span>
