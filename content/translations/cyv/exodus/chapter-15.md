## Exodus Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Yahveh: "I'll sing to Yahveh because he's triumphed gloriously; he's thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh is my strength and song; he is my salvation. He's my God, and I'll praise him, my ancestors' God, and I'll honor him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> He's a soldier; his name is Yahveh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He has thrown Pharaoh's chariots and army into the Red Sea; his elite officers have drowned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The depths covered them; they sank like rocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Your right hand, Yahveh, was majestic in its power; it shattered the enemy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> In your extreme excellence, you overthrew your opponents. You sent out your burning anger that consumed them like chaff.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> At the blast of your nostrils, the water piled up; liquid water stood in a heap; the depths of the sea congealed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The enemy said, 'I'll pursue, I'll overtake, I'll divide up spoil; I'll satisfy my desire against them; I'll draw out my sword and destroy them.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You blew with your wind; the sea covered them; they sank like lead in deep water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> You reached out your hand, and the earth swallowed them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In your kindness you led the people you redeemed; in your strength you guided them to your sacred abode.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The nations have heard and tremble; anguish has gripped the people in Philistia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The chiefs in Edom are scared; the leaders in Moab tremble; the people in Canaan melt away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Panic and dread have fallen on them; by your great power they're as still as stone, until your people pass over, until the people pass over that you've bought.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You'll take them and plant them in the mountain in your permanent possession, where you've made yourself a place to live.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Yahveh will reign forever."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, and Yahveh washed the water back over them; but the Israelites walked through on dry seabed. 20Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine and went out with the women with tambourines and dancing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> She lined out a song to them, "Sing to Yahveh because he has triumphed gloriously; he threw the horse and its rider into the sea."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Moses led the Israelites from the Red Sea to the Wilderness of Shur. They traveled three days without finding water. 23When they got to Marah, the water was too "brackish" to drink. That's why it was called Marah. 24The people complained to Moses, "What are we going to drink?" 25He called out to Yahveh, and he showed him a tree. Moses threw it in the water and made it drinkable. Yahveh made a statute and regulation to test them. 26"If you sincerely pay attention to me, do what I consider right, listen to my commandments, and keep my statutes, I won't put any disease on you that I put on the Egyptians, because I'm your healer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They came to Elim with its 12 springs and 70 date palms, and camped there beside the water. Manna and Quail</span>
