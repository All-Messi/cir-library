## Exodus Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, "Go to Pharaoh; I've hardened his and his officers' hearts so I can perform these signs among them 2and you can tell your sons and grandsons how I mocked the Egyptians with my signs, and so you can know I'm Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, "Yahveh God of the Hebrews says, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself toward me? Let my people go so they can serve me. 4If you don't, I'll bring locusts to your realm tomorrow. 5They'll cover the ground so thick you can't see it. They'll eat what the hail didn't ruin, every tree that sprouts in your field. 6Your houses, your officers' houses, every Egyptian's house will be full of them—something your fathers and grandfathers have never seen.'" He turned and left. 7Pharaoh's officials said, "How long will that man hold us hostage? Let the men go so they can serve Yahveh their God. Can't you see that Egypt's destroyed?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Pharaoh brought Moses and Aaron back, "Go serve Yahveh your God! Who are going?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Moses said, "We'll all go with our flocks and herds to hold a festival to Yahveh." 10-11Pharaoh said, "Oh, no! Yahveh help you if I ever let you and your little ones go! Don't tempt me; you have ulterior motives. The men among you can go serve Yahveh. That's what you've been asking for." Pharaoh drove them out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, "Hold your hand out over Egypt; locusts will come up on the land and eat the plants the hail left." 13He held his staff out over Egypt, and Yahveh made an east wind blow all that day and night. In the morning, it brought the locusts, 14and they landed everywhere. There had never been so many, and there never would be again. 15They covered the ground till it was black. They ate every plant and fruit tree the hail had left. There wasn't anything green on the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Pharaoh hurried and called for Moses and Aaron, "I've sinned against you and Yahveh your God. 17Forgive me just this once and pray to him to remove this death from me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Yahveh. 19He shifted the wind to a strong west wind that blew the locusts into the Red Sea. Not a one was left in Egypt. 20But Yahveh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let the people go. The Plague of Darkness</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then he told Moses, "Lift your hand toward the sky; it'll be so dark you can feel it." 22Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and a dense darkness covered Egypt for three days. 23People couldn't see each other, it was so dark. Nobody got up from where they were for three days, but the Israelites had light in their houses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Pharaoh called to Moses, "Go serve Yahveh. Just leave your flocks and herds here. Even your little ones can go with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But Moses said, "You need to let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to Yahveh our God.  26Our livestock has to go with us. Not a hoof will stay here. We'll take some of them to serve Yahveh. We don't know what we'll serve him with till we get there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But Yahveh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go. 28He told Moses, "Get out of here! I'm warning you, don't ever see me again. The day you do you'll die!" 29"You're right. I'll never see you again." Plague on the Firstborn</span>
