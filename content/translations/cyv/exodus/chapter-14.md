## Exodus Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh said to Moses,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> When the king found out they’d left, he and his officials changed their minds, <em>“What have we done, letting </em><em>them</em><em> </em><em>leave</em><em> from serving us?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He got his chariot ready and took his troops: <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>600 select chariots as well as all the rest of Egypt’s chariots and their officers. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>As the Israelites were leaving boldly, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>the Egyptians chased them with Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, cavalry, and troops. They caught up with them camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth across from Baal-zephon.<strong> </strong><strong>  </strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 14:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> As Pharaoh got close, the Israelites saw the Egyptians marching after them. They panicked and cried out to Yahveh. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They asked Moses, <em>“</em><em>Was it because there weren’t any</em><em> graves in Egypt that you’ve </em><em>brought</em><em> us </em><em>out</em><em> to die in the </em><em>desert</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>did you</em><em> bring us out of Egypt?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Didn’t we tell you to just let</em><em> us serve the</em><em> Egyptians? It would’</em><em>ve been better to serve the</em><em>m than </em><em>die in the </em><em>desert</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But Moses told them, <em>“Don’t be afraid!</em><em> </em><em>Stand by and </em><em>watch Yahveh deliver you</em><em>.</em><em> The Egyptians you see</em><em> today</em><em> </em><em>you’ll never see again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>He’ll fight for you while you</em><em> </em><em>just watch</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em> <em>	</em><strong>Ex</strong><em> </em><strong>14:10-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, <em>“Why </em><em>call</em><em> out to me?</em><em> </em><em>Tell the Israel</em><em>ites</em><em> to go forward.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>L</em><em>ift</em><em> up your staff and hold your</em><em> hand out over the sea to separat</em><em>e it.</em><em> </em><em>The Israel</em><em>ites</em><em> will go through </em><em>it </em><em>on dry </em><em>seabed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> harden the Egyptians’ hearts so they’ll go in after </em><em>you; Pharaoh, his army, </em><em>chariots</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>cavalry</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em><u>The Egyptians will know I’m </u></em><em><u>Yahveh</u></em><em> when Pharaoh, his chariots</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>cavalry honor me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> God’s angel that had been going ahead of Israel, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front to in back. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The cloud and the darkness stood between the camps of Egypt and Israel; yet it gave light at night so they wouldn’t come close to each other all night. <strong>Ex 14:15-20</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then Moses held his hand out over the sea, and Yahveh pushed it back with a strong east wind all night. He separated the water and dried up the seabed. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The Israelites went through the sea on dry seabed with the water like a wall on their left and right. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went in after them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Just before dawn, Yahveh looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud and threw them into confusion. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He made their chariot wheels wobble so they were hard to drive. The Egyptians shouted, <em>“</em><em>Retreat! Yahveh’s fighting for Israel!</em><em>”</em><strong>           </strong><strong>	      </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	       </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	       </strong><strong>	       </strong><strong>Ex 14:21-25</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Yahveh told Moses, <em>“</em><em>Hold</em><em> your hand </em><em>out </em><em>over the sea so the water </em><em>will wash</em><em> back over the Egyptians, their chariots, and </em><em>cavalry</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The sea washed back to its normal position at daybreak while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it. He overthrew them in the sea. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>The water washed back over the chariots and cavalry. Not a one in Pharaoh’s entire army remained who followed the Israelites into the sea. [<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Israel saw them dead on the shore. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>When they saw the great power Yahveh had used against the Egyptians, they feared him and trusted him and Moses.</span>
