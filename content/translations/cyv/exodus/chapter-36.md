## Exodus Chapter 36

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Bezalel, Oholiah, and every person skilled by Yahveh are to perform their work as commanded."	 Ex 35:30-36:1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and their artisans to begin the work. 3They received from him the contributions for building the sanctuary. [4] 5They told him, "The people are bringing more than we need." 6He circulated a message throughout the camp that they didn't need to contribute anything more. [7]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Bezalel and his artisans made the Tabernacle with 10 curtains from finely twined linen and from blue, purple, and scarlet material with cherubs, 9each one 42 x 6ft. 10He joined the 2 sets of 5 curtains, 11and made blue loops along the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 12He made 50 loops in each curtain and set the curtains across from each other. 13He made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains with them so the Tabernacle formed a unit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then he made curtains out of goats' hair for a tent over the Tabernacle—11 in all. 15Each one was 45 x 6ft. 16He connected 5 curtains to make one set and connected the other 6 curtains to make a second set. 17He made 50 loops each on the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 18He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together. 19He made the covering of the tent out of rams' skins dyed red with a covering of goatskins over it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He made the upright boards out of acacia wood, 21each one 15ft x 27in. .22Each board had a mortise and tenon so they'd fit together. 23He made 20 boards for the south side 24with 40 silver bases under the 20 boards. 25-26He did the same for the north side. 27He made 6 boards for the back, the west end of the Tabernacle. 28He made 2 boards for the corners of the Tabernacle in the back; 29they were double underneath. Together they were complete to the top—to the first ring. He did the same for the other corner. 30There were 8 boards with their 16 bases—2 under each board.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He formed bars out of acacia wood, 5 for each side of the Tabernacle 32and 5 for the back of it. 33The middle bar passed through the center of the boards from one end of the Tabernacle to the other. 34He overlaid the boards with gold, shaped their rings out of gold to hold the bars, and made the bars out of gold—an artisan's work.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He made the curtain out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen decorated with cherubs. 36He shaped 4 posts out of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and cast 4 silver bases for them. 37For the door to the tent, he fashioned a screen woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 38He formed its 5 posts with their hooks and overlaid their tops and bands with gold; their bases were bronze.
