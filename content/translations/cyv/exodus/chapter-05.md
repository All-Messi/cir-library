## Exodus Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, "Yahveh, Israel's God, says to let his people go so they can celebrate a festival to him in the open country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahveh that I should obey him? I don't know him. I'm not going to let them go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day's journey into open country to sacrifice to Yahveh our God so he won't fall on us with disease or sword."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The king said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to pull the people away from their work? Get back to work! 5Look at how many there are, and you want them to stop working!" Making Bricks Without Straw</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That same day Pharaoh told the taskmasters and their foremen, 7"Don't give them straw anymore to make bricks. They can gather their own straw! 8But don't reduce their quota. They're lazy, so they're crying out, 'Let us go sacrifice to our God.' 9Give them more work so they won't get false ideas in their heads."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The taskmasters and their foremen went out to the people, "Pharaoh says he's not going to give you straw anymore. 11Get your own wherever you can find it, but your quota will stay the same. 12The people scattered out across Egypt to gather stubble. 13The taskmasters pressed them, "Make your daily quota like when you had straw." 14What's more, Pharaoh's taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen that they'd set over them, "Why haven't you completed your required amount yesterday or today?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Israelite foremen came and appealed to Pharaoh, "Why are you treating us like this? 16We don't have any straw, but they keep telling us to make bricks! They're beating us, but it's your own people's fault." 17"You're lazy, very lazy. That's why you want me to let you go sacrifice to Yahveh. 18Get to work. You won't be given any straw, but you still have to make your quotas."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The foremen saw they were in trouble. 20When they left him, they met Moses and Aaron, waiting for them. 21They said, "Yahveh condemn you! You've made us offensive to Pharaoh and his officers! You've put a sword in their hand to kill us!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Moses went back to Yahveh and said, "Why hurt the people? Why send me? 23Since I spoke to Pharaoh in your name, he's been hurting them more. You haven't delivered them at all." Promise of Deliverance</span>
