## Exodus Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, <em>“Yahveh, Israel’s God,</em> <em>says to let his people go so they can celebrate a festival to him in the open country.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Pharaoh said, <em>“Who is Yahveh that I should obey him? I don’t know him. I’m not going to let them go.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> They said, <em>“The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day’s journey into open country to sacrifice to Yahveh our God so he won’t fall on us with disease or sword.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The king said, <em>“Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to pull the people away from their work? Get back to work!</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Look at how many there are, and you want them to stop working!”</em> <strong>Making Bricks Without Straw</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> That same day Pharaoh told the taskmasters and their foremen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The taskmasters and their foremen went out to the people, <em>“Pharaoh says he’s not going to give you straw anymore. </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Get your own wherever you can find it, but your quota will stay the same. </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The people scattered out across Egypt to gather stubble. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The taskmasters pressed them, <em>“Make your daily quota like when you had straw.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>What’s more, Pharaoh’s taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen that they’d set over them, <em>“Why haven’t you completed your required amount yesterday or today?”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 5:10-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Israelite foremen came and appealed to Pharaoh, <em>“Why are you treating us like this? </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>We don’t have any straw, but they keep telling us to make bricks! They’re beating us, but it’s your own people’s fault.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The foremen saw they were in trouble. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>When they left him, they met Moses and Aaron, waiting for them. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They said, <em>“Yahveh condemn you! You’ve made us offensive to Pharaoh and his officers! You’ve put a sword in their hand to kill us!”  </em><em>	</em><strong>Ex 5:15-21</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Moses went back to Yahveh and said<em>, </em> <em>“Why hurt the people? Why </em><em><u>send</u></em><em> me? </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Since I spoke to Pharaoh in your name, he’s been hurting them more. You haven’t delivered them at all.”</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	    </em><em>	</em><em>	    </em> <strong>Promise of Deliverance</strong></span>
