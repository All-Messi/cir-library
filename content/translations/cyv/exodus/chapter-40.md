<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, 2"The first day, first month, set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 3Put the Ark of Testimony in it and screen it off with the curtain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Take the table in and arrange what goes on it; take the lampstand in and mount the lamps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Place the gold altar for incense in front of the Ark of Testimony, and set up the curtain across the door to the Tabernacle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Put the altar of burnt offering in front of the door to the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Set the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Set up the court around it and hang the curtain across the entrance. 9Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate it and its furnishings to be holy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Anoint the altar for burnt offering and the utensils to consecrate the altar. The altar will be the most holy item.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then take Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and bathe them. 13Dress Aaron in the holy vestments and anoint him to consecrate him so he can serve as a priest to me. 14Bring his sons and put tunics on them. 15Anoint them like you anointed him. Their anointing will appoint them as an ongoing permanent priesthood."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Moses did everything Yahveh told him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The first day, first month, second year, he set up the Tabernacle:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> laid its bases, set up its boards, inserted its bars, and set up its posts; 19he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering on it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> put the Testimony in the Ark, attached the poles to it, put the mercy seat on top of it, 21took it into the Tabernacle, and screened it off;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> put the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the Tabernacle outside the curtain, 23and arranged the bread on it in front of Yahveh;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, across from the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, 25and lit the lamps in front of Yahveh;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> put the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain, 27and burned fragrant incense on it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> set up the curtain for the door to the Tabernacle, 29set the altar for burnt offering in front of the door, and offered the burnt offering and meal offering on it;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> put the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar with water in it for washing; 31out of it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet 32when they went into the Tent of Meeting to approach the altar;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> set up the court around the Tabernacle and the altar and hung a curtain across the court entrance. So Moses finished the work. The Glory of the LORD</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahveh's glory filled the Tabernacle. 35Moses couldn't go into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and Yahveh's glory of Yahveh filled it. 36During their travels, whenever the cloud rose up from the Tabernacle, the Israelites would move out. 37If it didn't rise up, they'd stay till it did. 38The cloud was on the Tabernacle during the day; fire was in it at night where Israel could see it.</span>
