## Exodus Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh said to Moses, "Go tell Pharaoh Yahveh says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you don't, he'll strike the whole country with frogs. 3The Nile will teem with them. They'll come up into your house, your bedroom, your bed, your officials' houses and on your people, in your ovens and kneading bowls. [4]'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then Yahveh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to hold his staff out over the rivers, canals, and pools, and make frogs come up all over the ground."  6Aaron held his hand out over the water, and frogs came up and covered the whole country. 7The magicians did the same thing with their magic, and made frogs come up on the ground everywhere in Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, "Ask Yahveh to take the frogs away; I'll let the people go sacrifice to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Moses asked, "When should I ask for the frogs to leave you and your houses, and be only in the Nile?" 10"Tomorrow." "All right; so you can know there's nobody like Yahveh our God, 11the frogs will leave everywhere except in the Nile."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Moses left Pharaoh and called out to Yahveh about the frogs. 13Yahveh did what he asked; the frogs died in the houses, courts, and fields. 14They piled them up and the country reeked. 15When Pharaoh saw relief, he hardened his heart and wouldn't listen. The Plague of Gnats</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh told Moses, "Tell Aaron to strike the dust on the ground with his staff so it becomes gnats everywhere in Egypt." 17He struck it, and it became gnats everywhere in Egypt. 18The magicians tried with their magic to bring gnats, but they couldn't. There were gnats on people and animals. 19The magicians told Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh hardened his heart and wouldn't listen. The Plague of Flies</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Yahveh told Moses, "Get up early and present yourself to Pharaoh when he comes out to the water. Tell him Yahveh says to let his people go so they can serve him. 21If you don't, he'll send swarms of flies on you, your officers, your people, and in your houses. They'll infest the Egyptians' houses and cover the ground. 22But he won't send them on Goshen, where his people live. You'll know he's in the land. 23He'll distinguish his people from yours tomorrow.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Yahveh did that. Huge swarms of insects were in Pharaoh's palace and his officers' houses. They covered the ground everywhere in Egypt. 25Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, "Go sacrifice to your God inside the country."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> But Moses said, "That won't work. We'd be sacrificing to Yahveh our God what's detestable to Egyptians. Wouldn't they stone us? 27We have to go a three-day's journey into the open country and sacrifice to Yahveh like he said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Pharaoh said, "I'll let you go so you can sacrifice to Yahveh your God in the countryside. But you can't go very far. Pray for me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Moses said, "I'm leaving; I'll pray to Yahveh that the swarms of insects will leave tomorrow. But you must not lie again and not let the people go sacrifice to himY."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Moses left and prayed to Yahveh, 31and he took the swarms away completely. 32But Pharaoh hardened his heart that time too and wouldn't let the people go. The Plague on Livestock</span>
