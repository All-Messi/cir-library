## Exodus Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Make an altar out of acacia wood, 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high 2with a horn on each corner. Make them one piece with the altar and overlaid with bronze. 3"Make bronze pails for removing the ashes, bronze shovels, basins, forks, and fire pans. 4"Make a network of bronze grating for it, and on the network put four bronze rings at the corners. 5Put the grating under the ledge of the altar so it reaches halfway up the altar. 6"For the altar make acacia poles overlaid with bronze. 7Insert the poles into the rings on the two sides of the altar for carrying it. 8Make it hollow with planks like you saw on the mountain. The Court of the Tabernacle 9"Make a court for the Tabernacle. Its south side will have curtains made out of finely twined linen 150ft long for one side. 10It'll have 20 posts with 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts will be silver. 11Make the north side of the court the same way. 12The west end of the court will have 75ft of curtains with 10 posts with their 10 bases. 13The east end of the court will be 75ft wide. 14The curtains for one side of the entrance will be 22½ft long with 3 posts and their 3 bases. 15Make the other side of the entrance the same way. 16The entrance to the court will be a screen 30ft wide woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material with finely twined linen; with 4 posts and their 4 bases. 17The posts around the court will have silver bands with silver hooks and bronze bases. 18The court will be 150 x 75ft with curtains 7½ft high and bronze bases under its posts. 19Make out of bronze the Tabernacle's utensils of service, its pegs, and the pegs in the court. Oil for the Lamp 20"Charge the people to bring pure oil from mashed olives for a continually burning light in the lamp. 21In the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will keep the light burning from evening to morning in front of Yahveh—a permanent statute for Israel's descendants.
