## Exodus Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told him, "I'm making you like God to him, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 2Say what I tell you, and Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let Israel leave his country. 3But I'll harden his heart so I can multiply my signs and wonders. 4When he won't listen to you, I'll lay my hand on Egypt and take out my people with tremendous acts of judgment. 5The Egyptians will know I'm Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses and Aaron did what he said. 7Moses was 80 and Aaron was 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.	Ex 6:28-7:7</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yahveh told Moses and Aaron, 9"When Pharaoh says to work a miracle, throw down your staff, and it'll become a snake." 10They went to Pharaoh. Aaron threw down his staff for him and his officers to see, and it became a snake. 11Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with magic. 12Each one threw down his staff, and it also turned into a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up theirs. 13Pharaoh's heart was still hardened, and he wouldn't listen. The Plague of Blood</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh told Moses, "Pharaoh is stubborn and refuses to let the people go. 15In the morning, go meet him on the bank of the Nile. Take the staff that turned into a snake 16and say, 'Yahveh God of the Hebrews sent me, "Let my people go to serve me in the open country," but you've ignored me. 17This is how you'll know I'm Yahveh: I'll strike the water in the Nile with my staff, and it'll turn to blood. 18The fish will die, and it'll stink. The Egyptians won't be able to drink it."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then Yahveh said to Moses, "Have Aaron hold his staff out over the water in Egypt's rivers, canals, pools, and reservoirs so it will turn to blood. There will be blood everywhere in Egypt, even in wood and stone containers."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Moses and Aaron did that. He struck the water in the Nile with his staff for Pharaoh and his officers to see, and the water turned to blood. 21The fish in the Nile died, and it stunk. The Egyptians couldn't drink it. There was blood everywhere in Egypt. 22But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he wouldn't listen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Pharaoh returned to his palace without concerning himself with that either. 24The Egyptians dug along the Nile for water because they couldn't drink the water in it. 25A week went by. The Plague of Frogs</span>
