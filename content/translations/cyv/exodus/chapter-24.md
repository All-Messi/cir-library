## Exodus Chapter 24

### The Covenant Confirmed

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Yahveh<em> </em>told Moses,<em> “Come up to me</em><em><sup>Y</sup></em><em> and worship at a distance—you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders. </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>You alone will approach me; the others and the community can’t approach </em>me<em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses recounted to the people Yahveh’s ordinances, and they answered together, <em>“We’ll do </em><em>what</em><em> </em><em>he’</em><em>s said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Moses wrote them down. Then he got up early and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with 12 pillars for the 12 tribes. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He sent young men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as peace offerings. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Moses put half of the blood in basins and sprinkled the other half on the altar. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He read the covenant to the people. They said, <em>“We’ll </em><em>do</em><em> </em><em>what</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has said.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Moses sprinkled the blood on them, <em>“</em>This is <em>t</em><em>he blood of the covenant </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has made with you.”</em><em>  </em><em>                                                                       </em><strong>Ex 24:1-8</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what looked like an expanse of sapphire as clear as the sky. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Yet he didn’t reach out against the nobles of Israel; they looked at him and ate and drank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Yahveh told Moses, <em>“Come up </em><em>to me on the mountain and stay </em><em>here.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll give you the stone tablets with </em><em>the L</em><em>aw I’ve commanded and written </em><em>to instruct them</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Moses and Joshua his assistant went up on the mountain of God. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But he told the elders, <em>“Wait here </em><em>till</em><em> we </em><em>get</em><em> back.</em><em> </em><em>Aaron and Hur are with you.</em><em> </em><em>If anybody has a legal problem, go to them.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Then he went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Yahveh’s brightness rested on Mount Sinai for six days. On the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the cloud. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>To the people of Israel Yahveh’s brightness looked like a flagrant fire on the mountain. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Moses went into the cloud as he climbed the mountain and was there for 40 days.</span>
