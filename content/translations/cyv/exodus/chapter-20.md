Don't have God speak to us—so we won't die." 20Moses told them, "Don't be afraid. God has come to test you, to make you respect him and not sin." 21They stood a long way off while Moses approached the dark cloud where God was. The Proper Use of Altars</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh told him to tell Israel, "You've seen that I've spoken to you from the sky. 23Don't makef other gods, silver or gold. 24Makef an altar out of dirt for me for sacrificing your burnt offerings, peace offerings, sheep and cattle. Everywhere I make my name remembered, I'll come to you and bless you. 25If you build a stone altar for me, don't buildf it with cut stones. You'll desecrate it if you use a tool on it. 26Don't climbf steps to my altar so you won't show your nakedness on it. Laws About Slaves</span>
