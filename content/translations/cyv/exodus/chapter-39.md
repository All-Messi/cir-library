## Exodus Chapter 39

### The Priestly Garments

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> From the <u>blue, purple, and scarlet </u><em><u>material</u></em>, they made finely woven vestments for Aaron to perform service in the Holy Place—like Yahveh commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He made the <u>ephod</u> out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads that were woven in with the blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and the fine linen—an artisan’s work. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod—attached at the two <em>upper</em> ends. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The skillfully woven band on it had the same workmanship: gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They made the onyx stones, set in delicate gold ornamentation. They engraved the onyx stones like the engravings on a signet, showing the names of Israel’s sons. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 39:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He made the <u>pouch</u> to match the ephod, an artisan’s work. <em>It </em><em>too </em><em>was made</em> of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The pouch was square—9ins on a side when folded double. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They mounted 4 rows of stones on it: row 1 had ruby, topaz, and emerald;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> row 2 had turquoise, sapphire, and diamond;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> row 3 had jacinth, agate, amethyst;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> row 4 had beryl, onyx, and jasper— mounted in delicate gold settings. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The stones corresponded to the names of Israel’s sons. The 12 names corresponded to the engravings of a signet, each the name of one tribe. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They made chains like cords on the pouch, twined cordage in pure gold. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They made 2 delicate gold <em>settings</em> and 2 gold rings and put the 2 rings on the ends of the pouch. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They put the 2 gold cords in the 2 rings. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They put the <em>other</em> 2 ends of the cords on the 2 delicate <em>settings</em> and put them on the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They made 2 gold rings and placed <em>them</em> on the inner edge of the pouch ends next to the ephod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They made 2 gold rings for the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>They bound the pouch to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so it could be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch wouldn’t come loose from the ephod.<strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 39:8-21</p>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then he made the <u>robe of the ephod</u> out of blue woven work. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The opening of the robe was in the center at the top, like the opening of a coat of mail with a binding around its opening so it wouldn’t tear. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They made pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and twined <em>linen</em>, [<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and alternated them with pure gold bells and pomegranates around the hem.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 39:22-26</p>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They prepared <u>tunics</u> out of finely twined linen for Aaron and his sons. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>They made </em>the <u>turban</u>, decorated <u>caps</u>, and the <u>pants</u> out of finely twined linen. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They wove the <u>sash</u> out of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They shaped the plate for the holy <u>crown</u> out of pure gold and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet: <em>Holy to </em><em>Yahveh</em>. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They fastened a blue cord to it and attached it to the top of the turban.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That completed the work on the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites did everything Yahveh told Moses.</span>
