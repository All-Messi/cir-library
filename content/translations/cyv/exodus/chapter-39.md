## Exodus Chapter **39**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>From the <u>blue, purple, and scarlet </u><em><u>material</u></em>, they made finely woven vestments for Aaron to perform service in the Holy Place—like Yahveh commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>He made the <u>ephod</u> out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads that were woven in with the blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and the fine linen—an artisan’s work. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod—attached at the two <em>upper</em> ends. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The skillfully woven band on it had the same workmanship: gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They made the onyx stones, set in delicate gold ornamentation. They engraved the onyx stones like the engravings on a signet, showing the names of Israel’s sons. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>He made the <u>pouch</u> to match the ephod, an artisan’s work. <em>It </em><em>too </em><em>was made</em> of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and finely twined linen. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The pouch was square—9ins on a side when folded double. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They mo</span>

### had beryl, onyx, and jasper— mounted in delicate gold settings. 14The stones corresponded to the names of Israel’s sons. The 12 names corresponded to the engravings of a signet, each the name of one tribe. 15They made chains like cords on the pouch, twined cordage in pure gold. 16They made 2 delicate gold settings and 2 gold rings and put the 2 rings on the ends of the pouch. 17They put the 2 gold cords in the 2 rings. 18They put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 delicate settings and put them on the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 19They made 2 gold rings and placed them on the inner edge of the pouch ends next to the ephod.

### gold rings for the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. 21They bound the pouch to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so it could be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch wouldn’t come loose from the ephod.   	Ex 39:8-21


<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Then he made the <u>robe of the ephod</u> out of blue woven work. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The opening of the robe was in the center at the top, like the opening of a coat of mail with a binding around its opening so it wouldn’t tear. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>They made pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>; and twined <em>linen</em>, [<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and alternated them with pure gold bells and pomegranates around the hem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They prepared <u>tunics</u> out of finely twined linen for Aaron and his sons. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>They made </em>the <u>turban</u>, decorated <u>caps</u>, and the <u>pants</u> out of finely twined linen. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They wove the <u>sash</u> out of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet <em>material</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They shaped the plate for the holy <u>crown</u> out of pure gold and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet: <em>Holy to </em><em>Yahveh</em>. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They fastened a blue cord to it and attached it to the top of the turban.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>That completed the work on the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites did everything Yahveh told Moses.</span>
