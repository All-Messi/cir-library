## Exodus Chapter 39

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> From the blue, purple, and scarlet material, they made finely woven vestments for Aaron to perform service in the Holy Place—like Yahveh commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He made the ephod out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 3They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads that were woven in with the blue, purple, and scarlet material; and the fine linen—an artisan's work. 4They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod—attached at the two upper ends. 5The skillfully woven band on it had the same workmanship: gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen.  6They made the onyx stones, set in delicate gold ornamentation. They engraved the onyx stones like the engravings on a signet, showing the names of Israel's sons. 7He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He made the pouch to match the ephod, an artisan's work. It too was made of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 9The pouch was square—9ins on a side when folded double. 10They mounted 4 rows of stones on it: row 1 had ruby, topaz, and emerald;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> row 2 had turquoise, sapphire, and diamond;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> row 3 had jacinth, agate, amethyst;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> row 4 had beryl, onyx, and jasper— mounted in delicate gold settings. 14The stones corresponded to the names of Israel's sons. The 12 names corresponded to the engravings of a signet, each the name of one tribe. 15They made chains like cords on the pouch, twined cordage in pure gold. 16They made 2 delicate gold settings and 2 gold rings and put the 2 rings on the ends of the pouch. 17They put the 2 gold cords in the 2 rings. 18They put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 delicate settings and put them on the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 19They made 2 gold rings and placed them on the inner edge of the pouch ends next to the ephod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They made 2 gold rings for the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. 21They bound the pouch to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so it could be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch wouldn't come loose from the ephod.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then he made the robe of the ephod out of blue woven work. 23The opening of the robe was in the center at the top, like the opening of a coat of mail with a binding around its opening so it wouldn't tear. 24They made pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and twined linen, [25] 26and alternated them with pure gold bells and pomegranates around the hem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They prepared tunics out of finely twined linen for Aaron and his sons. 28They made the turban, decorated caps, and the pants out of finely twined linen. 29They wove the sash out of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet material.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They shaped the plate for the holy crown out of pure gold and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet: Holy to Yahveh. 31They fastened a blue cord to it and attached it to the top of the turban.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> That completed the work on the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites did everything Yahveh told Moses. Moses Inspects the Work</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They brought the Tabernacle to Moses: the tent and its furnishings, its clasps, boards, bars, posts, and bases;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> the covering made of rams' skins dyed red and goatskin leather; the screening curtain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> the Ark of Testimony, its poles, and the mercy seat;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> the table, its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> the pure gold lampstand, its arrangement of lamps, utensils, and olive oil for its lights;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> the gold altar, anointing oil, and fragrant incense; the curtain for the door to the tent;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> the bronze altar, its bronze grating, poles, and utensils; the laver and its stand;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> the curtains for the court, its posts and sockets, the screen for the entrance to the court, its cords, and pegs; the equipment for the service of the Tabernacle for the Tent of Meeting;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> the woven holy vestments for Aaron and his sons to serve as priests in the Holy Place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> The Israelites did everything like Yahveh told Moses. 43Moses examined their work and blessed them. Setting Up the Tabernacle</span>
