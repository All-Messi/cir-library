## Habakkuk Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I'll stand at my post and watch; I'll station myself on a watchtower to see how he'll answer my complaint. Yahveh's Second Answer</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Yahveh's second answer: "Write down this vision, etch it on tablets so the messenger can run with it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The vision is still for a future time; it speeds toward the goal and won't fail. Though it seems slow, wait for it; it will certainly come in due time. 4"Arrogant people aren't righteous, but the righteous will have life by his trust in me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Besides, wine betrays the arrogant, so they don't last. Their greed increases like the grave; like death, they're never satisfied. They gather the whole world to themselves and use everybody. 6"Won't people taunt them and say in mockery, 'Misfortune awaits you that accumulate what's not yours and make yourselves rich by extortion —for how long, though?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Won't your creditors suddenly decide to call in their loans? You'll become their plunder.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Since you've looted many nations, other nations will loot you for the blood of men and women that you shed, for your violence to towns and their people.' 9"Misfortune awaits whoever uses dishonest gain to build a prominent house up high, like a nest beyond harm's reach.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> You've plotted shamelessly to build that house by ruining lots of people's lives; you end up sinning against yourself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The very stones cry out against you from the wall, and the beams in the ceiling echo the complaint. 12"Misfortune awaits whoever builds a city with murder and establishes a town by violence!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Isn't it from Yahveh of hosts that people labor only to have it burn up and nations wear themselves out for nothing?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The knowledge of Yahveh's glory will cover the earth like water fills the ocean. 15"Misfortune awaits you that make other people drink your venom to get them drunk so you can stare at their disgrace!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> You'll be disgraced, not honored; you'll drink and expose your own disgrace. The cup in Yahveh's right hand will come around to you; complete disgrace will cover up your honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The violence you did to Lebanon will overwhelm you; the devastation of its animals will terrify you, because of the murder and violence you did to the land, its towns, and their people. 18"What good is an idol after its maker carves it, or an image, which represents a lie? Its maker puts his faith in what he's made when the idol he's made can't talk.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Misfortune awaits whoever says to a piece of wood, 'Wake up!' or to a speechless stone, 'Get up and help us!' That's your teacher!? It's overlaid with gold and silver, but it can't breathe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But Yahveh is in his holy Temple; let the whole earth be silent in his presence."</span>
