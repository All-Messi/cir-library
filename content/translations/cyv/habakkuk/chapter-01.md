## Habakkuk Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Oracle That Habakkuk the Prophet Saw Habakkuk's Complaint</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> How long, Yahveh, will I call out for help, and you won't listen? I cry out, "Violence!" but you don't protect me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Why do you make me watch wickedness? Destruction and violence go on right in front of me; fighting and arguing keep getting worse and worse.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> The courts ignore the Law, so they don't render justice; sinners are in the majority, so they pervert justice. Yahveh's Answer</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh's first answer: "Look around at the nations and be astounded. I'm doing something in your own day you wouldn't believe if somebody told you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm arousing the Babylonians, that fierce, impetuous people that marches across the region to seize places to live that aren't theirs.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They're dreaded and feared; they're a law unto themselves and make their own rules.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Their horses are faster than cheetahs, more vicious than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry comes charging from far away and swoops down like eagles to devour their prey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> They come bent on violence; their hordes surge forward like a desert wind and sweep captives away like sand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> They scoff at kings and ridicule rulers; they laugh at fortresses and pile up ramparts to besiege them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They rush through like the wind and move on; they're guilty men whose power is their god." Habakkuk's Second Complaint</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Aren't you from everlasting, Yahveh, my God, my Holy One? Surely you won't let us die. You, Yahveh, have appointed the Babylonians to judge us; you, Rock, have sent them to punish us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You're too pure to approve of evil; you can't countenance wickedness. Why do you tolerate treacherous people? Why are you silent when sinners swallow up people better than themselves?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They treat us like fish in the sea, like creatures with no rulers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Sinful people fish us out with hooks and scoop us up with nets. They catch us in their seines; they're happy and celebrate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So they sacrifice to their seines and burn incense to their fishing nets, because they make large catches with them and have lots to eat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Will they empty their nets then and keep on killing nations without mercy?</span>
