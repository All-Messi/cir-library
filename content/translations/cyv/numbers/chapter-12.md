## Numbers Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses for the Nubian woman he'd married. 2"Has Yahveh indeed only spoken through you? Hasn't he spoken through us too?" Yahveh heard it. (3Moses was the humblest man in the world.) 4At once, Yahveh told Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting." 5He came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent to call Aaron and Miriam. When they'd come forward, 6he said, "Listen to what I'm saying: if there's a prophet among you, I'll show myself to him in a vision or speak to him in a dream.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Not so with Moses; he's faithful in my house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I speak to him directly, clearly, not in dark sayings; he sees my form. Why then weren't you afraid to criticize him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Yahveh's anger burned against them, and he left. 10When the cloud withdrew from over the Tent, Miriam had leprosy as white as snow. When Aaron turned and saw it, 11he told Moses, "Don't hold that foolish sin against us. 12Don't leave her like somebody dead, with flesh half eaten away at birth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Moses cried out to Yahveh, "God, heal her!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Yahveh said, "If her father had only spit in her face, wouldn't she have borne her disgrace for a week? Quarantine her outside the camp for a week. Then she can come back."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> So they did; the people didn't move on till she returned. 16Then they moved out from Hazeroth to the Wilderness of Paran. Spies Sent into Canaan</span>
