### 11‘Anyone of you that touches a human corpse will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 12Purify yourself with the water on the third and seventh days, and you’ll be clean. If you don’t, you’re still unclean; 13you’re defiling Yahveh’s Tabernacle, and you’re excluded from Israel. 14‘If someone dies in your tent, all of you in it will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 15Every open container will be unclean. 	Num 19:11-15 16‘Anybody that touches a body out in the open, slain with a sword or dead from natural causes, will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 17Then for the unclean person they’ll take some ashes from the burnt purification from sin and add flowing water in a basin. 18A clean person will dip hyssop in the water and sprinkle it on the tent, its furnishings, the people that were there, and the one that touched the bone, the one slain, the one dead of natural causes, or the grave. 19Then the clean person will sprinkle the unclean persons on the third and seventh days. On the seventh day the clean purify the unclean. Then they’ll wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean by evening.   	Num 19:16-19 20‘But those who don’t purify themselves will be excluded from the community. They’ve defiled Yahveh’s sanctuary. The water for removing impurity wasn’t sprinkled on them. 21Those who sprinkle the water will wash their clothes, and those who touch the water will be ceremonially unclean until evening. 22Anything an unclean person touches is unclean; anyone that touches it is unclean till evening.’”   	Num 19:20-22 The Death of Miriam
