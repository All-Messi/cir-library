## Numbers Chapter 32

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Reuben and Gad had lots of livestock. When they saw that Jazer and Gilead had good grazing land, 2they spoke to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community, 3"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—4land Yahveh overthrew for Israel—is suitable for our livestock. 5If we're pleasing to you, give us this land instead of having us cross the Jordan."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Moses said, "Will your relatives go to war, and you sit here? 7Why discourage Israel from going to the land Yahveh has given them? 8That's what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. 9When they went to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged Israel from going in. 10Yahveh was angry that day and swore, 11'No men that came up from Egypt 20 years and older will see the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they wouldn't follow me. 12Only Caleb the Kenizzite and Joshua Ben- Nun faithfully followed me.' 13Yahveh made Israel wander in the desert for 40 years till that generation died off. 14You're replacing your parents as sinful people to anger Yahveh toward Israel. 15If you turn aside from him, he'll leave you in the desert. You'll be responsible for destroying this nation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> They came to him and said, "We'll build corrals here for our livestock and towns for our children, 17but we'll take up arms and go with Israel till we've brought them to their place. Our children will live in fortified towns because of the people still in the land. 18We won't go home till everyone has received their inheritance. 19We won't inherit with them on that side of the Jordan; our inheritance will lie here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Moses said, "If you take up arms 21and cross the Jordan till Yahveh 22has conquered the land, you'll meet your obligations. 23If you don't, be sure your sin will find you out. 24Build your towns, put up corrals, and do what you've promised." 25"We will. 26Our little ones, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay in towns in Gilead. 27But we'll cross over armed to fight like you've said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Moses charged Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel, 29"If Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan and help you conquer the land, give them Gilead. 30If they don't, they'll have possessions among you in Canaan."       [31-32]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Moses gave to Gad, Reuben, and the Manasseh half-tribe the kingdoms of Sihon and Og, and the towns and territory around them. 34Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 36Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran—fortified towns and corrals for sheep. 37Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38Nebo, and Baal-meon (new names), and Sibmah. They renamed the towns they built. 39The sons of Machir Ben-Manasseh went to Gilead and took it away from the Amorites. 40Moses gave them Gilead and they lived there. 41"Jair" Ben-Manasseh took its "towns" and called them Havvoth-jair. 42Nobah took Kenath and its villages and renamed it after himself.
