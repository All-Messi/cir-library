## Numbers Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The people started complaining about their hardships. Yahveh's anger flared. It burned among them and burned up the outskirts of the camp. 2The people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to Yahveh, and the fire died down. 3The name of that place became Taberah, because Yahveh's fire "burned" among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Some riffraff among them had selfish interests and cried out again, "Who's going to feed us? 5We remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. 6Now our appetite's gone. There's nothing to look at except this manna."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The manna was like coriander seed and looked like bdellium. 8The people would go around and gather it up, grind it between millstones, mash it in mortars, or boil it in pots and make cakes. The cakes tasted like they were baked with olive oil. 9The manna would fall with the dew at night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Moses heard the families whining at the entrance to their tents. Yahveh's anger kindled greatly, and Moses wasn't pleased. 11He asked Yahveh, "Why be so hard on me? How have I displeased you that you've laid the responsibility for all these people on me? 12Was I the one that conceived them and had them, that you should tell me to carry them in my arms like a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land you swore to their ancestors? 13Where can I get meat for all these people? They're crying to me for something to eat!' 14I can't carry them; they're too heavy. 15If you're going to deal with me this way, take my life now if I'm pleasing to you. Spare me the misery." Elders Appointed to Help Moses</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh told Moses, "Gather the 70 elders and their officers at the Tent of Meeting. Have them stand there with you. 17I'll come down and speak to you and take the Spirit that's on you and put on them. They'll bear responsibility for the people, too, so you won't be bearing it by yourself. 18Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you'll eat meat because you've cried, "Oh that someone would feed us! We were well-off in Egypt." Yahveh will give you meat and you'll eat it—19not 1 day, 2 days, 5, 10, or 20 days, 20but for a whole month, till it comes out your nostrils and you get sick of it. That's because you've rejected Yahveh that's among you and whined to his face, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But Moses said, "There are 600,000 people around me; yet you've said you'd give them meat for a month. 22Should they butcher flocks and herds to get enough or try to catch all the fish in the sea?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh said, "Am I limited? You'll see if what I said comes true."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Moses told the people what Yahveh said. He gathered the 70 elders and stationed them around the tent. 25Yahveh came down in the cloud and spoke to him. The Spirit that was on Moses he put on them. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they never did it again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Two men had remained in the camp, Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested on them, and they kept on prophesying. (They were among the ones that had been registered but hadn't gone out to the Tent.) 27A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Joshua Ben-Nun, Moses' assistant from his youth, said, "Moses, my lord, stop them." 29"Are you jealous for me? Oh that all Yahveh's people were prophets, and he would put his Spirit on them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Moses and the elders went back to the camp. The LORD Sends Quail</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Yahveh made a wind blow from the sea to bring quail. They fell about a day's walk away all around the camp—about 3ft deep all over the ground. 32The people spent all day, all night, and the next day picking them up and spreading them out all around the camp. The least anybody gathered was 62.5 bushels. 33While they chewed the meat, Yahveh's anger flared at them; he struck them with a severe plague. 34So they called the place Kibroth-hattaavah, because they put in "graves" the people that had been "greedy." 35From Kibroth-hattaavah they set out for Hazaroth and stayed there. Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses</span>
