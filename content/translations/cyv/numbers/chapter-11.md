## Numbers Chapter 11

### The People Complain

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The people started complaining about their hardships. Yahveh’s anger flared. It burned among them and burned up the outskirts of the camp. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to Yahveh, and the fire died down. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The name of that place became Taberah, because Yahveh’s fire “burned” among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Some riffraff among them had selfish interests and cried out again, <em>“Who’s going to </em><em>feed us</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>We</em><em> remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, </em><em>melons, </em><em>leeks, onions, and garlic.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>N</em><em>ow</em><em> our </em><em>appetite’s gone. T</em><em>here’s nothing to look at except this manna.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The manna was like coriander seed and looked like bdellium. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The people would go around and gather it up, grind it between millstones, mash it in mortars, or boil it in pots and make cakes. The cakes tasted like they were baked with olive oil. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The manna would fall with the dew at night.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 11:1-9</p>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Moses heard the families whining at the entrance to their tents. Yahveh’s anger kindled greatly, and Moses wasn’t pleased. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He asked Yahveh, <em>“Why </em><em>be</em><em> so hard on </em><em>me</em><em>?</em><em> How</em><em> have I </em><em>displeased you that you’</em><em>ve laid the </em><em>responsibility for</em><em> all these people on me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Was</em><em> I the one that conceived </em><em>them</em><em> and </em><em>had them</em><em>, that you should </em><em>tell me to c</em><em>arry them in </em><em>my</em><em> arms like a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land you swore to their ancestors?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Where</em><em> can I get meat for all these people?</em><em> </em><em>They</em><em>’re</em><em> c</em><em>rying to me for something to</em><em> eat!’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> can’t carry </em><em>them; they’re</em><em> too </em><em>heavy</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> you’re going to deal with me this way, </em><em>take my life</em><em> now if </em><em>I’m </em><em>pleasing</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> you</em><em>.</em><em> Spare me the misery</em><em>.”</span>

### Elders Appointed to Help Moses


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh told Moses, <em>“Gather</em><em> the </em><em>70</em><em> elders and their officers</em><em> at the Tent of Meeting. Have</em><em> </em><em>them</em><em> stand there with you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>I’ll</em><em> come down and speak to you an</em><em>d take the Spirit that’s on you</em><em> and put on them.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll bear </em><em>responsibility for</em><em> the people</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>too,</em><em> so you won’t be </em><em>bearing</em><em> it by yourself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Tell</em><em> the</em><em>m</em><em>, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tom</em><em>orrow, and you’ll eat meat because you’</em><em>ve cr</em><em>ied, “Oh that someone would feed us</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>We were well-off in Egypt.”</em><em> Yahveh</em><em> will give you meat and you’ll eat it—</em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>not</em><em> </em><em>1</em><em> day,</em><em> 2</em><em> days,</em><em> 5</em><em>, </em><em>10,</em><em> or </em><em>20</em><em> day</em><em>s</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> for a wh</em><em>ole month, till it comes out </em><em>your nostrils and </em><em>you get sick of it. That’s because y</em><em>ou’ve rejected </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> </em><em>that’</em><em>s among you and </em><em>whined</em><em> </em><em>to his face</em><em>, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But Moses said, <em>“</em><em>There are </em><em>600,000 </em><em>people around me; </em><em>yet you’ve said</em><em> you’d</em><em> give them meat </em><em>for a month. </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Should</em><em> they </em><em>butcher</em><em> flocks and herds to get enough</em><em> or try</em><em> t</em><em>o</em><em> </em><em>catch</em><em> all the fish in the sea</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Yahveh said, <em>“</em><em>Am I</em><em> limi</em><em>ted?</em><em> You’ll s</em><em>ee if </em><em>what I said</em><em> comes true.”</em><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 11:16-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Moses told the people what Yahveh said. He gathered the 70 elders and stationed them around the tent. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Yahveh came down in the cloud and spoke to him. The Spirit that was on <em>Moses </em>he put on them. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they never did it again.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Two men had remained in the camp, Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested on them, and they kept on prophesying. (They were among the ones that had been registered but hadn’t gone out to the Tent.) <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>A young man ran and told Moses<em>, “Eldad and Medad </em><em>a</em><em>re </em><em>prophesying in the </em><em>camp.”</em><em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Num 11:24-27</p>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Joshua Ben-Nun, Moses’ assistant from his youth, said, <em>“</em><em>Moses, my lord, </em><em>stop</em><em> them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“Are</em><em> you jealous </em><em>for</em><em> me? </em><em>Oh</em><em> that all Yahveh’s people were prophets, and he would put his Spirit on them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Moses and the elders went back to the camp. 	<strong>The L</strong><strong>ORD</strong><strong> Sends Quail</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Yahveh made a wind blow from the sea to bring quail. They fell about a day’s walk away all around the camp—about 3ft deep all over the ground. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>The people spent all day, all night, and the next day picking them up and spreading them out all around the camp. The least anybody gathered was 62.5 bushels. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>While they chewed the meat, Yahveh’s anger flared at them; he struck them with a severe plague. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>So they called the place Kibroth-hattaavah, because they put in “graves” the people that had been “greedy.” <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>From Kibroth-hattaavah they set out for Hazaroth and stayed there.</span>
