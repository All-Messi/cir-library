### 14“In that way, set the Levites apart from among the Israelites. The Levites will belong to me. 15Then they can serve in the Tent of Meeting. But you’ll cleanse them and present them as a wave offering, 16because I’ve dedicated them to myself in place of every firstborn in Israel. 17Every firstborn belongs to me among people and animals. The day I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. [18] 19I’ve given the Levites to Aaron and his sons to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting, and to atone for them so there won’t be a plague on Israel from coming near the sanctuary.”

Aaron presented them as a wave offering and atoned for them. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Afterwards they went into the Tent of Meeting to perform their service with Aaron and his sons.</span>
