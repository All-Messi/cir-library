## Numbers Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel, "When men or women take a Nazarite vow to dedicate themselves to Yahveh, 3they must abstain from wine and strong drink and from vinegar made from them. They can't drink grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins. 4They're not to eat anything a grapevine produces from seeds to skin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> During that time, they have to let their hair grow. 6-7They can't make themselves ceremonially unclean by going near a dead body even for a parent or sibling that dies. [8] 9"If someone dies suddenly beside them and defiles their dedicated head, they'll shave it the same day and on the seventh day. 10The eighth day, they'll take two turtledoves or young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 11The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; that will purify them from their defilement. That same day they'll reconsecrate their head, 12dedicate to Yahveh their days as a Nazirite, and take a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. Their previous days of separation are void. 13"When Nazirites finish their time of separation, they'll take an offering to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 14and present it to Yahveh: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering, one ram without defect for a peace offering, 15and a basket of cakes of fine flour without yeast mixed with oil and wafers without yeast spread with olive oil, along with their grain offering and liquid offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The priest will present them all to Yahveh. [17] 18Then the Nazirite will shave their head and put the dedicated hair on the fire that's under the peace offering. 19The priest will take the ram's boiled shoulder, one cake and wafer without yeast out of the basket, and put them in the Nazirites' hands. 20The priest will wave them in front of Yahveh. They're set apart for the priest, together with the chest offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up. Afterward Nazirites can drink wine again. 21"That's the law for Nazirites that vow their offering to Yahveh for their separation in addition to what else they can afford." Aaron's Blessing</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Yahveh told Moses to have Aaron and his sons 23pronounce this blessing on Israel: 24"Yahveh bless you and keep you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh smile on you and be gracious to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Yahveh lift up his countenance on you and give you peace." 27"In that way they'll invoke my name on the people, and I'll bless them." Offerings of Dedication</span>
