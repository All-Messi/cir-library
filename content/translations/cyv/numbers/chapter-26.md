## Numbers Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After the plague Yahveh told Moses and Eleazar, 2"Count by families the men 20 years old and up that can go to war." 3Moses and Eleazar told them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, 4"Count the men 20 years old and up." The Israelites that came out of Egypt were as follows:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Reuben by families was Hanoch, Pallu, 6-7Hezron, and Carmi: 	43,730</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The son of Pallu was Eliab, 9father of Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram the community called on to oppose Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah when they contended against Yahveh. 10The ground opened up and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, and the fire consumed 250 men. That served as a warning. 11The sons of Korah, however, didn't die. 12-14Simeon by families was Nemuel, Jamin, Jachin, Zerah, and Shaul.  	   22,200 15-18Gad by families was Zephon, Haggai, Shuni, Ozni, Eri, Arod, and Areli.	 40,500 19-22Judah by families was Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. 	76,500 The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. Judah's other sons Er and Onan died in Canaan. 23-25Issachar by families was Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron. 	64,300 26-27Zebulun by families was Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.	 60,500 28-37Joseph by families was Manasseh and Ephraim. The sons of Manasseh were Machir Avi-Gilead Avi-Jezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, and Hepher. Hepher was father of Zelophehad, whose daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 	52,700 The sons of Ephraim were Shuthelah, Becher, and Tahan. The son of Shuthelah was Eran. 			32,500 38-41Benjamin by families was Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham. The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman. 	45,600 42-43Dan's family was Shuham. 64,400 44-47Asher by families was Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah. 	53,400 The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel. Asher's daughter was Serah. 48-50Naphtali by families was Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 	45,400 51601,730 52Yahveh told Moses, 53"Parcel out the land among these for an inheritance in proportion to their numbers, 54a larger inheritance for larger groups, a smaller one for smaller groups. 55Divide it up by lot by tribes. [56]" 57These are the Levites numbered by families: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 58These are the families of Levi: the Libnites, Hebronites, Mahlites, Mushites, and the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram. 59Amram's wife was Jochebed, daughter of Levi, born in Egypt. She bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam. 60Aaron became the father of Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  61Nadab and Abihu died from offering before Yahveh fire different from what he'd commanded. 62The number of male Levites a month old and up was 23,000. They weren't counted with the Israelites because they didn't inherit with them. 63Those were the ones Moses and Eleazar counted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.  64But Moses and Aaron didn't count anyone they'd counted in the Wilderness at Sinai.  65That was because Yahveh had said they'd die in the desert. Only Caleb and Joshua would survive. The Daughters of Zelophehad</span>
