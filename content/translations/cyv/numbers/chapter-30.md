## Numbers Chapter **30**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Moses told the tribal leaders, <em>“This is </em><em>what</em><em> </em><em>Yahveh</em><em> has commanded.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> a man makes a vow to Yahveh or takes an oath that obligates him to do something, he must keep his word. </em> <strong>Women’s Vows</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> a woman takes a vow to Yahveh and obligates herself to do something while in her father’s family in her youth, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> her father hears it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> if her father forbids her, her vow and pledge don’t stand. Yahveh will release her </em>from them<em> because her father forbade her.</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“But</em><em>, if she marries while under her vow or rash statement </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> her husband hears about it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>But</em><em>, if he forbids her, he annuls her vow or rash statement, and Yahveh will release her </em>from it. <em>	</em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“The</em><em> vow of a widow or divorced woman stands. </em><em>	</em></span>

### 10“However, if she vows in her husband’s house or binds herself to an obligation with an oath 11and her husband hears it, but doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 12But if her husband annuls it, it won’t stand, and Yahveh will release her from them. 	13“A husband can annul any vow or binding oath a wife submits herself to. 14If he doesn’t say anything to her the day he hears it, then he confirms it. 15But if he tries to annul it later, he’ll bear her guilt.”


<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Those statutes Yahveh commanded Moses about a husband and wife and a father and daughter in her youth in his home.</span>
