## Numbers Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 2"Make two bugles out of hammered silver. Use them to gather the community or move the camp out. 3Blow both bugles to gather the community at the Tent of Meeting. 4Blow one bugle to gather just the leaders of thousands there. 5"When you blow the signal, the camps pitched on the east side will set out. 6When you blow the signal again, the camps pitched on the south side will set out. 7When assembling the community, however, blow without sounding an alarm. 8By permanent statute the priestly descendants of Aaron will blow the bugles. 9When you go to war in your country against an attacker, blow the signal with the bugle, so Yahveh will remember you and save you from your enemies. 10At celebrations, at scheduled festivals, and on the first day of the month, blow the bugles over your burnt offerings and peace offerings to remind your God about you. I'm Yahveh your God." Israel Leaves Sinai</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> On the twentieth day, second month, second year, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle. 12The Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai and came to rest in the Wilderness of Paran. 13That was the first time they moved at Yahveh's directive through Moses. 14The standard of Judah's camp set out first, with Nahshon over its army, 15Nethanel over Issachar's tribal army, 16and Eliab over Zebulun's tribal army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The Levites dismantled the Tabernacle; the descendants of Gershon and Merari set out carrying it. 18Next, Reuben's standard set out with Elizur over its army, 19Shelumiel over Simeon's tribal army, 20and Eliasaph over Gad's tribal army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects, and the Tabernacle would already be set up before they arrived. 22Next, Ephraim's standard set out with Elishama over its army, 23Gamaliel over Manasseh's army, 24and Abidan over Benjamin's army.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then Dan's standard, the rear guard for the camps, set out with Ahiezer over its army, 26Pagiel over Asher's army, 27and Ahira over Naphtali's army. 28That was the order of the Israelite's tribal armies.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Moses told Hobab Ben-Reuel/Jethro from Midian, Moses' father-in-law, "We're setting out to the place Yahveh said he'd give us. Go with us and we'll do you good because heY has promised good for Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> But he said, "No; I'll go to my own territory and relatives."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Moses said, "Don't leave. You know where to camp in the open country. You can be our eyes. 32If you go with us, whatever good Yahveh does for us we'll do for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They set out from the mountain of Yahveh on a three-day journey, with the Ark of the Covenant in front, to find a resting place. 34The cloud of Yahveh was over them during the day when they set out from the camp.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> When the Ark set out, Moses would say, "Rise up, Yahveh! Scatter your enemies; make the ones that hate you flee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> When the Ark came to rest, he'd say, "Come back, Yahveh, to the countless thousands in Israel." The People Complain</span>
