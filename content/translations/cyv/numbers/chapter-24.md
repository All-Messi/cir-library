## Numbers Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahveh to bless Israel, he didn't go like before to look for omens, but faced the open country. 2He saw Israel camping by tribes, and God's Spirit came on him. 3He took up this oracle: "The oracle of Balaam Ben-Beor, the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> the oracle of one that hears God's message, that sees a vision from the Almighty, that falls down with his eyes wide open. 5"How fair your tents, Jacob, the places where you live, Israel!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> like valleys that stretch out, like orchards beside a river, like aloes Yahveh planted, like cedars beside the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Water will flow from Jacob's buckets; his seed will live by abundant water; his king will be greater than Agag; his kingdom will be exalted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> God is bringing him out of Egypt; he's like the horns of a wild ox for him. He'll devastate the nations that oppose him; he'll crush their bones to pieces and shatter them with his arrows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Israel lies down like a lion; who dares to rouse him? Blessed is everyone that blesses him; cursed are all who curse him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Balak was mad at Balaam. He clapped his hands and said, "I called you to curse my enemies, and you've persisted in blessing them three times! 11Go back home. I said I'd greatly honor you, but Yahveh has prevented you from receiving your honor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Balaam said, "Didn't I tell your messengers, 13'Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, on my own I can't do anything contrary to Yahveh's command, good or bad. I'll say what he says.'? 14I'm going to my people, but I'll advise you what this nation will do to your people later." Balaam's Last Oracle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He took up this oracle: "The oracle of Balaam Ben-Beor, the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> the oracle of one that hears God's message, that knows Elyon, that sees a vision from the Almighty, and falls down with eyes wide open. 17"I see him, but not now; I look at him, but not near. A star will rise out of Jacob; a scepter will arise from Israel. He'll crush the forehead of Moab and tear down the sons of Sheth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Edom will be a possession; Seir, his enemy, will be overtaken, while Israel grows strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> A ruler will arise from Jacob and destroy the remnant of Ir.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He looked at Amalek and took up this oracle: "Amalek was first among the nations, but he'll end in destruction."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He looked at the Kenites and took up this oracle: "Where you live endures; your nest sits on a cliff.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Nevertheless, Kain will be consumed; how long will Asshur hold you captive?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He took up his oracle: "Who can live except God ordains it?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But ships will come from the coast of Kittim and attack Asshur and Eber; so they'll end up in destruction too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Balaam went home and Balak left. Moab Seduces Israel</span>
