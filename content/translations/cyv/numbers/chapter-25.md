## Numbers Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> While Israel was camping in Shittim, the people started carrying on prostitution with the women of Moab. 2They invited the people to the sacrifices to their gods, and the people ate and bowed to their gods. 3In this way, Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and Yahveh was angry. 4He told Moses, "Seize the ringleaders and execute them in broad daylight in myY presence so my fierce anger will turn away from Israel." 5Moses told the judges, "Each of you put to death his men that have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> One Israelite even brought a Midianite woman among his fellow Jews right in front of Moses and the assembly while they were crying at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 7When Phinehas Ben-Eleazar Ben-Aaron the priest saw it, he got up from the assembly. He took a spear, 8followed the man into the tent, and ran both of them through, and so checked the plague on Israel. 924,000 had died from it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, 11"Phinehas has turned away my anger because he was as zealous as I am for my honor, so I didn't destroy Israel. 12So say, 'I'm giving him and his descendants my covenant of peace, 13a permanent priesthood, because he was zealous for me and atoned for Israel.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The slain man was Zimri Ben-Salu, a family leader in Simeon. 15The Midianite woman was Cozbi Bat-Zur, a family leader in Midian.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 17"Attack the Midianites and strike them down. 18They've been hostile to you by deceiving you at Peor with Cozbi their sister, who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor." The Second Registration of Israel's Troops</span>
