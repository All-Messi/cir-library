<p class="section-ref">Num 5:1-4</p>

### 5-6Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel, “When a man or woman sins against Yahveh by sinning against another person, 7the offender will confess and pay restitution plus a fifth to the one that was wronged. 8If there’s no relative to receive the restitution, it goes to Yahveh for the priest in addition to the ram offered for the atonement. 9The priest will also receive every contribution associated with the holy gifts people offer. 10Everybody’s holy gifts belong to the priest.    	Num 5:5-10 The Test for Adultery 		[11] 12-13“If a husband suspects his wife has been unfaithful, 14-15he can take her to the priest. He’s to take .11 bushel .1 ephah of barley meal as an offering for her. He won’t pour oil on it or put frankincense on it because it’s a grain offering of jealousy, a reminder of sin.
