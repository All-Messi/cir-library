<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Generations of Aaron and Moses When Yahveh Spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai Duties of Levites</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> The sons of Aaron were Nadab, the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar—3anointed and ordained as priests. 4In the Wilderness of Sinai, Nadab and Abihu died from offering before Yahveh fire different from what he'd commanded. They didn't have any children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron's lifetime.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 6"Set the tribe of Levi aside to serve Aaron. 7They'll perform duties for him and the whole community at the Tent of Meeting. They'll service the Tabernacle 8and keep the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting in assisting with the duties of the people. 9Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. 10Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; execute any layman that tries to come near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Again Yahveh told Moses, 12"I've taken the Levites from the people in place of the firstborn. 13The firstborn belong to me. When I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart to myself the firstborn people and animals in Israel. The Levites belong to me; I'm Yahveh."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped east of the Tabernacle and performed duties in the sanctuary for the obligation of Israel. Any layman that would come near was to be executed. 39The Levites that Moses and Aaron counted a month old and up numbered 22,000. Redemption of the Firstborn</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Yahveh told Moses, "Count by name every firstborn male in Israel a month old and up. 41Take the Levites for me in place of Israel's firstborn sons, and take the Levites' livestock in place of Israel's firstborn livestock."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Moses counted Israel's firstborn: 4322,273 males a month old and up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 45"The Levites belong to me; I'm Yahveh. 46For the ransom of the 273 firstborn of Israel above the number of Levites, 47take 2 oz 5 shekels per head, shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs to a shekel). 48Give the ransom money to Aaron and his sons."</span>
