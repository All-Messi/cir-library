## Numbers Chapter 31

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 2"Take revenge for Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you'll pass on to your people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Moses told the people, "Arm men to attack Midian and carry out Yahveh's revenge on it. 4Send 1,000 men from each tribe."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They provided 12,000 men. 6Moses sent them to war with Phinehas Ben-Eleazar the priest along with the holy items from the sanctuary and bugles for signaling. 7They fought Midian and killed every male, 8including its five kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, Reba. They also killed Balaam Ben-Beor with a sword. 9They took the women and children, their cattle, flocks, and possessions. 10They burned their towns, houses, and camps; 11and took the spoil—people and animals. 12They brought the captives, prey, and spoil to Moses, Eleazar, and the community on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community met them outside the camp. 14Moses was mad at the officers of the army and the commanders of thousands and hundreds. 15"You've saved the women alive? 16They're what got Israel to sin against Yahveh at Peor, and a plague came into the community by Balaam's advice. 17So kill every male child and every woman that has had intercourse with a man. 18Keep alive for yourselves the young girls that are virgins. 19Camp outside the camp for a week. Whoever has killed anybody or touched a slain body, purify yourself on the third day and seventh day, you and your captives. 20Purify every piece of clothing, anything made out of skin, goat hair, or wood."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Eleazar told the men that fought, "Yahveh commanded Moses this statute. 22'The gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, and lead—23anything that doesn't burn—put through fire to cleanse it; then purify it with water. Anything that will burn, purify with water. 24Wash your clothes the seventh day. You'll be ceremonially clean then, and you can come into the camp."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Yahveh told Moses, 26"You, Eleazar, and heads of families, count the spoil—people and animals—27and divide it between soldiers and community. 28Levy a tax for Yahveh from the soldiers' spoil: 1 per 500 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep. 29Give this share to Eleazar as a heave offering to Yahveh. 30From Israel's half, take 1 from every 50 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep, and give them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Moses and Eleazar did that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The prey that was left from the soldiers' spoil was 675,000 sheep, 3372,000 cattle, 3461,000 donkeys, 3532,000 virgins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The soldiers' half was 337,500 sheep; 37Yahveh's levy, 675.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> There were 36,000 cattle; Yahveh's levy, 72.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> There were 30,500 donkeys; Yahveh's levy, 61.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> There were 16,000 persons; Yahveh's levy, 32.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Moses gave Yahveh's levy to Eleazar the priest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Israel's half was 43337,500 sheep, 4436,000 cattle, 4530,500 donkeys, 46and 16,000 persons. 47From Israel's half Moses took out one from every 50 people and animals, and gave them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> The commanders of thousands and hundreds came to Moses, 49"We've counted the men who fought and not a one is missing. 50So, from what each man found, we've brought an offering to Yahveh: articles of gold, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and neck chains to atone for ourselves." 51Moses and Eleazar took the gold and crafted articles, 52418¾ lbs 16,750 shekels worth. 53Each soldier had taken spoil. 54Moses and Eleazar brought the commanders' gold to the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to Israel before Yahveh.
