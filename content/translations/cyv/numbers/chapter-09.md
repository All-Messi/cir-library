## Numbers Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the first month, second year after the Israelites left Egypt, Yahveh told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 2-3"Have Israel observe Passover as directed at its scheduled time: the fourteenth day of this month in the evening." 4Moses told the Israelites to observe it. 5They did so in the Wilderness of Sinai the way Yahveh commanded Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Some men were ceremonially unclean because of a corpse, so they couldn't observe it that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day, 7"Although we're unclean, why can't we present the offering to Yahveh at the scheduled time with the rest of Israel?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Moses said, "I'll listen to what Yahveh says." 9-10Yahveh told him to tell Israel, "If any of you becomes ceremonially unclean because of a dead person or being on a long trip, go ahead and observe the Passover to Yahveh. 11Observe it on the fourteenth day, second month in the evening. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 12Don't leave any of it till morning or break a bone of it. 13But any of you that's clean and not on a trip and doesn't observe it, will be excluded from Israel. You didn't present the offering to Yahveh as scheduled. You'll be held guilty. 14Any foreigner living among you may observe Passover as directed. You'll have one statute for foreigners and citizens." The Cloud over the Tabernacle</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The day they set up the Tabernacle (the Tent of Testimony), the cloud covered it. In the evening, what looked like fire appeared over it till morning. 16That became the pattern: the cloud covered it during the day and what looked like fire covered it at night. 17Whenever the cloud lifted, the Israelites would set out. Where it settled, they'd camp. 18As Yahveh directed Moses, they'd set out or camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle, they stayed at that camp 19even if it was for a long time. [20] 21If the cloud stayed all night and lifted in the morning, they'd move out in the morning. If it stayed all day and lifted at night, they'd move out in the evening. 22Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, they wouldn't move till the cloud lifted. [23] The Silver Trumpets</span>
