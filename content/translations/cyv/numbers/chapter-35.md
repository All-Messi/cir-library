## Numbers Chapter 35

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Yahveh said to Moses, 2"Tell Israel to give the Levites towns to live in, 3along with pastureland for their cattle, herds, and animals. 4The pastures will extend 1500ft out from the wall all around the city, 5a 3,000ft diameter of pastureland. 6Give the Levites 6 cities as refuge for a person to flee to that's killed someone accidentally. 7Give them 42 other towns with their pastures to make 48 total. 8The towns you give them will be in proportion to the number of towns each tribe inherits." Cities of Refuge 9-10Yahveh told Moses to say to Israel, "When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 11identify cities of refuge a person can flee to from killing someone accidentally. 12-13The 6 cities will serve as refuges from an avenger till the slayer can stand public trial: 143 cities beyond the Jordan and three in Canaan. 15They'll serve Israelites, foreigners, and people living temporarily in Israel. 16"If a slayer kills someone with an iron instrument, it's murder; execute the slayer. 17The same applies if the weapon is stone 18or wood. 19The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 20If one person pushes another in hate, throws something from an ambush, 21or hits barehanded with enmity and kills the other, it's murder. The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 22"One person might push someone suddenly without enmity or throw something 23like a stone and hit the other accidentally. 24The community will decide between the slayer and the avenger by these ordinances. 25They'll protect the slayer from the avenger by returning the slayer to the city of refuge till the high priest dies. 26If the slayer ventures outside the city, 27the avenger is not considered a murderer. 28The slayer should've stayed in the city till the high priest died. Then the slayer could have gone home. 29"These are permanent statutes wherever you live. 30On the testimony of two or more witnesses, execute whoever commits murder. One witness isn't enough. 31Don't take a ransom in place of execution 32or for someone that flees to a city of refuge so they can go home early before the high priest dies. 33Don't defile the land you live in; blood defiles it. Don't atone for land defiled by blood except by the blood of the one that shed it. 34Don't defile the land you're living in because I'm living in it with you." Women Heirs of Property</span>
