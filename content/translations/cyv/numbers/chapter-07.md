### cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. 4Yahveh told Moses, 5“Accept these things for use in the Tent of Meeting. Give them to each Levite according to his service.” 6Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: 72 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon’s descendants to match their service, 8and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari’s descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar Ben-Aaron. 9He didn’t give any to Kohath’s descendants because their service was with the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders. 10The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar.
