## Numbers Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated its furnishings, the altar, and its utensils. 2The leaders in Israel (besides the numbered men) made an offering 3and brought it to the Tabernacle: 6 covered carts and 12 cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. 4Yahveh told Moses, 5"Accept these things for use in the Tent of Meeting. Give them to each Levite according to his service." 6Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: 72 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon's descendants to match their service, 8and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari's descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar Ben-Aaron. 9He didn't give any to Kohath's descendants because their service was with the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders. 10The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Then Yahveh told Moses, "Have them present their offering, one leader a day, for the dedication of the altar." [Each leader presented the same offering as follows:]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The first day, Nahshon Ben-Amminadab, from Judah, presented his offering.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> one silver platter that weighed 3¼ lbs 130 shekels, one silver bowl that weighed 28 oz 70 shekels of the sanctuary— both full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> one gold pan weighing 4 oz 10 shekels, full of incense;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> one bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> one male goat for a sin offering;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs a year old for peace offerings.</span>

The silver of the utensils weighed 60 lbs 2,400 shekels of the sanctuary. 86The 12 gold saucers full of incense weighed 4 oz 10 shekels apiece—3 lbs 120 shekels altogether. 87For the burnt offerings there were 12 bulls, 12 rams, 12 male lambs a year old with their grain offerings, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. 88For the peace offerings there were 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, 60 male lambs a year old. That was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed. 89Whenever Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak to Yahveh, he'd hear a voice speaking to him from between the two cherubs above the mercy seat on the Ark of Testimony.
