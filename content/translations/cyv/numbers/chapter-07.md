## Numbers Chapter 7

### Offerings of Dedication

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated its furnishings, the altar, and its utensils. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The leaders in Israel (besides the numbered men) made an offering <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and brought it to the Tabernacle: 6 covered carts and 12 cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Yahveh told Moses,<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“Accept</em><em> these things for use in the </em><em>Tent of Meeting</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Give them to each </em><em>Levite</em><em> according to his service.”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>2 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon’s descendants to match their service, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari’s descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar Ben-Aaron. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He didn’t give any to Kohath’s descendants because their service was with the holy <em>objects</em>, which they carried on their shoulders. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The leaders offered the dedication <em>offering</em> for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar.</span>
