## Numbers Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Israel traveled and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. 2Balak Ben-Zippor saw what Israel did to the Amorites. 3The people of Moab were afraid of them because there were so many of them. 4The king of Moab told the elders in Midian, "This horde will eat up everything around us like an ox eats up grass in a pasture." Balak, king of Moab at the time, 5sent messengers to Balaam Ben-Beor at Pethor, near the River Euphrates in the land of his people. He called him and said, "A people has come out of Egypt. They cover the ground; they're living across from me. 6Come and put a curse on them; there are too many of them for me to fight. Maybe I can defeat them and drive them out. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The elders in Moab and Midian left with a fee for fortunetelling in hand and went to Balaam with Balak's message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He said, "Spend the night here, and I'll bring word back to you as Yahveh tells me." So they stayed with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> God came to Balaam, "Who are these men?" 10"Balak Ben-Zippor sent me a message, 11'A people has come out of Egypt and covered the land. Come put a curse on them for me. Maybe I can fight them and drive them out.'" 12"Don't go with them. Don't curse the people because they're blessed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Balaam got up in the morning and told Balak's leaders, "Go back. Yahveh has refused to let me go with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> They went back to Balak, "Balaam wouldn't come with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Balak sent a bigger group of more distinguished officials, 16"Balak says, 'Please don't let anything keep you from coming to me. 17I'll honor you richly and do whatever you tell me. Come put a curse on this nation for me.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Balaam said, "Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, I couldn't do anything great or small that's contrary to what Yahveh my God may say. 19Stay here tonight, and I'll find out what else Yahveh may say."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> God came to him at night, "If the men have come to call you, go ahead with them; but only do what I tell you." Balaam and His Donkey</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with them. 22But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of Yahveh stood in the road to hinder him. He was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 23When the donkey saw the angel standing there with his sword drawn, she went off the road into a field, but Balaam hit her to get her back on the road. 24Then the angel stood in a narrow path between vineyards with a wall on both sides. 25When the donkey saw the angel, she pressed herself to the wall and mashed Balaam's foot; so he hit her again. 26The angel went on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either way. 27When the donkey saw the angel, she lay down under Balaam. He was mad and hit her with his stick.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Yahveh opened her mouth, and she asked, "What have I done to you to hit me three times?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Balaam said, "You've mocked me! If I'd had a sword, I would've killed you!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The donkey said, "Am I not the donkey you've ridden all your life? Have I ever acted like this before?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then Yahveh opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel standing on the road with his sword drawn, and he bowed to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The angel said, "Why did you hit your donkey three times? I've come to restrain you, because you're opposing me. 33But the donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If she hadn't, I would've killed you and let her live."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Balaam said, "I've sinned. I didn't know you were standing on the road. If you want me to, I'll turn around."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> But the angel said, "Go on with the men, but only say what I tell you." So Balaam went along with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the Arnon border. 37He said, "Didn't I urgently call you? Why didn't you come? Am I really not able to honor you?" 38Balaam said, "I'm here! Can I say just anything? I'll say what God tells me." 39He went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 40Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders that were with him. 41In the morning he took Balaam to the high places of Baal to see part of the people from there.
