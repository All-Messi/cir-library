<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">19:1When Jesus finished, he left Galilee and went into the hills of Judaea on the other side of the Jordan. Again 2big crowds followed him, and he healed them there. </span><span class="gospel-mk">As usual </span><span class="gospel-mt">he was teaching them.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">3Pharisees came to him, testing him, “Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife for any reason whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mk">3</span><span class="gospel-mt">He answered, “What did Moses command you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mk">4</span><span class="gospel-mt">“Moses allowed a husband to WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND DIVORCE HER” [Deut 24:1].</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">4He answered, “You’ve read, haven’t you, that ever since the creation the creator ‘MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE’? [Gen 1:27; 5:2] 5So, ‘A MAN IS TO LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO WILL BECOME ONE PHYSICAL UNIT’ [Gen 2:24]. 6So, they’re no longer two but one. What God has united, people are not to separate.”  </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">7They said, “Why then did Moses command ‘TO GIVE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND DIVORCE HER’?” [Deut 24:1]</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt"> 8“Because you’re hardhearted, Moses let you divorce your wives, but ever since the beginning it’s not been that way. 9Whoever divorces his wife—except for sexual immorality—and marries someone else, is committing adultery.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mk">10</span><span class="gospel-mt">In the house the disciples asked him about this again.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">11“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. 12If a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">10His disciples said, “If that’s the way a man’s relationship is with his wife, it’s better not to get married.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">11Jesus said, “Not everybody can live that way—only those who have that gift. 12Some are eunuchs from birth, some are made eunuchs by men, and some have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it who can accept it.”	 </span></p>
