<h3 class="topic-header">Incarnation of the Messiah</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 1:1-18)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">1:1In the beginning the Word was there. The Word was with God, and the Word was deity. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3He made everything; nothing came into existence without him. 4He had life in himself, life that gave light to mankind. 5The light shined in the dark, but the darkness tended not to accept it.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	6God sent a man named John 7to tell people about the light so everybody would believe through him. 8He wasn’t the light, but came to talk about 9the light, the true light that enlightens every person in the world. 10He was in the world and made the world, but it didn’t know him. 11He came into his own things, but his own people didn’t accept him. 12But, to as many as did accept him and trust him, he gave the right to become God’s children. 13They weren’t born from blood, physical desire, the will of a husband, but from God. 14The Word took on a physical nature and lived among us for a while. We saw his glory, glory like the only One the Father begot, full of grace and truth.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	15John shouted, “This is the One I was talking about when I said, ‘There’s a man coming after me who has come to be before me, because he existed before me.’” 16From his full measure we’ve all received grace on top of grace. 17Moses gave law, but Jesus Messiah brought grace and truth. 18Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten deity—the One dear to the Father—has shown what he’s like.							     </span></p>
