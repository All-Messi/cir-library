<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">46A discussion came up among the disciples as to which would have highest rank. Jesus knew about their discussion; so </span><span class="gospel-mk">33</span><span class="gospel-mt">when they came to Capernaum and he was at home, he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">34They kept still because they’d been talking about who had higher rank.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">35He sat down and called the twelve over, “If anybody wants to be first, he’ll be last and servant of all.” 36He took a little child and stood him </span><span class="gospel-lk">next to him </span><span class="gospel-mt">and put his arms around him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">3“Unless you change and become like little children, you won’t get in the kingdom. 4Whoever humbles himself like this little child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </span><span class="gospel-lk">48The least among you has the highest rank. “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me. </span><span class="gospel-mt">6“Whoever makes one of these little ones stumble who believe in me, would be better off to have a large millstone hung around his neck and drown in the sea.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">10“Make sure you don’t look down on one of these little ones. Their angels in heaven can always see my heavenly Father. [11]ms 12What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders off, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine on the hill and go looking for the stray? 13If he finds it, he’s happier over it than over the ninety-nine that didn’t stray. In the same way, my heavenly Father doesn’t want one of these little ones to be lost.	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	7“Woe to the world because of temptations. They’ll come, but woe to the one that brings them. 8If your hand or foot causes you problems, cut it off and throw it away. It’s better to go about life deformed or lame than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown in the eternal fire. 9If your eye is causing you problems, pull it out and throw it away. It’s better to </span><span class="gospel-mk">47</span><span class="gospel-mt">get in God’s kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown in the </span><span class="gospel-mk">48</span><span class="gospel-mt">fire that doesn’t burn out.</span></p>
