<h3 class="topic-header">Jesus at the Feast of Tabernacles</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 7:10-52-[[53]])</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">10Then Jesus went up secretly. 11The Jews were looking for him at the festival, “Where is he?” 12A lot of murmuring was going on about him in the crowds. Some were saying, “He’s a good man.” Others said, “No, he’s misleading the crowd.” 13But, nobody would talk openly about him for fear of the Jews.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">14In the middle of the festival, Jesus did go up to the temple and start teaching. 15The Jews marveled, “How does he know letters without going to school?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">16Jesus answered, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“My teaching’s not mine; it’s the teaching of the One that sent me. 17If anybody wants to do his will, he’ll know if my teaching is from God or if I’m speaking on my own. 18Anybody that speaks on his own is looking for his own glory. The one that’s looking for the glory of the One that sent him is genuine; there’s nothing dishonest about him. 19Didn’t Moses give you the law? But none of you keep it. Why are you trying to kill me?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">20The crowd answered, “You’ve got a demon. Who’s trying to kill you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">21Jesus responded, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“I did one thing, and you were all amazed. 22Moses gave you circumcision—not that it originated with him but with the ancestors—and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 23If a man gets circumcised on the Sabbath to avoid breaking the law, are you angry with me because I made a whole man healthy on the Sabbath? 24Don’t make surface judgments; base your judgments on what’s real.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">25Some that lived in Jerusalem were saying, “Isn’t this the One they’re trying to put to death? 26And look, he’s speaking openly, and they aren’t saying anything to him. Do the rulers know maybe that he really is the Messiah?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">      27“But we know where this man’s from. Nobody knows where the Messiah’s from.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">28Then, as he was teaching, he shouted, “You know me, and you know where I’m from. I haven’t come on my own; the One that’s true sent me. You don’t know him; 29but I know him, because I came from him and he sent me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">30They were trying to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him, because it wasn’t his time yet. 31Many in the crowd believed in him, “When the Messiah comes, he won’t do more signs that this man has done, will he?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">32The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33Jesus said, “I’ll be with you for a little while yet, and I’ll go back to the One that sent me. 34You’ll look for me, but you won’t find me. You can’t go where I’m going.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">35The Jews said to each other, “Where’s he going that we won’t find him. He’s not going, is he, to the Diaspora of the Greeks and teach the Greeks? 36What does he mean, ‘You’ll look for me and won’t find me,’ and, ‘You can’t go where I’ll be’?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">37On the last day of the festival, the main day, Jesus stood and shouted, “If anybody’s thirsty, come to me and drink. 38Everybody that believes in me, as the scripture has said, will have streams of living water flowing from within him.” (39He said this about the Spirit that the ones that believed in him would receive. The Spirit hadn’t come yet, because Jesus hadn’t been glorified.)</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">40Some in the crowd said, “This really is the prophet.” Others said, “This is the Messiah.” 41Others said, “The Messiah doesn’t come from Galilee, does he? 42Doesn’t the scripture say the Messiah descends from David and comes from Bethlehem, where David lived?” 43So a difference of opinion about him arose in the crowd. 44Some wanted to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">45The officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, “Why didn’t you bring him?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">46The officers answered, “No man ever spoke this way.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">47The Pharisees answered them, “You haven’t been deceived too, have you? 48None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they? 49This crowd that doesn’t know the law is accursed.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">50Nicodemus said to them—the one who came to him at first, 51“Our law doesn’t condemn a man, does it, unless it has a hearing first to find out what he’s doing?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">52They answered him, “You aren’t from Galilee too, are you? Search and see that no prophet is supposed to arise from Galilee.” [[53And each one went home.]]ms      </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">([[Jn 8:1-11]])</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">[[8:1Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2Early in the morning he went back to the temple, the people came to him, and he sat down and started teaching them. 3The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and stood her in front of everybody, 4“Rabbi, we caught this woman in adultery—in the very act. 5In the law Moses commanded us to stone a woman like this. What do you say?” (6They said this, testing him, so they could accuse him.)</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	Jesus squatted down and scribbled on the ground with his finger. 7When they kept badgering him, he stood up, “The one of you that doesn’t have any sin, throw the first stone at her.” 8He squatted down again and scribbled on the ground. 9They began to go away one by one, starting with the oldest; and left him alone with the woman standing there. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">10Jesus stood up, “Where are they? Hasn’t anybody condemned you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	11“No, sir.” </span></p>

<h3 class="topic-header">Sermon on the Light of the World</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 8:12-59)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">12Jesus started talking to the audience again. “I’m the light of the world. Nobody that follows me will be walking in the dark; he’ll have the light of life.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	13The Pharisees said, “You’re testifying for yourself; your testimony’s not valid.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	14Jesus answered, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Although I’m testifying for myself, my testimony is valid because I know where I’m from and where I’m going. You don’t. 15You condemn people by legal standards; I don’t condemn anybody that way. 16Even if I do render judgment, my judgment’s valid because I’m not the only witness. There’s me and the Father that sent me. 17Yourpl law says the witness of two people is valid. 18I witness for myself, and the Father witnesses for me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	19“Where is your Father?”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">Jesus answered, “You don’t know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father too.” 20He said this in the temple Treasury, and nobody arrested him, because it wasn’t his time yet.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	21He told them again, “I’m going away. You’ll look for me, and you’ll die in your sinsg. You can’t go where I’m going.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	22The Jews said, “He’s not going to kill himself, is he?” (because he said, “You can’t go where I’m going.”) </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	23He said, “You’re from below; I’m from above. You’re from this world; I’m not. 24I said you’d die in yourpl sins because if you don’t believe who I am, you will die in you sins.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25“Who are you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Exactly what I’ve been telling you all along. 26I have a lot to say about you and judgments to make, but the One that sent me is the real basis for it. What I’ve heard from him is what I’m telling the world.” (27They didn’t know he was talking about the Father; 28so he said,)</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“When you lift up the Son of Man, you’ll know who I am and that I’m not saying anything but what the Father has taught me. 29The One that sent me is with me. He hasn’t left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.” 30While he was saying that, many believed in him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">31Then he said to the Jews that believed him, “If you keep following what I say, you really are my disciples. 32You’ll know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"> 33“We’re Abraham’s descendants. We’ve never been slaves to anybody. What do you mean, ‘You’ll be free’?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">34“Everybody that sins is a slave to sin. 35A slave is not a part of the family. A son is. 36So, if a son sets you free, you really are free. 37I know you’re Abraham’s descendants, but you’re trying to kill me because you don’t want to hear what I’m saying. 38I’m telling you what I’ve seen my Father do, and you’re doing what you’ve seen your father do.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">39“Abraham’s our father.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“If you were Abraham’s children, you’d be acting like Abraham. 40But you’re trying to kill me now, a man that’s told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham didn’t act like that. 41You’re doing what your father does.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“We’re not illegitimate children; we have one Father—God.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">42“If God were your Father, you’d love me, because I’ve come from him. I haven’t come on my own; he sent me. 43Why don’t you understand what I’m saying? Can’t you hear? 44You belong to your father the devil, and you want to do what he wants you to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and doesn’t stand for the truth. There’s no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he’s doing his own thing, because he’s a liar and the one that invented lying. 45Because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. 46Which of you can convict me of sinning? If I’m telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? 47Whoever belongs to God listens to God. Here’s the reason you don’t listen: you don’t belong to him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">48“Wouldn’t we be right to say you’re a Samaritan with a demon?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">49Jesus answered, “I don’t have a demon, but I do honor my Father and you dishonor me. 50I’m not trying to honor myself. There is One who seeks and condemns. 51The truth is, if anybody keeps what I say, he’ll never die.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">52The Jews said, “Now we know you’ve got a demon. Abraham died and the prophets died, but you’re saying, ‘If anybody keeps what I say, he’ll never die.’ 53You aren’t greater, are you, than our ancestor Abraham who died and the prophets who died? Who do you think you are anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">54“If I honor myself, it’s not important. My Father’s the One that honors me—who you say is your God. 55You don’t know him, but I do. If I said I didn’t, I’d be lying like youpl. But I know him and keep his word. 56Your ancestor Abraham was overjoyed to see my day, and he saw it and was happy.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">57“You’re not even fifty years old, and you’ve seen Abraham?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">58“The truth is, I existed before Abraham did.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">59They picked up stones to throw at him, but he hid and left the temple.     </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 9:1-41)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">9:1As he was going along, he saw a man that had been blind from birth. 2His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	3“Neither he or his parents sinned. This happened so I could demonstrate God’s work in him. 4We need to work for the One that sent me while it’s daylight. The night’s coming when nobody can work. 5While I’m in the world, I’m the light of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	6When he’d said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud and smeared it on the blind man’s eyelids, 7“Go wash it off in the Pool of Siloam [Sent].”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">So he went and washed it off and came back able to see. 8Neighbors and people that had seen him begging said, “Isn’t this the fellow that sits and begs?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	 9“It’s him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	“No, he just looks like him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	“It is me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	10 “How did you get your sight?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	 <span class="gospel-jn">11“The man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyelids and said, ‘Go to Siloam and wash it off.’ I did, and I could see.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	12“Where is he?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	13They brought him to the Pharisees. 14It was on a Sabbath day when Jesus made mud and gave him sight. 15The Pharisees, too, asked him how he received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyelids. I washed it off, and I can see.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	16Some Pharisees said, “This man is not from God; he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	Others said, “How can a sinful man do such a thing?” They were divided over it.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	17They said to the blind man again, “What do you think about him? You’re the one he made see.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	“He’s a prophet.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	18The Jews questioned whether he’d been blind and received his sight till they called his parents, 19“Is this your son that you say was blind? How can he see now?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	20“He’s our son, and he was blind. 21We don’t know how he is able to see now or who gave him his sight. He’s legal age; he can speak for himself.” (22They said that because they were afraid. The Jews had already agreed to excommunicate from synagogue membership anybody that confessed that Jesus was the Messiah. [23]repeat)</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	24They called the man a second time, “Give God the credit; we know this man’s a sinner.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25“I don’t know if he’s a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind; now I can see.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	26“What did he do to you? How did he make you able to see?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	27“I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	28“You’re his disciple; we’re Moses’ disciples. 29We know God spoke to Moses, but we don’t know where this man’s from.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	30“The amazing thing here is that you don’t know where he’s from, and he gave me my sight. 31We know God doesn’t hear sinners; but if people are devout and do his will, he hears them. 32Since eternity past nobody ever heard of somebody giving sight to a man born blind. 33If this man weren’t from God, he couldn’t do anything.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	34“You were totally born in sins, and you’re trying to teach us?” They excommunicated him.</span></p>

<h3 class="topic-header">Sermon on the Good Shepherd</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 10:1-21)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">10:1“Whoever doesn’t go through the gate into the sheep pen, but climbs up somewhere else, is a robber. 2A shepherd comes through the gate. 3The gatekeeper opens for him, and the sheep recognize his voice. He calls his sheep by name and leads them out. 4When he gets them out, he goes in front of them, and they follow him because they know his voice. 5They won’t follow a stranger. They’ll run away from him, because they don’t recognize his voice.” 6They didn’t understand what Jesus meant by the illustration.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	7Again, Jesus said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“I’m the gate for the sheep. 8The ones that came before were thieves and robbers. The sheep didn’t listen to them. 9If anybody goes in through me, he’ll be safe. He can go in and out and find pasture. 10A thief comes to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I’ve come so they can live and live more abundantly. 11I’m a good shepherd; a good shepherd risks his life for his sheep. 12A hired hand sees a wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and runs away, because the sheep don’t belong to him. A wolf snatches them and scatters them. 13A hired hand doesn’t care about the sheep. 14I’m a good shepherd; I know my sheep, and they know me. 15As the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I lay down my life for my sheep. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">16“And, I have other sheep that aren’t part of this fold. I need to lead them too. They’ll hear my voice and become one flock with one shepherd. 17The Father loves me because I lay down my life to take it back again. 18Nobody’s taking it away from me. I’m laying it down voluntarily. I have the right to lay it down and the right to take it back. That’s what my Father commanded me to do.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	19Again a division arose among the Jews over what he said. 20A number of them said, “He’s got a demon; he’s crazy. Why are you listening to him?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	21Others said, “A demon-possessed man doesn’t talk like that. A demon can’t make blind people see, can it?”							    	     </span></p>
