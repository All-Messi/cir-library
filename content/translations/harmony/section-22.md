<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">11:1</sup>There was a sick man, Lazarus of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. <sup class="verse-num">2</sup>This was the Mary that anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">4</sup>When he heard it, he said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“He’s not going to die from this sickness. It’s for God’s glory so it can glorify God’s Son.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <sup class="verse-num">6</sup>So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days. <sup class="verse-num">7</sup>Afterwards he said to the disciples, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Let’s go back to Judaea.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">8</sup>They said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Rabbi, the Jews were trying to stone you just now, and you’re going back there?” </em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">9</sup>Jesus answered, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight?

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">12</sup>His disciples said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, if he’s sleeping, he’ll get better.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">13</sup>Jesus was talking about death, but they thought he was talking about rest. <sup class="verse-num">14</sup>Then he told them plainly, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lazarus has died. </em></strong></span><sup class="verse-num">15</sup><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>I’m glad for your sake that I wasn’t there, so you can believe.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">29</sup>She got up quickly and went to him. <sup class="verse-num">30</sup>He hadn’t come in the village yet; he was still where Martha met him. <sup class="verse-num">31</sup>When the Jews in the house with Mary saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">33</sup>When Jesus saw her crying and the ones coming with her crying, he was deeply moved and troubled in himself, 34</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Where have youpl laid him?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	They said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“We’ll show you.”	</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">35</sup>Jesus began to cry.</strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">36</sup>The Jews said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“See how much he loved him.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">38</sup>When Jesus got to the tomb, he was deeply moved.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>Martha said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, by now he smells. He’s been dead four days.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">40</sup>Jesus said to her, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you’d see how great God is?”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 11:45-54)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">45</sup>Many Jews that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him; <sup class="verse-num">46</sup>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he’d done. <sup class="verse-num">47</sup>So the high priests and the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin into session. </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“What are we going to do?

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup class="verse-num">49</sup>Caiaphas, high priest that year, said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“There’s something you don’t understand: </em></strong></span><sup class="verse-num">50</sup><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>It’s to your advantage that one man die for the people so the whole nation doesn’t perish.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup class="verse-num">51</sup>Now he didn’t say this on his own; but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <sup class="verse-num">52</sup>and not for the nation only, but that he’d gather into one body the children of God scattered abroad. <sup class="verse-num">53</sup>From then on, they made plans to put him to death. <sup class="verse-num">54</sup>So Jesus quit walking openly among the Jews, and went away to the territory close to the desert—to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.		    				    </strong></span></p>
