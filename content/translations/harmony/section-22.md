<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 11:1-44)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>11:1</sup>There was a sick man, Lazarus of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. <sup>2</sup>This was the Mary that anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus was her brother. <sup>3</sup>His sisters sent to Jesus, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, the one you love is sick.” </em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>4</sup>When he heard it, he said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“He’s not going to die from this sickness. It’s for God’s glory so it can glorify God’s Son.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <sup>6</sup>So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days. <sup>7</sup>Afterwards he said to the disciples, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Let’s go back to Judaea.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>8</sup>They said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Rabbi, the Jews were trying to stone you just now, and you’re going back there?” </em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>9</sup>Jesus answered, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? If a person walks in the daylight, he doesn’t stumble, because he has light. </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>If he tries to walk in the dark, he stumbles because he doesn’t have light coming out of himself.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>11</sup>After he said that, he told them, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Our friend Lazarus is sleeping; I’m going to wake him up.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>12</sup>His disciples said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, if he’s sleeping, he’ll get better.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>13</sup>Jesus was talking about </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><u>death</u></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>, but they thought he was talking about </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><u>rest</u></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>. <sup>14</sup>Then he told them plainly, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lazarus has died. </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>I’m glad for your sake that I wasn’t there, so you can believe. Let’s go to him.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>16</sup>Thomas, called Didymus, said,</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em> “Let’s go along and can die with him.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>17</sup>When Jesus got there, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. <sup>18</sup>Now Bethany was a little less than two miles from Jerusalem. <sup>19</sup>Many Jews had come to console Mary and Martha about their brother. <sup>20</sup>When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary continued to sit in the house. <sup>21</sup>Martha said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>But I know even now that whatever you ask God for, he’ll give you.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	23</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Your brother will rise again.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>24</sup>Martha said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em><u>I</u></em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em> know he’ll rise again in the resurrectionat the end of time.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>25</sup>Jesus said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“I am the resurrection and life. Whoever believes in me will live even though he’s died. <sup>26</sup>Everybody that lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	27</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Yes, Lord; I’ve believed you’re the Messiah, God’s Son, who comes to the world.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>28</sup>When she’d said that, she went and called Mary privately, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“The Rabbi’s here; he’s asking for you.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>29</sup>She got up quickly and went to him. <sup>30</sup>He hadn’t come in the village yet; he was still where Martha met him. <sup>31</sup>When the Jews in the house with Mary saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her. They supposed she was going to the tomb to mourn. <sup>32</sup>Mary came to where Jesus was and fell down to him, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>33</sup>When Jesus saw her crying and the ones coming with her crying, he was deeply moved and troubled in himself, 34</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Where have youpl laid him?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	They said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“We’ll show you.”	</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>35</sup>Jesus began to cry.</strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>36</sup>The Jews said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“See how much he loved him.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>37</sup>Some said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Couldn’t a man that gave sight to the blind man have kept this man from dying?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>38</sup>When Jesus got to the tomb, he was deeply moved. It was a cave with a stone lying against it. <sup>39</sup>He said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Take the stone away.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>Martha said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lord, by now he smells. He’s been dead four days.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>40</sup>Jesus said to her, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you’d see how great God is?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>They took the stone away. <sup>41</sup>He looked up and said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Father, thank you for hearing me. </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>42</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>I know you always do, but I’m saying it for the crowd standing here so they’ll believe you’ve sent me.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>43</sup>Then he shouted, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Lazarus, come out!”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> <sup>44</sup>The dead man came out bound hand to foot with strips of cloth, and his face was wrapped in a facecloth. </strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>Jesus said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Unwrap him and free him.”	</em></strong></span>		   	     </p>

<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 11:45-54)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>45</sup>Many Jews that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him; <sup>46</sup>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he’d done. <sup>47</sup>So the high priests and the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin into session. </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“What are we going to do? This man is doing lots of signs. </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>48</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>If we leave him alone like this, everybody’s going to believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>49</sup>Caiaphas, high priest that year, said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“There’s something you don’t understand: </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>50</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>It’s to your advantage that one man die for the people so the whole nation doesn’t perish.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>51</sup>Now he didn’t say this on his own; but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <sup>52</sup>and not for the nation only, but that he’d gather into one body the children of God scattered abroad. <sup>53</sup>From then on, they made plans to put him to death. <sup>54</sup>So Jesus quit walking openly among the Jews, and went away to the territory close to the desert—to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.		    				    </strong></span></p>
