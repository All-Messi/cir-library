<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 11:1-44)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">11:1There was a sick man, Lazarus of Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. 2This was the Mary that anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus was her brother. 3His sisters sent to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	4When he heard it, he said, “He’s not going to die from this sickness. It’s for God’s glory so it can glorify God’s Son.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">5Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days. 7Afterwards he said to the disciples, “Let’s go back to Judaea.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	8They said, “Rabbi, the Jews were trying to stone you just now, and you’re going back there?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	9Jesus answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? If a person walks in the daylight, he doesn’t stumble, because he has light. 10If he tries to walk in the dark, he stumbles because he doesn’t have light coming out of himself.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	11After he said that, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus is sleeping; I’m going to wake him up.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	12His disciples said, “Lord, if he’s sleeping, he’ll get better.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	13Jesus was talking about death, but they thought he was talking about rest. 14Then he told them plainly, “Lazarus has died. 15I’m glad for your sake that I wasn’t there, so you can believe. Let’s go to him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	16Thomas, called Didymus, said, “Let’s go along and can die with him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	17When Jesus got there, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. 18Now Bethany was a little less than two miles from Jerusalem. 19Many Jews had come to console Mary and Martha about their brother. 20When Martha heard Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary continued to sit in the house. 21Martha said, “Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. 22But I know even now that whatever you ask God for, he’ll give you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	23“Your brother will rise again.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	24Martha said, “I know he’ll rise again in the resurrectionat the end of time.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and life. Whoever believes in me will live even though he’s died. 26Everybody that lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	27“Yes, Lord; I’ve believed you’re the Messiah, God’s Son, who comes to the world.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	28When she’d said that, she went and called Mary privately, “The Rabbi’s here; he’s asking for you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	29She got up quickly and went to him. 30He hadn’t come in the village yet; he was still where Martha met him. 31When the Jews in the house with Mary saw her get up quickly and leave, they followed her. They supposed she was going to the tomb to mourn. 32Mary came to where Jesus was and fell down to him, “Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	33When Jesus saw her crying and the ones coming with her crying, he was deeply moved and troubled in himself, 34“Where have youpl laid him?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	They said, “We’ll show you.”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">35Jesus began to cry.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">36The Jews said, “See how much he loved him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">37Some said, “Couldn’t a man that gave sight to the blind man have kept this man from dying?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">38When Jesus got to the tomb, he was deeply moved. It was a cave with a stone lying against it. 39He said, “Take the stone away.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">Martha said, “Lord, by now he smells. He’s been dead four days.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">40Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you’d see how great God is?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">They took the stone away. 41He looked up and said, “Father, thank you for hearing me. 42I know you always do, but I’m saying it for the crowd standing here so they’ll believe you’ve sent me.” 43Then he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” 44The dead man came out bound hand to foot with strips of cloth, and his face was wrapped in a facecloth. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">Jesus said, “Unwrap him and free him.”			   	  </span>   </p>

<h3 class="topic-header">Plots to Kill Jesus</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 11:45-54)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">45Many Jews that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him; 46but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he’d done. 47So the high priests and the Pharisees called the Sanhedrin into session. “What are we going to do? This man is doing lots of signs. 48If we leave him alone like this, everybody’s going to believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	49Caiaphas, high priest that year, said, “There’s something you don’t understand: 50It’s to your advantage that one man die for the people so the whole nation doesn’t perish.” 51Now he didn’t say this on his own; but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52and not for the nation only, but that he’d gather into one body the children of God scattered abroad. 53From then on, they made plans to put him to death. 54So Jesus quit walking openly among the Jews, and went away to the territory close to the desert—to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.		    				    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">11On the way to Jerusalem, he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. 12As he came in one village, ten lepers met him. They stood a long ways off 13and shouted, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	14When he saw them, he said, “Go show yourselves to the priests.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">As they went, they were cleansed. 15When one of them saw he was healed, he came back, loudly glorifying God, 16and fell down on his face in front of Jesus, and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.  </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	17Jesus responded, “Weren’t there ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 18Was this foreigner the only one to come back and glorify God? </span></p>

<h3 class="topic-header">The Time of the Coming of the Kingdom</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 17:20-37)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	20The Pharisees asked when God’s kingdom would come. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He answered, “God’s kingdom won’t come in a way you can watch. 21People won’t say, ‘Here,’ or ‘There,’ because God’s kingdom is interpersonal.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">22He told his disciples, “The time’s coming when you’ll want to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you won’t see it. 23People will say to you, ‘Look, there it is’; [or]ms ‘Look, here it is.’ Don’t go anywhere or follow them. 24As lightning flashes from one end of the sky to the other, that’s the way the Son of Man will come. 25First, he has to suffer a lot of things and be rejected by people here now. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">26“As it was in Noah’s day, it will be in the Son of Man’s day. 27They were eating and marrying till Noah went in the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28As it was in Lot’s day, they were eating, buying, selling, planting, building. 29The day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed them all. 30It’ll be the same way when the Son of Man returns. 31At that time, a person on the roof must not go down to get his things out of the house. A person in the field must not go back for things at the house. 32Remember Lot’s wife. 33Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it, and whoever loses it will give life to his life. 34That night two will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 35Two will be grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other left.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">37They responded, “Where, Lord?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He said, “The buzzards will gather where the carcass is.”   		</span>   </p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 18:1-8)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">18:1He told a parable to the effect that people should always pray, and not lose heart. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">2“There was a judge in a town who didn’t fear God or respect man. 3A woman in that town came to him, ‘Give me legal protection against my opponent.’ 4At first he wouldn’t help her, but after a while he said to himself, ‘Though I don’t fear God or respect man, 5because this widow keeps hounding me, I’ll give her justice so she won’t wear me out, coming to me all the time.’”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	6The Lord said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“Listen to what the unjust judge illustrates. 7Won’t God surely provide justice for his chosen ones who call to him for help day and night, and is patient with them? 8I’m telling you, he’ll provide justice quickly. But, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”			     </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">9He told this parable to some who trusted in their own goodness and looked down on everybody else. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">10“Two men went up to the temple to pray, a Pharisee and a tax collector. 11The Pharisee stood, praying to himself, ‘God, I’m grateful to you that I’m not like everybody else—swindlers, unjust, adulterers—or like this tax collector. 12I fast twice a week; I tithe everything I get.’ </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">13“The tax collector stood a good ways off and wouldn’t even look up to heaven, but kept beating his chest, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14I’m telling you, this man went home justified instead of the other. Everybody that exalts himself will be humbled, but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”  						         	    </span></p>
