<h3 class="topic-header">at the Pool of Bethesda</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 5:1-47)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">5:1After that, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2At the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there was a pool that had five porches, called Bethesda in Hebrew. 3A crowd of infirm, blind, lame, and paralyzed people was lying in these porches. [</span><span class="gospel-mt">4</span><span class="gospel-jn">]ms 5One guy had been in his condition for thirty-eight years. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">6When Jesus saw him and knew he’d already been there a long time, he said, “Do you want to be cured?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	7The crippled man answered, “Sir, I don’t have anybody to take me in the pool when the water stirs. While I’m making my way down, somebody else gets there ahead of me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	8Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your bedroll, and walk.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">9Right away the guy was cured. He picked up his bedroll and started walking.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	It was a Sabbath day. 10So the Jews started telling the cured man, “It’s the Sabbath; 11it’s against the law to be carrying your bedroll.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	He answered, “The One that cured me told me, ‘Pick up your bedroll and walk.’”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	12They asked him, “Who told you that?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">13The cured man didn’t know who it was, because he hadn’t notice Jesus leave in the crowd. 14Later, Jesus found him in the temple, “You’ve been cured. Don’t sin anymore so something worse doesn’t happen to you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	15The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus that cured him. 16The Jews began to harass Jesus because he did it on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	17But Jesus answered them, “My Father has been working till now, and I’m working.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	18Now the Jews wanted to do more to him and put him to death. Not only had he broken the Sabbath; he said God was his Father. That made him equal to deity.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	19Jesus answered them, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“The Son of Man can’t do anything on his own. He does what he sees the Father do. 20The Father loves the Son and shows him what he’s doing; he’ll show him greater deeds than these so you’ll be amazed. 21As the Father raises the dead, so the Son makes alive the ones he wants to. 22The Father doesn’t judge anybody; he’s given judgment to the Son, 23so everybody will respect him like they do the Father. Whoever doesn’t respect the Son doesn’t respect the Father that sent him. 24Whoever listens to what the Son says and believes the One that sent him, has eternal life and doesn’t end up condemned. He’s crossed over from death to life. 25The time’s coming—and is now—when the dead will hear the Son and come to life. 26As the Father has life in himself, he has enabled the Son to have life in himself. 27And, he has given him the right to judge, because he’s a human being.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">28“Don’t be amazed that the time’s coming when everybody in the tombs will hear him. 29The ones that did good things will come out to a resurrection that leads to life.  The ones that did evil things will come out to a resurrection that leads to condemnation.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">30“I can’t do anything on my own. As I hear I judge, and my judgment is just, because I’m not trying to accomplish my own purpose, but the purpose of the One that sent me.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">31“If I speak for myself, you might consider suspect, what I’m saying. 32There is somebody else that speaks for me, and I know what he says is true: 33you sent to John, and he spoke the truth. 34I don’t receive people’s claims about me, but I do say this so you can be saved: 35John was a burning, shining lamp, and you were happy for a while in his light. 36But I have greater things to say than John did. The deeds the Father has given me to do speak for the fact that he sent me. 37The Father has spoken for me. You’ve not heard him speak or seen him, 38and you don’t believe in the One he sent. 39Search the scriptures, because you suppose you have eternal life in them; they talk about me. 40You just don’t want to come to me to have life.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">41“I don’t accept glory from people; 42I know you don’t love God. 43I’ve come in my Father’s name, and you don’t accept me. If somebody comes in his own name, youpl accept him. 44How can you believe when you accept glory from one another, and don’t strive for the glory that only comes from God? 45Don’t suppose I’m going to accuse you to the Father. Moses accuses you, the one you’ve put your faith in. 46 If you believed Moses, you’d be believing me, because he wrote about me. 47If you don’t believe what he wrote, how can you believe what I say?”       						</span>      </p>
