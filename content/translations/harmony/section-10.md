<h3 class="topic-header">Healing and Controversy at the Pool of Bethesda</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 5:1-47)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>5:1</sup>After that, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>2</sup>At the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there was a pool that had five porches, called </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>Bethesda</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> in Hebrew. <sup>3</sup>A crowd of infirm, blind, lame, and paralyzed people was lying in these porches.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>6</sup>When Jesus saw him and knew he’d already been there a long time, he said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Do you want to be cured?” </em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>7</sup>The crippled man answered, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Sir, I don’t have anybody to take me in the pool when the water stirs. While I’m making my way down, somebody else gets there ahead of me.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>8</sup>Jesus told him, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Get up, pick up your bedroll, and walk.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>9</sup>Right away the guy was cured. He picked up his bedroll and started walking.</strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	It was a Sabbath day. <sup>10</sup>So the Jews started telling the cured man, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“It’s the Sabbath; </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>it’s against the law to be carrying your bedroll.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>12</sup>They asked him, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Who told you that?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>13</sup>The cured man didn’t know who it was, because he hadn’t notice Jesus leave in the crowd. <sup>14</sup>Later, Jesus found him in the temple, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“You’ve been cured.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>15</sup>The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus that cured him. <sup>16</sup>The Jews began to harass Jesus because he did it on the Sabbath.</strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>18</sup>Now the Jews wanted to do more to him and put him to death. Not only had he broken the Sabbath; he said God was his Father. That made him equal to deity.</strong></span></p>
