<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	22Then they brought Jesus a demon-possessed blind mute, and he healed him; he could speak and see. 23The crowds were amazed, “This isn’t the Son of David, is it?”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	24When </span><span class="gospel-mk">22</span><span class="gospel-mt">scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem heard it, they said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">“What sense would it make for Satan cast out Satan? 24A kingdom divided against itself can’t stand and is desolate. No city or 25household divided against itself can stand. 26If Satan casts out Satan, he’s at cross purposes with himself; so how will his kingdom stand? 27If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, who do your students cast them out by? So judge for yourselves.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">“An evil and adulterous generation is straining to find a sign, but it won’t get one—except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40As ‘JONAH WAS IN THE STOMACH OF THE SEA MONSTER FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS’ [Jon 1:7], the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and nights. 41The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with people of today and condemn them. They repented at the preaching of Jonah; something greater than Jonah is here. 42The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with people of today and condemn them. She came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom; something greater than Solomon is here. </span></p>

That person’s last condition is worse than the first. That’s the way it’ll be with today’s evil people.”		   </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	30“What can we compare God’s kingdom to?
