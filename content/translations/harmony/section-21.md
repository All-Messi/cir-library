<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">22The Festival of Dedication </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Hanukkah] </span><span class="gospel-jn">took place in Jerusalem during the winter, 23and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s Portico. 24The Jews surrounded him and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? Are you the Messiah? Tell us plainly.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25Jesus answered, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“I’ve told you, and you didn’t believe me. The things I do in my Father’s name speak for me. 26But you don’t believe me because you’re not my sheep. 27My sheep hear my voice, and I know them. They follow me, 28and I give them eternal life. Nobody will snatch them out of my hand. 29My Father, who gave them to me, is more powerful than anybody. Nobody will snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 30The Father and I are at one.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	31Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him. 32Jesus replied to them, “I’ve shown you many good works from the Father. Which of them are you ready to stone me for?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	33“We’re not ready to stone you for a good deed, but for blasphemy. You’re a human being, and you’re making yourself deity.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	34Jesus responded, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Doesn’t your law say, ‘I SAID, YOU ARE GODS’? </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Ps 82:6]</span><span class="gospel-jn"> 35If he called them gods that the word of God came to—and scripture can’t be broken—36how do you say that the One the Father sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming, because I said, ‘I’m God’s Son’? 37If I’m not doing what my Father does, don’t believe me. 38If that’s what I am doing, though you don’t believe me, believe what I do so you can know that the Father’s in me and I’m in the Father.” </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">24“Make every effort to go in through the narrow door.

Go away, you evil people.’ 28There’ll be bitter crying and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets in God’s kingdom and yourselves thrown out. 29People will come from the east, west, north, and south and sit down in God’s kingdom. 30The last will be first and the first last.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">14:1On the Sabbath when he went in the house of a ruling Pharisee to eat, they were watching him closely. 2In front of him was a man with edema. 3Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	4They didn’t say anything. He took hold of him, and healed him and sent him away. 5He said, “Which of you, if a son or ox falls in a well, wouldn’t pull him out at once on the Sabbath day?” 6They couldn’t answer him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	7When he noticed how they were picking the prominent seats, he started telling the guests a parable. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">8“When somebody invites you to a wedding feast, don’t recline at table in the place of honor. Someone more distinguished than you may have been invited. 9The one that invited you both will say to yousg, ‘Let this man have his place.’ Then you’ll head for the last place, embarrassed. 10But, when you’re invited, go recline in the last place so when the one that invited you comes, he’ll say, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then the ones reclining at table will respect you. 11Everybody that exalts himself will be humbled, and the one that humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	12He went on to say to his host, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“When yousg make lunch or dinner, don’t call your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. They can invite you in return and pay you back. 13Invite the poor, disabled, lame, and blind. You’ll be blessed; they can’t repay you. 14You’ll get repaid when the righteous resurrect.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	15When one of the people reclining at the table heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one that eats bread in God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	16Jesus said to him, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“A man prepared a banquet and invited lots of people. 17When it was time for the meal, he sent a servant to tell them, ‘Come, everything’s ready.’ 18But they started making excuses. The first said, ‘I’ve bought a field; I need to go see it. Please, excuse me.’</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	19“Another one said, ‘I’ve bought five yoke of oxen; I’m on my way to try them out. Please, excuse me.’ </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 14:25-35)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">25Large crowds were traveling along with him. He turned and said to them, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">26“Nobody that comes to me can be my disciple unless they love me more than their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even their own life. 27Whoever doesn’t carry their own cross and follow me, can’t be my disciple. 28Who wants to build a tower and doesn’t sit down first and figure out what it’ll cost, to see if he has enough money to finish it? 29Otherwise, when he’s laid a foundation and can’t finish it, everybody that sees it will make fun of him, 30‘This fellow began to build and couldn’t finish it.’</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">31“What king that goes against another king in war, doesn’t sit down first to figure out whether with 10,000 he can meet the one with 20,000? 32If he can’t, while the other is a long way off, he’ll send ambassadors to ask for terms of peace. 33In the same way, none of you can be my disciples unless you give up everything you own.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">34“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, what’s going to make it salty? 35It’s useless for the ground or the manure pile. People throw it out. Whoever has ears to hear, listen!”</span>	   				    </p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">13“A few days later the younger son got everything together and left home for a distant country, and wasted his assets there, living immorally. 14When he’d spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he was out of money. 15He went to work for a citizen in that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 16He was so hungry he wanted to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but nobody would give him anything.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">17“He came to himself, ‘How many of my father’s hired hands have more than enough to eat, and I’m starving here. 18I’ll go to my father and say, “I’ve sinned against heaven and you. 19I don’t deserve to be your son anymore.

The sons of this age are smarter among their own kind than the sons of light are. 9Make friends by wealth that has nothing to do with being good so when it runs out, people will welcome you into permanent shelters. A person that’s reliable in small things will be reliable in big ones. 10A person that’s unreliable in small things will be unreliable in big ones. 11So if you prove to be unreliable in riches that have nothing to do with being good, who’ll trust you with true riches? 12If you prove to be unreliable with what belongs to somebody else, who’ll give you your own? 13No housekeeper can serve two employers. He’ll either disregard one and love the other, or pay attention to one and disregard the other. You can’t serve God and wealth.”	    </span></p>
