<p class="topic-reference">(Mt 8:5-13; Lk 7:1-10)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	7:1After he finished this message, he went to Capernaum. 2A centurion’s valued servant was sick, </span><span class="gospel-mt">laid up at home paralyzed and tormented terribly, </span><span class="gospel-lk">about to die. 3The centurion heard about Jesus, and sent elders of the Jews to ask him to come get his servant through it. 4When they got to Jesus, they urged him earnestly, “He deserves doing this for him. 5He loves our nation and built us a synagogue himself.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">Jesus said, “I’ll come and heal him,” 6</span><span class="gospel-lk">and went with them.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	While they were still a good ways from his house, the centurion sent friends, “Sir, don’t bother coming. I don’t deserve to have you under my roof. 7I didn’t even consider myself worthy of coming to you personally. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8I’m directed by the authority of superior officers myself with soldiers under me. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; to a servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	9When Jesus heard that, he was amazed, and turned around to the crowd, “I haven’t found faith like this even in Israel. </span><span class="gospel-mt">11Many will come from the east and the west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; 12and citizens of the kingdom themselves will be thrown out in the dark. There’ll be bitter crying and gnashing of teeth.”</span><span class="gospel-lk"> 10When the ones sent got back to the house, they found the servant healed. 							   						   </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 7:11-17)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">11Soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were going along. 12As he got near the town gate, people were carrying out a widow’s only son, and a sizable crowd of townspeople was with her. 13When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her, and told her not to cry. 14He went and touched the bier, and the pall bearers stopped. He said, “Young man, get up.” 15The dead boy sat up and started to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16Fear gripped them all, and they glorified God: “A great prophet has arisen among us; God has visited his people.” 17News about him spread all over Judaea and the surrounding countryside.  </span></p>

<h3 class="topic-header">Jesus’ Comments on John</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Mt 11:2-19; Lk 7:18-35)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	18John’s disciples reported to him </span><span class="gospel-mt">in prison</span> <span class="gospel-mt">what Messiah was doing.</span><span class="gospel-lk"> He called two of them 19and sent a question to the Lord, “Are you the one that’s coming, or are we supposed to wait for somebody else?” 20The men went to Jesus, “John the Baptist sent us to ask you, ‘Are you the One that’s coming, or are we supposed to wait for somebody else?’”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	21At the time, Jesus was healing people from sicknesses, afflictions, and evil spirits, and granting sight to a number of blind people. 22He answered them, “Go tell John </span><span class="gospel-mt">what</span> <span class="gospel-mt">you see:</span><span class="gospel-lk"> the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are hearing the good news. 23Blessed is the one that’s not disappointed in me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	24After John’s messengers left, he said to the crowd, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed waving in the wind? 25What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? People dressed in expensive clothes and living in luxury are in palaces. 26“What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, and more than a prophet. 27This is the one the scripture refers to,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		‘I’LL SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOU</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			TO PREPARE your ROAD AHEAD OF YOU’ </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Mal 3:1].</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">28Nobody ever born is greater than John, but the least in God’s kingdom is greater than he is.”</span><span class="gospel-mt"> 12From John’s time till now, aggressive people have been trying to bring in the kingdom of heaven by force. 13All the prophets and the law prophesied till John. 14If you’re willing to accept it, he is the Elijah that’s to come. 15Whoever has ears, let him hear.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	29When the people and the tax collectors heard that, they acknowledged God’s righteous requirements, because they had John baptize them. 30But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s intentions for them by not having him baptize them. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	31“What are people like today? 32They’re like kids sitting in a marketplace, calling to one another:</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		‘We played a flute for you;</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			you didn’t dance.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		We sang a funeral song; </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			you didn’t cry.’</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">33John the Baptist </span><span class="gospel-mt">came, not eating </span><span class="gospel-lk">bread </span><span class="gospel-mt">or drinking </span><span class="gospel-lk">wine, and you say, ‘He’s got a demon.’ 34The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘A glutton and a drunk, a pal of tax collectors and sinners.’ 35Wisdom becomes obvious from </span><span class="gospel-mt">what </span><span class="gospel-lk">it produces.”    </span>					  </p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	20He began to denounce the towns where many of his miracles happened, because they didn’t repent. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">21“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would’ve repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22It’ll be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on judgment day than for you. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	23“And Capernaum, you won’t rise up to heaven, will you? You’ll go down to hell.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	25Then Jesus said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealing them to infants. 26Yes, Father, you delighted in doing it that way.” </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 7:36-50)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	36A Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. He went in the Pharisee’s house and sat down. 37A woman of ill repute in town learned Jesus was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house. She brought an alabaster cruise of ointment, and 38stood behind him at his feet crying. She started to wet his feet with her tears, wipe them with her hair, kiss them, and anoint them with the ointment. 39When the Pharisee saw it, he thought to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he’d know who she is and what kind of woman is touching him—a prostitute.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	40Jesus responded, “Simon, a question.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	“What’s that, Rabbi?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	41“A money lender had two clients that owned him money. One owed five hundred denarii; the other owed fifty. 42When they couldn’t pay him back, he forgave them both. Which loved him more?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	43“I suppose the one he forgave more.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">Jesus said, “That’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">44He turned to the woman and said to Simon,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	“You see this woman? I came in your house; you didn’t give me any water, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45You didn’t give me a kiss, but from the time she got here she’s been kissing my feet. 46You didn’t anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed ointment. 47So, I’ve forgiven her many sins because she loved a lot. The one forgiven little loves little.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	48He told her, “I’ve forgiven your sins.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	49The ones reclining at table with him started saying to themselves, “Who is this that forgives sins?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	50He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”	    </span></p>
