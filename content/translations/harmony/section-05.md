<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">41Every year his parents would go up to Jerusalem to the Passover Festival. 42When he was twelve, they went up to the festival as usual. 43After it was over, they headed back; but the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem, and his parents didn’t know it. 44They supposed he was in the caravan. They traveled for a day and started looking for him among relatives and acquaintances. 45When they didn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem. 46Three days later they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking them questions. 47Everybody that heard him was surprised at his understanding and answers. 48When his parents saw him, they were astonished. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">His mother said, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking for you, worried sick.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	49He said, “Why were you looking all over for me? Didn’t you know I’d be in my Father’s house?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	50They didn’t understand what he meant.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	51He went down with them to Nazareth and was subject to them, and his mother treasured this up in her heart. 52Jesus kept growing in wisdom and stature, in favor with God and man.									    	    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“Nest of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8Bear fruit fit for repentance, and don’t say to yourselves, ‘Abraham’s our ancestor.’ God can raise up descendants of Abraham from these rocks. 9An axe is already lying at the base of the trees. Every tree that doesn’t bear good fruit will be chopped down and thrown in the fire.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	10The crowds asked him, “What should we do?”</span></p>

I’m not worthy to undo his sandal straps. He’ll immerse you in the Holy Spirit </span><span class="gospel-mt">and fire</span><span class="gospel-lk">. 17His winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clean up his threshing floor. He’ll gather the seed into his granary and burn up the chaff with a fire you can’t put out.”</span></p>
