<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">As he was making his way along, the </span><span class="gospel-mt">large </span><span class="gospel-lk">crowd was pressing in on him. </span><span class="gospel-mk">25A woman there had had chronic hemorrhaging for twelve years. 26</span><span class="gospel-mt">She’d been put through a lot by doctors and spent everything she had without any benefit—but got worse. 27When she heard about Jesus, 21she said to herself, “If I can just touch his cloak, I’ll be cured.” 44</span><span class="gospel-lk">She came up behind Jesus </span><span class="gospel-mt">in the crowd </span><span class="gospel-lk">and touched the fringe of his cloak. </span><span class="gospel-mk">29Right away the bleeding stopped. </span><span class="gospel-mt">She could tell in her body that she was healed from the scourge she’d been dealing with for so long.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">6:14</span><span class="gospel-mt">King Herod </span><span class="gospel-lk">the tetrarch </span><span class="gospel-mt">heard about Jesus, because Jesus had become well known. </span><span class="gospel-lk">He was confused because </span><span class="gospel-mt">people were saying John the Baptist had arisen from the dead and that was why miraculous powers were working in him. Some were saying </span><span class="gospel-lk">Elijah had appeared; </span><span class="gospel-mt">others, that </span><span class="gospel-lk">one of the prophets of old had resurrected </span><span class="gospel-mt">or that he was a prophet like one of the prophets. </span><span class="gospel-lk">Herod said </span><span class="gospel-mt">to his servants, </span><span class="gospel-lk">“I beheaded John </span><span class="gospel-mt">the Baptist. </span><span class="gospel-lk">Who is this that I’m hearing such things about? </span><span class="gospel-mt">Has John risen from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers are working in him?” </span><span class="gospel-lk">Herod kept trying to see Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mt">Herod had sent and arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; he’d married her. John kept telling him, “It’s against the law for you to be living with her.” </span><span class="gospel-mk">19</span><span class="gospel-mt">Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to have him killed; but she couldn’t, 20because Herod was afraid of the general public; they considered John a prophet. He was also afraid of John. He knew he was upright and holy, and he protected him. When he listened to him, he was confused, but he relished listening to him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	21A chance came on his birthday when Herod threw a banquet for his lords, military commanders, and prominent men in Galilee. Herodias’ daughter danced at the banquet, and it pleased Herod and the ones reclining at table with him. Consequently, the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.” 23He solemnly swore, “I’ll give you whatever you ask me for up to half my kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	24She went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	She said, “The head of John the Baptist.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	25At once she came to the king, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	26Although Herod became deeply grieved, because of the oaths and the guests, he wasn’t willing to refuse her. 27Right then he sent the executioner and commanded him to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded him in prison, 28and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	29When John’ disciples heard about it, they came to get the corpse and put it in a tomb, and went and told Jesus.			  	      </span></p>
