<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">13:1Before the Passover festival, Jesus knew the time had come for him to go to the Father. He loved his own who were in the world and loved them to the end. 2By the time of the supper, the devil had put it in the heart of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him. 3Jesus knew the Father had placed everything in his hands. 4He got up from supper, laid his outer clothes aside, and took a towel and hung it over himself. 5He put some water in a basin, and started washing his disciples’ feet, and drying them with the towel.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">19Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Are you talking about what I said, ‘In a little while, you won’t see me; again in a little while, you’ll see me’? 20You’ll mourn, but the world will be glad. You’ll grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. 21When a woman’s in labor, she has grief; but when she has the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of bringing a person into the world. 22You’ll grieve, but I’ll see you again, and you’ll be glad. Nobody will take your gladness away. 23In that day you won’t ask me for anything. Whatever you ask the Father in my name now he’ll give you. 24Up till now you haven’t asked for anything in my name. Ask and you’ll receive so your joy will be complete.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25“I’ve been using illustrations. The time’s coming when I’ll speak plainly about the Father. 26Then you’ll ask in my name; and, rest assured, I’ll ask the Father for you. 27The Father himself loves you because you love me and believe I came from him. 28I did come from him to the world. Again, I’m leaving the world and going back to him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	29The disciples said, “Now you’re speaking clearly. 30Now we know that you know everything and don’t need anybody to ask you. That’s why we believe you’ve come from God.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	31Jesus responded, “Do you believe now? 32The time’s coming—and is almost here—when each of you will scatter and leave me alone. But I’m not alone, because the Father’s with me. 33I’ve told you these things so you’ll have peace. In the world you have trouble, but take heart, I’ve overcome the world.” 	    		     </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">17:1Jesus looked up to heaven, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Father, it’s time. Honor your Son so he can honor you. 2You gave him authority to give eternal life to everybody you’ve given him. 3Eternal life means knowing you, the only true God, and Jesus the Messiah, the One you sent. 4I’ve honored you on earth and completed the work you gave me to do. 5Now, honor me and yourself with the honor I had with you before the earth existed.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	6“I’ve shown you to the ones you gave me out of the world, and they’ve kept your word. 7Now they know that the message I’ve given them came from you. 8They know that I really did come from you, and believe you sent me. 9I’m not asking about the world, but about the ones you gave me. 10My things are yours and yours are mine, and they’ve honored me. 11I’m not in the world anymore, but they are and I’m coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name so they can be one like we are. 12When I was with them, I kept them in your name, and none of them have perished except the one destined to perish—to fulfill scripture. 13I’m saying these things so they can fully experience my joy. 14The world hates them because they’re not like the world. 15I’m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. 16They’re not like the world as I am not. 17I’ve sanctified them with the truth—with your message. 18As you sent me to the world, I’ve sent them out into it. 19I’ve sanctified myself for them so the truth can sanctify them. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	20“Father, I’m not asking just that these be one, but that their converts also be one. 21That way the world will know you sent me. 22I’ve given them the honor you gave me so they can be one like us—23so the world may know you love them like you love me. 24I want them to be with me where I am so they can see the honor you gave me because you loved me before the world existed. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25“Righteous Father, the world didn’t know you, but I knew you, and these know you sent me. 26I’ll continue to make you known to them so the love you loved me with may be in them like I’m in them.”	</span></p>
