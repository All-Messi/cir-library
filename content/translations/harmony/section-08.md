<h3 class="topic-header">The Woman at the Well</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 4:1-42)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">4:1When Jesus found out that the Pharisees heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John (2though Jesus didn’t perform the baptisms himself; his disciples did it), 3he left Judaea and headed back to Galilee. 4He needed to go through Samaria. 5He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar near the plot of land Jacob gave his son Joseph. 6Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was sitting on the well, tired from the trip. It was about noon.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	7A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and he said to her, “Give me a drink.” (8His disciples had gone into town to buy food.) </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	9The woman said, “How does a Jewish man like you ask a Samaritan woman like me for a drink? Jews don’t associate with Samaritans.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	10Jesus answered her, “If you knew God’s gift and who’s saying, ‘Give me a drink,’ you’d be asking him to give you living water.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	 <span class="gospel-jn">11“Sir, you don’t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get ‘living water’? 12You aren’t greater than our ancestor Jacob, are you? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, his sons, and his herds.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	13Jesus answered, “Everybody that drinks this water gets thirsty again. 14Whoever drinks the water I give him won’t ever get thirsty again. It’ll become a well inside of him, springing up into eternal life.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	15“Sir, give me that water so I won’t get thirsty and have to come here to draw it!”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	16Jesus told her, “Go call your husband and come back.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	17“I don’t have a husband.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	18“You said it well. You’ve had five husbands; the one you’re living with now isn’t your husband. You told the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	19The woman said, “Sir, you must be a prophet. 20Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. Youpl say people should worship in Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	21Jesus told her, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Believe me, the time’s coming when youpl won’t worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem. 22You don’t know what you’re worshiping. We know what we’re worshiping, because salvation does come from the Jews. 23But, the time’s coming—and it’s here now—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. The Father’s looking for people like that to worship him. 24God’s a spirit. and the ones that worship him need to worship him in spirit and truth.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	 25“I know the Messiah’s coming [called Christ]. He’ll explain everything.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	26Jesus said, “I am the Messiah.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	27At that point his disciples got back and were surprised he was talking to a woman. But nobody said, “What are you trying to find out?” “Why are you talking to her?” 28She left her water pot, and went in town, and said to the men, 29“Come see a guy that told me everything I ever did. This isn’t the Messiah, is it?” 30They left the town and were on the way to him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	31Meanwhile the disciples kept saying, “Rabbi, eat something.”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	32But he said, “I have ‘food’ to eat that you don’t know about.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	33They said to one another, “Nobody’s brought him anything to eat, have they?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	34Jesus said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“My ‘food’ is doing the will of the One that sent me and finishing it up. 35Aren’t youpl saying, ‘Harvest is still four months away’? Look; the fields are ready for harvest now. 36Whoever reaps earns wages and gathers grain for eternal life. 37In this respect the saying rings true, ‘One sows, another reaps.’ 38I’ve sent you to reap what you haven’t worked on. Other people have worked, and you’ve joined in their work.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	39From that town many Samaritans believed in him because the woman said, “He told me everything I ever did.” 40So when the Samaritans got to where he was, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed two days. 41Many more believed because of what he said. 42They told the woman, “We don’t believe just because of what you said. We’ve heard him ourselves, and know this really is the Savior of the world.”		      		      </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">46Then he went to Cana in Galilee, where he’d turned the water to wine. There was an official whose boy was sick in Capernaum. 47When he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he went to ask him to come down and heal his boy, who was about to die. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">48Jesus told him, “Unless youpl see signs, you won’t believe, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">49The official said, “Sir, come on down before my boy dies.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">50Jesus told him, “Go on, your boy’s alive.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">16He went to Nazareth, where he grew up. He went in the synagogue on the Sabbath as usual, and stood up to read. 17They gave him a scroll of the prophet Isaiah, and he unrolled it to where it says,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		18“THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS ON ME.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			HE’S ANOINTED ME TO TELL GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">20He rolled up the scroll, gave it to the attendant, and sat down. Everybody in the synagogue was looking directly at him. 21He began, “Today you can hear this scripture being fulfilled.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">22They were talking about him and marveling at the eloquent way he was speaking. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	23He said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“No doubt you’ll use this saying against me: ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ ‘What we heard happened in Capernaum do in your hometown too.’ 24I’m telling you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown. 25Lots of widows lived in Israel at the time of Elijah, when it didn’t rain for 3½ years and a severe famine dragged on. 26But Elijah wasn’t sent to any of them but to a widow in Zarephath up around Sidon. 27Lots of lepers lived in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	28Everybody in the synagogue just lost it. 29They jumped up and threw him out of town. They hustled him to the brow of the hill the town was built on, to throw him over the cliff. 30But he passed through the mob and left.			    		    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">5:1While the crowd was pressing him and listening to God’s message, he was standing by Lake Gennesaret, 2and saw two boats on the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	3He got in one of the boats—Simon’s—and asked him to shove it out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and started teaching the crowd from the boat.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	4When he stopped teaching, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	5Peter answered, “Master, we worked all night and didn’t catch a thing. But, at your bidding I’ll let down the nets.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	6When they did, they caught such a big school of fish that their nets started to break. 7They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come help. They came and filled both boats so that they were riding low in the water. 8When Peter saw it, he fell at Jesus’ knees, “Go away from me; I’m a sinful man, Lord.” 9Amazement gripped him and everybody with him over the catch of fish, 10including James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	Jesus said to him, “You don’t need to be afraid. From now on you’ll be ‘catching’ people.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	11When </span><span class="gospel-mt">Peter and his brother Andrew </span><span class="gospel-lk">brought their boats to land, they left </span><span class="gospel-mt">their nets and </span><span class="gospel-lk">everything behind and went with him. </span><span class="gospel-mk">19A little farther along, </span><span class="gospel-mt">21James and John were in a boat with their father, mending nets. </span><span class="gospel-mk">20He called them, and they </span><span class="gospel-mt">22left the boat and their father and the hired help.						    	     </span></p>
