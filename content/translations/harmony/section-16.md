<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">7:1After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He didn’t want to travel in Judaea because the Jews were trying to kill him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">7:1</span><span class="gospel-mt">Some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem 2had seen some of his disciples eat with defiled—unwashed—hands. (3The Pharisees and all the Jews always wash their hands vigorously before they eat—keeping the tradition of the elders. 4When they come in from the marketplace, they don’t eat unless they take a bath. They keep many other customs—immersing cups, pitchers, bronze kettles [, and stretchers]ms.). 5They gathered around Jesus and asked, “Why don’t your disciples follow the tradition of the elders, instead of eating with defiled hands?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	3He answered them, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">“And why do you transgress the commandment of God with your tradition? 4A case in point: God said, ‘HONOR FATHER AND MOTHER’ [Ex 20:12; Deut 5:16], and ‘PUT TO DEATH WHOEVER CUSSES AT his FATHER OR MOTHER’ [Ex 21:17]. 5But you say, ‘Whoever says to father or mother, “Whatever of mine would have helped you I’ve given to God [Corban].” 6He surely won’t be honoring his father. </span><span class="gospel-mk">12</span><span class="gospel-mt">You let him do nothing for his parents. 8-9You neatly set aside divine commandment to establish human tradition. 13You negate God’s word with your tradition. You do a lot of things like that.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	10He called the crowd, “Listen, all of you; get this. 11It’s not what goes in your mouth that defiles you. It’s what comes out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	12The disciples came to him, “Do you realize you offended the Pharisees with what you said?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	13“Every plant my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be pulled up. 14Let them alone; they’re blind guides of blind people. If a blind man guides a blind man, they both fall in the ditch.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	15Peter said, “What’s the illustration mean?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	16“Youpl still don’t understand either? 17You do know, don’t you, that everything that goes in your mouth goes in your stomach and ends up in the toilet? [cleansing all foods] Nothing that goes in you can defile you, because it doesn’t go in your heart. 18But, what comes out of your mouth comes from your heart: that’s what defiles you. 19It’s from your heart that evil thoughts come, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, lying, slander, blasphemy, </span><span class="gospel-mk">22</span><span class="gospel-mt">coveting, wickedness, deception, indecency, jealousy, pride, senselessness. 20They’re what defile you. Not washing your hands when you eat, doesn’t defile you.”									  </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">24From there </span><span class="gospel-mt">Jesus left for the territory around Tyre and Sidon </span><span class="gospel-mk">and went in a house, because he didn’t want anybody to know, but he couldn’t hide</span><span class="gospel-mt">. </span><span class="gospel-mk">25Right away, </span><span class="gospel-mt">a Canaanite woman from the area, </span><span class="gospel-mk">whose daughter had an unclean spirit, heard about him and </span><span class="gospel-mt">22began to shout, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	His disciples came and asked him, “Send her away; she keeps shouting behind us.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	25But she came and bowed down to him, “Lord, help me.”</span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Mt 15:29-39; Mk 7:31-8:9)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">31Jesus left the area around Tyre, and traveled through Sidon to Lake Galilee. </span><span class="gospel-mt">29He crossed over the lake, and went up on a hill </span><span class="gospel-mk">in the Decapolis </span><span class="gospel-mt">and sat down. 30Big crowds came with lame, blind, disabled, mute, and other needs; and put them by him, and he healed them. 31They were amazed to see the mute speak, the disabled healthy, the lame walk, the blind see; and they glorified Israel’s God.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">32They brought him a deaf man with a speech impediment, and asked him to lay his hand on him. 33He took him away from the crowd by himself, and put his fingers in his ears and spit and touched his tongue. 34He looked up at the sky, and made a groaning sound and said, “Ephphatha [Open up].” 35His ears opened, and the bond of his tongue loosened, and he started speaking clearly. 36Jesus told the people not to tell anybody; but the more he told people to keep something quiet, the more they spread it around. 37They were completely astonished, “He’s done everything well. He even makes deaf people hear and mutes speak.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">8:1At that time again the large crowd didn’t have anything to eat. </span><span class="gospel-mt">32Jesus called his disciples to him, “I feel for the crowd. They’ve stayed with me three days </span><span class="gospel-mk">already </span><span class="gospel-mt">without anything to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry for fear they’ll give out on the way. </span><span class="gospel-mk">Some of them have come a long way.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	33His disciples said, “Where can we get enough bread out in the country to satisfy such a crowd?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	34“How many loaves do you have?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Seven—and a few small fish.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	35He had the crowd sit down on the ground. 36He took the seven loaves and the fish, blessed them, broke them up, and gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd. 37They all ate till they were full. The disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover pieces. </span><span class="gospel-mk">About </span><span class="gospel-mt">38four thousand men ate—besides women and children. 39After he dismissed them, he </span><span class="gospel-mk">directly </span><span class="gospel-mt">got in a boat and went to the area around Magadan and </span><span class="gospel-mk">Dalmanutha</span><span class="gospel-mt">.	      </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	16:1The Pharisees and the Sadducees came </span><span class="gospel-mk">11and began to argue with him </span><span class="gospel-mt">and </span><span class="gospel-mk">demand </span><span class="gospel-mt">a sign from the sky, testing him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">12He groaned under his breath, “Why do people today keep looking for a sign?</span><span class="gospel-mt"> 2When evening comes, you say, ‘It’ll be fair weather; the sky’s red.’ 3In the morning, ‘It’ll be bad weather today; the sky’s red and dark.’ You can read the sky, but you can’t read the signs of the times. 4An evil and adulterous generation keeps looking for a sign, but it’s not going to get one—except for the sign of Jonah.” </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	5The disciples went to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. </span><span class="gospel-mk">14They had just one loaf left in the boat. 15He gave them strict orders</span><span class="gospel-mt">, 6“Watch out for the ‘leaven’ of the Pharisees and Sadducees </span><span class="gospel-mk">and Herodians.”</span> </p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	7They started talking among themselves, “He said that because we didn’t bring any bread.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	8Jesus knew it, “Men with little faith, why are you talking about not having any bread? </span><span class="gospel-mk">17Don’t you get it yet? Do you have hearts that don’t understand? 18Do you have eyes but don’t see, and ears but don’t hear? Don’t you remember 19how many baskets of leftovers you picked up when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mk">	“Twelve.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mk">	20How many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand?”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">12Then they understood he hadn’t warned them about the leaven in bread, but about the “teaching” of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 			 </span></p>
