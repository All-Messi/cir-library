<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">27</span><span class="gospel-mt">Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. </span><span class="gospel-lk">18When he was praying by himself, his disciples were with him. He asked them, </span><span class="gospel-mt">13“Who are </span><span class="gospel-lk">the crowds </span><span class="gospel-mt">saying I, the Son of Man, am?” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	14“Some say John the Baptist; some, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or </span><span class="gospel-lk">19a prophet of old that’s resurrected.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mt">15“Who do you say I am?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	16Simon Peter said, “You’re the Messiah, the Son of the Living God.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	17“Bless you, Simon Barjonah. You didn’t get that from other people, but from my heavenly Father. 18You’re‘Peter’; I’ll build my church on that ‘rock.’ Even the gates of the grave won’t be strong enough to stop it. 19I’ll give yousg the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you let loose on earth will be let loose in heaven.” 20Then he charged them not to tell anybody he was the Messiah.	   </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	21From then on Jesus started showing his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem; suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be put to death, and resurrect the third day. </span><span class="gospel-mk">32</span><span class="gospel-mt">He was stating the matter plainly, and Peter pulled him aside and got after him, “Surely not, Lord! This is not going to happen to you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	22But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan. You’re a stumbling block to me. You don’t have your mind on God’s interests, but on people’s interests.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">34</span><span class="gospel-mt">He called the crowd with his disciples, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">24“If anybody wants to follow me, he has to set his own interests aside, pick up his cross, and follow me. 25Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, whoever loses his life because of me and the good news will find it. 26What good does it do a person to gain the whole world and lose his life? What will he give in exchange for his life? </span><span class="gospel-mk">38</span><span class="gospel-mt">Whoever’s ashamed of me and my message in this adulterous and sinful time, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes </span><span class="gospel-lk">26in the glory of himself, the Father, and his holy angels. 27Some standing here won’t die before they see </span><span class="gospel-mt">the Son of Man coming in his kingdom with power.”		    		    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">28About </span><span class="gospel-mk">s</span><span class="gospel-mt">ix </span><span class="gospel-lk">or eight days after he said this, Jesus took Peter, James, and </span><span class="gospel-mt">his brother </span><span class="gospel-lk">John along, and went up on a </span><span class="gospel-mt">high </span><span class="gospel-lk">mountain to pray 29While he was praying, </span><span class="gospel-mt">2he was transfigured in front of them. His face glowed like the sun, and his clothes became </span><span class="gospel-lk">brilliant white—</span><span class="gospel-mt">as white as light, like no laundryman can bleach them. </span><span class="gospel-lk">30Two men were talking to him—Moses and Elijah. 31They had a brilliant appearance, and talked about his death soon in Jerusalem. 32Peter and the ones with him were weighed down with sleep, but they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">33As they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, </span><span class="gospel-mt">“Rabbi, </span><span class="gospel-lk">it’s good </span><span class="gospel-mk">for us </span><span class="gospel-lk">to be here. </span><span class="gospel-mt">If you want, I’ll set up </span><span class="gospel-lk">three tents—one for you and Moses and Elijah”—not thinking about what he was saying, </span><span class="gospel-mt">because they were afraid. 5While he was still talking, a bright cloud </span><span class="gospel-lk">engulfed </span><span class="gospel-mt">them. </span><span class="gospel-lk">34They were afraid as they went into the cloud.</span><span class="gospel-mt"> A voice spoke out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son that I delight in.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	9As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus impressed on them, “Don’t tell anybody about what you saw till the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” They kept the matter to themselves, and discussed what “rising from the dead” meant.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	10The disciples asked, “Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	11“Elijah does come </span><span class="gospel-mk">first </span><span class="gospel-mt">to restore everything. 12He’s already come, and they didn’t recognize him.

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">37The next day</span> <span class="gospel-lk">when they came down from the mountain and </span><span class="gospel-mk">14</span><span class="gospel-mt">got back to the rest of the disciples, they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. 15At once when they saw him, the whole crowd was really surprised and ran to greet him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	16Jesus asked, “Why are you arguing with them?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">38A man from the crowd ran up </span><span class="gospel-mt">to Jesus, falling on his knees, “</span><span class="gospel-lk">Rabbi, please </span><span class="gospel-mt">have mercy on my boy. </span><span class="gospel-lk">He’s the only son I have. </span><span class="gospel-mt">He’s an epileptic and suffers badly. </span><span class="gospel-lk">39A spirit seizes him and all of a sudden he screams. It </span><span class="gospel-mk">17makes him unable to talk and 18</span><span class="gospel-mt">throws him on the ground </span><span class="gospel-lk">and convulses him and bruises him</span><span class="gospel-mt">. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and it makes him stiff. </span><span class="gospel-mk">22</span><span class="gospel-mt">Lots of times it has thrown him in the fire or the water to destroy him. </span><span class="gospel-lk">It seldom leaves him. 40I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they couldn’t </span><span class="gospel-mt">do it. But if you can, help us; have sympathy for us.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	23Jesus said, “If you can? Everything is possible if a person believes.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	24The dad cried out, “I believe! Help my unbelief!”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">41</span><span class="gospel-lk">Jesus answered. “Unbelieving, perverse bunch, how long am I going to be with you? </span><span class="gospel-mt">How long am I going to deal with you? Bringpl him here.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">20</span><span class="gospel-mt">They brought him; and when the spirit saw Jesus, </span><span class="gospel-lk">it attacked the boy and </span><span class="gospel-mt">threw him into convulsions. He fell on the ground and rolled around, and foamed at the mouth.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	21Jesus asked his dad, “How long has this been going on?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Ever since he was little.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">25</span><span class="gospel-mt">When he saw the crowd quickly coming together, Jesus commanded the unclean spirit, “Mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and don’t go into him again.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">26</span><span class="gospel-mt">It cried out and threw him into severe convulsions, and came out. The boy looked like he was dead, so much so that many of them said he’d died.

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">28</span><span class="gospel-mt">When Jesus went in a house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	20“Because your faith was weak. </span><span class="gospel-mk">29</span><span class="gospel-mt">This kind doesn’t come out except by prayer.
