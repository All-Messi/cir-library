<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>35</sup>The next day John was standing with two disciples. <sup>36</sup>When he saw Jesus walk by, he said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Look, the Lamb of God!”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> <sup>37</sup>His two disciples heard him and followed Jesus. <sup>38</sup>Jesus turned around and saw them, </strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>So they went and saw where he was staying and stayed with him that day. It was about four o’clock. </strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>40</sup>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two that followed Jesus. <sup>41</sup>He found his brother Simon, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“We’ve found the Messiah [the Christ].”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> <sup>42</sup>When he brought him to Jesus, Jesus looked at him, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“You’re Simon, son of John; you’ll be called Cephas [Peter].”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>43</sup>The next day Jesus wanted to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Come with me.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>44</sup>Philip was from Bethsaida, where Andrew and Peter lived. <sup>45</sup>Philip found Nathanael, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“We’ve found the One that Moses and the prophets wrote about in the law: Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael coming, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“A true Israelite with no deceit in him.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 2:1-11)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>2:1</sup>Three days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, <sup>2</sup>and Jesus and his disciples were invited. <sup>3</sup>When the wine ran out, his mother said to him, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“They don’t have any more wine.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>4</sup>Jesus said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“What’s between you and us? It’s not my time yet.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>5</sup>His mother told the help, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Do whatever he tells you.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>6</sup>Now six large stone water pots were standing there that the Jews use for purification. They held twenty or thirty gallons apiece. <sup>7</sup>Jesus said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Fill the pots with water.”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> They filled them to the brim. 8</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies.”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong> <sup>9</sup>When the master of ceremonies tasted it, he didn’t know where it had come from—but the help that drew the water knew. He called the groom,</strong></span> <span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Everybody serves good wine first. When people have drunk freely, they serve wine that’s not as good. You’ve kept the good wine till now.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>11</sup>So Cana was where Jesus performed his first sign and demonstrated his glory, and his disciples believed in him.	     					     	           				     </strong></span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(<span class="gospel-jn">Jn</span> 2:13-25)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>13</sup>The Jewish Passover was coming up, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>In the temple he found the men that were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and found moneychangers sitting there. <sup>15</sup>He made a whip out of cords and drove the sheep and oxen out of the temple. He poured out the moneychangers’ coins and turned their tables over. <sup>16</sup>He told the ones selling doves, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Get them out of here; don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace.” </em></strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>17</sup>His disciples remembered that the scripture said,</strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em> “ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE HAS CONSUMED ME”</em></strong></span> <span class="gospel-mt"><strong>[Ps 69:9].</strong></span> </p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>18</sup>The Jews said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“What sign do you show us that you have a right to do this?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>19</sup>Jesus answered, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Destroy this temple, and I’ll raise it up in three days.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>23</sup>While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many people believed in him because they saw the signs he did. <sup>24</sup>But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them because he knew everybody. He didn’t need anybody to tell him about anybody; he knew what was in him.    </strong></span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn"><strong><sup>3:1</sup>Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, <sup>2</sup>came to Jesus at night, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“Rabbi, we know you’re a teacher from God.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>4</sup>Nicodemus said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-jn"><strong><em>“How can you be born when you’re an adult? You can’t get in your mother’s womb a second time and be born, can you?”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn"><strong>	<sup>5</sup>Jesus answered, </strong></span></p>
