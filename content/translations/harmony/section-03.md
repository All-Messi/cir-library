<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 1:57-80)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">57The time came for Elizabeth to have her baby, and she had a son. 58Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord showed her such mercy, and they celebrated with her. 59On the eighth day they came to circumcise the little boy, and started calling him “Zachariah,” after his father. 60His mother answered, “No, his name is ‘John.’”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	61But they said, “None of your relatives are named that.” 62They motioned to his father what he wanted to name him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">63He asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is ‘John.’” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">They were surprised. 74Right then, Zechariah began to speak and praise God. 65Their neighbors were afraid. Everybody in the hill country of Judaea was talking about it. 66The ones that heard what happened took it to heart, “What’s this child going to be” [because the Lord was with him]?</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	67Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	68“Blessed be Israel’s God.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		He has visited us,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			and delivered his people.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	69He has raised up a horn of salvation for us</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		in the house of David his servant—</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">70as he said through his holy prophets of old—</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">71salvation from our enemies, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">    from everybody that hates us. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">72He showed mercy to our ancestors and </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">remembered his holy covenant,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">73the oath he swore to our ancestor Abraham,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	74to deliver us from our enemies</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	so we can serve him without fear </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">75in holiness and goodness our whole lives.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	76You, child, will be a prophet for the Most High.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		You’ll go ahead of the Lord</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			to prepare his way,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			77to tell his people how to be saved from their sins.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">			78Our God is a God of tender mercy.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">				 Because of it the Sunrise from on high will visit us,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">					79to shine on a people sitting in darkness and</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">								   the shadow of death,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">					to direct us into the way of peace.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	80The child grew up and became strong in spirit. He lived in the open country till his public appearance to Israel.							    	    </span></p>
