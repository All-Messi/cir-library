<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk"><strong><sup>57</sup>The time came for Elizabeth to have </strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong><em>her</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong> baby, and she had a son. <sup>58</sup>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord showed her such mercy, and they celebrated with her. <sup>59</sup>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the little boy, and started calling him “Zachariah,” after his father.</strong></span> <span class="gospel-lk"><strong><sup>60</sup>His mother answered, </strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong><em>“No, his name is ‘John.’”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk"><strong><sup>61</sup>But they said, </strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong><em>“None of your relatives are named that.”</em></strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong> <sup>62</sup>They motioned to his father what he wanted to name him. </strong></span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk"><strong><sup>63</sup>He asked for a tablet and wrote, </strong></span><span class="gospel-lk"><strong><em>“His name is ‘John.’” </em></strong></span></p>
