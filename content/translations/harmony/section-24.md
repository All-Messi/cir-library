<p class="topic-reference">(Jn 11:55-12:1. 9-11)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">55Now the Jews’ Passover was coming up, and people from around Ephraim went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves ceremonially. 56They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he won’t come to the festival.” 57The chief priests and the Pharisees had passed laws that if anybody knew where he was, he should report it so they could arrest him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	12:1Six days before the Passover Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived that Jesus had raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">9A great crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there. They didn’t come just because of him, but to see Lazarus. 10The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too, because many Jews were going away 11and believing in Jesus because of him.	    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	Jesus arrived at Bethany. </span><span class="gospel-jn">2</span><span class="gospel-mt">They made him a meal there in the house of Simon the leper. Martha was waiting on </span><span class="gospel-jn">Jesus, </span><span class="gospel-mt">and Lazarus was reclining at table with him. 3Mary took twelve ounces of ointment in an alabaster cruise—pure nard, very expensive—broke open the cruise and poured the ointment on Jesus’ head </span><span class="gospel-jn">and feet</span><span class="gospel-mt"> while he was reclining at table, and started wiping his feet with her hair. The scent from the ointment filled the whole house.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	The disciples were indignant when they saw it, and said to one another, “What’s the point of such waste?” 4Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ disciples—the one that was going to betray him—said, 5“Why didn’t she sell this ointment for three hundred denarii and give it to the poor?” (6He didn’t say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He took care of the money pouch, and had been stealing from it.) They started fussing at her. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	7Jesus said, “Why are you fussing at her? She has done me a good turn. </span><span class="gospel-mk">8</span><span class="gospel-mt">She did what she could: let her be putting this ointment on my body beforehand to prepare me for burial. </span><span class="gospel-jn">8</span><span class="gospel-mt">You always have poor people around you; you can do something good them whenever you want to. You don’t always have me. 9Wherever you preach the gospel in the whole world, tell what she did in memory of her.” 		   </span></p>
