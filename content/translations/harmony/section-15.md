<p class="topic-reference">(Mt 14:13-21; Mk 6:30-44; Lk 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">10The apostles came back from their mission and reported to Jesus what all they’d done </span><span class="gospel-mt">and taught. 13Jesus also heard at that time about John’s death. </span><span class="gospel-lk">He took his disciples with him; </span><span class="gospel-mk">31</span><span class="gospel-mt">“Come off by yourselves away from the crowds and rest awhile.” So many people were coming and going that they didn’t even have time to eat.  </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	32They went away in a boat </span><span class="gospel-jn">to the other side of Lake Galilee (Lake Tiberias) </span><span class="gospel-mt">to a place off by themselves </span><span class="gospel-lk">near a town called Bethsaida. </span><span class="gospel-mk">33</span><span class="gospel-mt">People saw them leaving and figured out where they were going, </span><span class="gospel-jn">and followed him because they saw the signs he was doing on the sick. </span><span class="gospel-mt">They ran as a crowd from the towns and got there first.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	When he got out, </span><span class="gospel-jn">3he went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples. 4The Jews’ Passover festival was coming up. 5Jesus looked up and saw a huge crowd arriving, </span><span class="gospel-mk">34</span><span class="gospel-mt">and felt sorry for them: they were like sheep without a shepherd. </span><span class="gospel-lk">11He welcomed them, talked to them about God’s kingdom, and healed as many as needed it.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">Jesus said to Philip, “Where are we going to buy enough bread for these people to eat?” (6He said that to test him because Jesus already knew what he was going to do.)</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	7Philip answered, “Bread worth two hundred denarii won’t be enough for each person to get a little bit.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">12As the day drew to a close, the twelve came to him, “Let the crowd go so they can go to villages around the countryside to find lodging and buy something to eat. Nobody lives around here.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mt">But he answered, 16“They don’t need to leave. You feed them.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">37</span><span class="gospel-mt">“Should we go spend two hundred denarii on bread to feed them?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	38</span><span class="gospel-mk">“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">8Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother—said, “There’s a boy here that has five barley loaves and two fish, but what’s that among so many?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mt">“Bring them here.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">9There was lots of grass in the place, so he told them, “Have </span><span class="gospel-mt">everybody </span><span class="gospel-jn">sit down </span><span class="gospel-mt">on the green </span><span class="gospel-jn">grass </span><span class="gospel-mt">in groups of </span><span class="gospel-lk">about fifty </span><span class="gospel-mt">and a hundred.” </span><span class="gospel-lk">They did so.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">41</span><span class="gospel-mt">He took the five loaves and two fish, and looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, </span><span class="gospel-lk">16and kept giving them to his disciples to distribute to </span><span class="gospel-jn">11</span><span class="gospel-lk">t</span><span class="gospel-jn">he ones that were sitting there—the fish too, as much as people wanted.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	12When they were full, he told the disciples, “Pick up the leftover pieces so nothing’s wasted.” 13So they picked up the leftovers and filled twelve baskets with the scraps from the barley loaves </span><span class="gospel-mt">and fish </span><span class="gospel-jn">that Jesus multiplied. </span><span class="gospel-mt">21About five thousand men had eaten the loaves—besides women and children.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">14People that saw the sign said, “This really is the prophet that’s supposed to come.” 	 </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">15aJesus knew they intended to take him by force to make him king. </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	14:22He urged his disciples to get in the </span><span class="gospel-jn">small </span><span class="gospel-mt">boat right away, and go on ahead to the other side—</span><span class="gospel-jn">to Capernaum</span><span class="gospel-mt">,</span> <span class="gospel-mt">while he dismissed the crowd. 23When he’d dismissed them, he went up on the hill by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">17It was dark now, and Jesus hadn’t come. 18They’d rowed three miles or so, </span><span class="gospel-mt">24and waves were bashing the boat. </span><span class="gospel-jn">18The lake was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing </span><span class="gospel-mk">against them. 48Jesus saw them straining at the oars. About </span><span class="gospel-mt">four in the morning</span><span class="gospel-mk">, he went to them walking on the lake as if he intended to go on by. </span><span class="gospel-mt">19</span><span class="gospel-jn">He was getting close to the boat. </span><span class="gospel-mt">26When they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">At once Jesus spoke to them, “It’s okay; it’s me. </span><span class="gospel-jn">20You don’t need to be afraid</span><span class="gospel-mt">.</span><span class="gospel-jn">”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">Peter responded, “Lord, if it’s you, tell me to come to you on the water.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">29“Come on.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">Peter got down out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the water. 30But when he saw the high wind, he got scared and started to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">31At once Jesus reached out and grabbed him, “One with little faith, why did you doubt?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	32When they climbed up in the boat, the wind died down. 33The ones in the boat were astounded and bowed down to him, “You really are God’s Son.” </span><span class="gospel-jn">21Presently the boat came to the land where they were headed.</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">22The next day the crowd that was standing on the other side of the lake saw that no other boat was there except one and Jesus had not got in the boat with his disciples; they’d left alone. 23Other small boats came from Tiberias to where the people ate the bread. 24When the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples weren’t around, they got in the small boats and went to Capernaum, looking for him. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	26Jesus answered, “You’re looking for me, not so much because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were full. 27Don’t work for bread that perishes; work for bread that lasts forever. That’s the bread the Son of Man will give you, because he’s the One the Father has marked with a seal.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	28They asked him, “What’ll we do to be working the works of God?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	29Jesus answered, “This is the ‘work’ of God: believe on the One he sent.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	30They said, “What sign do you do so we can see it and believe? What ‘work’ do you do? 31Our ancestors ate manna in the desert like the scripture says, ‘HE GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN TO EAT’” </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Ps 78:24].</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	32Jesus said, “Moses didn’t give you bread from heaven. My Father is giving you the real ‘bread from heaven.’ 33God’s ‘bread’ is the One that comes down from heaven to give life to the world.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	34They said, “Sir, give us that bread all the time!”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	35Jesus said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“I’m the life-giving bread. Whoever comes to me will never get hungry, and whoever believes in me will never get thirsty. 36But, you’ve seen me and not believed. 37Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I won’t send away; 38because I’ve come down from heaven, not to do my will, but the will of the One that sent me. 39This is his will: that I not lose anything he’s given me, 40that everybody who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and that I raise him up in the last day.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	41The Jews started grumbling, because he said, “I’m the bread that’s come down from heaven.” 42They were saying, “Isn’t this Jesus, Joseph’s son? We know his father and mother. How does he say now, ‘I’ve come down from heaven’?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	43Jesus answered, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Don’t grumble around with one another. 44Nobody can come to me unless the Father that sent me is drawing him. 45The prophets wrote, ‘GOD WILL TEACH THEM ALL’ </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Is 54:13].</span><span class="gospel-jn"> Everybody that listens to the Father and learns, comes to me—46not that anybody has seen him except the One that’s come from him; he’s seen him. 47Whoever believes has eternal life. 48I’m the life-giving ‘bread.’ 49Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died. 50Nobody that eats this ‘bread from heaven’ will die. 51I’m the life-giving ‘bread’ that comes from heaven. Everybody that eats this ‘bread’ will live forever. Yes, and the ‘bread’ I’ll give for the life of the world is my own flesh.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	52The Jews started quarreling with one another, “How can he give us his flesh to eat?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	53Jesus said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Unless you ‘eat’ the flesh of the Son of Man and ‘drink’ his blood, you don’t have any life in you. 54People that ‘eat’ my flesh and ‘drink’ my blood have eternal life, and I’ll raise them up at the last day. 55My flesh is true ‘food,’ and my blood is true ‘drink.’ 56People that ‘eat’ my flesh and ‘drink’ my blood remain in me and I in them. 57As the living Father has sent me and I live because of him, people that ‘eat’ me will live because of me. 58This is the ‘bread’ from heaven; it’s not like what the ancestors ate and died. Whoever ‘eats’ this bread will experience eternal life.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	59He said this as he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 60When they heard it, many disciples said, “That message is hard to understand. Who can make sense of it?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	61Jesus knew his disciples were grumbling about it. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">“Does that shock you? 62What if you see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63The spirit of what I’ve said is the point. The literal words are not the point. What I’ve spoken has meaning figuratively. 64But some of you don’t believe. [Jesus knew from the start who weren’t believers and who’d betray him.] 65That’s why I told you that nobody can come to me unless the Father lets him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	66At this point, many disciples quit traveling with him. 67Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go too, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	68Simon Peter answered, “Lord, who would we go to? You have the life-giving message. 69We believe and have come to know that you’re God’s Holy One.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	70Jesus answered them, “Didn’t I choose you twelve, and one of you is a devil?” (71He was referring to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, the one that would betray him—one of the twelve.) 							     		     	  </span></p>
