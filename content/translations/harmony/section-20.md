<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 10:1-24)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">10:1After this, the Lord appointed seventy other men and sent them ahead in pairs to every town and place where he intended to go. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">2He told them, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“It’s a big harvest with few workers, so ask the crew chief to put more workers in his harvest. 3I’m sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4Don’t carry a money bag, knapsack, or shoes. Don’t visit with anybody along the way. 5Whatever house you go in, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6If a peace-loving person lives there, your peace will rest on him. If not, it’ll return to you. 7Stay in the same house and eat what they provide. A worker is worth his wages. Don’t move around from house to house. 8Whatever town you go in and they welcome you, eat what they put in front of you. 9Heal the sick in it, and say, ‘God’s kingdom has come close to you.’ 10Whatever town you go in and they don’t welcome you, go out in the streets and say, 11‘Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. But know this: God’s kingdom has come close to you.’ 12It’ll be more bearable for Sodom at the judgment than for that town. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">13“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 14It’ll be more bearable at the judgment for those cities than for you. 15And you, Capernaum, you won’t be exalted to heaven, will you? You’ll be brought down to hell. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">16“Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; whoever rejects me rejects the One that sent me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	17The seventy came back excited, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	18He said, “I’ve been watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning. 19I’ve given you authority to step on snakes and scorpions, and over the power of the enemy. Nothing will hurt you. 20But, don’t get excited because the spirits submit to you; be excited that your names are recorded in heaven.”	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	21Right then he was really happy, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from wise, intelligent people and revealing them to infants. 22Yes, Father, you delighted in doing that.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	“My Father has turned everything over to me. Nobody knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and whoever the Son wants to reveal him to.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	23He turned to his disciples aside and said, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you’re seeing. 24Many prophets and kings have wanted to see what you’re seeing and haven’t seen it, and hear what you’re hearing and haven’t heard it.”  				    </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">25A lawyer stood up, testing him, “Rabbi, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	26Jesus said, “What’s the law say? How do you read it?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	27He answered, “‘LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, SOUL, STRENGTH </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Deut 6:5; 10:12; Josh 22:5]</span><span class="gospel-lk">, and mind’; and ‘LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF’” </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Lev 19:18].</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	28Jesus said, “You’re right. Do that and you’ll live.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	  29But he wanted to justify his question, so he said, “Who’s my ‘neighbor’?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	30Jesus answered, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him and beat him up and left him half dead. 31By chance a priest was going down that road and saw him and went around him. 32When a Levite came to the place and saw him, he did the same thing. 33But a Samaritan on a business trip came to the place and saw him and felt sorry for him. 34He went over and poured oil and wine in his wounds, bandaged them up, put him on his own animal, and took him to an inn and took care of him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">35“The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him. Whatever more you spend I’ll pay you when I get back.’ 36Which of the three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man the robbers attacked?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	37The lawyer said, “The one that showed him mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	Jesus said, “Go do the same thing.”				   	</span>   </p>

<h3 class="topic-header">Was in League with the Devil</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 11:14-36)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">14He was casting a demon out of mute man. When he’d cast it out, the man could speak; and the crowd was amazed. 15Some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.” 16Others, testing him, were looking for a sign from him out of the sky.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">17He was aware of their thoughts, and said to them, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“Every kingdom divided against itself falls. 18If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand—because you’re saying I cast out demons by Beelzebub? 19If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, who do your students cast them out by? So they’ll be your judges. 20But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then God’s kingdom has come to you. 21When a strong man, fully armed, guards his courtyard, his possessions are undisturbed. 22When somebody stronger than him attacks and overpowers him, he seizes the armor the man depended on and scatters his plunder. 23Whoever’s not with me is against me, and whoever doesn’t gather with me scatters out.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">24“When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it roams around in dry places, looking for rest. When it doesn’t find any, it says, ‘I’ll go back to the house I left.’ 25When he goes, he finds it swept out and decorated. 26Then he takes seven spirits more evil than he is and goes in and settles down there. The person’s last condition is worse than the first.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">27While he was saying this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts you nursed.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">28But he said, “More important, blessed are people that hear God’s message and keep it.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">29As the crowds were growing, he said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“This is a wicked time. People are looking for a sign, but it won’t get any but the sign of Jonah. 30As Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, that’s the way the Son of Man will be to people today. 31The queen of the south will stand up in the judgment with people today and condemn them. She came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and something greater than Solomon is here. 32The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with people today and condemn it. They repented when Jonah preached to them, and something greater than Jonah is here.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">33“Nobody lights a lamp and puts it in the cellar [or under a bucket]ms, but on a stand so people coming in can see it. 34Your eye is the lamp for the body. When your eye is clear, your whole body is full of light; but when it’s bad, your body’s full of darkness too. 35Watch out so the light in you won’t be darkness. 36If then your whole body is full of light, it’s like a bright lamp that gives you light.”</span>	</p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">37When he’d spoken, a Pharisee asked him to eat a meal with him, and he went in and directly reclined at table. 38When the Pharisee saw it, he was amazed that Jesus didn’t dip his hands first before the meal. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">39The Lord said to him, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you’re full of robbery and wickedness. 40You foolish people, didn’t the One that made the outside make the inside too? 41Give the internal things over to charity, and everything will be clean to you.  </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">42“But woe to you Pharisees! You tithe mint and rue and every vegetable, and pass over justice and love for God. You should have done these without neglecting those. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">43“Woe to you Pharisees! You love the main seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">47“Woe to you! You build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 48So you’re witnesses and approve of your fathers’ deeds: they killed them; you build their tombs. 49So the wisdom of God also said, ‘I’ll send them prophets and apostles. They’ll persecute some and kill some. 50So the blood of all the prophets shed since the founding of the world will be required of this generation—51from the blood of Abel to Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, it’ll be required of this generation.’</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">52“Woe to you lawyers! You take away the key for understanding. You haven’t gone in yourselves, and you stand in the way of the ones that are trying to go in.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“A rich man’s land produced a bumper crop. 17He deliberated, ‘What am I going to do?

Rest, eat, drink, celebrate.’ 20God said, ‘You fool!

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk"> 22He said to his disciples, “So don’t worry about your life, what you’ll eat, or your body, what you’ll wear. 23Life is more than food; the body is more than clothes. 24Think about black birds; they don’t sow or reap; they don’t have a storeroom or barn. God feeds them. You’re worth a lot more than birds. 25Which of you by worrying can add eighteen inches to his height? 26If you can’t do such a small thing, why worry about the rest? 27Think how lilies grow; they don’t work hard or spin, but even Solomon in all his splendor didn’t dress like one of them. 28If God dresses the vegetation in the field this way—which is here today and thrown in the oven tomorrow—how much more will he dress you, people with little faith. 29Don’t concentrate on what you’ll eat, and don’t worry. 30They’re what Gentiles strain after. Your Father knows you need them. 31Seek his kingdom, and they’ll come along with it. 32You don’t need to be afraid, little flock; your Father delights in giving give you the kingdom. 33Sell what you own and give it to charity.

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">35“Be dressed and ready with your lamps lit. 36Be like men waiting for their lord to return from a wedding so they can open the door when he knocks. 37Blessed are the servants he finds watching.
