<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	“About Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people. 20The chief priests and our rulers delivered him over to the death sentence and had him crucified. 21We were hoping he was the One that would redeem Israel. On top of everything, it’s been three days since that happened, 22but some women from our number astounded us. They’d arrived at the tomb early this morning. 23When they didn’t find his body, they came and said they’d seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. 24Some with us went to the tomb and found it the way the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	25He said to them, “Foolish people and slow to believe everything the prophets have said, 26wasn’t it necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and enter his glory?” 27He started with Moses and the prophets, and explained to them all the scriptures what referred to him.	</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	28They got close to where they were going, and he acted like he was going on. 29But they urged him, “Stay with us; it’s toward evening, and the day’s almost over.” So, he went in with them. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	 30While he was reclining at table with them, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them. 31They recognized him, and he disappeared. 32They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn [in us]ms while he was talking to us on the road and explaining the scriptures to us?” 			     </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	21:1After this, Jesus appeared again to his disciples at Lake Tiberias. 2Simon Peter, Thomas, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	3Simon Peter said, “I’m going fishing.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“We’ll go with you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">They went out and got in the boat, and that night they didn‘t catch anything. 4When morning was coming, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn’t know it was him.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	5“Children, you haven’t had anything to eat, have you?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“No.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	6“Cast the net on the right side of the boat; you’ll find some.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">So they did, and they couldn’t haul it in for the number of fish.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	7The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (he’d stripped down) and dived in the water. 8The rest of the disciples came in the small boat, because they weren’t far from land—only about three hundred feet away, dragging the net full of fish. 9When they got out of the boat, they saw a charcoal fire with a fish and a loaf laid on it.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	10Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">11Simon Peter got up and pulled the net up on land full of large fish—153. Although there were so many, the net didn’t tear.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	12Jesus said, “Come and eat breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	None of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. 13Jesus gave them the bread and the fish. 14This was a third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he resurrected. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	15When they’d finished breakfast, Jesus said, “Simon Barjonah, do you love me more than these do?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Tend my lambs.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	16He said the second time, “Simon Barjonah, do you love me?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Yes, Lord, you know I love you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	“Tend my sheep.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	17He said the third time, “Simon Barjonah, do you love me?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	It pained Peter that Jesus said a third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know everything; you know I love you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	18Jesus told him, “Tend my sheep. When you were younger, you’d dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted to. When you get old, you’ll stretch out your hands, and somebody else will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.” (19He said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) When he’d said this, he said to him. “Follow me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	20When Peter turned around, he saw the disciple Jesus loved, following, who had leaned back on Jesus’ chest at the supper and said, “Lord, who’s going to betray you?” 21Peter said, “Lord, what about him?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	22Jesus said, “If I want him to live till I come back, what’s that to you? You follow me.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	23So the idea got going among the brothers that he wouldn’t die. But Jesus didn’t say he wouldn’t die; he said, “If I want him to live till I come back, what’s that to you?” 									     </span></p>
