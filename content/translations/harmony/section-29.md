<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	Pilate’s soldiers took off the purple robe and dressed him in his own clothes, and took him away to crucify him, </span><span class="gospel-jn">carrying his own cross.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">21</span><span class="gospel-mt">They conscripted Simon, a Cyrenian coming in from the country—father of Alexander and Rufus—to carry </span><span class="gospel-lk">the cross in front of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	27There followed him a large crowd of people, including women who were mourning and weeping for him. 28Jesus turned and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me. Cry for yourselves and your children. 29The time’s coming when they’ll say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’ 30They’ll say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ 31If they do this when the wood’s green, what’ll happen when it’s dry?”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">22</span><span class="gospel-mt">The soldiers brought him </span><span class="gospel-lk">to the place called </span><span class="gospel-mt">Golgotha </span><span class="gospel-jn">in Hebrew </span><span class="gospel-mt">[“The Skull”], and offered him a myrrh-wine mixed; but when he tasted it, he wouldn’t drink it.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-mk">27</span><span class="gospel-mt">They crucified him and the two rebels, on his right and left. </span><span class="gospel-lk">[[Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; they don’t know what they’re doing.]]ms</span> <span class="gospel-mk">25</span><span class="gospel-mt">It was nine o’clock. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">19Pilate wrote an inscription </span><span class="gospel-mt">of his accusation, </span><span class="gospel-jn">and put it on the cross </span><span class="gospel-mt">above his head: </span><span class="gospel-jn">“Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.” 20Many Jews read it, because the place where they crucified him was close to the city. Pilate wrote it in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	21The chief priests said to Pilate, “Don’t write ‘king of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am king of the Jews.”</span>	</p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-jn">23When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes into four sets, one for each soldier—except for the tunic. It was seamless, woven from the top throughout. 24They said, “Let’s not tear it apart; cast lots for it”—in fulfillment of the scripture that said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	 	“THEY DIVIDED MY GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">CAST LOTS FOR MY CLOTHES” </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Ps 22:18[.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">So that’s what the soldiers did</span><span class="gospel-mt">, and sat down to keep watch.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	25Beside Jesus’ cross stood his mother, the sister of his mother; Mary, wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene. 26When he saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Your son.” 27Then he said to the disciple, “Your mother.” From that time the disciple took her to his home. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">The people stood watching</span><span class="gospel-mt">. </span><span class="gospel-mk">29</span><span class="gospel-mt">The people passing by threw insults at him and shook their heads, “Ha! You that tear down the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, 30save yourself. 40If you’re God’s Son, come down from the cross!”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	41The chief priests as well as the scribes and elders were making fun of him too: 42“He saved other people; he can’t save himself! He’s king of the Jews! Let him come down from the cross, and we’ll believe in him. 43He has trusted in God; let him rescue him if he wants him”—because he said, “I’m God’s Son.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	44The rebels that were crucified with him were putting him down with the same insults. </span><span class="gospel-lk">36The soldiers mocked him too. They offered him sour wine, 37“If you’re the King of the Jews, save yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">39One of those hanged with him lashed out, “You’re the Messiah, aren’t you? Save yourself and us.” 40The other rebuked him, “Don’t you even fear God? You’re under the same condemnation! 41We’re getting what we deserve. He hasn’t done anything wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	42“Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	43“You’ll be with me in Paradise today.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	44At about noon, darkness came over the whole land and lasted till mid-afternoon. </span><span class="gospel-mt">46About 3 p.m. Jesus shouted out, “ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI [My God, my God, why have you deserted me?]?” [Ps 28:1] 47Some of the ones standing there heard him, “He’s calling for Elijah.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">28Since he knew they’d done everything that would fulfill the scripture, Jesus said, “I’m thirsty.” 29A jar was sitting there full of sour wine. </span><span class="gospel-mt">48One of them ran and filled a sponge with it, put in on a </span><span class="gospel-jn">hyssop branch, and held it up to his mouth to give </span><span class="gospel-mt">him a drink. 49The rest were saying, “Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.” </span><span class="gospel-jn">30When he’d taken it, he </span><span class="gospel-mt">let out another loud cry, </span><span class="gospel-jn">“It’s done! </span><span class="gospel-lk">Father, I’m entrusting my spirit to you.” </span><span class="gospel-jn">He dropped his head and quit breathing. </span>					     </p>

(52Tombs came open, and the bodies of many saints arose. 53They left their graves after his resurrection, and went in the Holy City and appeared to many people.) 54Now the centurion standing across from him and the ones on watch with him were scared to death when they saw the earthquake and the other things that were happening. </span><span class="gospel-lk">47When the centurion saw </span><span class="gospel-mt">the way Jesus quit breathing, </span><span class="gospel-lk">he glorified God, “Surely this was a good man</span><span class="gospel-mt">. </span><span class="gospel-mk">39</span><span class="gospel-mt">This man really was God’s Son.”</span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	31Because it was Preparation, the Jews asked Pilate to break their bones and take them away so the bodies wouldn’t be on the cross on the Sabbath. (That Sabbath was a high day.) 32So the soldiers broke the bones of the other men crucified with him. 33They saw that Jesus was already dead and didn’t break his bones. 34One soldier thrust his spear into his side; blood and water drained out immediately. (35One that “looked at” it himself has submitted this report. He knows what he’s telling you is true so you can believe too.) 36This reminds us of the scripture, “DON’T BREAK A BONE OF IT” </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Ex 12:46; Num 9:12; Ps 24:20].</span><span class="gospel-jn"> 37Another scripture says, “THEY’LL LOOK AT THE ONE THEY PIERCED” </span><span class="gospel-mt">[Zech 12:10]. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	50A </span><span class="gospel-mt">respected </span><span class="gospel-lk">Sanhedrin member named Joseph, a good, upright man, 51hadn’t agreed with their plot and action. He was a </span><span class="gospel-mt">rich man</span><span class="gospel-lk"> from Arimathea, a town of the Jews, and one who was waiting for God’s kingdom. </span><span class="gospel-mt">He was a disciple of </span><span class="gospel-jn">Jesus—but secretly for fear of the Jews. </span><span class="gospel-mk">43</span><span class="gospel-mt">He gathered up the courage to go to Pilate and ask </span><span class="gospel-jn">permission to take </span><span class="gospel-mt">Jesus’ body. 44Pilate was surprised that he’d already died. He called the centurion and asked him if Jesus was dead already. 45When he understood from him that Jesus was dead, he let Joseph have the body.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	46Joseph bought a clean linen cloth, </span><span class="gospel-jn">went and </span><span class="gospel-mt">took Jesus down, </span><span class="gospel-jn">and took his body away. 39Nicodemus—who at the first came to Jesus at night—also brought some seventy pounds of myrrh mixed with aloes. 40They wrapped his body in the linen wrappings along with the aromatic spices, which is the Jews’ burial custom.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-jn">	41A garden close to where they crucified Jesus had a new, used tomb in it. That’s where they put Jesus, because it was the Jews’ Preparation, </span><span class="gospel-lk">and the Sabbath was coming on. </span><span class="gospel-mt">60It was Joseph’s own rock-hewn tomb, </span><span class="gospel-lk">where no one had yet been laid. </span><span class="gospel-mt">They rolled a large stone over the entrance and left.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">55Mary the Magdalene and Mary, mother of Joses, followed along </span><span class="gospel-mt">and sat across from the grave and </span><span class="gospel-lk">saw how they laid the body. 56They went back to prepare spices and ointment oils. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span></p>
