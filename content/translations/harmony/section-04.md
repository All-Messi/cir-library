<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">2:1At that time Caesar Augustus sent out a decree to take a census of the Roman Empire. 2That was the first census, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3Everybody went to his ancestral city to register. 4Joseph went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judaea, to Bethlehem, the city of David, because he descended from David. 5He went up to register with Mary, who was engaged to him and pregnant. 6While they were there, it came time for her to have her baby, 7and she had her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in baby cloths and laid him in a manger because there wasn’t any room for them in the inn. 	      </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">8Not far away, shepherds were watching sheep outdoors at night. 9An angel of the Lord stood beside them, and the glory of the Lord shined around them. It really scared them. 10The angel said, “You don’t need to be afraid; I have some good news for you that will make people really happy. 11A Savior was born today in the city of David: Messiah the Lord. 12You’ll find a baby wrapped in baby cloths, lying in a manger.” 13Suddenly a great choir of angels in the sky joined the angel, praising God:</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		14“Glory to God in the highest,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">		  and on earth peace to men that please him.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	15When the angels had gone back to heaven, the shepherds said, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord’s told us about.” 16They hurried away and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby that was lying in a manger. 17When they’d seen him, they told everybody what the angel said about him. 18They were amazed at what the shepherds were saying. 19Mary treasured these things up in her heart. 20The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for everything they’d seen and heard, just like the angel said.		     			          	     	     	     	     </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">2:1When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of Herod the king, Magi from the East arrived in Jerusalem, 2“Where’s the one born king of the Jews? In the East we saw his star and came to pay homage to him.” 3When Herod heard this, he was disturbed and Jerusalem as well. 4He gathered the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Messiah would be born. </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	9When they heard the king, they started traveling, and the star they saw when they were in the East went ahead of them till it stood over above the child was. 10When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 11They went in the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down and paid homage to him. They opened their treasures and brought him gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 12God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod; so they left for their country another way.  									     </span></p>

The ones that were trying to kill the child have died.” 21He got up and took them to Israel. When he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. 22When God warned him in a dream, he left for Galilee. 23He settled down in a town called Nazareth, a name that reminds us of what the prophets said he’d be: a Nazarene [nezer, shoot].	    </span></p>
