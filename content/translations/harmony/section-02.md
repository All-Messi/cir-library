<h3 class="topic-header">The Birth of John Announced</h3>
<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 1:5-25)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	5</span><span class="gospel-lk">At the time of Herod, king of Judaea, there was a priest named Zachariah from the Abijah division. His wife Elizabeth descended from Aaron. 6They were both righteous before God and conducted themselves blamelessly by his commandments. 7Elizabeth couldn’t have children, and both were getting old.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	8Zachariah was carrying out his priestly duties before God in the sequence of his division. 9He’d been chosen by lot—according to the custom of the priestly office—to go in the sanctuary of the Lord to offer incense. 10A crowd outside was praying. 11An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 12When Zachariah saw him, fear gripped him. 13The angel said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“You don’t need to be afraid, Zachariah; God has heard your prayer. Your wife will have a son, and you’re to name him ‘John.’ 14You’ll be so happy, and many will celebrate his birth. 15He’ll be great before the Lord: </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He won’t drink wine or strong beer. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He’ll be full of the Holy Spirit from birth. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">16He’ll return many Israelites to the Lord their God.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">17He’ll go ahead of the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He’ll return the hearts of fathers to their children, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">and the disobedient to the attitude good people have. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">He’ll prepare a people for the Lord.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">18Zachariah said, “How am I going to know this? I’m an old man; my wife is up in years.” </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">19“I’m Gabriel; I stand beside the Lord. He sent me to bring you this good news. 20You won’t be able to speak till it happens, because you didn’t believe what I told you; but it will come about in due time.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">21The people that were waiting for Zachariah couldn’t believe how long he’d been in the sanctuary. 22When he did come out, he couldn’t talk to them. They suspected he’d seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept making gestures to them but couldn’t speak.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">23When his term of service was up, he went back home. 24Later Elizabeth became pregnant. She hid herself five months, 25“This is how the Lord treated me when he looked at me and took away my disgrace among people.” 			      	      </span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Lk 1:26-38)</p>
<p class="harmony-text">	<span class="gospel-lk">26In Elizabeth’s sixth month, God sent Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee. 27He went to a virgin named Mary, who was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of David. 28He went inside, and said, “Hello, favored one; the Lord’s with you.” 29What he said startled her; she wondered what it meant.</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	30The angel said, </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">“You don’t need to be afraid, Mary. God’s pleased with you. 31You’ll be pregnant and have a son; you’re to name him ‘Jesus.’ </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">32He’ll be great; </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">   he’ll be called the Son of the Most High. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David. </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">33He’ll rule over the descendants of Jacob forever; </span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">his kingdom will never end.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	34Mary said, “How can that be? I don’t have a husband.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	35“The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One that’s begotten will be called God’s Son. 36Your relative Elizabeth is pregnant too with a son in her old age. This is the sixth month with her that’s been childless. 37God can do anything.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">	38Mary said, “I’m the Lord’s servant; it can be like you’ve said.” </span></p>

<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">39Then Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judaea. 40She went in Zachariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. 41When Elizabeth heard her greeting, the baby kicked and Elizabeth was filled the Holy Spirit: 42she shouted, “You are blessed among women, and your baby is blessed. 43How is it that my Lord’s mother has come to me? 44When I heard you say, ‘Hello,’ the baby kicked for joy in my womb. 45You’re blessed for believing the Lord will keep his promise to you.”</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-lk">46Mary said,</span></p>

<p class="topic-reference">(Mt 1:18-25)</p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">	18This is the way the birth of Jesus Messiah took place. Mary his mother was engaged to Joseph. Before they got married, it was discovered that she was pregnant—by the Holy Spirit. 19Joseph her husband was a good man and didn’t want to disgrace her publicly; he intended to break off the engagement privately. 20As he was thinking about it, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to marry her. She’s pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 21She’ll have a son. Name him ‘Jesus,’ because he’ll ‘save’ his people from their sins.” 22This fulfilled what the Lord had said by Isaiah the prophet,</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">		23“A VIRGIN WILL HAVE A SON;</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">			THEY’LL CALL HIM ‘EMMANUEL’ [‘God with us’]” [Is 7:14].</span></p>
<p class="harmony-text"><span class="gospel-mt">24Joseph got up and did what the angel said, and had no relations with her till she had a son, and he named him “Jesus.”			    			    	    </span></p>
