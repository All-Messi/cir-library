## 2 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Elder to-the-elect lady and the children of-her, whompl I love in truth, and not only I, but all the-ones having-known the truth, 2on-account-of the truth [the] residing in us and will-be with us forever3.  3Grace, mercy, peace will-be with us from God (the) Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of-the Father in truth and love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I-was┘very└joyous, because I-have-found (some) of the children of-you walking in truth, even-as we-received commandment from the Father.  5And now I-ask you, lady, not as writing (a) new commandment, but what we-were-having from (the) beginning:  that we-love one-another.  6And this is [the] love:  [in-order]-that we-walk according-to the commandments of-him.  This is the commandment, even-as you-heard from (the) beginning:  [in-order]-that you-walk in it.  7Because many deceivers went-out into the world, the-ones not confessing Jesus Christ coming in (the) flesh.  This is the deceiver and the antichrist.  8Watch yourselves, in-order-that you not lose what-things you-gained, but receive (a) full reward.  9Everybody [the] going-forward and not remaining in the teaching of-[the] Christ does┘not└have God.  The-one remaining in the teaching—this-one has both the Father and the Son.  10If anybody comes to you and does┘not└bring this [the] teaching, do┘not└receive him into (the) house, and do┘not└say greetings to-him.  11For the-one saying greetings to-him shares in-the evil [the] deeds of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Having many-things to-write to-you, I-did┘not└want (to do so) through reed-pen and ink, but I-hope to-become to you and to-speak mouth to mouth, in-order-that the joy of-us may-be full.  13The children of-the elect [the] sister of-you greet you.</span>
