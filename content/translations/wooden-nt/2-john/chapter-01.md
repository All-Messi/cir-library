## 2 John Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The Elder to-the-elect lady and the children of-her, whom<sup>pl</sup> I love in truth, and not only I, but all the-ones having-known the truth, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>on-account-of the truth [the] residing in us and will-be with us forever<sup>3</sup>.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace, mercy, peace will-be with us from God (the) Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of-the Father in truth and love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>I-was┘very└joyous, because I-have-found (some) of the children of-you walking in truth, even-as we-received commandment from the Father.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And now I-ask you, lady, not as writing (a) new commandment, but what we-were-having from (the) beginning:  that we-love one-another.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And this is [the] love:  [in-order]-that we-walk according-to the commandments of-him.  This is the commandment, even-as you-heard from (the) beginning:  [in-order]-that you-walk in it.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Because many deceivers went-out into the world, the-ones not confessing Jesus Christ coming in (the) flesh.  This is the deceiver and the antichrist.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Watch yourselves, in-order-that you not lose what-things you-gained, but receive (a) full reward.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Everybody [the] going-forward and not remaining in the teaching of-[the] Christ does┘not└have God.  The-one remaining in the teaching—this-one has both the Father and the Son.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If anybody comes to you and does┘not└bring this [the] teaching, do┘not└receive him into (the) house, and do┘not└say greetings to-him.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For the-one saying greetings to-him shares in-the evil [the] deeds of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Having many-things to-write to-you, I-did┘not└want (to do so) through reed-pen and ink, but I-hope to-become to you and to-speak mouth to mouth, in-order-that the joy of-us may-be full.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The children of-the elect [the] sister of-you greet you.</span>
