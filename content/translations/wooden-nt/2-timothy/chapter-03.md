## 2 Timothy Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now know this:  that in (the) last days hard times will-be-present.  2For [the] men will-be self-lovers, lovers-of-silver, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to-parents, ungrateful, not-lovers-of-good, 3lacking-natural-affection, heartless, malicious-gossiping-ones, without-self-control, vicious, not-loving-good, 4treacherous, reckless, having-been-puffed-up-with-pride, lovers-of-pleasure rather than lovers-of-God, 5having the/a form of-godliness but having-denyed the power of-it, and avoid these-(men).  6For out-of these are the-ones sneaking-into [the] houses and seducing morally-weak-women having-been-weighed-down with sins, led-on by-various desires, 7always learningfem, and never able to-come to (a) knowledge of-(the)-truth.  8And in-the-same-way2 Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, men having-been-corrupted with-regard-to-the mind, rejected concerning the faith.  9But they-will┘not└progress on further, for the foolishness of-them will-be clear to-all, as also the (foolishness) of-those-(men) became (clear).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But you followed the teaching of-me, the manner-of-life, the way-of-thinking, [the] faith, [the] longsuffering, [the] love, [the] perseverance, 11[the] persecutions, [the] sufferings, such-as happened to-me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what-kind-of persecutions I-have-borne-up-under/endured and out-of all the Lord delivered me.  12And also all the–ones desiring to-live godly in Christ Jesus will-be-persecuted.  13But evil men and imposters will-proceed to the worse, deceiving and being-deceived.  14But you remain in what you-learned and became-convinced-of, knowing from whompl you-learned-them, 15and that from (a) baby you-knew the holy scriptures, the-ones able to-make┘you└wise to salvation through faith [the] in Christ Jesus.  16All scripture (is) breathed-out-by-God and (is) profitable for teaching, for refutation-of-error, for correction, for training [the] in righteousness, 17in-order-that the man of-[the] God may-be fully-qualified, having-been-equipped for every good deed.</span>
