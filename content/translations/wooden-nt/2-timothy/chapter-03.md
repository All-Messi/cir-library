## 2 Timothy Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now know this:  that in (the) last days hard times will-be-present.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For [the] men will-be self-lovers, lovers-of-silver, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to-parents, ungrateful, not-lovers-of-good, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>lacking-natural-affection, heartless, malicious-gossiping-ones, without-self-control, vicious, not-loving-good, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>treacherous, reckless, having-been-puffed-up-with-pride, lovers-of-pleasure rather than lovers-of-God, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>having the/a form of-godliness but having-denyed the power of-it, and avoid these-(men).  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For out-of these are the-ones sneaking-into [the] houses and seducing morally-weak-women having-been-weighed-down with sins, led-on by-various desires, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>always learning<sup>fem</sup>, and never able to-come to (a) knowledge of-(the)-truth.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And in-the-same-way<sup>2</sup> Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, men having-been-corrupted with-regard-to-the mind, rejected concerning the faith.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But they-will┘not└progress on further, for the foolishness of-them will-be clear to-all, as also the (foolishness) of-those-(men) became (clear).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But <u>you</u> followed the teaching of-me, the manner-of-life, the way-of-thinking, [the] faith, [the] longsuffering, [the] love, [the] perseverance, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>[the] persecutions, [the] sufferings, such-as happened to-me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what-kind-of persecutions I-have-borne-up-under/endured and out-of all the Lord delivered me.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And also all the–ones desiring to-live godly in Christ Jesus will-be-persecuted.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But evil men and imposters will-proceed to the worse, deceiving and being-deceived.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> remain in what you-learned and became-convinced-of, knowing from whom<sup>pl</sup> you-learned-them, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and that from (a) baby you-knew the holy scriptures, the-ones able to-make┘you└wise to salvation through faith [the] in Christ Jesus.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>All scripture (is) breathed-out-by-God and (is) profitable for teaching, for refutation-of-error, for correction, for training [the] in righteousness, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>in-order-that the man of-[the] God may-be fully-qualified, having-been-equipped for every good deed.</span>
