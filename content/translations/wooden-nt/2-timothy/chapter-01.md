## 2 Timothy Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God according-to (the) promise of-life [the] in Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to-Timothy, beloved son.  Grace, mercy, peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Lord of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I-have grace to-[the] God, whom I-serve from (my) forefathers with (a) clear conscience, as <u>I</u>┘constantly└have the remembrance concerning you in the prayers of-me night and day, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>longing to-see you, remembering the tears of-you in-order-that I-might-be-filled with-joy, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>taking remembrance of-the sincere faith in you, which first resided in the grandmother of-you, Lois, and the mother of-you, Eunice, and I-have-been-persuaded that also (is) in you.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>On-account-of which reason I-remind you to-stir-up-into-a-flame/to-stir-up the spiritual-gift of-[the] God that is in you through the laying-on of-the hands of-me.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For [the] God did<u>┘not└</u>give us (a) spirit of cowardice/timidity, but of-power and love and self-control.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So do<u>┘not└</u>be-ashamed-of the mystery of-the Lord of-us nor me, the prisoner of-him, but suffer-with (me), for-the gospel according-to (the) power of-God, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>the-One having-saved us and having-called (us) with-(a)-holy calling, not according-to the works of-us, but according-to his-own purpose and grace, the-one having-been-given to-us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and/but now having-been-revealed by the appearing of-the Savior of-us Christ Jesus, (the-One) having-destroyed death [on-the-one-hand] and having-brought-to-light life and immortality through the gospel, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>to which I was-appointed (a) preacher and apostle and teacher, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>on-account-of which reason also I-suffer these-things.  But I-am┘not└ashamed, for I-know whom I-have-believed and have-been-persuaded that he-is able to-keep the entrusted-matter of-me to that [the] day.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Have (the) pattern of-sound words that you-heard from me in (the) faith and love [the] in Christ Jesus.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>By the Holy Spirit [the] residing in us, keep the good matter-entrusted to-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Know this:  that all the-ones in [the] Asia turned-away-from me, of-whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>May┘the Lord└give mercy to-the household of-Onesiphorus, because frequently he-cheered<u>┘me└</u>up, and was<u>┘not└</u>ashamed-of the imprisonment/chain of-me; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>but, becoming in Rome, he<u>┘diligently└</u>sought and found me.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>May<u>┘the</u><u> </u><u>Lord└</u>give to him to-find mercy from (the) Lord in that [the] day, and <u>you</u> know very-well as-many-things-as he-ministered in Ephesus.</span>
