## 2 Timothy Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God according-to (the) promise of-life [the] in Christ Jesus, 2to-Timothy, beloved son.  Grace, mercy, peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Lord of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I-have grace to-[the] God, whom I-serve from (my) forefathers with (a) clear conscience, as I┘constantly└have the remembrance concerning you in the prayers of-me night and day, 4longing to-see you, remembering the tears of-you in-order-that I-might-be-filled with-joy, 5taking remembrance of-the sincere faith in you, which first resided in the grandmother of-you, Lois, and the mother of-you, Eunice, and I-have-been-persuaded that also (is) in you.  6On-account-of which reason I-remind you to-stir-up-into-a-flame/to-stir-up the spiritual-gift of-[the] God that is in you through the laying-on of-the hands of-me.  7For [the] God did┘not└give us (a) spirit of cowardice/timidity, but of-power and love and self-control.  8So do┘not└be-ashamed-of the mystery of-the Lord of-us nor me, the prisoner of-him, but suffer-with (me), for-the gospel according-to (the) power of-God, 9the-One having-saved us and having-called (us) with-(a)-holy calling, not according-to the works of-us, but according-to his-own purpose and grace, the-one having-been-given to-us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 10and/but now having-been-revealed by the appearing of-the Savior of-us Christ Jesus, (the-One) having-destroyed death [on-the-one-hand] and having-brought-to-light life and immortality through the gospel, 11to which I was-appointed (a) preacher and apostle and teacher, 12on-account-of which reason also I-suffer these-things.  But I-am┘not└ashamed, for I-know whom I-have-believed and have-been-persuaded that he-is able to-keep the entrusted-matter of-me to that [the] day.  13Have (the) pattern of-sound words that you-heard from me in (the) faith and love [the] in Christ Jesus.  14By the Holy Spirit [the] residing in us, keep the good matter-entrusted to-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Know this:  that all the-ones in [the] Asia turned-away-from me, of-whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.  16May┘the Lord└give mercy to-the household of-Onesiphorus, because frequently he-cheered┘me└up, and was┘not└ashamed-of the imprisonment/chain of-me; 17but, becoming in Rome, he┘diligently└sought and found me.  18May┘the Lord└give to him to-find mercy from (the) Lord in that [the] day, and you know very-well as-many-things-as he-ministered in Ephesus.</span>
