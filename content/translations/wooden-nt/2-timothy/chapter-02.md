## 2 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><u>You</u> then, my son, be-strong in the grace [the] in Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and what-things you-heard from me through many witnesses—these-things entrust to-faithful men who will-be able to-teach others.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Suffer-hardship-with (me) as (a) good soldier of-Christ Jesus.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Nobody, serving-as-a-soldier, gets-mixed-up-in the affairs of-[the] everyday-life, in-order-that he-may-please the-one having-recruited-(him)-as-a-soldier.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And also if anybody competes-as-an-athlete, he-does<u>┘not└</u>win-the-crown unless<sup>2</sup> he competes according-to-the-rules/legally.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>It-is-necessary-for the laboring farmer to-share-in the crops first.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Think-over what I-am-saying, for the Lord will-give you understanding in all-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Remember Jesus Christ having-been-raised from (the) dead, out-of (the) seed of-David, according-to the gospel of-me, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>in which I-suffer-hardship even-as-far-as bonds/imprisonment as (an) evildoer, but the word of-[the] God has┘not└been-bound.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>On-account-of this I-endure all-things on-account-of (the) elect, in-order-that they<u>┘themselves└</u>may-obtain salvation [the] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Faithful/reliable (is) the saying, <em>“For if we-suffered-with (him), </em><em>we-will┘also└live-with</em><em> (him).</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <strong><em><sup>12</sup></em></strong><em>If</em><em> we-endure, </em><em>we-will┘also└reign-with</em><em> (him).</em> <em>	</em><em>	If we-deny (him), that-one-also will-deny us.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> <strong><em><sup>13</sup></em></strong><em>If we-are-unfaithful, that-one remains faithful,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	For </em><em>he-is┘not└able</em><em> to-deny himself.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Remind-(them)-of these-things, solemnly-charging (them) before [the] God not to-quarrel-about-words, (which is) useful for nothing, unto (the) ruin of-the hearers.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Be-diligent to-present yourself approved to-[the God, (a) workman unashamed, correctly-interpreting the word of-[the] truth.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But avoid worldly empty-talk[s], for they-will-grow to more of-godlessness, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and the word of-them will-have (a) spreading like gangrene, of-whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>who missed-the-mark/lost-their-way concerning the truth, saying [the]<sup>ms</sup> resurrection has-happened already, and are-overturning the faith of-some.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Nevertheless the firm foundation of-[the] God stands, having [the] this seal:  <strong>“(The) Lord knows the-ones being of-him,”</strong><strong> </strong>and <em>“</em><em>Let</em><em>┘</em><em>every</em><em> [the</em><em>] naming the name of-</em><em>(</em><em>the</em><em>)</em><em> </em><em>Lord└</em><em>depart</em><em> from injustice.”</em>  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And in (a) large house are not only gold and silver containers/vessels, but also wooden and clay (containers/vessels), and what (are) for honor and what (are) for dishonor.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>If then anybody cleanses himself from these-things, he-will-be (a) vessel/container for honorable-(use), sanctified, useful to-the Master, readied for every good deed.  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But flee [the] youthful desires, and pursue-after righteousness, faith, love, peace with the-ones calling-on the Lord out-of (a) pure heart.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But keep-away-from [the] foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they-produce quarrels.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But it-is┘not└necessary-for (the) bond-servant of-(the)-Lord to-quarrel, but to-be gentle toward all, able-to-teach, tolerant/not-reacting-when-mistreated/patient-when-wronged, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>in gentleness correcting the-ones opposing, lest-at-some-time [the] God should-give them repentance unto-(the) knowledge of-(the) truth, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and they–may-come-to-their-senses out-of the trap of-the devil, having-been-held by him in the will of-that-one.</span>
