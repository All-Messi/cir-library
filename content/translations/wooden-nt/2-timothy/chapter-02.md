## 2 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You then, my son, be-strong in the grace [the] in Christ Jesus, 2and what-things you-heard from me through many witnesses—these-things entrust to-faithful men who will-be able to-teach others.  3Suffer-hardship-with (me) as (a) good soldier of-Christ Jesus.  4Nobody, serving-as-a-soldier, gets-mixed-up-in the affairs of-[the] everyday-life, in-order-that he-may-please the-one having-recruited-(him)-as-a-soldier.  5And also if anybody competes-as-an-athlete, he-does┘not└win-the-crown unless2 he competes according-to-the-rules/legally.  6It-is-necessary-for the laboring farmer to-share-in the crops first.  7Think-over what I-am-saying, for the Lord will-give you understanding in all-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ having-been-raised from (the) dead, out-of (the) seed of-David, according-to the gospel of-me, 9in which I-suffer-hardship even-as-far-as bonds/imprisonment as (an) evildoer, but the word of-[the] God has┘not└been-bound.  10On-account-of this I-endure all-things on-account-of (the) elect, in-order-that they┘themselves└may-obtain salvation [the] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.  11Faithful/reliable (is) the saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If we-endure, we-will┘also└reign-with (him).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> If we-are-unfaithful, that-one remains faithful,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Remind-(them)-of these-things, solemnly-charging (them) before [the] God not to-quarrel-about-words, (which is) useful for nothing, unto (the) ruin of-the hearers.  15Be-diligent to-present yourself approved to-[the God, (a) workman unashamed, correctly-interpreting the word of-[the] truth.  16But avoid worldly empty-talk[s], for they-will-grow to more of-godlessness, 17and the word of-them will-have (a) spreading like gangrene, of-whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18who missed-the-mark/lost-their-way concerning the truth, saying [the]ms resurrection has-happened already, and are-overturning the faith of-some.  19Nevertheless the firm foundation of-[the] God stands, having [the] this seal:  "(The) Lord knows the-ones being of-him," and "Let┘every [the] naming the name of-(the) Lord└depart from injustice."  20And in (a) large house are not only gold and silver containers/vessels, but also wooden and clay (containers/vessels), and what (are) for honor and what (are) for dishonor.  21If then anybody cleanses himself from these-things, he-will-be (a) vessel/container for honorable-(use), sanctified, useful to-the Master, readied for every good deed.  22But flee [the] youthful desires, and pursue-after righteousness, faith, love, peace with the-ones calling-on the Lord out-of (a) pure heart.  23But keep-away-from [the] foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they-produce quarrels.  24But it-is┘not└necessary-for (the) bond-servant of-(the)-Lord to-quarrel, but to-be gentle toward all, able-to-teach, tolerant/not-reacting-when-mistreated/patient-when-wronged, 25in gentleness correcting the-ones opposing, lest-at-some-time [the] God should-give them repentance unto-(the) knowledge of-(the) truth, 26and they–may-come-to-their-senses out-of the trap of-the devil, having-been-held by him in the will of-that-one.</span>
