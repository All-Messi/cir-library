## 2 Timothy Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I-solemnly-charge (you) before [the] God and Christ Jesus, the-One going to-judge (the) living and (the) dead, and with-respect-to-the appearing of-him and the kingdom of-him:  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>preach the word, be-ready in season (and) out-of-season; refute, rebuke, encourage with all longsuffering and teaching.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For (the) time will-be when they-will┘not└put-up-with/endure [the] sound teaching; but according-to [the] their-own desires, they-will-accumulate for-themselves teachers itching<sup>nom</sup> with-respect-to-the what-they-hear, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and will-wander-off-from/turn-away-from the truth with-respect-to-the message, and will turn-aside to [the] myths.  <sup>5</sup>But <u>y</u><u>ou</u> be-self-controlled in all-things, suffer-hardship, do (the) work of-(an)-evangelist, fulfill the ministry of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For I am┘already└being-poured-out-like-a-drink-offering, and the time of-the departure of-me has-come near.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>I-have-fought the/a good fight, I-have-finished the course, I-have-kept the faith.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>From-now-on the crown of-[the] righteousness is-laid-up for-me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will-give to-me in that [the] day, and not only to-me, but also to-all the-ones having-loved the appearance of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Do-your-best/Hasten to-come to me soon/quickly.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For Demas deserted me, having-loved the present age, and went to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Only Luke is with me.  Having picked-up Mark, bring (him) with you, for he-is useful to-me for ministry.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And I-sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Coming, bring the cloak that I-left in Troas with Carpus and the books, especially (the) parchments.  <sup>14</sup>Alexander the metal-worker did many evil-things to-me.  The Lord will-repay him according-to the works of-him, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>whom <u>you</u> be-on-your-guard-about too, because he┘greatly└opposed [the] our words.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In (the) first defense of-me nobody stood-by me, but all deserted me.  May-it┘not└be-counted-against them.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But the Lord stood-by me and enabled me, in-order-that through me the preaching might-be┘fully└proclaimed, and all the Gentiles might-hear, and I-was-delivered out-of (the) mouth of-(the)-lion.  <sup>18</sup>The Lord will-deliver me from every evil deed, and he-will-save (me) into the heavenly [the] kingdom of-him, to-whom (be) [the] glory forevermore<sup>5</sup>.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of-Onesiphorus.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Erastus remained in Corinth, and I-left┘Trophimus└behind in Miletus sick.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Do-your-best/Be-diligent to-come before winter.  Ebulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers greet you.  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>The Lord (be) with the spirit of-you.  [The] grace (be) with you.
