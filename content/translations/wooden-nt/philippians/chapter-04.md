## Philippians Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>So, my beloved and longed-for brothers, (the) joy and crown of-me, stand-firm thus in (the) Lord, beloved. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I-urge Euodia and I-urge Syntyche to-have┘the same└attitude in (the) Lord. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Yes, I-ask you also, genuine yokefellow, help them, who struggle-together-with me in the gospel and with Clement and the rest of-(the) fellow-workers of-me, the names of-whom (are) in (the) book of-life. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Rejoice in (the) Lord always. I-will-say (it) again, rejoice. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Let┘the gentle-demeanor of-you└be-known to-all men. The Lord (is) near. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Worry in-respect-to-nothing, but in every [the] prayer and [the] supplication with thanksgiving make┘└know to [the] God. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the peace of-[the] God the-one surpassing all knowledge-will-guard the hearts of-you and the minds of-you in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>As a result, brothers, as-many-things-as are true, as-many-things-as (are) pure, as-many-things-as (are) honorable, as-many-things-as (are) just, as-many-things-as (are)pleasing, as-many-things-as (are worthy-of-praise, if (there is) any moral excellence, and if (there is) any-praise, think-about these-things. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the-things you- learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these-things, and the God of-[the] peace will-be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Now I-rejoiced in (the) Lord greatly that now at last you-revived [the] concern on-behalf-of me. Indeed, because-0of which you-were-concerned, but lacked opportunity. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Not that I-am-speaking from need, for I learned to-be content in what-things I-am. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I-know both to-be-in-humble-circumstance and I-know to-have-enough. In any and all-things I-have-learned-the secret both to-be-filled and to-hunger, both to abound and to-lack. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I-can-do all-things in the-One enabling me. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Nevertheless You-did well sharing-with the tribulation of-me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And you also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of-the gospel, when I-went-out from Macedonia, not church shared with-me in (the) matter of-giving and receiving except<sup>2</sup> you alone. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Because even in Thessalonica both once and twice you-sent to the need to-me. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Not that I-seek the gift, but I-seek the fruit [the-one] increasing in (the) account of-you. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Now I-have all-things and abound. I-have-been-filled, having received from Epaphroditus the-things from you, (a) sweet aroma, (an) acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to-[the] God. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And the God of-me will-supply every need of-you according-to the wealth of-him in glory in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Now to-the God and Father of-us (be) [the] glory forevermore<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>All the saints greet you, and especially the-ones from the household of-Caesar. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The grace of-the Lord Jesus Christ (be) with the spirit of-you.
