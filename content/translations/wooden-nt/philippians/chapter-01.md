## Philippians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of-Christ Jesus, to-all the saints in Christ Jesus the-ones being in Philippi with elders and deacons. 2Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I-thank the God of-me at every [the] remembrance of-you, 4always making [the] prayer with joy in every prayer of-me for all of-you, 5over the fellowship of-you in the gospel from the first day until the now, 6confident with-respect-to-this- very-thing that the One having begun in you (a) good work will-keep-perfecting (it) until (the) day of-Christ Jesus, 7even-as it-is right for-me to-think on-behalf-of you all on-account-of [the] me to-have you in the heart, and in the bonds of-me and in the defense and confirmation of-the gospel, you all being sharers-with me of-[the]-grace. 8For [the] God (is) witness of-me, as I-long-for you all in (the) affections of-Christ Jesus. 9And this I-pray, in-order-that the love of-you still more and more may-increase in knowledge and all insight, 10unto [the] your approving the excellent things, in-order-that you-may-be sincere and of clear conscience unto (the) day of-Christ, 11filled-with (the) fruit of-righteousness, the-one through Jesus Christ unto (the) glory and praise of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now I-want you to-know, brothers, that the-things according-to me have-come more to (the) progress of-the gospel, 13so-that the bonds/imprisonment of-me became manifest in Christ in the whole Praetorium and (in) all the rest; 14and the more of-the brothers having-trusted in (the) Lord because-of-the bonds of-me, dare to-speak the word more-fearlessly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Some are-preaching [the] Christ even on-account-of spite and strife, and some also on-account-of good-will. 16The-ones (do it) out-of love, knowing that I-am-set for (the) defense of-the gospel, 17but the-others preach [the] Christ out-of selfish-rivalry, not sincerely, thinking to-raise-up trouble for-the bonds/imprisonment of-me. 18For what? Only that in-every-way, whether in-pretense or in-truth, Christ is-being-preached, and in this I-rejoice. But I┘also└will-rejoice, 19for I-know that this will-lead-out for me into deliverance through the prayer of-you and support of-the Spirit of-Jesus Christ 20accordiing-to the deep-desire and hope of-me that in nothing will-I-be-ashamed; but in all boldness as always also now, Christ will-be-held- in-high-honor in the body of-me, whether by life or by death. 21For to-me [the] to-live (is) Christ and [the] to-die is gain. 22But if [the] to-live is in (the) flesh, this to-me (is the fruit of-labor, and I-do┘not└know what I-will choose. 23Now I-am-under-tension of the two, having the desire to the departing and being with Christ, [for] that (is) better, more by-much. 24But [the] remaining in the flesh (is) more-necessary on-account-of you. 25And persuaded in-respect-to-this, I-know that I-will-remain and will-remain-with you all unto the progress of-you and joy of-the faith; 26in-order-that the ground-for-pride of-you will-increase in Christ Jesus in me through [the] my presence again with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Only conduct yourselves worthily of-the gospel of-[the] Christ, in-order-that, whether coming and seeing you or being-away, I-may-hear the-things about you that you-are-standing-firm in one spirit, with-onemind, striving-together in-the faith of-the gospel 28and not alarmed in anything by the opponents, which is for-them (an) indication of-destruction, but of-(the)-salvation of-you and this from God; 29because to-you the-thing was-granted on-behalf-of Christ, not only [the] to-believe in him but also [the] to-suffer on-behalf-of him, 30having the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear in me.</span>
