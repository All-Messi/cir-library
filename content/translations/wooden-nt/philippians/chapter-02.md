## Philippians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So if (there is) any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of-love, if any fellowship of-(the)-Spirit, if any affection and compassion, 2make┘the joy of-me└full in-order-that you-may-have-in-mind the same thing, having the same love, united-in-spirit, intending the one purpose, 3(doing) nothing according-to selfishness, nothing according-to empty-conceit, but with-[the] humility considering one-another more-important than-yourselves, 4each-one not looking-at the-things of yourselves, but [also]ms everyone the-things of-others. 5Have┘this└attitude in you that (was) also in Christ Jesus, 6who, being in (the) form of-deity, did┘not└consider [the] being equal to-God (a) clung-to-thing, 7but emptied himself, having-taken (the) form of-(a)-servant, having-been in (the) likeness of-man, and having-been-found in-form like (a) man, 8he-humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even (the) death of-(a)-cross. 9Wherefore also [the] God exalted him and gave to-him the name [the] above every name, 10in-order-that at the name of-Jesus every knee would-bend of-heavenly-ones and earthly-ones and subterranean-ones, 11and every tongue would-confess that Jesus Christ (is) Lord to (the) glory of-God (the) Father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, my beloved, even-as you┘always└obeyed, not as in the presence of-me only, but now more by-much in the absence of-me, with fear and trembling, work-out [the] your salvation. 13For God is the-One working in you both the willing and the doing for the/his good-pleasure (of him). 14Do all-things without grumblings and arguings, 15in-order-that you-may-be blameless and innocent, children of-God faultless in-the-midst-of (a) crooked generation and perverse, among whom you-shine as lights in (the) world, 16holding-firmly-onto (the) word of-life, unto glorying to-me in (the) day of-Christ, that I-did┘not└run in vain or labor in vain. 17But even if I-am-poured-out-as-(a)-drink-offering on the altar and service of-the faith of-you, I-rejoice and rejoice-with you all. 18And you also the same-way rejoice and rejoice-with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But I-hope in (the) Lord Jesus to-send Timothy to-you in-order-that I-also may-be-encouraged, having-known the-things about you. 20For I-have nobody like-minded who will┘sincerely└be-concerned-about the-things about you. 21For the-ones all seek the-things of-themselves, more-than the-things of-Jesus Christ. 22But you-now the proven-value of-him that like (a) child to-(a)-father he-served with me in the gospel. 23So I-hope to-send this-one as┘soon└as2 I-see the-things about me, 24and I-am-confident in (the) Lord that I┘myself└will-come soon also.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Now I-considered (it) necessary to-send to you Epaphroditus, the brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier of-me and messenger of-you and minister of-the need of-me, 26because he-was longing-for you all and being-anxious because you-heard that he-was-sick. 27For indeed he-was-sick near death, but [the] God was-merciful-to him, and not to-him only, but also to-me in-order-that I-might┘not└have grief upon grief. 28So more-eagerly I- sent him in-order-that, having-seen him again, you-might-rejoice and-I might-be less-grieved. 29So welcome him in (the) Lord with all joy and have [the] such in-high-regards, 30because he-came-close to death because-of the work of-Christ, having-risked the life (of-him) in-order-that he-might-fill-up the remaining-things of-you of-the service to-me.</span>
