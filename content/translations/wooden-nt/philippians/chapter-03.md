## Philippians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Finally/As-a-result<sup>2</sup>, my brothers, rejoice in (the) Lord. To-write the same-things to-you (is) not troublesome to me, but/and (is is) safe for you. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Watch-out-for the dogs; watch-out-for the evil doers; watch-out-for the mutilation/false-circumcision. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We are the circumcision, the-ones serving (the) Spirit of-God and taking-pride in Christ Jesus and not putting-confidence in (the) flesh, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>although I having confidence even in (the) flesh if anybody else seems to-put-confidence in (the) flesh, I more. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>With-respect-to circumcision (the) eighth-day, of (the) nation of-Israel, of-(the) tribe of-Benjamin, (a) Hebrew of Hebrews, according-to (the) Law (a) Pharisee, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>according-to zeal persecuting the church, according-to (the) righteousness the-one in (the) Law being blameless. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><sup>[</sup></strong>But]<sup>ms</sup> whatever-things were to-me gains—these I-consider loss on-account-of [the] Christ. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But more-than-that I┘also└consider all-things to-be loss on-account-of the surpassing-thing of-the knowledge of-Christ Jesus the Lord of-me, on-account-of whom I-lost [the] all-things, and consider (them) garbage in-order-that I-might-gain Christ <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and be-found in him, not having my-own righteousness, the-one from law, but the-one through trust of-Christ, the righteousness from God on-the-basis-of [the] trust, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>[the] to-know him and the power of-the resurrection of-him and the fellowship of-the sufferings of-him, being conformed to-the death of-him, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>if somehow I-might-attain to the resurrection [the] of-(the() dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Not that I┘already└obtained (it) or have┘already└reached-the-goal, but I press-on if indeed I-might-lay-hold-of (it) for-which I-was-laid-hold-of by Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Brothers, I do┘not└consider myself to-have-laid-hold-of (it); but one-thing, forgetting the-things behind and stretching-for the-things ahead, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I-press-on according-to (the) goal for the prize of-the upward call of-[the] God in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So as-many-as (are) mature, let-us-take┘this└attitude; and if with-respect-to-anything you-have-(a) ┘different└attitude, [the] God will-reveal this also to-you. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>However, to-what we-attain, to-the same (level) to-conduct (ourselves).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Brothers, be imitators of-me, and watch the-ones walking thus as you-have us (as a) pattern. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For may walk whom many-times I-used-to-tell you, but now also I-say weeping, (they are the) enemies of-the cross of-[the] Christ, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>whose [the] end (is) destruction, whose [the] god is the/their stomach, and the glory (is) in the shame of-them, the-ones setting-their-minds-on [the] earthly-things. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For the citizenship of-us is in heaven, from which also we expectantly wait-for (a) Savior, (the) Lord Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>who will-transform the body of-the humility of-us (to be) conformed to-the body of-the glory of-him according-to the working unto his being-able also to-subject [the] all-things to himself.</span>
