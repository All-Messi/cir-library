## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now about times and seasons, brothers, you-do┘not└have need (for anything) to-be-written to you.  2For you┘yourselves└know correctly/full-well that (the) day of-(the)-Lord comes just like (a) thief at night.  3When they-say, "Peace and safety," then destruction comes-on them unexpected like [the] birth-pangs to-the-one having in (the) stomach, and they-will┘certainly not└escape.  4But you, brothers, are not in (the) dark in-order-that the day might-overtake you like (a) thief.  5For you all are sons of-light and sons of-day; e-are not (sons) of-night and of-darkness.  6So then let-us┘not└sleep like the rest, but let-us-keep-awake and let-us-be-sober.  7For the-ones sleeping sleep during-(the)-night and the-ones getting-drunk get-drunk during-(the)-night.  8But let-us┘being (sons) of-day└be-sober, having-put-on (the) breastplate of-faith and love and (the)-helmet (as the) hope of-salvation, 9because he-did┘not└destine us to wrath, but to (the) obtaining of-salvation through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, 10the-One having-died on-behalf-of us in-order-that whether we-are-awake or asleep, we-will-live together with him.  11Wherefore comfort one-another, and build┘each-other└up even-as also you-are-doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But we-ask you, brothers, to-acknowledge the-ones laboring among you and having-responsibility over-you in (the) Lord and instructing you, 13and to-regard them very highly in love on-account-of the work of-them.  Be-at-peace with each-other.  14And we-urge you, brothers, warn the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with all.  15See (that) not anybody repays anybody evil for evil, but always follow the good-thing [both]ms for one-another and for all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Always rejoice.  17Constantly pray, 18in everything give-thanks; for this (is the) will of-God in Christ Jesus for you.  19Do┘not└quench the Spirit, 20do┘not└look-down-on prophecyings, 21but examine all-things; hold-onto the good-thing, 22abstain from every appearance/form of-evil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Now may┘ the God of-[the] peace himself └sanctify you completely and may┘the spirit and the soul and the body of-you└be-kept complete without blame at the coming of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.  24The-One calling you (is) faithful, who will┘also└do (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Brothers, [also]ms pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Greet all the brothers with (a) holy kiss.  27I-adjure you by-the Lord to-have the letter read to-all the brothers.  28The grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ (be) with you.</span>
