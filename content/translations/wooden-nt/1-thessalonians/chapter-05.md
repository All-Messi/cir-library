## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now about times and seasons, brothers, you-do┘not└have need (for anything) to-be-written to you.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For you┘yourselves└know correctly/full-well that (the) day of-(the)-Lord comes just like (a) thief at night.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When they-say, <em>“Peace and safety,”</em> then destruction comes-on them unexpected like [the] birth-pangs to-the-one having in (the) stomach, and they-will┘certainly not└escape.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But <u>you</u>, brothers, are not in (the) dark in-order-that the day might-overtake you like (a) thief.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For you all are sons of-light and sons of-day; e-are not (sons) of-night and of-darkness.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So then let-us┘not└sleep like the rest, but let-us-keep-awake and let-us-be-sober.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For the-ones sleeping sleep during-(the)-night and the-ones getting-drunk get-drunk during-(the)-night.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But let-<u>us</u>┘being (sons) of-day└be-sober, having-put-on (the) breastplate of-faith and love and (the)-helmet (as the) hope of-salvation, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>because he-did┘not└destine us to wrath, but to (the) obtaining of-salvation through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>the-One having-died on-behalf-of us in-order-that whether we-are-awake or asleep, we-will-live together with him.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Wherefore comfort one-another, and build┘each-other└up even-as also you-are-doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> But we-ask you, brothers, to-acknowledge the-ones laboring among you and having-responsibility over-you in (the) Lord and instructing you, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and to-regard them very highly in love on-account-of the work of-them.  Be-at-peace with each-other.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And we-urge you, brothers, warn the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with all.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>See (that) not anybody repays anybody evil for evil, but always follow the good-thing [both]<sup>ms</sup> for one-another and for all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Always rejoice.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Constantly pray, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>in everything give-thanks; for this (is the) will of-God in Christ Jesus for you.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Do┘not└quench the Spirit, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>do┘not└look-down-on prophecyings, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>but examine all-things; hold-onto the good-thing, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>abstain from every appearance/form of-evil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Now may┘ the God of-[the] peace himself └sanctify you completely and may┘the spirit and the soul and the body of-you└be-kept complete without blame at the coming of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The-One calling you (is) faithful, who will┘also└do (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Brothers, [also]<sup>ms</sup> pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Greet all the brothers with (a) holy kiss.  <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>I-adjure you by-the Lord to-have the letter read to-all the brothers.  <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>The grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ (be) with you.
