## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to-the church of-(the)-Thessalonians in God (the) Father and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.  Grace and [peace (be) to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> We┘always└thank [the] God for all of-you, making mention (of you) in the prayers of-us; constantly 3remembering the work of-[the] faith of-you and [the] labor of-love and [the] perseverance of-[the] hope of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ before the God and Father of-us, 4knowing, brothers beloved by [the]ms God, the election of-you; 5because the gospel of-us did┘not└come to you in word only, but also in power and in [the] Holy Spirit and [in]ms full assurance, even-as you-know what-kind-of-men we-proved-to-be amongms you on-account-of you.  6And you became imitators of-us and the Lord, having-received the word in much tribulation with (the) joy of-(the)-Holy Spirit, 7so-that you became (an) example to-all the believing-ones in [the] Macedonia and in [the] Achaia.  8For from you the word of-the Lord rang-out, not only in [the] Macedonia and [in the]ms Achaia, but in every place the faith of-you [the] toward [the] God has-gone-out, so-that we have no need to-say anything.  9For they┘ themselves └acknowledge about us what-kind-of reception we-had with you, and how you-turned to [the] God from [the] idols to-serve (the) living and true God, 10and to-await the Son of-him from [the] heaven[s], whom he-raised from [the]ms dead, Jesus, the-one rescuing us from the coming [the] wrath.</span>
