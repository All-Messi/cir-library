## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For you┘yourselves└know, brothers, the entering of-us [the] to you that it-proved┘not└to-be in-vain; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>but, having-suffered-before and been-mistreated, as you-know, in Philippi, we-had-the-boldness in the God of-us to-speak to you the gospel of-[the] God in much struggling.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For the encouragement of-us (was) not out-of deception neither out-of impurity nor in deceit, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>but even-as we-have-been-approved by [the] God to-be-entrusted-with the gospel, thus we-speak, not as pleasing men, but God, the-One approving the hearts of-us.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For neither at-any-time in word of-flattery did-we-come, as you-know, neither in (a) pretext of-greed—God (is) witness, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>neither seeking glory out-of men nor from you or from others, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><sup>a </sup></strong>though-being-able in importance/weight to-be as apostles of-Christ, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><sup>b</sup></strong>but we-became infants in (the) midst of-you.  As if (a) nursing-mother takes-good-care-of her [the] children, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>thus longing-for you, we-were-well-pleased to-share-with you, not only the gospel of-[the] God, but also the souls of-us, wherefore you-became beloved to-us.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For you-remember, brothers, the labor of-us and the hardship, night and day working unto [the] not burdening any of-you, we-preached to you the gospel of-[the] God.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>You (are) witnesses and [the] God how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we-became to-you the believing-ones, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>even-as you-know, as each one of-you like (a) father (would) his children, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>urging you and encouraging and testifying unto [the] your living worthily of-[the] God the-One calling you into the kingdom of-him and glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And on-account-of this <u>we</u>┘also└thank [the] God constantly, because, having-received the word of-hearing of-[the] God from us, you-accepted (it), not as (the) word of-men, but as it-is truly, (the) word of-God, who also is-working in you the believing-ones.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For <u>you</u> became imitators, brothers, of-the churches of-[the] God the-ones being in [the] Judaea in Christ Jesus, because <u>you</u> also suffered the same-things by [the] your-own countrymen even-as they also (did) by the Jews, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>the-ones also having-killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us and not being-pleasing to-God and in-opposition-to all men, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>preventing┘us└from speaking to the Gentiles in-order-that they-might-be-saved, unto the filling-up the sins of-them always.  But [the] wrath will-come upon them in (the) end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But we, brothers, having-been-separated from you for (a) time of-(an)-hour, by-face not by heart, were┘especially└eager to-see the face of-you in great desire.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Wherefore we-wanted to-come to you—I, Paul, both once and twice, and/but [the] Satan prevented us.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For who (is the) hope of-us or (the) joy or crown of-pride—[or] if-not even <u>you</u>—before the Lord of-us Jesus at the coming of-him?  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For <u>you</u> are the glory of-us and the joy.</span>
