## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wherefore, being┘no-longer└able-to-put-up-with (it), we-thought-it-best to-be-left-behind in Athens alone, 2and sent Timothy, the brother of-us and fellow-worker of-[the] God in the gospel of-[the] Christ, unto [the] strengthening you and encouraging (you) on-behalf-of the faith of-you 3to┘[the] nobody's└being-disturbed by [the] these tribulations, for you┘yourselves└know that we-are-destined for this.  4For even when we-were with you, we-were-telling┘you└beforehand that we-would be-afflicted even-as also it-happened and you-know (it).  5On-account-of this I-also, no-longer able-to-endure, sent unto the knowing the faith of-you, lest the-one putting┘us└to-the-test might┘somehow└tempt you, and the labor of-us would-have-been in vain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But now Timothy having-come to us from you and having-brought-good-news to-us in-regard-to-the faith and the love of-you, and that you┘always└have (a) good memory of-us, longing to-see us as also we (long to see) you—7on-account-of this we-are-comforted, brothers, over you in all the distress and tribulation of-us through the faith of-you, 8because now we-live if you stand-firm in (the) Lord, 9for what thanks are-we-able to-pay to-[the] God about you over all the joy with-which we-rejoice on-account-of you before the God of-us, 10night and day praying very earnestly unto [the] seeing the face of-you and completing the lacking-things of-the faith of-you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Now may the God and Father of-us himself direct the way of-us to you; 12and may┘ the Lord └increase you and abound with love to one-another and to all-men as also we to you, 13to [the] establishing the hearts of-you blameless in holiness before the God and Father of-us at the coming of-the Lord of-us Jesus with all the saints of-him.  Amen.</span>
