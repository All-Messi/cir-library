## 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Finally, then, brothers, we-ask you and urge (you) in (the) Lord Jesus, in-order-that even-as you-received from us [the] how it-is-necessary for-you to-walk and to-be-pleasing to-God, even-as also you-walk, in-order-that you increase more.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For you-know what commandments we-gave you by the Lord Jesus.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For this is (the) will of-[the] God the sanctification of-you:  (that) you abstain from sexual-immorality; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>(that) each of-you know to-exercise-control the vessel of-him in sanctification and honor, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not in (the) passion of-lust, like also the Gentiles the-ones not knowing [the] God; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>(that a man not) [the] transgress and cheat the brother of-him in the matter, because (the) Lord (is the) avenger about all these-things, even-as also we-told┘you└before and solemnly-warned (you).  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For [the] God did┘not└call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Consequently, the-one rejecting (this) is┘not└rejecting man, but [the] God, the-one giving the Holy [the] Spirit of-him into us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now about [the] brotherly love, you-do┘not└have need (for me) to-write to-you, for you yourselves are God-taught unto [the] loving one-another, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>for indeed you-do it to all the brothers [the]<sup>ms</sup> in the whole (of) Macedonia.  But we-urge you, brothers, to-increase more <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and make-it-your-ambition to-work with [the] hands of-you as we-commanded you, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>in-order-that you-may-walk properly toward the-ones outside and have need of-nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And we-do┘not└want you to-be-ignorant, brothers, about the-ones sleeping, in-order-that you-may┘not└mourn even-as also the rest the-ones not having hope.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For if we-believe that Jesus died and arose, so also [the] God will-bring with him the-ones fallen-asleep through [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> For we-say this to-you in (the) word of-(the)-Lord, that <u>we</u> the-ones living [the] left-behind-ones unto the coming of-the Lord will┘certainly not└precede the-ones fallen-asleep; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>because the Lord himself with (a) shout, with (the) voice of-(the)-archangel and with (the) trumpet of-God, will-descend from heaven and the dead in Christ will-resurrect first, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>then we the-ones living [the] left-behind will-be-taken-up together with them in (the) clouds unto meeting the Lord in (the) air, and so we-will┘always└be with (the) Lord.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>So comfort one-another with [the] these words.</span>
