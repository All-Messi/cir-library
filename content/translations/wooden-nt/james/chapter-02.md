## James Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My brothers, do┘not└have the faith of the Lord of-us Jesus Christ of-[the] glory with partiality/favoritism.  2For if (a) man in bright/fine clothes wearing-a-gold-ring comes into (the) synagogue/assembly of-you, and (a) poor-(man) also comes-in in shabby clothes, 3and you-pay-attention to the-one wearing the bright/fine [the] clothes, and you-say, "You sit here well," and to-the poor-(man), "You stand," or, "Sit here under/by the footstool of-me," 4did-you┘not also/both└make-distinctions among yourselves and become judges of-evil reasonings/motives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers, did┘[the] God not└choose the poor to-the world (to be) rich in faith and (to be) heirs of-the kingdom that he-promised to-the-ones loving him?  6But you dishonored the poor-(man).  Do┘not└the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you into court?  7Are┘they not└blaspheming the good name [the] called upon you?  8However, if you-keep (the) royal law according-to the scripture, "You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself," you-do well.  9But if you-show-favoritism, you-work sin, being-convicted by the Law as transgressors.  10For whoever keeps the whole Law, and stumbles in one (commandment), has-become guilty of-allpl.  11For the-One having-said, "Do┘not└commit adultery," also said, "Do┘not└murder."  And if you-do┘not└commit-adultery, but commit-murder, you-have-become (a) transgressor of-(the)-Law.  Thus speak and thus do as ones-going to-be-judged by (a) law of-liberty.  13For [the] judgment (is) without-mercy to-the-one not doing/showing mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What (is) the benefit, my brothers, of somebody says to-have faith, but does not have works?  [The] faith is┘not┘┘└able to-save him, └└is-it?  15If (a) brother of sister is in-need-of-clothes and are lacking [the] daily food, 16and somebody of you says to-them, "Go in peace; be-warmed and be-filled," but do┘not└give to-them the necessities of-the body, what (is) the benefit?  17Likewise also [the] faith, if it-does┘not└have works, is dead according-to itself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But somebody will-say, "You have faith, and-I have works."  Show me the faith of-you apart-from [the] works, and-I will-show you the faith (of-me) by the works of-me.  19You believe that one is [the] God; you-do well.  Even the demons believe and tremble-with-fear.  20Are-you-willing to-know, O foolish/vain man, that [the] faith apart-from [the] works is useless?  21Was┘not Abraham, the father of-us,└justified by works having–offered Isaac the son of-him on the altar?  22You-see that [the] faith worked-with the works of-him, and [the] faith was-brought-to-completion by [the] works.  23And the scripture was-fulfilled the-one saying, "And Abraham believed [the] God, and it-was-reckoned to-him for righteousness," and he-was-called (a) "friend of-God."    24You-see that by works (a) man is-justified, and not by faith only.  25and likewise also was┘Rahab the harlot not└justified by works, having-received the messengers and having-sent┘└out another way?  26For as the body without (the) spirit/breath is dead, so also [the] faith without work is dead.</span>
