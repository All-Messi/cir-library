## James Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My brothers, do┘not└have the faith of the Lord of-us Jesus Christ of-[the] glory with partiality/favoritism.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For if (a) man in bright/fine clothes wearing-a-gold-ring comes into (the) synagogue/assembly of-you, and (a) poor-(man) also comes-in in shabby clothes, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and you-pay-attention to the-one wearing the bright/fine [the] clothes, and you-say, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> sit here well,”</em> and to-the poor-(man), <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> stand</em><em>,</em><em>” </em><em>or</em><em>, “S</em><em>it here under/by the footstool of-me,”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>did-you┘not also/both└make-distinctions among yourselves and become judges of-evil reasonings/motives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers, did┘[the] God not└choose the poor to-the world (to be) rich in faith and (to be) heirs of-the kingdom that he-promised to-the-ones loving him?  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> dishonored the poor-(man).  Do┘not└the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you into court?  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Are┘<u>they</u> not└blaspheming the good name [the] called upon you?  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>However, if you-keep (the) royal law according-to the scripture, <strong><em>“You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself,”</em></strong> you-do well.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But if you-show-favoritism, you-work sin, being-convicted by the Law as transgressors.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For whoever keeps the whole Law, and stumbles in one (commandment), has-become guilty of-all<sup>pl</sup>.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For the-One having-said, <strong><em>“Do┘not└commit adultery,” </em></strong>also said, <strong><em>“Do┘not└murder.”</em></strong>  And if you-do┘not└commit-adultery, but commit-murder, you-have-become (a) transgressor of-(the)-Law.  Thus speak and thus do as ones-going to-be-judged by (a) law of-liberty.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For [the] judgment (is) without-mercy to-the-one not doing/showing mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What (is) the benefit, my brothers, of somebody says to-have faith, but does not have works?  [The] faith is┘not┘┘└able to-save him, └└is-it?  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If (a) brother of sister is in-need-of-clothes and are lacking [the] daily food, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and somebody of you says to-them, <em>“Go in peace; be-warmed and be-filled,” </em>but do┘not└give to-them the necessities of-the body, what (is) the benefit?  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Likewise also [the] faith, if it-does┘not└have works, is dead according-to itself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> But somebody will-say, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> have faith, and-I have works.”</em>  Show me the faith of-you apart-from [the] works, and-I will-show you the faith (of-me) by the works of-me.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><u>You</u> believe that one is [the] God; you-do well.  Even the demons believe and tremble-with-fear.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Are-you-willing to-know, O foolish/vain man, that [the] faith apart-from [the] works is useless?  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Was┘not Abraham, the father of-us,└justified by works having–offered Isaac the son of-him on the altar?  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>You-see that [the] faith worked-with the works of-him, and [the] faith was-brought-to-completion by [the] works.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And the scripture was-fulfilled the-one saying, <strong><em>“And Abraham believed [the] God</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> and it-was-reckoned to-him for righteousness</em></strong><strong><em>,”</em></strong> and he-was-called (a) <strong>“</strong><strong><em>friend of-G</em></strong><strong><em>od</em></strong>.<strong><em>”</em></strong>    <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>You-see that by works (a) man is-justified, and not by faith only.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and likewise also was┘Rahab the harlot not└justified by works, having-received the messengers and having-sent┘└out another way?  <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>For as the body without (the) spirit/breath is dead, so also [the] faith without work is dead.</span>
