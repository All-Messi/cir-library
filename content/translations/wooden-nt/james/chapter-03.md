## James Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Do┘not many-(of you)└become teachers, my brothers, because we-will-receive greater condemnation.  2For we┘all└go-wrong in word, this-one (is a) perfect man, able to-hold┘the whole body└in-check.  3And if we-put [the] bits into the mouths of-[the] horses unto [the] their obeying us, we┘also└direct the whole body of-them.  4Behold also [the] ship, being so-great and driven by hard winds, are-directed by very-small steering-paddles wherever the will of-the helmsman wants.  5Likewise also the tongue is (a) small member and boasts big-things. Behold, how-small (a) fire ignites/sets-on-fire how big (a) forest!  6And the tongues (is a) fire.  The world of-[the] iniquity, the tongue is-placed among the members of-us [the-one] polluting the whole body and setting-on-fire the course of-[the] existence and is-set-on-fire by [the] Gehenna.  7For every nature/kind both of-beasts and birds, both of reptiles and fish is-controlled and has-been-controlled by-[the] human [the] species, 8but nobody of-men is-able to-control the tongue.  (It is a) restless evil-thing, full of-deadly poison.  9With it we-bless the Lord and Father, and with it we-curse [the] men made according-to (the) likeness of- God.  10Blessing and cursing comes out-of the same mouth.  These-things ought┘not└to-be, my brothers.  11The/A spring does┘not└gush/pour out-of the same opening [the] sweet-(water) and [the] bitter, does-it?  12(A) fig-tree is┘not┘┘└able to-make olives or (a) vine (is not able to produce) figs, └└can-it?  Neither (is) salty water (able) to-produce fresh (water).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who among you (is) wise and understanding?  Let┘the works of-him└show from the/his good lifestyle in (the) gentleness of-wisdom.  14And if-you-have bitter jealousy and selfish-ambition in the heart of-youpl, do┘not└be-proud and lie against the truth.  15This [the] wisdom does not come-down from-above, but (is) earthly, natural, demonic.  16For where jealous and selfish-ambition, there (is) disorder and every evil thing.  17Now the wisdom from-itself is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of-mercy and good fruits, unwavering, not-hypocritical.  18And (the) fruit of-righteousness is-sown in peace for-the-ones making peace.</span>
