## James Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Go now, [the] rich-ones; cry, wailing over the miseries of-you [the] coming-on (you).  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The wealth of-you has-rotted, and the clothes of-you have-become moth-eaten.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The gold and the silver of-you has-tarnished, and the rust of-them will-be for (a) witness to-you, and it-will-consume the flesh[es] of-you like fire.  You-treasured (it up) in the last days.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Behold, the pay of-the laborers [the] mowing the fields of-you, [the] withheld by you, cries-out; and the outcries of-the reapers has-entered into the ears of-(the)-Lord of-hosts/Sabaoth.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You-lived-in-self-indulgence on the earth, and you-lived-in-luxury.  You-nourished the hearts of-you in (the) day of-slaughter/butchering; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>you-condemned; you-put-to-death the Righteous-One.  He-does┘not└resist you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So be-patient, brothers, until the coming of-the Lord.  Behold, the farmer waits for the precious crop of-the earth, being-patient over it, until he-receives (the) early-rain and late (rain).  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>You┘also└be-patient; strengthen the hearts of-you, because the coming of-the Lord was/is near.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Do┘not└complain, brothers, against one-another in-order-that you┘not└be-condemned.  Behold, the Judge is-standing in-front-of the doors.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>As-an-example of-[the] suffering and [the] patience, brothers, take the prophets that spoke in the name of-(the)-Lord.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Behold, we-bless/consider-blessed the-ones having-endured.  You-heard-about the endurance of-Job, and you saw the outcome of-(the)-Lord, that the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And before all-things, my brothers, do┘not└swear either with-respect-to [the] heaven or [the] earth, or any other oath.  But let┘the “yes” of-you└be yes and the “no” (be) no, in-order that you┘not└fall under condemnation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Is┘anybody among you└suffering? Let-him-pray.  Is anybody happy, let-him-sing.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Is┘anybody among you└sick?  Let-him-call the elders of-the church, and let-them-pray over him, having-anointed him with-oil in the name of-the Lord.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the prayer of-[the] faith will-save the sick-one, and the Lord will-raise┘him└up; and-if he-has done sins, it-will-be-forgiven to-him.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So confess the/your sins to-one-another, and pray for one-another in-order-that you-may-be-healed.  (The) effective prayer of-(a)-righteous-(man) accomplishes much.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Elijah was (a) man of-like-nature to-us, and he-prayed with-prayer<sup>2</sup>/he-prayed-earnestly<sup>2</sup> [the] that it not rain, and it-did┘not└rain on the earth for-three years and six months.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And again he-prayed, and the sky gave rain, and the earth produced the fruit of-it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>My brothers, if anybody among you strays from the truth and somebody turns┘him└around, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>let-him-know that the-one having-turned (a) sinner from (the) error of-(the)-way of-him, will-save (the) soul of-him from death and will-cover (a) multitude of-sins.
