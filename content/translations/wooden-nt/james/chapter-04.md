## James Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Whence (are) wars and battles among you?  (Is it) not whence from the passions of-you the-ones waging-war in the members of-you?  2You-lust and do┘not└have; you-murder and envy, and you-are┘not└able to-obtain; you-war and battle; you-do┘not└have on-account-of [the] your not asking; 3you-ask and do┘not└receive, because you-ask badly, in-order-that you-may-spend (it) on the pleasures of-you.  4Adulteresses, do you┘not└know that [the] friendship of-the world is hostility of-[the] God?  Whoever2 then wants to-be (a) friend of-the world, makes-himself (an) enemy of-[the] God.  5Or, do-you-suppose that in-vain the scripture says, "The Spirit that he caused to dwell in us desires unto jealousy"?  6But he-gives greater grace:  wherefore it-says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Therefore submit to-[the] God, and resist the devil and he-will-flee from you.  8Draw-near to-[the] God, and he-will-draw-near-to you.  Cleanse (your) hands, sinners; and sanctify (your) hearts, double-minded-ones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Be-sorrowful and mourn and weep.  Let┘the laughter of you└change into mourning, and (let) the joy (of you change) into gloom.  10Be-humbled before the Lord, and he-will-exalt you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Do┘not└speak-against one-another, brothers.  The-one speaking-against (a) brother or judging the brother of-him speaks-against (the) Law and judges (the) Law.  But if you-judge (the) Law, you-are not (a) doer of-the Law, but (a) judge.  12One is the Lawgiver and Judge, the-one able to-save and destroy.  But who are you, the-one judging the/your neighbor?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Go now the-ones saying, "Today or tomorrow we-will-go to this [the] city, and we-will-spend (a) year there, and we-will-conduct-business and make-(a)-profit," 14you┘who └do┘not└know what the life of-you (will-be) [the] tomorrow—for you-are (a) vapor [the] appearing for (a) little-(while), and then disappearing—15against [the] your saying, "If the Lord wills, we-will┘also└live and will-do this or that-thing."  16And now you-boast in the prides of-you.  Every such boasting is evil.  17So, to-one-knowing to-do good and not doing it, to-him it-is sin.</span>
