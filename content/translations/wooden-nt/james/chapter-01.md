## James Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>James, servant of-God and (the) Lord Jesus Christ, to-the twelve tribes [the] in the Diaspora.  Greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Consider (it) all joy, my brothers, when you-encounter all-kinds-of trials, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>knowing that the testing of-the faith of-you produces patience.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And let┘[the] patience└have (its) complete effect, in-order-that you-may-be complete and sound, lacking in nothing.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Now if anybody of-you lacks wisdom, let-him-ask from God, the-One giving to-all generously and not reproaching, and it-will-be-given to-him.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And let-him-ask in faith, doubting nothing, for the/a doubter is-like waves of-(the)-sea, driven-by-the wind and tossed-around, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>for let┘not [the] that man└suppose that he-will-receive anything from the Lord, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>(a) double-minded man, unstable in all the ways of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And let┘the humble [the] brother└take-pride in the exalted-state of-him, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and (let) the rich (glory) in the humiliation of-him; because like (the) flower of-(the)-grass, it/he will-pass-away.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For the sun rises with the scorching-wind and withers the grass, and the flower of-it fell/falls, and the loveliness of-the face of-it perished/perishes; thus also the rich-(man) will-fade-away in the pursuits of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Blessed (is) (the) man who perseveres under trial, because having-become approved he-will-receive the crown of-[the] life, which he-promised to-the-ones loving him.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Let┘nobody└say, being-tempted/tried, [that], <em>“I-am-being-tempted/tried by God.”  </em>For [the] God is not-tempted by-evil-things, and he tempts nobody.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And each-one is-tempted, carried-away and lured by [the] his-own lusts/desires.  <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then [the] lust, having-conceived, bears sin, and [the] sin, having-been-full-grown, breeds death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Do┘not└be-deceived, my beloved brothers.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Every good gift-bestowed and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of-[the] lights, beside whom there-is not (a) variation or shadow of-turning.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Having-willed, he-gave-birth-to us by-(the)-word of-truth unto [the] our being a first-fruits of-the creations of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Know, my brothers beloved:  let-every man be swift unto the listening, slow unto the speaking, slow unto wrath.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For man’s wrath does┘not└produce (the) righteousness of-God.   <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Wherefore putting-aside all filthiness and overflow of-evil, in humility receive the implanted word [the] able to-save the souls of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And become doers of-(the)-word and not just hearers, deceiving yourselves; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>because if somebody is (a) hearer of-(the)-word and not (a) doer, this-one is-like (a) man looking-at the face of-the-nature of-him in (a) mirror, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>for he-looked-at himself and, having-gone-away, he┘also└forgets immediately what-kind-of-(man) he-is.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But the-one having-looked-intently into (the) perfect law [the] of-[the] liberty and having-abided, not (as a) hearer having-become (a) hearer of-forgetfulness, but (a) doer of-work, this-one will-be blessed in the doing of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If anybody seems to-be religious, not holding┘(the) tongue of-him└in-check, but deceives his-own heart, the religion of-this-(man) (is) empty.  <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>This is pure and undefiled religion with the God and Father:  to-visit/visiting (the) fatherless and widows in the affliction of-them, (and) to-keep/keeping himself unstained by the world.</span>
