## James Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> James, servant of-God and (the) Lord Jesus Christ, to-the twelve tribes [the] in the Diaspora.  Greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Consider (it) all joy, my brothers, when you-encounter all-kinds-of trials, 3knowing that the testing of-the faith of-you produces patience.  4And let┘[the] patience└have (its) complete effect, in-order-that you-may-be complete and sound, lacking in nothing.  5Now if anybody of-you lacks wisdom, let-him-ask from God, the-One giving to-all generously and not reproaching, and it-will-be-given to-him.  6And let-him-ask in faith, doubting nothing, for the/a doubter is-like waves of-(the)-sea, driven-by-the wind and tossed-around, 7for let┘not [the] that man└suppose that he-will-receive anything from the Lord, 8(a) double-minded man, unstable in all the ways of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And let┘the humble [the] brother└take-pride in the exalted-state of-him, 10and (let) the rich (glory) in the humiliation of-him; because like (the) flower of-(the)-grass, it/he will-pass-away.  11For the sun rises with the scorching-wind and withers the grass, and the flower of-it fell/falls, and the loveliness of-the face of-it perished/perishes; thus also the rich-(man) will-fade-away in the pursuits of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Blessed (is) (the) man who perseveres under trial, because having-become approved he-will-receive the crown of-[the] life, which he-promised to-the-ones loving him.  13Let┘nobody└say, being-tempted/tried, [that], "I-am-being-tempted/tried by God."  For [the] God is not-tempted by-evil-things, and he tempts nobody.  14And each-one is-tempted, carried-away and lured by [the] his-own lusts/desires.  15Then [the] lust, having-conceived, bears sin, and [the] sin, having-been-full-grown, breeds death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Do┘not└be-deceived, my beloved brothers.  17Every good gift-bestowed and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of-[the] lights, beside whom there-is not (a) variation or shadow of-turning.  18Having-willed, he-gave-birth-to us by-(the)-word of-truth unto [the] our being a first-fruits of-the creations of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Know, my brothers beloved:  let-every man be swift unto the listening, slow unto the speaking, slow unto wrath.  20For man's wrath does┘not└produce (the) righteousness of-God.   21Wherefore putting-aside all filthiness and overflow of-evil, in humility receive the implanted word [the] able to-save the souls of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And become doers of-(the)-word and not just hearers, deceiving yourselves; 23because if somebody is (a) hearer of-(the)-word and not (a) doer, this-one is-like (a) man looking-at the face of-the-nature of-him in (a) mirror, 24for he-looked-at himself and, having-gone-away, he┘also└forgets immediately what-kind-of-(man) he-is.  25But the-one having-looked-intently into (the) perfect law [the] of-[the] liberty and having-abided, not (as a) hearer having-become (a) hearer of-forgetfulness, but (a) doer of-work, this-one will-be blessed in the doing of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> If anybody seems to-be religious, not holding┘(the) tongue of-him└in-check, but deceives his-own heart, the religion of-this-(man) (is) empty.  27This is pure and undefiled religion with the God and Father:  to-visit/visiting (the) fatherless and widows in the affliction of-them, (and) to-keep/keeping himself unstained by the world.</span>
