## Matthew Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came-to [the] Jesus, saying, 2"On-account-of what do┘the disciples of-you└transgress the tradition of-the elders? For they-do┘not└wash the hands [of-them]ms when they-eat bread?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, "On-account-of what do┘you└transgress the commandment of-[the] God on-account-of the traditions of-you? 4For [the] God said, 'Honor the/your father and the/your mother,' and 'The-one cursing father or mother—let-him-die death/surely die.' 5But you say, 'Whoever2 says to-the/his father or the/his mother, "(It-is) (a) gift, whatever2 you-would-have benefited from me,'" 6he-will┘certainly not└be-honoring the father of-him. And you-set-aside the word of-[the] God on-account-of the tradition of-you. 7Hypocrites! Well did┘Isaiah└prophesy about you, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And summoning the crowd, he-said to-them, "Listen and understand. 11Not the-thing entering into the/his mouth defiles the/a man, but the-thing coming-out of the/his mouth—this defiles the/a man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the disciples having-come-to-(him), say to-him, "Do-you-know the Pharisees, having-heard the/your word, were-offended?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said, "Every plant that the heavenly [the] Father of-me did┘not└plant will-be-uprooted. 14Let┘them└alone. They-are blind leaders [of-blind-ones]ms. And if (a) blind man leads (a) blind (man), both will-fall into the ditch."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Peter, having-answered, said to-him, "Explain the [this]ms illustration to-us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the/he said, "Youpl also still are without-understanding? 17Do-you┘not└know that everything [the] entering into the mouth goes into the stomach and is-cast-out into (the) latrine? 18But the-things coming-out from the mouth comes out-of the heart, and-those-things defile the/a man. 19For out-of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual-immoralties, thefts, lyings, insults. 20These-things (are) the-things defiling the/a man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-gone-out from-there, departed into the parts of-Tyre and Sidon. 22And behold (a) Canaanite woman from [the] those regions, having-come-out, was-shouting, saying, "Have-mercy-on me, Lord, Son of-David. The daughter of-me is┘badly└demon-possessed." 23And the/he did┘not└answer her (a) word. And the disciples of-him, having-come-to (him), started-asking him, saying, "Send┘her└away, because she-keeps-shouting after us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But the/he, having-answered, said, "I-was┘not└sent except2 to the lost [the] sheep of-(the)-house of-Israel."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the/she, having-come, was-kneeling to-him, saying, "Lord, help me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said, "It-is not good to-take the bread of-the children and to-throw (it) to the house-dogs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And the/she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the house-dogs eat from the crumbs [the-ones] falling from the table of-the lords of-them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to-her, "O woman, the faith of-you (is) great. Let-it-be to-you as you-desire." And the daughter of-her was-healed from [the] that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And having-departed from-there [the] Jesus went to-beside the Sea of-[the] Galilee, and having-gone-up onto the/a mountain, he-sat-down there. 30And the many crowd[s] came-to him, having-with them lame, blind, disabled, mute, and many others, and put them at the feet of-him, and he-healed them; 31so-that the crowd was-amazed seeing mutes talking, disabled-ones healthy, and lame walking and blind seeing; and they-glorified the God of-Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-called the disciples of-him, he-said, "I-have-compassion on the crowd, because already they-are remaining-with me for three days, and they-do┘not└have what they-may eat. And to-dismiss them hungry I-do┘not└desire lest they-give-out on the road."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the disciples say to-him, "Whence to-us in (an) unpopulated-place so-many loaves so-as to-satisfy such (a) crowd?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-them, "How many loaves do-you-have?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And having-directed the crowd to-sit-down on the ground, 36he-took the seven loaves and the fish and, having-blessed (them), he-broke (them) and started-giving (them) to-the disciples, and the disciples (were giving) (them) to-the crowd[s]. 37And all ate and were-satisfied. And the leftover of-the pieces they-picked-up seven baskets full. 38And the-ones eating were four-thousand men without women and little-children. 39And having-dismissed the crowds, he-got in the/a boat and went to the regions of-Magadan.</span>
