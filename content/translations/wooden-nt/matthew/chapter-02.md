<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And [the] Jesus having-been-born in Bethlehem of-[the] Judaea in (the) days of-Herod the king, behold, mage from (the) East arrived in Jerusalem, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Where is the-one having-been-born king of-the Jews?</em><em> </em><em>For we-saw the star of-him in the East and we-came to-worship him.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-heard, Herod the king was-troubled and all Jerusalem with him; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and having-assembled all the chief-priests and scribes of-the people, he-inquired from them where the Messiah would-be-born. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the/they said to-him, <em>“In Bethlehem of-[the] Judaea, for thus it-is-written</em><em> through the prophet, </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong><em>‘A</em></strong><strong><em>nd you, Bethlehem,</em></strong> <em>land of-Judah</em><em>,</em> <em>by-no-means</em> <strong><em>are-you least among the gov</em></strong><strong><em>ernors of-</em></strong><strong><em>Judah;</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	for </em></strong><strong><em>out-of</em></strong><strong><em> you (a) governor will-come,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	who will-shepherd the people of-me [the] Israel.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> 'And you, Bethlehem, land of-Judah, by-no-means are-you least among the governors of-Judah; for out-of you (a) governor will-come, who will-shepherd the people of-me [the] Israel.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then Herod, secretly having-called the magi, determined from them the time of-the appearing star; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and having-sent them to Bethlehem, he-said, <em>“Having-gone, search diligently concerning the child.</em><em> </em><em>And when you-find (him), report to-me in-order-that I-also, having-come, may-worship him.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the/they, having-heard the king, traveled and behold the star that they-saw in the East, started-going-ahead-of them until, having-come, it-stood above where the little-child was. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And having-seen the star, they-were-rejoiced (an) exceedingly great joy. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-gone in the house, they-saw the little-child with Mary the mother of-him; and having-fallen down, they-worshiped him; and having-opened the treasures of-them, they-offered him gifts—gold and frankincense and myrrh. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And having-been-warned according-to (a) dream not to-go-back to Herod, through another route they-left for the country of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And they having-departed, behold, (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appears according-to (a) dream to-[the] Joseph, saying, <em>“Having-arisen, take the little-child and the mother of-him and flee into Egypt and be there until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-speak to-you, for Herod will try [the] to-kill him.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And the/he, having-arisen, took the little-child and the mother of-him during-(the)-night and departed into Egypt; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and he-was there until the death of-Herod in-order-that the-thing spoken by (the) Lord through the prophet might-be-fulfilled, saying, 	<strong><em>“Out of-Egypt I-called the son of-me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Herod, seeing that he-was-tricked by the magi, was-furious exceedingly; and having-sent to-kill all the children [the] in Bethlehem and in all the regions of-it from two-years-(old) and below, according-to the time that he-ascertained from the magi. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then the-thing- spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <strong><em>“(A) voice in Ramah was-heard,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	weeping and great </em></strong><strong><em>mourning;</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Rachel weeping-for the children of-her,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and </em></strong><strong><em>she-did┘not└want</em></strong><strong><em> to-be</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	comforted, because they are not.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Herod having-died, behold (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appears according-to (a) dream to-[the] Joseph in Egypt, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Having-arisen, take the little-child and the mother of-him and go into (the) land of-Israel, for the-ones seeking the life of-the little-child have-died.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-arise, took the little-child and the mother of-him and entered into (the) land of-Israel. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And having-heard that Archelaus is/was-ruling [the] Judaea in-place-of the father of-him Herod, he-was-afraid to-go-away there. And having-been-warned according-to (a) dream, he-departed into the parts of-Galilee. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And having-come, he-settled-down in (a) town called Nazareth in-order-that the-thing having-been-spoken through the prophets might-be-fulfilled that he-will-be-called (a) Nazarene.</span>
