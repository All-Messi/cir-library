## Matthew Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And [the] Jesus having-been-born in Bethlehem of-[the] Judaea in (the) days of-Herod the king, behold, mage from (the) East arrived in Jerusalem, 2saying, "Where is the-one having-been-born king of-the Jews? For we-saw the star of-him in the East and we-came to-worship him." 3And having-heard, Herod the king was-troubled and all Jerusalem with him; 4and having-assembled all the chief-priests and scribes of-the people, he-inquired from them where the Messiah would-be-born. 5And the/they said to-him, "In Bethlehem of-[the] Judaea, for thus it-is-written through the prophet,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then Herod, secretly having-called the magi, determined from them the time of-the appearing star; 8and having-sent them to Bethlehem, he-said, "Having-gone, search diligently concerning the child. And when you-find (him), report to-me in-order-that I-also, having-come, may-worship him." 9And the/they, having-heard the king, traveled and behold the star that they-saw in the East, started-going-ahead-of them until, having-come, it-stood above where the little-child was. 10And having-seen the star, they-were-rejoiced (an) exceedingly great joy. 11And having-gone in the house, they-saw the little-child with Mary the mother of-him; and having-fallen down, they-worshiped him; and having-opened the treasures of-them, they-offered him gifts—gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12And having-been-warned according-to (a) dream not to-go-back to Herod, through another route they-left for the country of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And they having-departed, behold, (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appears according-to (a) dream to-[the] Joseph, saying, "Having-arisen, take the little-child and the mother of-him and flee into Egypt and be there until2 I-speak to-you, for Herod will try [the] to-kill him." 14And the/he, having-arisen, took the little-child and the mother of-him during-(the)-night and departed into Egypt; 15and he-was there until the death of-Herod in-order-that the-thing spoken by (the) Lord through the prophet might-be-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Herod, seeing that he-was-tricked by the magi, was-furious exceedingly; and having-sent to-kill all the children [the] in Bethlehem and in all the regions of-it from two-years-(old) and below, according-to the time that he-ascertained from the magi. 17Then the-thing- spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Herod having-died, behold (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appears according-to (a) dream to-[the] Joseph in Egypt, 20saying, "Having-arisen, take the little-child and the mother of-him and go into (the) land of-Israel, for the-ones seeking the life of-the little-child have-died."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-arise, took the little-child and the mother of-him and entered into (the) land of-Israel. 22And having-heard that Archelaus is/was-ruling [the] Judaea in-place-of the father of-him Herod, he-was-afraid to-go-away there. And having-been-warned according-to (a) dream, he-departed into the parts of-Galilee. 23And having-come, he-settled-down in (a) town called Nazareth in-order-that the-thing having-been-spoken through the prophets might-be-fulfilled that he-will-be-called (a) Nazarene.</span>
