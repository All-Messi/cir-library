## Matthew Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened when [the] Jesus finished [the] these words, he-departed from [the] Galilee and he-came into the mountains of-[the] Judaea beyond the Jordan. 2And many crowd[s] followed him and he-healed them there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And Pharisees came-to him, trying him and saying [whether], "Is-it lawful for-(a)-man to-divorce the wife of-him for every reason?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said, "Did-you┘not└read that the-One having-created (them), from (the) beginning 'made them male and female'? 5and said, 'For-the-sake-of this (a) man will-leave the/his father and the/his mother and unite-with the wife of-him, and the two will-become [for] one flesh; 6so-that they-are no-longer two but one flesh. What then [the] God joined-together let┘not man└separate."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They-say to-him, "Why then did┘Moses└command 'to-give (a) certificate of-divorce and divorce [her]ms'?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He-says to-them [that], "Moses allowed you to-divorce the wives of-you for the hardheartedness of-you, but from (the) beginning it-has been thus. 9And I-say to-you that whoever2 divorces the wife of-him not for sexual-immorality and marries another commits adultery."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The disciples [of-him]ms say to-him, "If thus is the matter of-the/a man and with the/a woman, not to-marry is better."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the/he said to-them, "Not all have-room-for [the] this word, but for-whom it-has-been-given. 12For there-are eunuchs that have-been-born that-way from (the) womb of-(the)-mother (of them), and there-are eunuchs who were-made-eunuchs by [the] men, and there-are eunuchs who made┘themselves└eunuchs on-account-of the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]. The-one able to-accept (it), let-him-accept (it)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then little-children were-brought-to him in-order-that he-might-lay┘the/his hands└on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14But [the] Jesus say, "Let the little-children to-come to me and do┘not└prevent them, for the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] is of-[the] such." 15And having-laid┘the/his hands└on them, he-went from-there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And behold one, having-come-to him, said, "Teacher, what good-thing shall-I-do i-order-that I-may-inherit eternal life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the/he said to-him, "Why are-you-asking me about the good-thing? One is [the] good. But if you-want to-enter into [the] life, keep the commandments."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He-says to-him, "Which-ones?" And [the] Jesus said to-him, "'[The] you-shall┘not└murder, you-shall┘not└steal, you-shall┘not└lie, honor [the] father and [the] mother,' and 'Love the neighbor of-you as yourself.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The young-man says to-him, "I-kept all these-things. What do-I┘still└lack?" 21[The] Jesus said to-him, "If you-want to-be perfect, go sell the possessions of-you and give (them) to-[the]ms poor, and you-will-have treasure in heaven[s], and come follow me." 22And the young-man, having-heard the word, went-away distressed, for he-was having many possessions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-the disciples of-him, "Truly I-say to-you that with-difficulty (a) rich-(man) will-enter into the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]. 24Again I-say to-you, it-is easier for-(a)-camel to-go through (the) eye of-(a)-needle, than for-(a)-rich-(man) to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And having-heard (it) the disciples were┘exceedingly└astonished, saying, "Who then is-able to-be-saved?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-looked-on (them), said to-them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all-things (are) possible."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The [the] Peter, having-answered, said to-him, "Behold we-left all-things and followed you. What then will-be to-us?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "Truly I-say to-you that you the-ones having-followed men, in the regeneration when the son of-[the] Man sits on (the) throne of-(the)-glory of-him, you-will-sit—even you—on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of-[the] Israel. 29And everybody who left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for-the-sake-of the name of-me will-receive (a) hundredfold and will-inherit eternal life. 30And many first will-be last and (many) last (will-be) first."</span>
