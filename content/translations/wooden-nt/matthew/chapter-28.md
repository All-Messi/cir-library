## Matthew Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After the Sabbath[s], at-the dawning toward (day) one of the Sabbath[s]. Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to-see the grave. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And behold (a) great earthquake happened, for (an) angel of (the) Lord, having-descended from heaven and having-come-to (it), rolled┘the stone└away and sat-down on it. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the sight of-him was like lightning and the garment of-him (was) white like snow. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And from the fear of-him, the-ones keeping watch shook and became like dead-(men). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the angel, having-answered said to the women, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not</em><em> </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>└</em><em>be-afraid</em><em>, for I-know that you-are-seeking Jesu</em><em>s the-One crucified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He-is not</em><em> here, for he-arose even-as he-said.</em><em> </em><em>Come, see the plac</em><em>e where he-was-l</em><em>ying.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>And quickly having-gone, say to-the disciples of-him [that], ‘He-arose from the dead-(ones), and behold, he-goes-ahead-of you into the Galilee.</em><em> </em><em>You-will-see him there.’</em><em> </em><em>Behold, I-told you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-gone-away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they-ran to-report to-the disciples of-him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, <em>“Hello.”</em> And the-ones going took-hold-of the feet of-him and worshiped/prostrated-to him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not└fear</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Go report to-the brothers of-me [in-order]-that they-go-away into [the] Galilee, and-there they-will-see me.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And they going, behold some of-the guard, having-gone into the city, reported to-the chief-priests all the things-having-happened. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And having-gathered-together with the elders and having-taken counsel, they-gave significant silver-shekels/a large amount of money to-the soldiers, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Say [that], ‘The disciples of-him during (the) night, having-come, stole him, we sleeping.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And if this-thing is-heard by the governor, </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> will-persuade [him]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>,</em><em> and will-make you without-worry.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the/they, having-taken the silver-shekels/the money, did as they-were-taught. And [the] this word was-spread with (the) Jews until the [day]<sup>ms</sup> today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the eleven went into the Galilee into the mountain where [the] Jesus designated. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And having-seen him, they-worshiped (him), but the/they/some doubted. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus, having-come-to (them), said to-them, saying, <em>“All power/authority was-given to-me in heaven and on [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> earth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>So having-gone, </em><em>make-disciples-of/disciple</em><em> all the nations, baptizing them into the name of-t</em><em>he Father and the S</em><em>on and the Holy Spirit, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>teaching them to-keep all-things as-many-as I-commanded you, and behold I-am with you </em><em>all the days/always</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em> unto the end of the age/world.</em><em>”</em> Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
