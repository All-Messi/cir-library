## Matthew Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After the Sabbath[s], at-the dawning toward (day) one of the Sabbath[s]. Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to-see the grave. 2And behold (a) great earthquake happened, for (an) angel of (the) Lord, having-descended from heaven and having-come-to (it), rolled┘the stone└away and sat-down on it. 3And the sight of-him was like lightning and the garment of-him (was) white like snow. 4And from the fear of-him, the-ones keeping watch shook and became like dead-(men). 5And the angel, having-answered said to the women, "Do┘not you└be-afraid, for I-know that you-are-seeking Jesus the-One crucified. 6He-is not here, for he-arose even-as he-said. Come, see the place where he-was-lying. 7And quickly having-gone, say to-the disciples of-him [that], 'He-arose from the dead-(ones), and behold, he-goes-ahead-of you into the Galilee. You-will-see him there.' Behold, I-told you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-gone-away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they-ran to-report to-the disciples of-him. 9And behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Hello." And the-ones going took-hold-of the feet of-him and worshiped/prostrated-to him. 10Then [the] Jesus says to-them, "Do┘not└fear. Go report to-the brothers of-me [in-order]-that they-go-away into [the] Galilee, and-there they-will-see me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And they going, behold some of-the guard, having-gone into the city, reported to-the chief-priests all the things-having-happened. 12And having-gathered-together with the elders and having-taken counsel, they-gave significant silver-shekels/a large amount of money to-the soldiers, 13saying, "Say [that], 'The disciples of-him during (the) night, having-come, stole him, we sleeping.' 14And if this-thing is-heard by the governor, we will-persuade [him]ms, and will-make you without-worry." 15And the/they, having-taken the silver-shekels/the money, did as they-were-taught. And [the] this word was-spread with (the) Jews until the [day]ms today.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the eleven went into the Galilee into the mountain where [the] Jesus designated. 17And having-seen him, they-worshiped (him), but the/they/some doubted. 18And [the] Jesus, having-come-to (them), said to-them, saying, "All power/authority was-given to-me in heaven and on [the]ms earth. 19So having-gone, make-disciples-of/disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of-the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 20teaching them to-keep all-things as-many-as I-commanded you, and behold I-am with you all the days/always3 unto the end of the age/world."</span>
