## Matthew Chapter **26**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And it-happened when [the] Jesus finished all [the] these words (that) he-said to-the disciples of-him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>You-know that after two days comes th</em><em>e Passover, and the S</em><em>on of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an is delivered unto [the] being-crucified.”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then the chief-priests and the elders of-the people gathered-together in the court of-the high-priest the-one called Caiaphas, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and they-plotted in-order-that they-might-arrest [the] Jesus by-stealth and put┘(him)└to-death. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And they-were-saying, <em>“Not in the feast, in-order-that (a) riot not arise among the people.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus arriving in Bethany in (the) house of-Simon the leper, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>(a) woman having (an) alabaster-cruise of very-expensive ointment came-to him, and began-to-pour (it) on the head of-him, sitting<sup>mas</sup>. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the disciples, having-seen (it), were-indignant, saying, <em>“Unto what (was) [the] this waste?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>For this was-able to-be-sold of-much and to-be-given to-the poor.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-known, said to-them, <em>“Why are-you-causing </em><em>trouble</em><em> for-the woman?</em><em> </em><em>For she-worked (a) good work on me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>For you┘</em><em> always</em><em>└have the poor with you,</em><em> but you-do┘not always└have me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>For this-one, having-put [the] this ointment on the body of-me, did (it) for [the] burying me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Truly I-tell you, wherever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> </em><em>[the] this</em><em> good-news is-preached in the whole world, what this-one did will┘also└be-told as (a) memorial of-her.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then one of-the twelve, the-one called Judas Iscariot, having-gone to the chief-priests, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>said, <em>“</em><em>What </em><em>a</em><em>re-you-willing to-give me, and-I will-deliver him to-you?</em><em>”</em><em> </em>And the/they put to-him thirty silver-coins. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And from then he-began-to-look-for (an) opportunity in-order-that he-might-betray him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now on-the first day of-[the] unleavened (bread), the disciples came-to [the] Jesus, saying, <em>“Where do-you-want (that) we-prepare for-you to-eat the Passover?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And the/he said, <em>“Go into the city to [the] such-and-such</em><em>,</em><em> and say to-him, ‘The teacher says, “The time of-me is near.</em><em> </em><em>With you I-am-doing the Passover with the disciples of-me.”’</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>And the disciples did as [the] Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And evening having-come, he-reclined-at-table with the twelve. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And they eating, he-said, <em>“Truly I-tell you that one of you will-betray me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And being┘exceedingly└grieved, each one began to-say to-him, <em>“I am not┘ (the one</em><em>),└</em><em>am-I, Lord?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And the/he, having-answered, said, <em>“The-one having-dipped the hand with me in the bowl—this-one will-betray me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an goes even-as it-is-written about him, but woe to-</em><em>[the] that</em><em> man through whom the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an is-betrayed.</em><em> </em><em>It-would-have-been good/better for-him if </em><em>[the] that</em><em> man had been-born.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>And having-answered, Judas, the-one betraying him, said, <em>“I am not</em><em>┘(</em><em>the one</em><em>),└</em><em>am-I, Rabbi?”</em> He-says to-him, <em>“You-said/Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And they eating, having-taken (a) loaf and having-blessed (it), [the] Jesus broke (it) and, having-given (it) to-the disciples of-him, said, <em>“Take, eat; this is the body of-me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And having-taken (a) cup and having-blessed (it), he-gave (it) to-them, saying, <em>“All drink out-of (it), </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>for this is the blood of-me of-the covenant [the] being-poured-out for (the) forgiveness of-sins.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>And I-say to-you, I-will┘certainly not└drink</em><em> from now-on from this [the] frui</em><em>t of-the vine until [the] that day when I-drink it with you new in the kingdom of-the Father of-me.”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And having-sung, they-went-out to the Mount of-[the] Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“You all will-be-offended in me in [the] this night, for it-is-written</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘I</em></strong><strong><em>-will-strike-down the shep</em></strong><strong><em>herd,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd the </em></strong><strong><em>sheep of-the shepherd </em></strong><strong><em>thorough</em></strong><strong><em>ly-scattered</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup><em>And after </em><em>[the] my</em><em> having-resurrected, I-will-go-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>And having-answered, [the] Peter said to-him, <em>“If all will-be-offended in you, </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> will┘never└be-offended.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>[The] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Truly I-tell you that in this [the] night before (a) rooster crows you-will-deny me three-times.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>[The] Peter says to-him, <em>“Even-if it-is-necessary for-me to-die with you, I-will┘certainly not└deny you.”</em><em> </em> Likewise also all the disciples said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus comes with them to (a) plot called Gethsemane, and he-says to-the disciples,<em> “Sit here until-[when], having-gone-away there, I-pray.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And taking-along [the] Peter and the two sons of-Zebedee, he-began to-be-grieved and to-be-distressed. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Then he-says to-them, <em>“The soul of-me is </em><em>exceedingly-grieved</em><em> to death.</em><em> </em><em>Stay here and watch with me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>And having-gone-forward (a) little, he-fell on (the) face of-him, praying and saying, <em>“Father of-me, if it-is possible, let┘[the] this cup└depart from me.</em><em> </em><em>Nevertheless</em><em> not as </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> want but as </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> (want).</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>And he-comes to the disciples and he-finds them sleeping, and says to [the] Peter, <em>“Are-you</em><em>┘thus not└</em><em>strong-enough to-</em><em>watch for-one-hour with me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Watch and pray in-order-that you┘</em><em>not</em><em>└</em><em>enter into</em><em> temptation/trial.</em><em> </em><em>The spirit</em><em> (is) willing, but the flesh (is) weak.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>Again [of] (a) second (time), having-gone-away, he-prayed, saying, <em>“Father of-me, if it-is┘not└able to-pass-away unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-d</em><em>rink it, let┘the will of-you└becom</em><em>e.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>And going again, he-found them sleeping, for the eyes of-them were weighed-down. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And having-left them again, having-gone-away, he-prayed [of] (a) third (time) the same word, having-said again. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Then he-comes to the disciples and he-says to-them, <em>“Sleep </em><em>[the] for</em><em> (the) rest (of-the-time) and rest.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the hour is-near and the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an is-being-delivered into (the) hands of-sinners.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>Get-up; let-us-go.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the-one betraying me is-near.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And yet he speaking, behold Judas, one of-the twelve, came and (a) great crowd with him with swords and clubs from the chief-priests and elders of-the people. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>Now the-one betraying him gave them (a) sign, <em>“Whomever I-kiss—it-is-he; arrest him.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>And immediately having-come-to [the] Jesus, he-said, <em>“Hello, Rabbi”</em>; and he-kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Friend, (do) unto/for what you-are-present.”</em> Then having-come, they-laid [the] hands on [the] Jesus and arrested him. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And behold, one of-the-ones with Jesus, having-reached-out the hand, drew the sword of-him and, having-struck the servant of-the high-priest, cut-off the ear of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus says to-him<em>, “Return the sword of-you into the place of-it, for all the-ones having-taken (a) sword will-perish by (a) sword.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>Or, do-you-suppose that I-am┘not└able to-appeal-to the Father of-me, and he-will-provide for-me now more than-twelve legions of-angels?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>54</sup></strong><em>Then how will┘the scriptures└be-fulfilled that thus it-is-necessary to-be?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup>In that [the] hour [the] Jesus said to-the crowd[s], <em>“As against (an) insurrectionist you-came-out with swords and clubs to-arrest me?</em><em> </em><em>According-to (the) day/Daily</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> in the temple I-was-sitting, teaching and you-did</em><em>┘not└</em><em>arrest me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>56</sup></strong><em>And this whole-thing has-taken-place in-order-that</em><em> the scriptures of-the prophets</em><em> might-be-fulfilled.</em><em>”</em> Then all the disciples, having-left him, fled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the-ones having-arrested [the] Jesus brought (him) to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and the elders gathered-together. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And [the] Peter was-following him from afar to the courtyard of-the high-priest and having-entered inside, he-sat-down with the officers to-see the end. <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>And the chief-priests and the whole Sanhedrin were-seeking false-witness against [the] Jesus in-order-that they-might-put┘him└to death, <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>and they-did┘not└find (any), many false-witnesses having-come. And afterwards, two having-come, <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>said, <em>“This-one said, ‘I-am-able to-tear-down the temple of-[the] God and to-build (it) through three days.’”</em> <strong><sup>62</sup></strong>And having-stood-up, the high-priest said to-him, <em>“You-are-answering nothing what these are-testifying-against you?</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>63</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus kept-silent. And the high-priest said to-him, <em>‘I-adjure you according-to</em><em> the living [the] God in-order-</em><em>that you-tell us whether you are the Messiah</em><em>,</em><em> the Son of-[the] God.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>64</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“You said/Yes.</em><em> </em><em>Except I-tell-you</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>From now you-will-see ‘</em><strong><em>the Son of-[the] </em></strong><strong><em>M</em></strong><strong><em>an,</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>sitting on (the) right[s] of-the Power,’</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and </em><strong><em>‘coming on the clouds of-[the] sky.’</em></strong><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup>Then the high-priest tore the clothes of-him, saying, <em>“He-blasphemed</em>. <em>Why do-we┘yet└have need of-witnesses?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>66</sup></strong><em>What does-it-seem to-you?”</em><em> </em> And the/they, having-answered, said, <em>“He-is worthy of-death.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v67"><sup><strong>67</strong></sup>Then they-spit in the face of-him and hit┘him└with-their-fists; and the/they slapped (him), <strong><sup>68</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Prophesy to-us, Messiah;</em><em> who is the-one having-struck you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] Peter was-sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant-girl came-to him, saying,<em> “You also were with Jesus the Galilee.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup><strong>70</strong></sup>And the/he denied before all, saying, <em>“I-do┘not└know what you-are-saying.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup>Having<sup>mas</sup>-gone-out into the gateway another<sup>fem</sup> saw him and says to-the-ones there, <em>“This-one was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><sup><strong>72</strong></sup>Again he-denied with (an) oath [that], <em>“I-do┘not└know the man.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v73"><sup><strong>73</strong></sup>After (a) little-(while) having-gone-to (him), the-ones standing (there) said to-[the] Peter, <em>“Truly you are one of-them, for even the speech of-you </em><em>makes</em><em> you evident.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v74"><sup><strong>74</strong></sup>Then he-began to-curse and swear [that], <em>“I-do┘not└know the man.”</em><em> </em> And immediately (a) rooster crowed. <strong><sup>75</sup></strong>And [the] Peter remembered the word Jesus having-spoken [that], <em>“Before (a) rooster c</em><em>rows you-will-deny me three-time</em><em>s.</em><em> </em>And having-gone outside, he-cried bitterly.</span>
