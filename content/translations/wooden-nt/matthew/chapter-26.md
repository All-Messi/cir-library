## Matthew Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened when [the] Jesus finished all [the] these words (that) he-said to-the disciples of-him. 2"You-know that after two days comes the Passover, and the Son of-[the] Man is delivered unto [the] being-crucified." 3Then the chief-priests and the elders of-the people gathered-together in the court of-the high-priest the-one called Caiaphas, 4and they-plotted in-order-that they-might-arrest [the] Jesus by-stealth and put┘(him)└to-death. 5And they-were-saying, "Not in the feast, in-order-that (a) riot not arise among the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And [the] Jesus arriving in Bethany in (the) house of-Simon the leper, 7(a) woman having (an) alabaster-cruise of very-expensive ointment came-to him, and began-to-pour (it) on the head of-him, sittingmas. 8And the disciples, having-seen (it), were-indignant, saying, "Unto what (was) [the] this waste? 9For this was-able to-be-sold of-much and to-be-given to-the poor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-known, said to-them, "Why are-you-causing trouble for-the woman? For she-worked (a) good work on me. 11For you┘ always└have the poor with you, but you-do┘not always└have me. 12For this-one, having-put [the] this ointment on the body of-me, did (it) for [the] burying me. 13Truly I-tell you, wherever2 [the] this good-news is-preached in the whole world, what this-one did will┘also└be-told as (a) memorial of-her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then one of-the twelve, the-one called Judas Iscariot, having-gone to the chief-priests, 15said, "What are-you-willing to-give me, and-I will-deliver him to-you?" And the/they put to-him thirty silver-coins. 16And from then he-began-to-look-for (an) opportunity in-order-that he-might-betray him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Now on-the first day of-[the] unleavened (bread), the disciples came-to [the] Jesus, saying, "Where do-you-want (that) we-prepare for-you to-eat the Passover?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And the/he said, "Go into the city to [the] such-and-such, and say to-him, 'The teacher says, "The time of-me is near. With you I-am-doing the Passover with the disciples of-me."'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the disciples did as [the] Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And evening having-come, he-reclined-at-table with the twelve. 21And they eating, he-said, "Truly I-tell you that one of you will-betray me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And being┘exceedingly└grieved, each one began to-say to-him, "I am not┘ (the one),└am-I, Lord?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said, "The-one having-dipped the hand with me in the bowl—this-one will-betray me. 24The Son of-[the] Man goes even-as it-is-written about him, but woe to-[the] that man through whom the Son of-[the] Man is-betrayed. It-would-have-been good/better for-him if [the] that man had been-born."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And having-answered, Judas, the-one betraying him, said, "I am not┘(the one),└am-I, Rabbi?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they eating, having-taken (a) loaf and having-blessed (it), [the] Jesus broke (it) and, having-given (it) to-the disciples of-him, said, "Take, eat; this is the body of-me." 27And having-taken (a) cup and having-blessed (it), he-gave (it) to-them, saying, "All drink out-of (it), 28for this is the blood of-me of-the covenant [the] being-poured-out for (the) forgiveness of-sins. 29And I-say to-you, I-will┘certainly not└drink from now-on from this [the] fruit of-the vine until [the] that day when I-drink it with you new in the kingdom of-the Father of-me." 30And having-sung, they-went-out to the Mount of-[the] Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then [the] Jesus says to-them, "You all will-be-offended in me in [the] this night, for it-is-written</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And after [the] my having-resurrected, I-will-go-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And having-answered, [the] Peter said to-him, "If all will-be-offended in you, I will┘never└be-offended." 34[The] Jesus said to-him, "Truly I-tell you that in this [the] night before (a) rooster crows you-will-deny me three-times." 35[The] Peter says to-him, "Even-if it-is-necessary for-me to-die with you, I-will┘certainly not└deny you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Then [the] Jesus comes with them to (a) plot called Gethsemane, and he-says to-the disciples, "Sit here until-[when], having-gone-away there, I-pray." 37And taking-along [the] Peter and the two sons of-Zebedee, he-began to-be-grieved and to-be-distressed. 38Then he-says to-them, "The soul of-me is exceedingly-grieved to death. Stay here and watch with me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And having-gone-forward (a) little, he-fell on (the) face of-him, praying and saying, "Father of-me, if it-is possible, let┘[the] this cup└depart from me. Nevertheless not as I want but as you (want)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And he-comes to the disciples and he-finds them sleeping, and says to [the] Peter, "Are-you┘thus not└strong-enough to-watch for-one-hour with me? 41Watch and pray in-order-that you┘not└enter into temptation/trial. The spirit (is) willing, but the flesh (is) weak."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Again [of] (a) second (time), having-gone-away, he-prayed, saying, "Father of-me, if it-is┘not└able to-pass-away unless2 I-drink it, let┘the will of-you└become."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And going again, he-found them sleeping, for the eyes of-them were weighed-down. 44And having-left them again, having-gone-away, he-prayed [of] (a) third (time) the same word, having-said again. 45Then he-comes to the disciples and he-says to-them, "Sleep [the] for (the) rest (of-the-time) and rest. Behold, the hour is-near and the Son of-[the] Man is-being-delivered into (the) hands of-sinners. 46Get-up; let-us-go. Behold, the-one betraying me is-near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> And yet he speaking, behold Judas, one of-the twelve, came and (a) great crowd with him with swords and clubs from the chief-priests and elders of-the people. 48Now the-one betraying him gave them (a) sign, "Whomever I-kiss—it-is-he; arrest him." 49And immediately having-come-to [the] Jesus, he-said, "Hello, Rabbi"; and he-kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-him, "Friend, (do) unto/for what you-are-present." Then having-come, they-laid [the] hands on [the] Jesus and arrested him. 51And behold, one of-the-ones with Jesus, having-reached-out the hand, drew the sword of-him and, having-struck the servant of-the high-priest, cut-off the ear of-him. 52Then [the] Jesus says to-him, "Return the sword of-you into the place of-it, for all the-ones having-taken (a) sword will-perish by (a) sword. 53Or, do-you-suppose that I-am┘not└able to-appeal-to the Father of-me, and he-will-provide for-me now more than-twelve legions of-angels? 54Then how will┘the scriptures└be-fulfilled that thus it-is-necessary to-be?" 55In that [the] hour [the] Jesus said to-the crowd[s], "As against (an) insurrectionist you-came-out with swords and clubs to-arrest me? According-to (the) day/Daily2 in the temple I-was-sitting, teaching and you-did┘not└arrest me. 56And this whole-thing has-taken-place in-order-that the scriptures of-the prophets might-be-fulfilled." 57And the-ones having-arrested [the] Jesus brought (him) to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and the elders gathered-together. 58And [the] Peter was-following him from afar to the courtyard of-the high-priest and having-entered inside, he-sat-down with the officers to-see the end. 59And the chief-priests and the whole Sanhedrin were-seeking false-witness against [the] Jesus in-order-that they-might-put┘him└to death, 60and they-did┘not└find (any), many false-witnesses having-come. And afterwards, two having-come, 61said, "This-one said, 'I-am-able to-tear-down the temple of-[the] God and to-build (it) through three days.'" 62And having-stood-up, the high-priest said to-him, "You-are-answering nothing what these are-testifying-against you?"  63And [the] Jesus kept-silent. And the high-priest said to-him, 'I-adjure you according-to the living [the] God in-order-that you-tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of-[the] God." 65Then the high-priest tore the clothes of-him, saying, "He-blasphemed. Why do-we┘yet└have need of-witnesses? 66What does-it-seem to-you?" 67Then they-spit in the face of-him and hit┘him└with-their-fists; and the/they slapped (him), 68saying, "Prophesy to-us, Messiah; who is the-one having-struck you?" 69And [the] Peter was-sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant-girl came-to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus the Galilee." 70And the/he denied before all, saying, "I-do┘not└know what you-are-saying." 71Havingmas-gone-out into the gateway anotherfem saw him and says to-the-ones there, "This-one was with Jesus the Nazarene." 72Again he-denied with (an) oath [that], "I-do┘not└know the man." 73After (a) little-(while) having-gone-to (him), the-ones standing (there) said to-[the] Peter, "Truly you are one of-them, for even the speech of-you makes you evident." 74Then he-began to-curse and swear [that], "I-do┘not└know the man." And immediately (a) rooster crowed. 75And [the] Peter remembered the word Jesus having-spoken [that], "Before (a) rooster crows you-will-deny me three-times. And having-gone outside, he-cried bitterly.</span>
