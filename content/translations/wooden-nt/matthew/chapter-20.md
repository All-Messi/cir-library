<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>For the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] is like (a) landowner man who went-out early to-hire workers for the vineyard of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>And having</em><em>-</em><em>agreed with the workers of (a) denarius for-the day, he-sent them into the vineyard of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And having-gone-out about (the) third hour, he-saw others standing idle in the </em><em>market-place</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>and said to-them, ‘You also go into the/my vineyard, and whatever is right I-will-give you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And the/they went-away.</em><em> </em><em>[And]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> again having-gone-out (the) sixth and ninth hours, he-did likewise.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>And about the eleventh hour, having-gone-out, </em><em>he-found others standing and sai</em><em>d to-them, ‘Why are-you-standing here the whole day idle?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>They-say to-him, ‘Because nobody hired us.’</em><em> </em><em>He-says to-them, ‘You also go into the/my vineyard.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>And evening having-come, the lord of-the vineyard says to-the foreman of-him, ‘Call the workers and give them the/their </em><em>pay having-begun from the last to the first.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And having-come, the-ones about the eleventh hour received (a) denarius apiece.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And having-come, the first thought that they would receive more, and </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> received [the/a]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> denarius also.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And having-received (it), they-began-to-grumble against the landowner, </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>saying ‘These [the] last do for-one hour, and you-made them equal to-us the-ones having-borne the burden of-the day and the heat.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But the/he, having-</em><em>answered to-one of-them, said, ‘</em><em>Friend, </em><em>I-did┘not└mistreat</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><em>Did-you┘not└agree-with</em><em> me of-(a)-denarius?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Take (the) your-thing and go.</em><em> </em><em>But I-want to-pay this [the] last-one as also (I-paid) you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>[Or]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>is-it┘</em><em>not</em><em>└lawful</em><em> for-me to-do what I-want with [the] my-things?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Thus the last will-be first</em><em>,</em><em> and the first (will be) last.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] Jesus, going-up to Jerusalem, called the twelve [disciples]<sup>ms</sup> privately<sup>2</sup> and on the road said to-them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then the mother of-the sons of-Zebedee comes-to him with the sons of-her, kneeling (to him) and asking something from him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And the/he said to-her, <em>“What do-you-want?”</em> She-says to-him, <em>“Say [in-order]-that these [the] two sons of-me will-sit one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s] of-you in the kingdom of-you.”</em><em> </em></span>
