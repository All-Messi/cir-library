## Matthew Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] is like (a) landowner man who went-out early to-hire workers for the vineyard of-him. 2And having-agreed with the workers of (a) denarius for-the day, he-sent them into the vineyard of-him. 3And having-gone-out about (the) third hour, he-saw others standing idle in the market-place, 4and said to-them, 'You also go into the/my vineyard, and whatever is right I-will-give you.' 5And the/they went-away. [And]ms again having-gone-out (the) sixth and ninth hours, he-did likewise. 6And about the eleventh hour, having-gone-out, he-found others standing and said to-them, 'Why are-you-standing here the whole day idle?' 7They-say to-him, 'Because nobody hired us.' He-says to-them, 'You also go into the/my vineyard.' 8And evening having-come, the lord of-the vineyard says to-the foreman of-him, 'Call the workers and give them the/their pay having-begun from the last to the first.' 9And having-come, the-ones about the eleventh hour received (a) denarius apiece. 10And having-come, the first thought that they would receive more, and they received [the/a]ms denarius also. 11And having-received (it), they-began-to-grumble against the landowner, 12saying 'These [the] last do for-one hour, and you-made them equal to-us the-ones having-borne the burden of-the day and the heat.' 13But the/he, having-answered to-one of-them, said, 'Friend, I-did┘not└mistreat you. Did-you┘not└agree-with me of-(a)-denarius? 14Take (the) your-thing and go. But I-want to-pay this [the] last-one as also (I-paid) you. 15[Or]ms, is-it┘not└lawful for-me to-do what I-want with [the] my-things?' 16Thus the last will-be first, and the first (will be) last."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] Jesus, going-up to Jerusalem, called the twelve [disciples]ms privately2 and on the road said to-them, 18"Behold we-are-going-up to Jerusalem, and the Son of-[the] Man will-be-delivered to-the chief-priests and scribes, and they-will-condemn him to-death, 19and they-will-deliver him to-the Gentiles unto [the] mocking (him) and scourging (him) and crucifying (him), and on-the third day he-will-be-raised."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then the mother of-the sons of-Zebedee comes-to him with the sons of-her, kneeling (to him) and asking something from him. 21And the/he said to-her, "What do-you-want?" She-says to-him, "Say [in-order]-that these [the] two sons of-me will-sit one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s] of-you in the kingdom of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said, "Youpl-do┘not└know that you-are-asking. Are-youpl able to-drink the cup that I will drink?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He-says to-them, "You-will drink the cup of-me, but [the] sitting on (the) right[s] of-me and on (the) left[s] is not to-me to-give [this]ms, but (it is) for-whom it-has-been-prepared by the Father of-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-heard, the twelve were-indignant about the two brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> But [the] Jesus, having-called┘them└to (him), said, "You-know that the rulers of-the Gentiles lord-it-over them and the great-ones tyrannize them. 26It-will be thus among you, but whoever wants to-become great among you will-be (a) server of-you. 27And whoever wants to-be first among you will-be (a) slave of-you. 28As the son of-[the] Man did┘not└come to-be-served but to-serve and to-give the life of-him (as a) ransom in-place-of many."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And they going-out from Jericho, (a) big crowd followed him. 30And behold two blind-men sitting beside the road, having-heard that Jesus is/was-passing-by, shouted, saying, "Have-mercy-on us, [Lord]ms, Son of-David." 31And the crowd rebuked them [in-order]-that they-would-be-quiet. But the/they shouted more-greatly, saying, "Have-mercy-on us, Lord, Son of-David."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And standing-still, [the] Jesus called them and said, "What do-you-want (that) I-should-do for-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They-say to-him, "Lord, [in-order]-that they eyes of-us might-open-up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And moved-with-compassion, [the] Jesus touched the eyes of-them, and immediately they-looked-up and followed him.</span>
