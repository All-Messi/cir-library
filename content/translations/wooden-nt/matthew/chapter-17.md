## Matthew Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And after six days [the] Jesus talks┘[the] Peter and James and John the brother of-him└aside, and takes┘them└up into (a) high mountain privately2. 2And he-was-transfigured in-front-of them; and the face of-him shined like the sun, and the clothes of-him became white like [the] light. 3And behold Moses and Elijah appeared to-them talking-with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Peter, having-answered, said to-[the] Jesus, "Lord, it-is-good for-us to-be here. If you-want, I-will-set-up three tents here, for-you one, and for-Moses one, and for-Elijah one."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He still speaking, behold (a) bright-cloud engulfed them, and behold (a) voice out-of the cloud, saying, "This is the beloved [the] Son of-me, in whom I-delighted; listen-to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the disciples, having-heard, fell on (the) face of-them and they-feared exceedingly. 7And [the] Jesus came-to (them) and having-touched then, said, "Get-up and do┘not└be-afraid." 8And having-lifted-up the eyes of-them, they-saw nobody except2 Jesus himself alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And they coming-down out-of the mountain, [the] Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell the vision to-nobody until2 the Son of-[the] Man arises from (the) dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do┘the scribes└say that it-is-necessary for-Elijah to-come first?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said, "Elijah does-come and will-restore all-things. 12I-say to-you that Elijah already came, and they-did┘not└recognize him, but did in him as-many-things-as they-wanted. Even so the Son of-[the] Man will-suffer by them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then the disciples understood that he-spoke about John the Baptist.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And (they) having-come to the crowd, (a) man came-to him kneeling-to him, 15and saying, "Lord, have-mercy-on the son of-me, because he-is-(an)-epileptic and suffers evilly. For many-times he-falls into the fire and many-times into the water. 16And I-brought him to-the disciples of-you, and they-were┘not└able to-heal him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-heard, [the] Jesus said, "O faithless and perverted generation, until when will-I-be with you? Until when will-I-put-up-with you? Bring him here to-me." 18And [the] Jesus rebuked it and the demon came-out from him, and the child was-healed from [the] that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the disciples, having-come to-[the] Jesus privately2, said, "On-account-of what were-we┘not└able to-cast┘it└out?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But [the] Jesus says to-them, "On-account-of the little-faith of-you. For truly I-say to-you, if you-have faith like (a) seed of-mustard, you-will-say to-[the] this mountain, 'Move from-here to-there, and it-will-be-moved, and nothing will-be-impossible to-you." [21]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And they having-come to Capernaum, the-ones receiving [the] didrachmas come-to [the] Peter and said, "The teacher of-you pays┘[the] didrachmas,└does-he not?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He-says, "Yes." And [the] Jesus spoke-to himacc first, having-comeacc into the house, saying, "What does-it-seem to-you, Simon? From whom do the kings of-the earth receive customs or tribute? From the sons of-them or from [the] foreigners?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> But (he) having-said, "From [the] foreigners," [the] Jesus said to-him, "Then the sons are free. 27But in-order-that we-may┘not└make┘them└stumble, having-gone to (the) sea, cast (a) fishhook and take the first fish having-come-up; and having-opened the mouth of-it, you-will-find (a) stater. Having-taken that, give (it) to-them for me and you."</span>
