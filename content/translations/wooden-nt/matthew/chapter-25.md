## Matthew Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] will-be-like then virgins, who, having-taken the lamps of-them, they-went-out to meeting the groom. 2Now five of them were foolish and five (were) wise. 3For the foolish, having-taken the lamps of-them, did┘not└take oil with them. 4But the wise took oil in [the] flasks with the lamps of-them. 5And the groom delaying, they-got-drowsy and fell-asleep. 6And during (the) middle of-(the)-night, (a) shout came,, 'Behold, the groom! Come-out for meeting [him]ms.' 7Then all [the] those virgins got-up and trimmed the lamps of-them. 8Now the foolish said to-the wise, 'Give us of the oil of-you, because the lamps of-us are-going-out.' 9But the wise answered, saying, 'No, there-will┘certainly not└be-enough for-us and for-you. Go instead to the selling-ones and buy for-yourselves.' 10And they going-away to-buy, the groom came, and the-ones prepared entered with him into the wedding-feast and the door was-shut. 11And later the remaining virgins also come, saying, 'Lord, lord, open for-us.' 12And the/he, having-answered, said, "Truly I-say to-you, I-do┘not└know you.' 13So watch, because you-do┘not└know the day nor the hour. 14"For as (a) man leaving-on-a-trip called [the] his servants and delivered to-them the possessions of-him. 15And to-one he-gave five talents, and to-another (he gave) two, and to-another (he gave) one, to-each according-to [the] his ability, and left. 16Immediately having-gone, the-one having-received five talents traded with them and earned five others. 17Likewise the-one (having-received) the two (talents) earned two others. 18But the-one having-received the one (talent), having-gone-away, dug (the) ground (in) (the) ground and hid the silver-(coin)/money of-the lord of-him. 19And after (a) long time the lord of-[the] those servants comes and settles account with them. 20And having-come, the-one having-received the five talents brought five other talents, saying 'Lord, you-gave five talents to-me. Behold, I-earned five other talents.' 21The lord of-him said to-him, 'Well, good and faithful servant; you-were faithful over (a) few-things; over many-things I-will-put┘you└in-charge. Enter into the joy of-the lord of-you.' 22[And]ms also having-come the-one (having-received) the two (talents) said, 'Lord, you-gave me two talents. Behold, I-earned two other talents.' 23The lord of-him said to-him, 'Well, good and faithful servant, you-were-faithful over (a) few-things; I-will-put┘you└in-charge over many-things. Enter into the joy of-the lord of-you.' 24And having-come, the-one having-received the one talent said, 'Lord, I-knew you that you-are (a) hard man, reaping where you-did┘not└scatter. 25And having-been-afraid, having-gone-away, I-hid the talent of-you in the ground. Behold, you-have [the] your (talent).' 26And having-answered, the lord of-him said to-him, 'Wicked and lazy servant, you-knew that I-reap where I-did┘not└sow and gather whence I-did┘not└scatter? 27I-was-necessary for-you then to-put the silver-coins/money of-me with-the bankers, and, having-come, I would-have-received [the] my (talent) with interest. 28So take from him the talent and give (it) to-the one having the ten talents. 29For to-the everybody having it-will-be-given and he-will-abound, but of-the-one not having even what he-has will-be-taken from him. 30And throw-out the worthless servant into the out [the] darkness. [The] bitter-crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be there. 31"And when the Son of-[the] Man comes in the glory of-him and all the angels with him, then he-will-sit on (the) throne of-(the) glory of-him. 32And all the nations will-be-gathered-together before him, and he-will-separate them from one-another as the/a shepherd separates [the] sheep from [the] goats. 33And he-will-stand the sheep on (the) right[s] of-him, but the goats on (the) left[s]. 34Then the king will-say to-the-ones on (the) right[s] of-him, 'Come [the] blessed-ones of-the Father of-me; inherit the kingdom prepared for-you from (the) foundation of-(the)-world. 35For I-hungered and you-gave me (something) to-eat; I-thirsted and you-watered me/you gave me (something)-to-drink, I-was (a) foreigner and you-took┘me└in, 36naked and you-clothed me; I-was-sick and you-visited me; I-was in prison and you-came to me.' 37Then the righteous will-answered him, saying, 'Lord, when did-we-see you hungering and nourish (you), or being-thirsty and water you? 38And when did-we-see you (a) foreigner and take-(you)-in, or naked and clothed (you). 39And when did-we-see you being-sick or in prison and come to-you?' 40And having-answered, the king will-say to-them, 'Truly I-tell you, unto as-much-as you-did (it) to-one of-the least of-these [the] least [the] brothers of-me, you-did (it) to-me.' 41"Then he-will-say also to-the-ones on (the) left[s], 'Go from me, [the]ms accursed, into the eternal [the] fire [the] prepared for-the devil and the angels of-him. 42For I-hungered and you-did┘not└give me (anything) to-eat; I-thirsted and you-did┘not└water me; 43I-was (a) foreigner and you-did┘not└take┘me└in, naked you-did┘not└visit me? 44Then they will-answer, saying, 'Lord, when did-we-see you hungering or thirsting or (a) foreigner or naked or sick or in prison and not take-care-of you?' 45Then he-will-answer them, saying, 'Truly I-tell you, unto as-much-as you-did┘not└do (it) to-me.' 46And these will-go-away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</span>
