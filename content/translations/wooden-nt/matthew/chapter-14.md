<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And immediately [the Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> spoke to-them, saying, <em>“Take-courage; I </em><em>am;</em><em> </em><em>do┘not└be-afraid</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And having-answered, [the] Peter said to-him, <em>“Lord, if you are, command me to-come to you on the water.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And the/he said, <em>“Come.”</em> And having-got-down from the boat, [the]<sup>ms</sup> Peter began-to-walk on the water[s] and went to [the] Jesus. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But seeing the [strong]<sup>ms</sup> wind, he-became-afraid, and having-begun to-sink, he cried-out, saying, <em>“Lord, save me.”</em></span>
