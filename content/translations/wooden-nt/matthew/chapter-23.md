## Matthew Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-the crowd[s] and to-the disciples of-him, 2saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of-[the] Moses. 3So do and keep all-things as-many-as2 they-say to-you, but do┘not└do according-to the works of-them, for they-say and do┘not└do. 4And they strap heavy loads and difficult-to-carry and put (them) on the shoulders of-[the] men, but they do┘not└want to-move them with the/a finger of-them. 5And all the works of-them they-do unto [the] being-seen by-[the] men. For they-broaden the phylacteries of-them and lengthen the/their tassels. 6And they-love the main-seat at [the] dinners and prominent seats in [the] synagogues 7and [the] greetings in [the] market-places, and (love) to-be-called by [the] men 'Rabbi.' 8But do┘not└you be-called 'Rabbi.' For One is the teacher of-you, and you are all brothers. 9And do┘not└call 'father' of-you on [the] earth, for One is the heavenly [the] Father of-you. 10Neither be-called leaders because one is leader of-you—the Messiah. 11But the greater/greatest of-you will-be (a) minister of-you. 12But whoever will-exalt himself will-be-humbled and who humbles himself will-be-exalted. 13"And woe to-you, scribers and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-shut the kingdom of-[the] heaven in-front-of [the] men, for you do┘not└go-in, neither do-you-let the-ones trying-to-enter to-go-in. [14]ms 15"Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-go-around [the] sea and [the] land to-make one proselyte, and when he-becomes (one), you-make him twice-more (the) son of-Gehenna than yourselves." 16"Woe to-you, blind guides the-ones saying, 'Whoever2 swears by the sanctuary it-is nothing, but whoever2 swears by the gold of-the sanctuary, he-is-under-obligation.' 17Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple [the] having-sanctified the gold? 18And 'whoever2 swears by the altar, it-is nothing, but whoever2 swears by the gift [the] on it, he-is-under-obligation.' 19Blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar [the] sanctifying the gift? 20Therefore the-one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all-things [the] on it. 21And the-one having-sworn by the sanctuary swears by it and by the-One dwelling-in it, 22and the-one having-sworn by [the] heaven swears by the throne of-[the] God and by the-one sitting on it. 23"Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-tithe [the] mint and [the] dill and [the] cumin, and neglect the heavier-things of-the Law—[the] justice and [the] mercy and [the] faith. And it-was-necessary to-do these-things and┘not to-neglect└those. 24Blind guides! The-ones straining-out the gnat and swallowing the camel! 25"Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-clean the outside of-the cup and the plate, but inside they-are-full of greed and self-indulgence. 26Foolish Pharisees! Cleanse first the inside of-the cup in-order-that the outside may┘also└become clean. 27"Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-are-like whitewashed tombs, which outside appear attractive, but inside they-are-full of (the) bones of-dead-(men) and all uncleanness. 28Thus also you outside appear to-[the] men righteous, but inside you-are full of-hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29"Woe to-you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you-build the tombs of-the prophets and decorate the graves of-the righteous; 30and you-say, 'If we-were in the days of-the fathers of-us, we-would┘not└have-been fellows in the blood of-the prophets.' 31So-that you-testify to-yourselves that you-are sons of-the-ones having-murdered the prophets. 32And you fill-up the measure of-the fathers of-you. 33Snakes! Nests of-vipers! How will you-escape from the condemnation of-[the] Gehenna? 34On-account-of this, behold, I send to you prophets and wise-ones and scribes. Some-of them you-will-kill and you-will-crucify, and some-of them you-will-scourge in the synagogues of-you and persecute from city to city, 35in-order-that may-come on you all righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of-Abel the righteous to the blood of-Zechariah, son of-Berechiah, whom you-murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 36Truly I-say to-you, all these-things will-come on [the] this generation. 37"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! The-one murdering the prophets and stoning the-ones sent to it. How-many-times did-I-want to-gather the children of-you which way/like (a) hen gathers the chicks of-her under the/her wings, and you-did┘not└want-(to). 38Behold, the house of-you is-left to-you desolate. 39For I-say to-you, you-will┘certainly not└see me from now till you-say, 'Blessed (is) the-One coming in (the) name of–(the)-Lord.'"</span>
