## Matthew Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In that [the] time [the] Jesus went through the grain-fields on-the Sabbath[s]. and the disciples of-him were-hungry and they-began to-pluck grain-heads and to-eat (the). 2And the Pharisees, having seen, said to-him, "Behold, the disciples of-you are-doing what is┘not└lawful to-do on (the) Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the/he said to-them, "Did-you┘not└read what David did when he-was-hungry and the-ones with him? 4How he-entered into the house of-[the] God and ate the loaves of-[the] presentation, which was not lawful for-him to-eat nor for-the-ones with him except for-the priests only? 5Or, did-you┘not└read in the Law that on-[the[] Sabbath[s] the priests in the temple defile the Sabbath and are innocent? 6And I-say to-you that something-greater than-the temple is here. 7And if you had-known what it-is, 'I-desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you-wouldhave-condemned2 the innocent 8for the Son of-[the] Man is Lord of-the Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And having-left from there, he-went into the synagogue of-them. 10And behold (a) man having (a) paralyzed hand, and they-asked him, saying [whether], "Is-it-lawful to-heal on-the Sabbath[s]?" in-order-that they-might-accuse him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the/he said to-them, "What man of-you will-there-be who will-have one sheep and, if this-one falls in (a) ravine on-the Sabbath[s], will-he┘not└take-hold-of it and pull-(it)-out? 12So (a) man is-more-valuable by-much than-(a)-sheep, so-that it-is-lawful to-do well on-the Sabbath." 13Then he-says to-the man, "Hold-out the hand of-you." And he-held-(it)-out, and it-was-restored healthy like the other. 14And having-gone-out, the Pharisees took counsel against him in-order-that they-might-destroy him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-known, left from-there. And many [crowds]ms followed him, and he healed them all. 16And he-charged them [in-order]-that they-might┘not└make him manifest, 17in-order-that the-thing spoken through Isaiah the prophet might-be-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He-will┘not└quarrel nor shout,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He-will┘not└break (a) bent reed,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then (a) demon-possessed blind and mute-(man) was brought-to him, and he-healed him so-that the mute speaks/spoke and sees/saw. 23And all the crowd[s] were-astounded and were-saying, "This is the Son of-David, is-it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And the Pharisees, having-heard, said, "This-One does cast-out [the] demons except2 by [the] Beelzebub, ruler of-[the] demons."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And knowing the thoughts of-them, he-said to-them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will-become-desolate, and every city and house divided against itself will┘not└stand. 26And if the] Satan casts-out Satan, he-will-be-divided against himself. How then will┘the kingdom of-him└stand? 27And if I by Beelzebub cast-out [the] demons, by what/whom do┘the sons of-you└cast-(them)-out? On-account-of this they will-be judges of-you. 28But if by (the) Spirit of-God I-cast-out [the] demons, then the kingdom of-[the] God reached to you. 29Or, how is┘somebody└able to-enter into the house of-the/a strong-(man) and seize the vessels of-him, unless2 first he-binds the strong-(man)? And then he-will-plunder the house of-him. 30The-one not being with me is-against me, and the-one not gathering with me scatters-out. 31On-account-of this I-say to-you, every sin and blasphemy will-be-forgiven to-[the] men, but [the] blasphemy of-the Spirit will be-forgiven. 32And whoever2 says (a) word against the Son of-[the] Man, it-will-be-forgiven to-him; but whoever2 speaks against the Holy [the] Spirit it-will┘not└be-forgiven to-him neither in this [the] age nor in the coming-(one). 33"Or, make the tree good and the fruit of-it good, or make the tree worthless and the fruit of-it worthless. For the/a tree is-known by the fruit. 34Generations of-snakes! How are-you-able to-say good-things, being evil?  For out-of the abundance of-the heart the mouth speaks. 35The/A good man puts-out good-things from the/his good treasure, and the/a bad man puts-out bad-things out-of the/his bad treasure. 36But I-say to-you that [the] men will-give-an-account about his word in (the) day of-judgment. 37For by the words of-you you-will-be justified, and by the words of-you you-will-be-condemned."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then some of-the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, "Teacher, we-want to-see (a) sign from you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> But the/he, having-answered, said to-them, "(An) evil and adulterous generation is-looking-for (a) sign, and (a) sign will┘not└be-given to-it except2 the sign of-Jonah the prophet. 40For as 'Jonah was in the stomach of-the sea-monster for-three days and three nights,' so the Son of-[the] Man will-be in the heart of-the earth for-three days and three-night. 41Ninevites men will-rise-up in the judgment with [the] this generation and they-will-condemn it, because they-repented at the preaching of-Jonah, and behold one-greater than-Jonah (is) here. 42(The) queen of-(the)-south will-rise-up in the judgment with [the] this generation and will-condemn it, because she-came out –of the ends of-the earth to-hear the wisdom of-Solomon, and behold one-greater than-Solomon (is) here. 43"And when the/an unclean spirit goes-out from the/a man, it-goes-out through waterless places looking-for rest and does┘not└find (it). 44Then it-says, 'I-will-return to the house whence I-came-out.' And having-come, it-finds (it) unoccupied, swept-out, and decorated. 45Then it-goes and takes-along with it seven other spirits more-evil than itself and, having-entered, settles-down there. And the last-things of-[the] that man become worse than-the first-things. Thus it-will-be also for-[the] this [the] evil generation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> He still speaking to-the crowd[s], behold, the mother and the brothers of-him had-been-standing outside, seeking to-speak to-him. [47And somebody said to-him, "Behold, the mother of-you and the brothers of-you are standing outside seeking to-speak to-you."]ms 48And the/he, having-answered, said to-the-one speaking to-him, "Who is the mother of-me and who are the brothers of-me?" 49And having-extended the hand of-him to the disciples of-him, he-said, "Behold, the mother of-me and the brothers of-me. 50For whoever2 does the will of-the Father of-me [the] in heaven[s]—he is brother and sister and mother of-me."</span>
