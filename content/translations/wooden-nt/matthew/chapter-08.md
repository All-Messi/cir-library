<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he having-come-down from the mountain, many crowds followed him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And behold (a) leper, coming-to (him), knelt to-him, saying<em>, “Lord, if you-are-willing, you-are-able to-cleanse me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And having-stretched-out the/his hand, he-touched him, saying, <em>“I-am-willing; be-cleansed.”</em><em> </em>And immediately the leprosy of-him was-cleansed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-him, <em>“See (that) you-say nothing to nobody/anybody, but go show yourself to-the/a priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for (a) testimony to-them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he having-entered into Capernaum, (a) centurion came-to him appealing-to him <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and saying, <em>“Lord, the servant of-me is-laid paralyzed in the/my house, terribly tormented.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-says to-him, <em>“I, having-come, will-heal him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the centurion, having-answered, said, <em>“Lord, </em><em>I-am┘not└worthy</em><em> [in-order]-that you-should-come-in under the roof of-me, but only say (a) word, and the servant of-me will-be-healed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>For I also am (a) man under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I-say to-</em><em>this-one, ‘Go,’ and he-goes; and to-another, ‘Come,’ and he-comes; and to-the servant of-me, ‘Do this,’ and he-does (it)</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-heard, marveled and said to the-ones following, <em>“Truly I-say to-you, with nobody in [the] Israel did-I-find such faith.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And I-say to-you, many will-come from (the) east and (the) west and will-recline-at-table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s], </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>and the sons of-the kingdom will-be-thrown-out into the darkness [the] outside.</em><em> </em><em>[The] bitter-crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be there</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-the centurion, <em>“Go; as you-believed let-it-be to-you,”</em> and the servant [of-him]<sup>ms</sup> was-healed in [the] that hour.</span>

And he-cast-out the demons by-word, and he-healed all the-ones having evilly, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>in-order-that the-thing-said through Isaiah the prophet might-be-fulfilled, saying, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em><u>He</u></em></strong><strong><em> took the weaknesses of-us,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd bore the illnesses (of-us).”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And [the] Jesus having-seen (the) crowd around him, commanded to-go-away to the other-wise. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And having-come-to (him), one scribe said to-him, <em>“Teacher, I-will-follow you wherever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-go.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-him, <em>“[The] foxes have dens and [the] birds of-the sky (have) nests, but the Son of-the </em><em>M</em><em>an </em><em>does</em><em>┘not└</em><em>have</em><em> where he-may-lay the/his head.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And another of-the disciples [of-him]<sup>ms</sup> said to-him<em>, “Lord, let me first to-go-away and bury the father of-me.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And he-says to-them. <em>“Why are-you fearful, little-faith-ones?”</em> Then having-arisen, he-rebuked the wind[s] and the sea, and (a) great calm came.</span>
