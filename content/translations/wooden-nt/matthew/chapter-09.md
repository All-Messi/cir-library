## Matthew Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-gotten into the boat, he-crossed-over and came into [the] his-own city. 2And behold, they-were-bringing to-him (a) paralytic laid on (a) stretcher. And [the] Jesus, having-seen the faith of-them, said to-the paralytic, "Be-encouraged, son; the sins of-you are-forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And behold some of-the scribes said to each other, "This-one is-blaspheming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-seen the thoughts of-them, said, "Why are-you thinking bad-things in the hearts of-you? 5For what is easier, to-say, 'The sins of-you are-forgiven,' or to-say, 'Get-up and walk'? 6But in-order-that you-may-know that the Son of-[the] Man has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins"—then he-says to-the paralytic, "Get-up, pick-up the stretcher of-you and go into the house of-you." 7And having-arisen he-went-away into the house of-him. 8And the crowd[s], having-seen, were-afraid and glorified [the] God the-one having-given such authority to-[the] men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And [the] Jesus, going-along from-these, saw (a) man, sitting at the/a tax-booth, called Matthew, and he-says to-him, "Follow me." And having arisen, he-started-following him. 10And it-happened, he sitting in the/his house, and/that behold many tax-collectors and sinners, having-come, were-sitting-with [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And having-seen, the Pharisees began-to-say to-the disciples of-him, "On-account-of what is┘the teacher of-you└eating with [the] tax-collectors and sinners?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the/he, having-heard, said, "The strong do┘not└have need of-(a)-doctor, but the-ones having badly. 13But having-gone, learn what it-is, 'I-want mercy and not sacrifice.' For I-did┘not└come to-call righteous-ones but sinners."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then the disciples of-John come, saying, "On-account-of what do we and the Pharisees fast [many-times]ms, but the disciples of-you do┘not└fast?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "The sons of-the groom are┘not└able to-feel-sad as-long-as2 the groom is with them, are-they? But days will-come when the groom will-be-taken-away from them, and then they-will-fast. 16And nobody puts (an) unshrunk patch on (an) old garment, for the fullness of-it takes from the garment and (the) tear becomes worse. 17Neither do-they-put new wine into old wineskins. And except, the wineskins burst and the wine pours-out and the wineskins are-ruined. But they-put new wine into new wineskins, and both are-preserved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And he-saying these-things, behold one ruler, having-come, kneels to-him, saying [that], "The daughter of-me died just-now; but, having-come, having-put the hand of-you on her, she-will-live again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-arisen, followed him, and the disciples of-him (followed too). 20And behold (a) woman, hemorrhaging for-twelve years, having-come-to (him) from-behind, touched the fringe of-the garment of-him. 21For she-was-saying in herself, "If only I-touch the garment of-him, I-will-be-saved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-turned and having-seen her, said, "Be-encouraged, daughter, the faith of-you has-saved you." And the woman was-saved from [the] that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-entered into the house of-the ruler and having-seen the flute-players and the crowd making-an-uproar, 24began-saying, "You-can-go, for the girl did┘not└die, but she-is-sleeping," and they-began-to-ridicule him. 25And when the crowd was-put-out, having-entered, he-took the hand of-her, and raised-up the girl. 26And [the] this news went-out into that [the] whole land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And [the] Jesus passing-on from-there, two blind-(men) followed [him]ms, shouting and saying, "Have-mercy-on us, son of David."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And (he) having-gone into the house, the blind-(men) followed him, and [the] Jesus says to-them, "Do-you-believe I-am-able to-do this?" They-say to-him, "Yes, Lord." 29Then he-touched the eyes of-them, saying, "According-to the faith of-you let-it-be to-you. 30And the eyes of-them were-opened, and [the] Jesus strictly-warned them, saying, "See, let┘nobody└know." 31But the/they, having-gone-out, spread-the-news-about him in that [the] whole land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And they going-out, behold they-brought-to him (a) mute man being-demon-possessed. 33And the demon having-been cast, the mute spoke. And the crowd[s] marveled, Saying, "At-no-time was-it-seen thus in [the] Israel." 34And the Pharisees were-saying, "He-casts-out [the] demons by the ruler of-the demons."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And [the] Jesus was-going-around all the towns and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of-them, and preaching the good-news of-the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness. 36And having-seen the crowd[s], he-felt-compassion about them because they-were-troubled and scattered like sheep not having (a0 shepherd. 37Then he-says to-the disciples of-him, "The harvest (is) plentiful, but the workers (are) few. 38So pray the Lord of-the harvest [in-order]-that he-may-put workers into the harvest of-him."</span>
