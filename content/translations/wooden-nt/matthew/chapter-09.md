## Matthew Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-gotten into the boat, he-crossed-over and came into [the] his-own city. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And behold, they-were-bringing to-him (a) paralytic laid on (a) stretcher. And [the] Jesus, having-seen the faith of-them, said to-the paralytic, <em>“Be-encouraged, son; the sins of-you are-forgiven.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And behold some of-the scribes said to each other, <em>“This-one is-blaspheming.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-seen the thoughts of-them, said, <em>“Why are-you thinking bad-things in the hearts of-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>For what is easier, to-say, ‘The sins of-you are-forgiven,’ or to-say, ‘Get-up and walk’?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>But in-order-that you-may-know that the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins”</em>—then he-says to-the paralytic, <em>“Get-up, pick-up the stretcher of-you and go into the house of-you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And having-arisen he-went-away into the house of-him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the crowd[s], having-seen, were-afraid and glorified [the] God the-one having-given such authority to-[the] men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus, going-along from-these, saw (a) man, sitting at the/a tax-booth, called Matthew, and he-says to-him, <em>“Follow me.”</em> And having arisen, he-started-following him. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And it-happened, he sitting in the/his house, and/that behold many tax-collectors and sinners, having-come, were-sitting-with [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And having-seen, the Pharisees began-to-say to-the disciples of-him, <em>“On-account-of what </em><em>is</em><em>┘the</em><em> teacher </em><em>of-you└</em><em>eating</em><em> with [the] tax-collectors and sinners?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the/he, having-heard, said, <em>“The strong </em><em>do┘not└have</em><em> need of-(a)-doctor, but the-ones having badly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But having-gone, learn what it-is, ‘I-want mercy and not sacrifice.’</em><em> </em><em>For </em><em>I-did┘not└come</em><em> to-call righteous-ones but sinners.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then the disciples of-John come, saying, <em>“</em><em>On-account-of what do we and the Pharisees fast [many-times]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>, but the disciples of-you </em><em>do┘not└fast</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“The sons of-the groom </em><em>are</em><em>┘not└able</em><em> to-feel-sad as-long-as</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the groom is with them, are-they?</em><em> </em><em>But days will-come when the groom will-be-taken-away from them, and then they-will-fast.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And nobody puts (an) unshrunk patch on (an) old </em><em>garment, for the fullness of-it takes from the garment and (the) tear becomes worse.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Neither do-they-put new wine into old wineskins.</em><em> </em><em>And except, the wineskins burst and the wine pours-out and the wineskins are-ruined.</em><em> </em><em>But they-put new wine into new wineskins, and both are-preserved.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And he-saying these-things, behold one ruler, having-come, kneels to-him, saying [that],<em> “The daughter of-me died just-now; but, having-come, having-put the hand of-you on her, she-will-live again.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-arisen, followed him, and the disciples of-him (followed too). <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And behold (a) woman, hemorrhaging for-twelve years, having-come-to (him) from-behind, touched the fringe of-the garment of-him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For she-was-saying in herself, <em>“If only I-touch the garment of-him, I-will-be-saved.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-turned and having-seen her, said, <em>“Be-encouraged, daughter, the faith of-you has-saved you.”</em><em> </em>And the woman was-saved from [the] that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-entered into the house of-the ruler and having-seen the flute-players and the crowd making-an-uproar, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>began-saying, <em>“You-can-go, for the girl </em><em>did┘not└die</em><em>, but she-is-sleeping,</em><em>”</em><em> </em>and they-began-to-ridicule him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And when the crowd was-put-out, having-entered, he-took the hand of-her, and raised-up the girl. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And [the] this news went-out into that [the] whole land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus passing-on from-there, two blind-(men) followed [him]<sup>ms</sup>, shouting and saying, <em>“Have-mercy-on us, s</em><em>on of David.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And (he) having-gone into the house, the blind-(men) followed him, and [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“Do-you-believe I-am-able to-do this?”</em><em> </em> They-say to-him, <em>“Yes, Lord.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Then he-touched the eyes of-them, saying, “According-to the faith of-you let-it-be to-you. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And the eyes of-them were-opened, and [the] Jesus strictly-warned them, saying, <em>“See, </em><em>let┘</em><em>nobody</em><em>└know</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>But the/they, having-gone-out, spread-the-news-about him in that [the] whole land.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they going-out, behold they-brought-to him (a) mute man being-demon-possessed. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And the demon having-been cast, the mute spoke. And the crowd[s] marveled, Saying, <em>“At-no-time was-it-seen thus in </em><em>[the] Israel</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And the Pharisees were-saying, “He-casts-out [the] demons by the ruler of-the demons.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus was-going-around all the towns and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of-them, and preaching the good-news of-the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And having-seen the crowd[s], he-felt-compassion about them because they-were-troubled and scattered like sheep not having (a0 shepherd. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Then he-says to-the disciples of-him, <em>“The harvest (is) plentiful, but the workers (are) few.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>So pray the Lord of-the harvest [in-order]-that he-may-put workers into the harvest of-him.”</em></span>
