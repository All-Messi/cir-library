## Matthew Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the Pharisees and Sadducees, having-come-to (him), testing (him), asked him to-show them (a) sign from [the] heaven/the sky. 2And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, ["Evening having-come, you-say, 'Good-weather, for the sky is-bright-red.' 3And in-the- morning, 'Today, bad-weather; for the sky is-red and is-dark.' You-know to-interpret/read the face of-the sky, but are-you┘not└able (to-interpret/read) the times?] 4An evil and adulterous generation keeps-looking-for (a) sign, and (a) sign will be-given to-it except2 the sign of-Jonah." And having-left them, he-went-away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-come to the other-side, the disciples forgot to-take bread[s]. 6And [the] Jesus said to-them, "Watch and beware of the leaven/yeast of-the Pharisees and Sadducees."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the/they started-discussing among themselves, saying [that], "We-did┘not└bring-bread,"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But [the] Jesus, having-known, said, "Why are-you-discussing among yourselves, little-faith-ones, that you-do┘not└have bread[s]? 9Do-you┘not-yet└understand nor remember the five loaves of-the five-thousand and how-many baskets you-took-up, 10nor the seven loaves of-the four-thousand and how many larger-baskets you-took-up? 11How do-you┘not└know that I-did┘not└speak to-you-about bread[s]? Beware of the leaven/yeast of-the Pharisees and Sadducees."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then they-understood that he-did┘not└speak to-beware of the leaven of-[the] bread[s], but about the teaching of-the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-come into the parts of-Caesarea of-[the] Philip/of-Caesarea Philippi, he-started-asking the disciples of-him, saying, "Whom do [the] men say the Son of-[the] Man to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the/they said, "Some, John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others Jeremiah or one of-the prophets."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He-says to-them, "And whom do┘you└say me to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And Simon Peter, having-answered, said, "You are the Messiah, the Son of-the living [the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus to-him "Blessed are-you, Simon Bar-Jonah, because flesh and blood did┘not└reveal (this) to-you, but the Father of-me [the] in [the] heaven[s]. 18And-I say to-you that you are Peter and on the [the] rock I-will-build the church of-me and (the) gates of-Hades/(the) grave will be-able-to-prevail-against it. 19I-will-give to-you the keys of-the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s], and whatever2 you-bind on [the] earth will-surely-be bound in [the] heaven[s] and whatever2 you-loose on [the] earth will-surely-be loosed in [the] heaven[s]."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then he-strictly-charged the disciples [in-order]-that they-say to-nobody that he is/was the Messiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> From then [the] Jesus began to-show to-the disciples of-him that it-is/was-necessary for-him to-go-away to Jerusalem and to-suffer many-things from the elders and chief-priests, and to-be-put-to-death and on-the third day to-resurrect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And taking┘him└aside, [the] Peter began to-rebuke him, saying, "(May God be) merciful to-you/God forbid, Lord! This will certainly not be to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But the/he, having-turned, said to-[the] Peter, "Get behind me, Satan. You-are-being (a) stumbling-block to-me, because you-do┘not└have-your-mind-on the things of-[the] God, but the-things of-[the] men."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-the disciples of-him, "If anybody wants to-come after me, let-him-deny himself and pick-up the cross of-him and follow me. 25For wohoever2 wants to-save the life of-him will-lose it, and whoever2 loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me will-find it. 26For what will┘(a) man└be-profited if he-gains the whole world and forfeits the life of-him? Or what will┘(a) man└give in-exchange-for the life of-him? 27For the Son of-[the] Man will come in the glory of-the Father of-him with the angels of-him, and then he-will-reward each according-to the practice of-him. 28Truly I-say to-you that some of-the-ones standing here who will┘certainly not└taste of-death until2 they-see the Son of-[the] Man coming in the kingdom of-him."</span>
