## Matthew Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-gone-out, [the] Jesus was-going from the temple, and the disciples of-him came to-show him the buildings of-the temple-complex. 2And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, "Do-you┘not└see all these-things? Truly I-tell you, stone on stone will be-left that will┘certainly not└be-utterly-destroyed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he sitting on the Mount of-[the] Olives, the disciples came-to him privately2, saying, "Tell us, when will┘these-things└be and what (will be) the sign of-[the] your coming and (the) end of-the age/world?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to-them, "Beware lest anybody deceives you. 5For many will-come in the name of-me, saying, 'I am the Messiah,' and will-deceive many. 6And you-will hear-about wars and reports of-wars. See (that) you-do┘not└be-alarmed, for it-is-necessary to-happen, but the end is not-yet. 7For nation will-rise-up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and famines and earthquakes will-be according-to/in many places. 8But all these-things (are) (the) beginning of-birth-pangs. 9Then they-will-deliver you to tribulation and putto-death, and you-will-be hated by all the nations on-account-of the name of-me. 10And then all will-be-offended and they-will-betray one-another and they-will-hate on-another. 11And many false-prophets will-arise and they-will-deceive many. 12And on-account-of the increasing of-[the] lawlessness the love of-[the] many will-grow-cold. 13But the-one having-remained to (the) end—this-one will-be-saved. 14And this the good-news of-the kingdom will-be-preached in the whole world for (a) testimony to-all the nations, and then the end will-come. 15"So when you-see the abomination of-[the] desolation [the] spoken-of through Daniel the prophet, standing in (the) holy place—let┘the-one reading└understand—16then let┘the-ones in [the] Judaea└flee into the hill-country, 17let┘the-one on the housetop not└come-down to-pick-up the-things out-of the house of-him, 18and let┘the-one in the field not└return behind to-pick-up the cloak of-him. 19But woe to-the-ones having in (the) womb/pregnant and the-ones nursing in-those the days. 20But pray [in-order]-that the flight of-you not happen during-(the)-winter nor on-(the)-Sabbath. 21For then will-be great tribulation such-as has┘not└been from (the) beginning of-(the)-world until [the] now nor certainly not will-happen. 22And except2 [the] those days were-shortened, all flesh would┘not└have-been-saved, but on-account-of the chosen-ones [the] those days will-be-shortened. 23If anybody says to-you, 'Behold, here (is) the Messiah,' or, 'There,' do┘not└believe (it). 24For false-messiahs and false-prophets will-arise, and they-will-give great signs and wonders so-as- to-deceive, if possible, even the chosen-ones. 25Behold, I-have-told┘you└ahead-of-time. 26If then they-say to-you, 'Behold, he-is in the desert,' do┘not└believe (it); 27for as [the] lightning comes-out from (the) east[s] and shines to (the) west[s], thus will-be the coming of-the Son of-[the] Man. 28For where the corpse is, there the buzzards will-be-gathered-together.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And then the sign of-the Son of-[the] Man will-appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of-the earth will-mourn, and they-will-see the Son of-[the] Man coming on the clouds of-the sky with power and much glory, 31and he-will-send the angels of-him with (a) loud trumpet-blast, and they-will-gather together the chosen-ones of-him from the four winds from (the) ends of-(the)-sky to [the]ms ends of-them. 32"And learn the/a parable from the fig-tree. When the branch(es) of-it already become tender and sprout[s] the leaves, you-know that [the] summer (is) near. 33So also that [the] this generation will┘certainly not└pass-away until2 all these-things happen. 35The sky and the earth will-pass-away, but the words of-me will┘certainly not└pass-away. 36"But concerning [the] that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of-[the] heaven[s], nor the Son, except2 the Father only. 37For even-as the days of-Noah (were), thus will-be the coming of-the Son of-[the] Man. 38For as in [the] those]ms days [the] before the flood they-were eating and drinking, marrying and being-given-in-marriage until which day Noah entered into the ark, 39and they-did┘not└know until the flood came and carried┘them-all└away, so will-be [also]ms the coming of-the Son of-[the] Man. 40Then two will-be in the field; one is-taken and one is-left. 41Two grinding at the will, one is-taken and one is-left. 42So watch because you-do┘not└know at-what hour the Lord of-you is-coming. 43But know that that if the house-owner had-known in-what watch the thief is/was-coming, he-would-have watched and would┘not└have allowed the house of-him to-be-ransacked. 44On-account-of this you also be prepared, because at-what hour you-do┘not└suppose the son of-[the] Man comes. 45"Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the Lord put over the household of-him [the] to-give them [the] nourishment at (the)-appropriate-time? 46Blessed (is) [the] that servant whom the lord of-him, having-come, will-find doing thus. 47Truly I-tell you that over all the possessions of-him will-he-put him. 48But if [the] that evil servant says in the heart of-him, 'The lord of-me is-delaying, 49and he-begins to-abuse the fellow-servants of-him and eats and drinks with [the] drunkards, 50the lord of-[the] that servant will-come in (a) day he-does┘not└expect and in an hour that he-does┘not└know, 51and he-will-severely punish him and will-place the part of-him with the hypocrites, and bitter-crying will-be there and the gnashing of-[the] teeth.</span>
