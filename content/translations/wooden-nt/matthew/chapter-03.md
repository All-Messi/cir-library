## Matthew Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And in [the] those days, John the Baptist comes preaching in the desert of-[the] Judaea <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>[and]<sup>ms</sup>, saying, <em>“Repent, for the kingdom of-[the] heaven came-near.”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For this is the-one having-been-spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, <strong><em>“(A) voice shouting in the desert,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	‘Prepare the way of-(the)-</em></strong><strong><em>Lord;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>m</em></strong><strong><em>ake the paths of-him straight.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And [the] John himself was-having the garment of-him from hairs of-(a)-camel and (a) leather belt around the wait of-him, and the food of-him was locusts and field/wild honey. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then Jerusalem was-coming-out to-him and all [the] Judaea and all the territory of-the Jordan, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and they-were-being-baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing the sins of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>7And having-seen all the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism of-him, he-said to-them, <em>“</em><em>Generations of-snakes! W</em><em>ho warned you to-flee from the coming wrath?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>Therefore produce fruit worthy of-[the] repentance, </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>and do</em>┘not└<em>think to-say in yourselves, ‘We-have Abraham (as) the/our father,’ </em><em>for I-say to-you that [the] God is-able from [the] stones to-raise-up children to-[the] Abraham.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And already the/an axe is-lying at the root of-the trees.</em><em> </em><em>Therefore</em><em>,</em><em> every tree not </em><em>producing good fruit is-cut down and thrown into (the) fire.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em><u>I</u></em><em> am-baptizing you with water to repentance, but the-One coming after me is stronger/greater than-I, the sandals of-whom I-am not worthy to-take-off.</em><em> </em><em><u>He</u></em><em> will-baptize you with (the) Holy Spirit and fire, </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>the </em><em>winnowing</em><em>-shovel of-whom (is) in-the hand of-him</em><em>,</em><em> and he-will-thoroughly-clean-up the threshing-floor of-him, and he-will-gather the grain of-him into the/his granary, but the chaff he-will-burn-up with unquenchable </em><em>fire.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus comes from [the] Galilee to the Jordan to [the] John [the] to-be-baptized by him. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But [the] John tried-to-prevent him, saying, <em>“</em><em><u>I</u></em><em> have need to-be-baptized by you, and </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are-coming to me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to him, <em>“Allow (it) now, for thus it-</em><em>is-appropriate to-fulfill all r</em><em>ighteousness.”</em> Then he-allows him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-been-baptized, came-up immediately from the water, and behold the sky[s] was-opened [to-him]<sup>ms</sup>, and he-saw [the]<sup>ms</sup> Spirit of-[the]<sup>ms</sup> God coming-down like (a) dove [and]<sup>ms</sup> coming onto him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And, behold, (a) voice (came) out-of the sky[s], saying, <em>“This is the beloved [the] Son of-me, in whom I-delighted.”</em></span>
