## Matthew Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And in [the] those days, John the Baptist comes preaching in the desert of-[the] Judaea 2[and]ms, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of-[the] heaven came-near." 3For this is the-one having-been-spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] John himself was-having the garment of-him from hairs of-(a)-camel and (a) leather belt around the wait of-him, and the food of-him was locusts and field/wild honey. 5Then Jerusalem was-coming-out to-him and all [the] Judaea and all the territory of-the Jordan, 6and they-were-being-baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing the sins of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And having-seen all the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism of-him, he-said to-them, "Generations of-snakes! Who warned you to-flee from the coming wrath? 8Therefore produce fruit worthy of-[the] repentance, 9and do┘not└think to-say in yourselves, 'We-have Abraham (as) the/our father,' for I-say to-you that [the] God is-able from [the] stones to-raise-up children to-[the] Abraham. 10And already the/an axe is-lying at the root of-the trees. Therefore, every tree not producing good fruit is-cut down and thrown into (the) fire. 11I am-baptizing you with water to repentance, but the-One coming after me is stronger/greater than-I, the sandals of-whom I-am not worthy to-take-off. He will-baptize you with (the) Holy Spirit and fire, 12the winnowing-shovel of-whom (is) in-the hand of-him, and he-will-thoroughly-clean-up the threshing-floor of-him, and he-will-gather the grain of-him into the/his granary, but the chaff he-will-burn-up with unquenchable fire."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then [the] Jesus comes from [the] Galilee to the Jordan to [the] John [the] to-be-baptized by him. 14But [the] John tried-to-prevent him, saying, "I have need to-be-baptized by you, and you are-coming to me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to him, "Allow (it) now, for thus it-is-appropriate to-fulfill all righteousness." Then he-allows him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-been-baptized, came-up immediately from the water, and behold the sky[s] was-opened [to-him]ms, and he-saw [the]ms Spirit of-[the]ms God coming-down like (a) dove [and]ms coming onto him. 17And, behold, (a) voice (came) out-of the sky[s], saying, "This is the beloved [the] Son of-me, in whom I-delighted."</span>
