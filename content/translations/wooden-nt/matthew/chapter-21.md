## Matthew Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And when they-got-near to Jerusalem and they-came to Bethany to the Mount of-[the] Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2saying to-them, "Go into the village across-from you, and immediately you-will-find (a) donkey tied and (a) colt with her. Having-untied (them), bring (them) to-me. 3And if anybody says anything to-you, you-shall-say [that], 'The Lord has need of-them.' And immediately he-will-send them." 4And this-thing has-happened in-order-that the-thing spoken through the prophet might-be-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the disciples, having-gone and having-done as [the] Jesus directed them, 7led the donkey and the foal; and they-put the cloaks of-them on them, and sat (him) on them. 8And the very-numerous crowd spread the cloaks of-them in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and began-to-spread (them) on the road. 9And the crowd[s] the-ones going-in-front-of him and the-ones following, were-shouting, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And he entering into Jerusalem, all the city was-stirred-up, saying, "Who is this?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the crowd[s] was-saying, "This is the prophet Jesus the-One from Nazareth of-[the] Galilee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And Jesus entered into the temple-complex and cast-out all the-ones selling and buying in the temple, and he-turned-over the tables of-the money-changers and the seats of-the-ones selling [the] doves. 13And he-says to-them, "It-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And (the) blind and (the) lame they-brought-to him in the temples, and he-healed them. 15And the chief-priests and the scribes, seeing the marvelous things that he-did and the children [the] shouting in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to-the son of-David," they-were-indignant, 16and said to-him, "Do-you-hear what these are-saying?" And [the] Jesus says to-them, "Yes, did-you┘never└read [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-left them, he-went outside the city to Bethany and lodged there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And early having-headed into the city, he-hungered. 19And having-seen (a) fig-tree by the road, he-went to it and found nothing on it except2 leaves only; and he-says to-it, "No-longer let┘fruit└be from you unto the age/forever."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-seen, the disciples were-amazed, saying, "How did┘the fig-tree└dry-up quickly?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to-them, "Truly I-say to-you, if you-have faith and do┘not└doubt/waver, not only will-you-do the-thing of-the fig-tree, but even-if you-say to-[the] this mountain, 'Be-picked-up and be-thrown into the sea,' it-will-happen. 22And all-things as-many-as you-ask in [the] prayer believing you-will-receive."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he going into the temple, the chief-priests and the elders of-the people came-to him, teaching, saying, "By what authority are-you-doing these-things, and who gave you [the] this authority?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to-them, "I-also will-ask you one matter, which if you-tell me, I-also will-tell you by what authority I-am-doing these-things. 25Whence was the baptism [the] of-John? From heaven or from men?" And the/they began-to-discuss with each-other, saying, "If we-say, 'From heaven,' he-will-say to-us, 'On-account-of what did-you┘not└believe him?' 26And if we-say, 'From men,' we-fear the people, for all have [the] John as (a) prophet." 27And having-answered [the] Jesus, they-said, "We-do┘not└know." "Neither am-I-telling you by what authority I-am-doing these-things." 28"But what does-it-seem to-you? (A) man had two sons. And having-gone-to the first, he-said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.' 29And the/he, having-answered, said, 'I-do┘not└want-(to),' but later he, having-repented, went. 30And having-gone-to the other, he-said likewise. But the/he having-answered said, 'I (will go), Sir,' and he-did┘not└go. 31Which of the two did the will of-the/his father?" [The] Jesus said to-them, "Truly I-tell you that [the] tax-collectors and prostitutes go-ahead-of you into the kingdom of-[the] God. 32For John came to-you in (the) way of-righteousness, and you-did┘not└believe him, but [the] tax-collectors and [the] prostitutes believed him, but you, having-seen, did┘not└repent afterwards [the] to-believe him. 33"Listen-to another parable. (A) man was (a) landowner who planted (a) vineyard, and put┘(a) wall└around it, and dug (a) winepress in it, and built (a) tower, and rented┘it└out to-tenants, and went-on-a-trip. 34And when the time of-the fruit[s] came-near, he-sent the servants of-him to the tenants to-receive the fruit[s] of-it. 35And the tenants, having-taken the servants of-him, beat one, and killed one, and stoned another. 36Again he-sent other servants, more than-the first, and they-did likewise to-them. 37And last he-sent to them the son of-him, saying, 'They-will-respect the son of-me.' 38But the tenants, having-seen the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come let-us-kill him and let-us-have the inheritance of-him.' 39And having-taken him, they-threw him outside the vineyard and killed (him). 40So when the lord of-the vineyard comes, what will-he-do to-[the] those tenants?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> They-say to-him, "He-will┘evilly└destroy them, evil-(men), and he-will-rent the vineyard to-other tenants."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> On-account-of this I-say to-you that the kingdom of-[the] God will-be-taken from you, and it-will-be-given to-(a)-nation boing the fruit[s] of-it. [44And the-one having-fallen on [the] this stone will-be-bruised, and on whomever2 it-falls it-will-crust him."]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And having-heard the parables of-him, the chief-priests and the Pharisees knew that he-is/was-talking about them. 46And trying to-seize him, they-feared the crowds, because they-had him as-a-prophet.</span>
