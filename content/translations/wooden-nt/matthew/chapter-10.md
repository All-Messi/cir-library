## Matthew Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-summoned the twelve disciples of-him, he-gave them authority of-unclean spirits so-as to-cast┘them└out and to-heal every disease and every sickness. 2And these are the names of-the twelve apostles: first Simon, the-one called Peter; and Andrew, the brother of-him; and James, the (son) of-[the] Zebedee, and John, the brother of-him; 3Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, the tax-collector; James the (son) of-[the] Alpheus, and Thaddeus, 4Simon the Cananaean, and Judas [the] Iscariot, the-one also having-betrayed him. "Do┘not└go into (the) way of-(the)-Gentiles, and do┘not└enter into (a) town of-Samaritans. 6But go rather to the lost [the] sheep of-(the)-house of-Israel. 7And going, preach, saying [that], 'The kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] came-near.' 8Heal sick-ones, raise dead-ones, cleanse lepers, cast-out demons. You-received freely; give freely. 9Do┘not└get gold or silver or copper for the money-belts of-you, 10no knap-stack for (the) road, neither two cloaks, neither shoes, neither (a) rod; for the worker (is) worthy of-the food of-him. 11And into whatever2 town or village you-enter, find-out who in it is worthy, and┘stay└there until2 you-leave;  12and entering into the house, greet it. 13And if the house (is) worthy, let┘the peace of-you└go onto it; and if it-is not worthy, let┘the peace of-you└return to you. 14And whoever2 does┘not└receive you nor listen-to the words of-you, going outside the house or[the] that town, wipe-off the dust of-the feet of-you. 15Truly I-say to-you, it-will-be more-bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah in (the) day of-judgment than for-[the] that town. 15"Behold, I-am-sending you like sheep in (the) midst of-wolves. So be wise as [the] snakes and harmless as [the] doves. 17And beware of [the] men. For they-will-deliver you to (the) courts, and they-will-scourge you in the synagogues of-them. 18And also you-will-be-led to governors and kings for-the-sake-of me for (a) witness to-them and to the Gentiles. 19And when they-deliver you, do┘not└worry how or what you-will-say, for it-will-be-given to-you in that [the] hour what you-shall-say. 20For you are not the-ones speaking, but the Spirit of-the Father of-you [the] speaking in you. 21And brother will-deliver-up brother to death and father (will deliver up) son, and children will-rise-up against parents and they-will-have┘them└put-to-death. 22And you-will-be hated by all on-account-of the name of-me. 23And when they-persecute you in [the] this city, flee into the other, for truly I-say to-you, you-will┘certainly not└finish the towns of-[the] Israel until2 the Son of-[the] Man comes. 24"(A) disciple is┘not└above the/his teacher, neither (is) (a) servant above the lord of-him. 25(It is) sufficient for-(a)-disciple [in-order]-that he-may-be as the teacher of-him and the servant (to be) as the lord of-him. If-they-called the master-of-the house Beelzebub, more by-much the household-members of-him! 26"So do┘not└be-afraid-of them, for nothing is covered that will be-revealed, and hidden that will-be-made known. 27What I-say to-you in the cark speak in the daylight, and what you-hear in the ear preach on the housetops. 28And do┘not└be-afraid of the-ones killing the body, not being-able to-kill the soul. But fear instead the-One able to-destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. 29Are┘not└two sparrows sold for-(an)-assarion? And one of them does┘not└fall on the ground without the Father of-you. 30And even the hairs of-the head are all numbered. 31So do┘not└fear. You are-worth many sparrows. 32"So everybody who confesses [in] me before [the] men, I┘also└will-confess [in him] before the Father of-me [the] in [the]ms heaven[s]. 33And whoever2 denies me before [the] men, I-will┘also└deny [him] before the Father of-me [the] in [the] heaven[s]. 34"Do┘not└think that I-came to-put peace on the earth. I-did┘not└come to-put peace, but (a) sword. 35For I-came to-divide</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The-one loving father or mother above me is not worth of-me, and the-one loving son or daughter above me is not worthy of-me. 38And who does┘not└take the cross of-him and follow after me is not worthy of-me. 39The-one having-found the life of-him will-lose it, and the-one having-lost the life of-him for-the-sake-of me will-find it. 40"The-one receiving you receives me, and the-one receiving me receives the-One having-sent me. 41The-one receiving (a) prophet in (the) name of-(a)-prophet will-receive (the) reward of-(a)-prophet. 42And whoever gives┘one of-[the] these little-ones only└ (a) cup of-cold-water in (the) name of-(a)-disciple, truly I-say to-you, he-will┘certainly not└lose the reward of-him."</span>
