## Matthew Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened when [the] Jesus finished giving-directions to-the twelve disciples of-him, (that) he-left from-there [the] to-teach and preach in the towns of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And [the] John, having-heard in [the] prison the works of-[the] Messiah, having-sent through the disciples of-him, 3he-said to-him, "Are you the-One coming, or are-we-waiting-for another?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to-them, "Having-gone, report to-John what-things you-hear and see. 5(The) blind see and (the) lame walk, lepers are-cleansed and (the) deaf hear, and (the) dead are-raised and (the) poor are-evangelized. 6And blessed is whoever2 is┘not└offended/disappointed in me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And these going, [the] Jesus began to-say to the crowd[s] about John, "What did-you-go-out in the desert to-see? (A) reed being blown-around by (the) wind? 8But what did-you-go-out to-see? (A) man dressed in soft-clothes? Behold, the-ones wearing soft-clothes are in the houses of-[the] kings. 9But what did-you-go-out to-see? (A) prophet? Yes, I-say to-you, and more than-(a)-prophet. 10This is about whom it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Truly I-say to-you, one-greater than John the Baptist has┘not└risen among (the-ones) form of-women, but the least in the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] is greater than-he. 12And from the days of-John the Baptist until now the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] is-suffering-violence, and violent-men are-trying-to-seize it. 13For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John. 14And if you-want to-receive (it), he is Elijah the-one going to-come. 15The-one having ears, let-him hear. 16"And to-what will-I-compare [the] this generation? It-is like children sitting in the markets who (are) calling to-the others, 17saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they-say, 'He-has (a) demon.' 19The Son of-[the] Man came eating and drinking, and they-say, 'Behold, (a) glutton man and (a) winebibber, (a) friend of-tax-collectors and sinners, and [the] wisdom was-justified by the works of-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The he-began to-denounce the towns in which the greatest works of-him happened, because they-did┘not└repent. 21"Woe to-you, Chorazin, woe to-you, Bethsaida, because if the miracles the-ones having-happened in youpl happened in Tyre and Sidon, of-old they-would-have-repented2 in sackcloth and ashes. 22Nevertheless I-say to-you, for Tyre and Sidon it-will-be more bearable in (the) day of-judgment than for-you. 23And you, Capernaum, Because if the miracles the-ones having-happened in you happened in Sodom, it-would-have-remained2 until [the] today. 24Nevertheless I-say to-you that it-will-be more-bearable for-(the)-and of-Sodom in (the) day of-judgment than for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> In that [the] time [the] Jesus, having-answered said, "I-praise you, Father, Lord of-[the] sky and [the] earth, that you-withheld these-things from wise and understanding-ones and revealed them to-infants. 26Yes, [the] Father, because thus it-was pleasing before you. 27All-things were-given to-me by the Father of-me, and nobody knows the Son except2 the Father, neither does┘anybody└know the Father except2 the Son, and to-whomever2sg the Son desires to-reveal (him). 28Come to me all the-ones laboring and are-overloaded, and-I will-give┘you└rest. 29Take the yoke of-me on you and learn from me, because I-am gentle and humble in-[the] heart, and you-will-find rest for-the souls of-you. 30For the yoke of-me (is) easy and the load of-me is light."</span>
