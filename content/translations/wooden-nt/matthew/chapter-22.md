## Matthew Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-responded, [the] Jesus spoke again in parables to-them, saying, 2"[The kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] was/is like (a) king man who made(a) marriage-feast for-the son of-him. 3And he-sent the servants of-him to-call the-ones invited to the wedding-feast[s], and they-did┘not└want to-come. 4Again he-sent other servants, saying, 'Say to-the ones invited, "Behold, the meal of-me I-have prepared, the oxen of-me and the grain-fed-calves 9are) butchered. All-things (are) ready. Come to the feast[s]."' 5But the/they, not-paying-any-attention, went-away, one to [the] his field, and one to the business of-him. 6And the rest, having-grabbed the servants of-him, treated-(them)-disgracefully and killed (them). 7And the king was-furious and, having-sent the soldiers of-him, destroyed [the] those murderers and burned the city of-them. 8Then he-tells the servants of-him, 'The wedding-feast is ready, but the-ones invited were not worthy. 9So go into the main-roads of-the roads and as-many-as you-find invite to the marriage-feast[s].' 10And having-gone-out into the roads, [the] those servants assembled all whom they-found, both evil and good, and the wedding-feast was-filled of-reclining-ones-at-table. 11And the king, having-come-in to-inspect the-ones reclining-at-table, saw there (a) man not dressed in-dress of-(a)-wedding-feast, 12and he-says to-him, 'Friend, how did-you-come-in here not having dress of-(a)-wedding-feast?' And the/he was-speechless. 13Then the king said to-the servers, 'Having-bound him feet and hands, throw┘him└out into the outer [the] darkness. [The] crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be there. 14For many are called, but few (are) chosen.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then having-gone, the Pharisees took counsel in-order-that they-might-trap him in word. 16And they-sent to-him the disciples of-them with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we-know that you-are true and you-teach the way of-[the] God in truth and it-is┘not└ (a)-concern to-you about nobody/anybody, for you-do┘not└look on (the) face of-(a)-man. 17So tell us what it-seems to-you. Is-it-lawful to-pay tribute to-Caesar or not."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-known the wickedness of-them, said, "Why are-you-testing me, hypocrites? 19Show me the coin of-the tribute."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-says to-them, "Of-whom (is) this [the] image and [the] inscription?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They say to-him, "Caesar's." Then he-says to-them, "So pay the-things of-Caesar to-Caesar and the-things of-[the] God to-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And having-heard, they-marveled, and having-left him, they-went-away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> On that [the] day Sadducees came-to him—saying resurrection not to-be, and they-asked him, 24saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If any (man) dies not having children, the brother of-him shall-marry the wife of-him, and shall-raise-up seed to-the brother of-him.' 25Now seven brothers were with us. And the first, having-married, died, and not having seed, he-left the wife of-him to-the brother of-him. 26Likewise also the second and the third unto the seven. 27And last of-all, the woman died. 28So in the resurrection of-which of-the seven will-she-her (the) wife.? For they┘all└had her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to-them, "You-err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of-[the] God. 30For in the resurrection they┘neither└marry nor are-given-in-marriage, but they-are like angels in [the] heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And concerning [the] resurrection of-the dead, did-you┘not└read the-thing said to-you by [the] God, saying, 32'I am the God of-Abraham and the God of-Isaac and the God of-Jacob'? He-is not [the]ms God of-dead-ones but of-living-ones."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And having-heard, the crowd[s] were-astounded at the teaching of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And the Pharisees, having-heard that he-silenced the Sadducees, gathered-together to the same/together3, 35and one of-them [(a) lawyer]ms asked, testing him, 36"Teacher, what commandment in the Law (is) greatest?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the/he said to-him, "'You-shall-love (the) Lord the God of-you with the whole [the] heart of-you and with the whole soul of-you' and with the whole mind of-you. 38This is the great and first commandment. 39(The) second (is) like it, 'You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself.' 40On these [the] two commandments hang/depend the whole Law and the prophets."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And the Pharisees gathered-together, [the] Jesus asked them, 42saying, "What does-it-seem to-you about the Messiah? [The] son of-whom is-he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> He-says to-them, "How then does┘David by (the) Spirit└call him Lord, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> If then David calls him Lord, how is-he (the) Son of-him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And nobody was-able to-answer him (a) word, neither did┘anybody└dare from that [the] day to-ask him nothing/anything.</span>
