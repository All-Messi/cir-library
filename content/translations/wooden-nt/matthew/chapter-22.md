## Matthew Chapter **22**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-responded, [the] Jesus spoke again in parables to-them, saying, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>[The kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] was/is like (a) king man who made(a) marriage-feast for-the son of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And he-sent the servants of-him to-call the-ones invited to the wedding-feast[s], and they-did┘not└want </em><em>to-come</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Again he-sent other servants, saying, ‘Say to-the ones invited, “Behold, the meal of-me I-have prepared, the oxen of-me and the grain-fed-c</span>

### are) butchered. All-things (are) ready. Come to the feast[s].”’ 5But the/they, not-paying-any-attention, went-away, one to [the] his field, and one to the business of-him. 6And the rest, having-grabbed the servants of-him, treated-(them)-disgracefully and killed (them). 7And the king was-furious and, having-sent the soldiers of-him, destroyed [the] those murderers and burned the city of-them. 8Then he-tells the servants of-him, ‘The wedding-feast is ready, but the-ones invited were not worthy. 9So go into the main-roads of-the roads and as-many-as you-find invite to the marriage-feast[s].’ 10And having-gone-out into the roads, [the] those servants assembled all whom they-found, both evil and good, and the wedding-feast was-filled of-reclining-ones-at-table. 11And the king, having-come-in to-inspect the-ones reclining-at-table, saw there (a) man not dressed in-dress of-(a)-wedding-feast, 12and he-says to-him, ‘Friend, how did-you-come-in here not having dress of-(a)-wedding-feast?’ And the/he was-speechless. 13Then the king said to-the servers, ‘Having-bound him feet and hands, throw┘him└out into the outer [the] darkness. [The] crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be there. 14For many are called, but few (are) chosen.’”


<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then having-gone, the Pharisees took counsel in-order-that they-might-trap him in word. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And they-sent to-him the disciples of-them with the Herodians, saying, <em>“Teacher, we-know that you-are true and you-teach the way of-[the] God in truth and it-is┘not└ (a)-concern to-you about nobody/anybody, for you-do┘not└look on (the) face of-(a)-man.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>So tell us what </em><em>it-seems</em><em> </em><em>to-you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Is-it-lawful</em><em> </em><em>to-pay</em><em> tribute </em><em>to-Caesar</em><em> or not.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-known the wickedness of-them, said, <em>“Why are-you-testing me, hypocrites?</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>19</sup></em></strong><em>Show me the coin of-the tribute.”</em><em> </em> And the/they bring-to him (a) denarius.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And he-says to-them, <em>“Of-whom (is) this [the] image and [the] inscription?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>They say to-him,<em> “Caesar’s.”</em><em> </em> Then he-says to-them, <em>“So pay the-things of-Caesar to-Caesar and the-things of-[the] God to-[the] God.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And having-heard, they-marveled, and having-left him, they-went-away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>On that [the] day Sadducees came-to him—saying resurrection not to-be, and they-asked him, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Teacher, Moses said, </em><strong><em>‘If any (man) dies not having children, the brother of-him shall-marry the wife of-</em></strong><strong><em>him</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> and</em></strong><strong><em> shall-raise-up seed to-the brother of-him.’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Now seven brothers were with us.</em><em> </em><em>And the first, having-married, died, and not having seed, he-left the wife of-him to-the brother of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Likewise also the second and the third unto the seven.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And last of-all, the woman died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>So in the </em><em>resurrection </em><em>of-which</em><em> of-the seven will-she-h</em><em>er (the) wife.?</em><em> </em><em>For they┘all└had her.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“You-err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>For in the resurrection they┘neither└marry nor are-given-in-marriage, but they-are like angels in [the] heaven.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup><em>And concerning [the] resurrection of-the dead, did-you┘not└read the-thing said to-you by [the] God, saying, </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><strong><em>‘I am the God of-Abraham and the God of-Isaac and the God of-Jacob’</em></strong><em>?</em><em> </em><em>He-is not [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> God of-dead-ones but of-living-ones.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>And having-heard, the crowd[s] were-astounded at the teaching of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the Pharisees, having-heard that he-silenced the Sadducees, gathered-together to the same/together<sup>3</sup>, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>and one of-them [(a) lawyer]<sup>ms</sup> asked, testing him, <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>“Teacher, what commandment in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw (is) greatest?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>And the/he said to-him, <em>“</em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>You-shall-love (the) Lord the God of-you with the whole [the] heart of-you and with the whole soul of-you’ </em></strong><em>and with the whole mind of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>This is the great and first commandment.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>(The) second (is) like it, </em><strong><em>‘You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself.’</em></strong><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>On these [the] two commandments hang/</em><em>depend</em><em> the whole </em><em>L</em><em>aw and the prophets.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the Pharisees gathered-together, [the] Jesus asked them, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>saying, <em>“What does-it-seem to-you about the Messiah?</em><em> </em><em>[The] son of-whom is-he?”</em><em> </em> They-say to-him, <em>“(The Son) of-[the] David.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>He-says to-them, <em>“How then does┘</em><em>David by (the) Spirit</em><em>└call him Lord, saying,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><strong><em>‘(</em></strong><strong><em>The) Lord said to-the Lord of-me,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	“Sit on (the) right[s] of-me,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	until</em></strong><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong><strong><em> I-put the enemies of-you under the feet of-you”?’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup><em>If then David calls him Lord, how is-he (the) Son of-him?”</em><em> </em></span>
