## Matthew Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And morning having-come, all the chief-priests and the elders of-the people took counsel against [the] Jesus so to-put┘him└to death; 2and having-bound him, they-led┘(him)└away and delivered (him) to Pilate the governor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> The Judas the traitor, having-seen that he-was-condemned, having-regretted, returned the thirty [the] silver[s]-shekels to-the chief-priests and elders, 4saying, "I-sinned, having-betrayed innocent blood."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-thrown the silver-shekels into the sanctuary, he-departed; and having-gone-away, he-hanged himself. 6And the chief-priests, having taken the silver-shekels, said, "It-is┘not└lawful to-put them in the Treasury, because it-is (the) price of-blood." 7And having-taken counsel, they-bought from them the field of-the potter as (a) grave for-[the] foreigners. 8Wherefore [the] that field was-called Field of-Blood unto the today. 9Then the-thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was-fulfilled, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And [the] Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the king of-the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And in [the] his being-accused by the chief-priests and elders, he-answered nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then Pilate says to-him, "You-hear┘, do-you not,└how-many-things they-are accusing you-of?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And he-did┘not└answer him about not-even one word, so-that the governor marveled exceedingly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Now according-to (the) feast/at every feast the governor was-accustomed to-release to-the people (a) prisoner that they-were-wanting. 16And at-the time they-were-holding (a) notorious prisoner called [Jesus]ms Barabbas. 17So they gathered-together, [the] Pilate said to-them, "Which do-you-want (that) I-shall-release to-you, [Jesus [the]]ms Barabbas or Jesus the-one called Messiah?" 18For he-knew that they-delivered┘him└up because-of jealousy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And he sitting on the judgment-seat, the wife of-him sent to him, saying, "Nothing to-you and [the] that righteous-(man), for I-suffered many-things today in (a) dream/by dream because-of him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the chief-priests and the elders persuaded the crowd[s] in-order-that the-might-ask-for [the] Barabbas, and destroy [the] Jesus. 21And the governor, having-answered, said to-them, "Which of the two do-you-want (that) I-shall-release to-you?" 22[The] Pilate says to-them, "What then shall-I-do-with Jesus the-one called Messiah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And the/he said, "For what evil-thing did-he-do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And [the] Pilate, having-seen that he-was-availing nothing, but rather (that) (a) riot is/was-becoming, having-taken water, he-washed the/his hands in-front-of the crowd, saying, "I-am-innocent of the blood of-the-one. You see-to-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And having-answered, all the people said, "The blood of-him (be) on us and on the children of-us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then he-released to-them [the] Barabbas, and having-scourged [the] Jesus, he-delivered┘(him)└over in-order-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then the soldiers of-the governor, having-taken┘[the] Jesus└aside into the Praetorium, gathered to-him the whole cohort. 28And having-stripped him, they-put┘(a) scarlet military-robe└on him, 29and, having-woven (a) crown out-of thorns, they-put (it) on the head of-him and (a) reed in the right (hand) of-him, and having-knelt in-front-of him, they-mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of-the Jews!" 30And having-spit on him, they-took the reed and started-beating (him) on the head of-him. 31And when they-mocked him, they-took┘the military-robe└off-of him and put┘the clothes of-him└on him and led┘him└away into [the] crucifying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And going-out, they-found (a) Cyrenian man, Simon by name. This-one they-conscripted in-order-that he-might-carry the cross of-him. 33And having-gone-out to (a) place called Golgotha, that is, called Place of-(the)-Skull, 34they-offered him wine mixed with gall; and having-tasted (it), he-did┘not└want to-drink (it). 35And having-crucified him, they-divided the clothes of-him, casting (a) lot. 36And sitting-down, they-were-watching him there. 37And they-put above the head of-him the accusation of-him written: "This is Jesus the King of-the Jews." 38Then two insurrectionists are-being-crucified with him, one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s]. 39And the-ones walking-by were-insulting him, shaking the heads of-them 40and saying, "The-one-tearing-down the sanctuary and in three days building (it), save yourself, if you-are (the) Son of-[the] God, [and]ms come-down from the cross."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Likewise also the chief-priests, mocking (him) with the scribes and elders, were-saying, 42"He-saved others; he-is┘not└able to-save himself! He-is (the) King of Israel! Let-him-come-down from the cross, and we-will-believe on him. 43He-trusted on [the] God; let-him┘now└rescue (him) if he-wants him; for he-said [that], 'I-am (the) Son of-God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> And the same (way) also the insurrectionists [the-ones] crucified with him were-insulting him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until (the) ninth hour. 46And about the ninth how [the] ninth hour. 46And about the ninth hour [the] Jesus cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "God of-me, God of-me, why did-you-desert me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> And some of-the-ones standing there, having-heard, began-to-say [that], "This-one is-calling Elijah." 48And immediately one of them, having-run and having-taken (a) sponge and having-filled (it) with-wine and having put┘(it)└around (a) reed, began-to-give┘him└ (a)-drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And the rest were-saying, "Let us-see if Elijah comes saving him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And [the] Jesus again having-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, let-go the breath/spirit. 51And behold the curtain of-the sanctuary was-torn into two from top to bottom, and the ground was-shaken, and the bed-rocks split. 52And the tombs were-opened and many bodies of-the dead saints were-raised, 53and, having-come-out-of the tombs after the resurrection of-him, they-entered into the holy city and appeared to-many. 54And the centurion and the-ones watching [the] Jesus with him, having-seen the earthquake and the-things having-happened, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this-(man) was (the) Son of-God." 55And many women were there, watching from afar, who followed [the] Jesus from [the] Galilee ministering to-him, among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of-[the] James and Joses, and the mother of-the sons of-Zebedee. 57And evening-coming, (a) rich man from Arimathea, came, Joseph by name, who also himself was-(a)-disciple to-[the] Jesus. 58This-one, having-gone-to [the] Pilate, asked-for the body of-[the] Jesus. Then [the] Pilate commanded (it) to-be-turned-over (to him). 59And having-taken the body, [the] Joseph wrapped it in (a) clean linen-cloth, 60and put it in the new tomb of-him, which was-hewn in the bedrock; and having-rolled┘(a) large stone└to-the door of-the tomb, he-left. 61And Mary the Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting across-from the grave. 62And on-the next-day, which is after [the] Preparation, the chief-priests and the Pharisees gather to Pilate, 63saying, "Lord, we-remember that that [the] deceiver said, still living, 'After three days I-am-resurrecting.' 64So command the grave to-be-made-safe until the third day, lest, having-come, the disciples of-him steal him and say to-the people, 'He-was-resurrected from the dead,' and the last deception will-be worse than-the first." 65[The] Pilate said to-them, "You-have (a) guard. Go make┘it└as-safe as you-know." 66And the/they, having-gone, made┘the grave└safe, having-sealed the stone along-with the guard.</span>
