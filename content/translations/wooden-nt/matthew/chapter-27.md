## Matthew Chapter **27**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And morning having-come, all the chief-priests and the elders of-the people took counsel against [the] Jesus so to-put┘him└to death; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and having-bound him, they-led┘(him)└away and delivered (him) to Pilate the governor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The Judas the traitor, having-seen that he-was-condemned, having-regretted, returned the thirty [the] silver[s]-shekels to-the chief-priests and elders, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>saying, <em>“I-sinned, having-betrayed innocent blood.”</em><em> </em> And the/they said,<em> “What to us; you will-see (to it).”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And having-thrown the silver-shekels into the sanctuary, he-departed; and having-gone-away, he-hanged himself. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the chief-priests, having taken the silver-shekels, said, <em>“It-is┘not└lawful to-put them in the Treasury, because it-is (the) price of-blood.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And having-taken counsel, they-bought from them the field of-the potter as (a) grave for-[the] foreigners. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Wherefore [the] that field was-called Field of-Blood unto the today. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then the-thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was-fulfilled, saying, <strong><em>“And they-took the thirty silver-shekels,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the price of-the one priced</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	whom they-priced from (the) sons of-</em></strong><strong><em>Israel;</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup><strong><em>and they-gave them for the field of-the potter, as (the) Lord </em></strong> <strong><em>instructed me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, <em>“Are you the king of-the Jews?”</em><em> </em> And [the] Jesus said, “You say/Yes.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And in [the] his being-accused by the chief-priests and elders, he-answered nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Then Pilate says to-him, <em>“You-hear</em><em>┘, do-you </em><em>n</em><em>ot,└</em><em>how-many-things they-are </em><em>accusing you-of?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>And he-did┘not└answer him about not-even one word, so-that the governor marveled exceedingly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Now according-to (the) feast/at every feast the governor was-accustomed to-release to-the people (a) prisoner that they-were-wanting. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And at-the time they-were-holding (a) notorious prisoner called [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> Barabbas. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So they gathered-together, [the] Pilate said to-them, <em>“Which do-you-want (that) I-shall-release to-you, </em><em>[</em><em>Jesus [the]</em><em>]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> Barabbas or Jesus the-one called Messiah?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For he-knew that they-delivered┘him└up because-of jealousy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>And he sitting on the judgment-seat, the wife of-him sent to him, saying<em>, “Nothing to-you and </em><em>[the] that</em><em> righteous-(man), for I-suffered many-things today </em><em>in (a) dream/by dream</em><em> because-of him.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And the chief-priests and the elders persuaded the crowd[s] in-order-that the-might-ask-for [the] Barabbas, and destroy [the] Jesus. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And the governor, having-answered, said to-them, <em>“Which of the two do-you-want (that) I-shall-release to-you?”</em> And the/they said, <em>“[The] Barabbas.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[The] Pilate says to-them, <em>“What then shall-I-do-with Jesus the-one called Messiah?”</em> They┘all└say, <em>“Crucify him!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And the/he said, <em>“For what evil-thing did-he-do?”</em> And the/they began-to-shout all-the-more, saying, <em>“Let-him-be-crucified!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>And [the] Pilate, having-seen that he-was-availing nothing, but rather (that) (a) riot is/was-becoming, having-taken water, he-washed the/his hands in-front-of the crowd, saying, <em>“I-am-innocent of the blood of-the-one.</em><em> </em><em>You see-to-it.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>And having-answered, all the people said, <em>“The blood of-him (be) on us and on the children of-us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Then he-released to-them [the] Barabbas, and having-scourged [the] Jesus, he-delivered┘(him)└over in-order-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then the soldiers of-the governor, having-taken┘[the] Jesus└aside into the Praetorium, gathered to-him the whole cohort. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And having-stripped him, they-put┘(a) scarlet military-robe└on him, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>and, having-woven (a) crown out-of thorns, they-put (it) on the head of-him and (a) reed in the right (hand) of-him, and having-knelt in-front-of him, they-mocked him, saying, <em>“Hail, King of-the Jews!”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And having-spit on him, they-took the reed and started-beating (him) on the head of-him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And when they-mocked him, they-took┘the military-robe└off-of him and put┘the clothes of-him└on him and led┘him└away into [the] crucifying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And going-out, they-found (a) Cyrenian man, Simon by name. This-one they-conscripted in-order-that he-might-carry the cross of-him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And having-gone-out to (a) place called Golgotha, that is, called Place of-(the)-Skull, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>they-offered him wine mixed with gall; and having-tasted (it), he-did┘not└want to-drink (it). <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And having-crucified him, they-divided the clothes of-him, casting (a) lot. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And sitting-down, they-were-watching him there. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And they-put above the head of-him the accusation of-him written: <em>“This is Jesus the King of-the Jews.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Then two insurrectionists are-being-crucified with him, one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s]. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And the-ones walking-by were-insulting him, shaking the heads of-them <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>and saying, <em>“The-one-tearing-down the sa</em><em>n</em><em>ctuary and in three days building (it), save yourself, if you-are (the) Son of-[the] God</em><em>,</em><em> [and]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> come-down from the cross.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Likewise also the chief-priests, mocking (him) with the scribes and elders, were-saying, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>“He-saved others; he-is┘not└able to-save himself!</em><em> </em><em>He-is (the) King of Israel!</em><em> </em><em>Let-him-come-down from the cross, and we-will-believe </em><em>on</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>He-trusted on [the] God; let-him┘now└rescue (him) if he-wants him; for he-said </em><em>[that],</em><em> ‘I-am (the) Son of-God.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>And the same (way) also the insurrectionists [the-ones] crucified with him were-insulting him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until (the) ninth hour. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And about the ninth how [the] ninth hour. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And about the ninth hour [the] Jesus cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, saying, <strong><em>“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?”</em></strong><em> that is, </em><strong><em>“God of-me, God of-me, why did-you-desert me?”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>And some of-the-ones standing there, having-heard, began-to-say [that], <em>“</em><em>This-one is-calling Elijah.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong>And immediately one of them, having-run and having-taken (a) sponge and having-filled (it) with-wine and having put┘(it)└around (a) reed, began-to-give┘him└ (a)-drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>And the rest were-saying, <em>“Let us-see if Elijah comes saving him.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus again having-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, let-go the breath/spirit. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And behold the curtain of-the sanctuary was-torn into two from top to bottom, and the ground was-shaken, and the bed-rocks split. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>And the tombs were-opened and many bodies of-the dead saints were-raised, <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>and, having-come-out-of the tombs after the resurrection of-him, they-entered into the holy city and appeared to-many. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>And the centurion and the-ones watching [the] Jesus with him, having-seen the earthquake and the-things having-happened, feared exceedingly, saying, <em>“Truly this-(man) was (the) Son of-God.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>55</sup></strong>And many women were there, watching from afar, who followed [the] Jesus from [the] Galilee ministering to-him, among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of-[the] James and Joses, and the mother of-the sons of-Zebedee.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>And evening-coming, (a) rich man from Arimathea, came, Joseph by name, who also himself was-(a)-disciple to-[the] Jesus. <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>This-one, having-gone-to [the] Pilate, asked-for the body of-[the] Jesus. Then [the] Pilate commanded (it) to-be-turned-over (to him). <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>And having-taken the body, [the] Joseph wrapped it in (a) clean linen-cloth, <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>and put it in the new tomb of-him, which was-hewn in the bedrock; and having-rolled┘(a) large stone└to-the door of-the tomb, he-left. <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>And Mary the Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting across-from the grave.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And on-the next-day, which is after [the] Preparation, the chief-priests and the Pharisees gather to Pilate, <strong><sup>63</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Lord, we-remember tha</em><em>t that [the] deceiver said, stil</em><em>l living, ‘After three days I-am-resurrecting.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>So command the grave to-be-made-safe until the third day, lest, having-come, the disciples of-him steal him and say to-the people, ‘He-was-resurrected from the dead,’ and the last deception will-be worse than-the first.”</em> <strong><sup>65</sup></strong>[The] Pilate said to-them, <em>“You-have (a) guard.</em><em> </em><em>Go make┘it└as-safe as you-</em><em>k</em><em>now.”</em> <strong><sup>66</sup></strong>And the/they, having-gone, made┘the grave└safe, having-sealed the stone along-with the guard.</span>
