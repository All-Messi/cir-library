## Matthew Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In that [the] hour the disciples came-to [the] Jesus, saying, "Who is greater/greatest in the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And having-called (a) little-child, stood him in (the) midst of-them, 3and said, "Truly I-say to-you, if you-do┘not└turn and become like [the] little-children, you-will┘certainly not└enter into the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s]. 4So whoever humbles himself like [the] this little-child—this is the greater/greatest in the kingdom of-[the] heaven, 5and whoever receives one such little-child in (the) name of-me, receives me. 6"But whoever causes┘one of-[the] these little-ones [the-ones] believing in me└to-stumble, it-would-be-better for-him in-order-that (a) millstone of-(a)-donkey is-hung around the neck of-him, and he-be-drowned in the depths of-the sea. 7Woe to-the world from [the] offenses, for it-is-necessary, except woe to-the man through whom the offense comes. 8And if the hand of-you or the foot of-you offends you, cut┘it└off and throw (it) from you. It-is good/better for-you to-enter into [the] life deformed or lame than having two hands or two feet to-be-thrown in to [the] eternal [the] fire. 9And if the eye of-you offends you, pull┘it└out and throw (it) away-from you. It-is good/better for-you to-enter into [the] life one-eyed than having two eyes to-be-thrown into the Gehenna of-[the] fire. 10"See (that) you-do┘not└look-down-on/disregard the angels of-them in heaven[s] continually2 see the face of-the Father of-me [the] in heaven[s]. [11]ms 12What does-it-see, to-you? If (a) hundred sheep are to-any man and one of them strays, will-he┘not└leave the ninety nine on the hills and, having-gone, looks-for the straying-one? 13And if to-find it happens, truly I-say to-you that he-rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine [the] not straying-ones. 14So also it-is not (the) will before the Father of-you [the] in heaven[s] [in-order]-that one of-[the] these little-ones be-lost. 15"And if the brother of-you sin [against you]ms, go, confront him between you and him alone. If he-listens-to you, you-gained the brother of-you. 16But if he-does┘not└listen, take-along with you yet one or two, in-order-that 'at (the) mouth of-two witnesses or three every matter may-be-established.' 17But if he refuses-to-listen-to them, speak to-the church. And if he-refuses┘even└to-listen-to the church, let-him-be to-you like the/a Gentile and the/a tax-collector. 18"Truly I-say to-you, as-many-things-as2 youpl-bind on [the] earth will-certainly-be-bound2 in heaven, and as-many-things-as2 youpl-loose on [the] earth will-certainly-be-loosed2 in heaven. 19Again [truly]ms I-say to-you that if two of you agree on [the] earth about every matter whatever2 you-may-ask, it-will-be to-them from the Father of-me in heaven[s]. 20For where two or three are gathered in [the] my name, I-am there in (the) midst of-them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then having-come-to (him), [the] Peter said to-him, "Lord, how-many-times will┘the brother of-me└sin against me and I-forgive him? Until seven-times?" "I-do┘not└say to-you seven-times, but until seventy┘seven└times. 23On-account-of this, the kingdom of-[the] heaven[s] was-likened to-(a)-king man, who wanted to-settle accounts with the servants of-him. 24And he having-begun to-settle (then), one debtor of-(a)-ten-thousand talents was-brought-to him. 25And he not having to-pay, the lord commanded him and the wife (of him) and the children (of him) and all-things as-many-as he-has/had to-be-sold, and (the debt) to-be-payed. 26So having-fallen-down, the servant prostrated to-him, saying, "Be-patience with me, and I-will-repay all-things to-you. 27And having-been-moved-with-compassion, the lord of-[the] that servant released him and forgive him the debt. 28And [the] that servant, having-gone-out, found one of-the fellow-servants of-him, who owed him (a) hundred denarii; and having-grabbed him, began-to-choke (him), saying, 'Pay what2 you-owe.' 29Then the fellow-servant of-him, having-fallen-down, pleaded-with him, saying, 'Be-patient with me, and I-will-repay you.' 30But the/he was┘not└willing, but having-gone-away, cast him into prison until he-should-repay the-thing owed. 31So having-seen, the fellow-servants of-him were┘exceedingly└grieved with-respect-to-the-things having-happened; and having-gone, they-reported to-the lord of-them all the-things having-happened. 32Then having-summoned him, the lord of-him says to-him, 'Wicked servant, I-forgave you all [the] that debt, when you-appealed-to me. 33Was-it┘not└necessary also for-you to-have-mercy-on the fellow-servant of-you, as I-also had-mercy-on you?' 34And having-been-angered, the lord of-him delivered him to-the tormentors until2 he-should-repay everything [the] being-owed. 35Thus also the heavenly [the] Father of-me will-do to-you, unless2 each forgives the brother of-him from the hearts of-you."</span>
