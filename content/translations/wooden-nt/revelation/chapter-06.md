## Revelation Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And I-looked when the Lamb opened-up one of the seven seals, and I-heard one of the four living-beings saying like (the) sound of-thunder, <em>“Come.”</em>  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-looked, and behold, (a) white horse and the-one sitting on it having (a) bow; and (a) crown was-given to-him, and he-went-out conquering and in-order-that he-might-conquer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And when he-opened the second [the] seal, I-heard the second living-being, saying, <em>“Come.”</em>  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And another, fiery-red horse came-out, and to-the-one sitting on it was-given [to-him] to-take peace out-of the earth and in-order-that they-will murder one-another and (a) big sword was-given to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And when he-opened the third [the] seal, I-heard the third living-being, saying, <em>“Come.”</em>  And I-looked, and behold, (a) black horse, and the-one sitting on it having (a) scales in the hand of-him.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And I-heard as-it-were/like (a) voice in the midst of-the four living-beings, saying, <em>“(A) quart of-wheat of</em><em>/for</em><em>-(a)-denarius and three quarts of-barley of</em><em>/for</em><em>-(a)-denarius, and the olive-oil and the wine </em><em>do┘not└waste</em><em>/harm.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And when he-opened the fourth [the] seal, I-heard (the) voice of-the fourth living-being, saying, <em>“Come.”</em>  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And I-looked, and behold (a) pale-green horse and the-one sitting on it—name to-him [the]<sup>ms</sup> Death, and the grave/[the] Hades was-following with him, and authority was-given to-them over/on the/a fourth of-the earth to-kill with (the) sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of-the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And when he-opened the fifth sea, I-saw under the altar the souls of-the-ones having-been-slain on-account-of the word of-[the] God and on-account-of the testimony that they-were-having.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And they-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, saying, <em>“Until when, [the] Master [the] holy a</em><em>n</em><em>d true, </em><em>are-you┘not└judging</em><em> and avenging the blood of-us from the-ones dwelling on the earth?”  </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And (a) white robe was-given to-each, and it-was-said to-them [in-order]-that they-would/should-rest until (a) little time, until also the fellow-slaves of-them and the brothers of-them the-ones going to-be-killed as also they (were) are-fulfilled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-saw when he-opened the sixth the] seal, and (a) great earthquake occurred, and the sun became black like sackcloth of-hair, and the whole moon became like blood, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and the stars of-the sky fell on the earth, as (a) fig-tree casts/drops/loses the  unripe-figs of-it shaken by (a) great/strong wind.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And the sky vanished like (as) rolled-up scroll, and every mountain and island was-moved out-of the places of-them.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the kings of-the earth and the persons-of-high-status and the chiliarchs/tribunes and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of-the mountains, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and they-say to-the mountains and the rocks, <em>“Fall on us, and hide us from (the) face of-the-One sitting on the throne and from the wrath of-the Lamb, </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> the great [the] day of</em><em>–the wrath of-them came, and who is-able to-stand?”</em></span>
