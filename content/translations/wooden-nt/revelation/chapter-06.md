## Revelation Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-looked when the Lamb opened-up one of the seven seals, and I-heard one of the four living-beings saying like (the) sound of-thunder, "Come."  2And I-looked, and behold, (a) white horse and the-one sitting on it having (a) bow; and (a) crown was-given to-him, and he-went-out conquering and in-order-that he-might-conquer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And when he-opened the second [the] seal, I-heard the second living-being, saying, "Come."  4And another, fiery-red horse came-out, and to-the-one sitting on it was-given [to-him] to-take peace out-of the earth and in-order-that they-will murder one-another and (a) big sword was-given to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And when he-opened the third [the] seal, I-heard the third living-being, saying, "Come."  And I-looked, and behold, (a) black horse, and the-one sitting on it having (a) scales in the hand of-him.  6And I-heard as-it-were/like (a) voice in the midst of-the four living-beings, saying, "(A) quart of-wheat of/for-(a)-denarius and three quarts of-barley of/for-(a)-denarius, and the olive-oil and the wine do┘not└waste/harm."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And when he-opened the fourth [the] seal, I-heard (the) voice of-the fourth living-being, saying, "Come."  8And I-looked, and behold (a) pale-green horse and the-one sitting on it—name to-him [the]ms Death, and the grave/[the] Hades was-following with him, and authority was-given to-them over/on the/a fourth of-the earth to-kill with (the) sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of-the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And when he-opened the fifth sea, I-saw under the altar the souls of-the-ones having-been-slain on-account-of the word of-[the] God and on-account-of the testimony that they-were-having.  10And they-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, saying, "Until when, [the] Master [the] holy and true, are-you┘not└judging and avenging the blood of-us from the-ones dwelling on the earth?"  11And (a) white robe was-given to-each, and it-was-said to-them [in-order]-that they-would/should-rest until (a) little time, until also the fellow-slaves of-them and the brothers of-them the-ones going to-be-killed as also they (were) are-fulfilled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And I-saw when he-opened the sixth the] seal, and (a) great earthquake occurred, and the sun became black like sackcloth of-hair, and the whole moon became like blood, 13and the stars of-the sky fell on the earth, as (a) fig-tree casts/drops/loses the  unripe-figs of-it shaken by (a) great/strong wind.  14And the sky vanished like (as) rolled-up scroll, and every mountain and island was-moved out-of the places of-them.  15And the kings of-the earth and the persons-of-high-status and the chiliarchs/tribunes and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of-the mountains, 16and they-say to-the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from (the) face of-the-One sitting on the throne and from the wrath of-the Lamb, 17because the great [the] day of–the wrath of-them came, and who is-able to-stand?"</span>
