## Revelation Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I-saw (a) star out-of the sky having-fallen on the earth, and the/a key of-the pit of-the abyss was-given to-him.  2And he-opened the pit of-the abyss, and smoke came-up out-of the pit like (the) smoke of-(a)-large furnace, and the sun and the air was-darkened out-of/by the smoke of-the pit; 3and out-of the smoke locusts came onto the earth, and authority/power was-given to-them like [the] scorpions of-the earth have authority/power.  4And it-was-said to-them [in-order]-that they-would┘not└injure/harm the grass of-the ground/earth nor any green-plant or any tree, except2/only2 the men who do┘not└have the seal of-[the] God on the/their foreheads.  5And it-was-given to-them [in-order]-that they-will-torment (them) for five months, and the torment of-them (was) like (the) torment of-(a)-scorpion when it-stings (a) person.  6And in [the] those days [the] men will-seek [the] death and will┘certainly not└find it, and they-will-long to-die, and [the] death flees from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the likenesses/appearances of-the locusts (were) like horses prepared for battle; and on the heads of-them (were), as-it-were, crowns like gold, and the faces of-them (were) like faces of-men; 8and they-were-having hair[s] like (the) hair[s] of-women, and the teeth of-them were like (the teeth) of-lions, 9and they-were-having breastplates of-iron, and the sound of-the wings of-them (was) like (the) sound of-(the)-chariots of-many horses running into battle.  10And they-have tails like scorpions and stingers, and in the tails of-them (is) the power of-them to-harm [the] men five months, 11they-have on them (a) king, the angel of-the abyss, (the) name to-him in-Hebrew (is) Abaddon, and in [the] Greek he-has (the) name Apollyon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The one [the] woe went-away; behold still (a) two woe is-coming after these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the sixth angel trumpeted.  And I-heard one/a voice of the [four]ms horns of-the gold [the] altar [the] before [the] God, 14saying to-the sixth angel the-one having the trumpet, "Release the four angels [the] bound at the great [the] river Euphrates."  15And the four angels were-released, the-ones prepared for the hour and day and month and year, in-order-that they-might-kill the/a third of-[the] men.  16And the number of-the soldiers of-the cavalry (was) twenty-thousand (times) ten thousand/200,000,000, and I-heard the number of-them.  17And thus I saw [the] horses in the vision and the-ones sitting on them, having breastplates fiery-red and hyacinth-colored and sulfur-yellow; and the heads of-the horses (were) like heads of-lions and out-of the mouths of-them comes fire and smoke and sulfur/brimstone.  18From [the] these three plagues the/a third of-[the] men were-killed—by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur [the] coming out of-the mouths of-them.  19For the power of-the horses is in the mouth of them and in the tails of-them, for the tails of-them (are) like snakes, having heads and with them they-hurt/harm.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the remaining-ones of-[the] men, who were┘not└killed by [the] these plagues, neither repented of the works of-the hands of-them, [in-order]-that they-would┘not└worship [the] demons and the gold and [the] silver and [the] bronze and [the] stone and [the] wooden [the] idols, that are┘not└able to-see or hear or walk.  21And they did┘not└repent of-the adulteries of-them or of the sorceries of-them or of the sexual-immoralities of-them or of the thefts of-them.</span>
