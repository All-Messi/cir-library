## Revelation Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things I-heard as-it-were (the) loud voice of-(a)-large multitude in [the] heaven, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And (a)-second-(time) they-said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the twenty four [the] elders and the four living-beings fell-down and worshiped [the] God the-One sitting on the throne, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And (a) voice from the throne came-out, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And I-heard as-it-were (the) sound of-(a)-large crowd and as-it-were (the) sound of-many-waters and as-it-were (the) sound of thunders, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Let-us-rejoice and let-us-be-glad,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he-says to-me, "Blessed (are) the-ones called to the dinner/marriage-feast of-the Lamb."  And he-says to-me, "These [the] words of-[the] God are true."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And I-fell-(down) before the feet of-him to-worship him, and he-says to-me, "See not (to do it).  I-am (a) fellow-servant of-you and the brothers of-you the-ones having the testimony of-Jesus.  Worship God, for the testimony of-Jesus is the spirit of-[the] prophecy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And I-saw the sky/[the] heaven opened, and behold (there was a) white horse and the-One sitting on it (was) [called]ms faithful and true, and in righteousness he-judges and makes-war.  12And the eyes of-him (were) as-it-were (a) flame of-fire, and on the head of-him (were) many diadems, having (a) name written that nobody knows except2 himself.  13And (he was) clothed with (a) garment dipped/bathed in/with-blood, and the name of-him has-been-called the word of-[the] God.  14And the armies [the-ones] in [the] heaven were-following him on white horses, dressed in clean white linen.  15And out-of the mouth of-him (a) sharp sword was-going-out/was-sticking-out, in-order-that with it he-might strike the nations, and he-himself/he will-shepherd hem with (an) iron rod, and he-himself/he walks/tramples the winepress of-the wine of-the wrath of-the anger of-[the] God the Almighty.  16And he-has on the garment and on the thigh of-him (a) name written:  "KING OF-KINGS" and "LORD OF-LORDS."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And I-saw one/an angel standing on the sun, and he-shouted [with]ms (a) loud voice, saying to-all the birds [the-ones] flying in (the) midst-of-heaven/(the)-sky, "Come, be-gathered to the great [the] feast of-[the] God, 18in-order-that you-may-eat the flesh[es] of-kings and (the) flesh[es] of-tribunes and (the) flesh[es] of-strong-ones and (the) flesh[es] of-horses and of–the-ones sitting on them and (the) flesh[es] both of-all freemen and slaves and small and great."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And I-saw the beast and the kings of-the earth and the armies of-them gathered to-make war with the-One sitting on the horse and with the army of-him.  20And the beast was-seized and with him the false prophet the-one having-done the signs before him, by-which he-deceived the-ones having-received the mark of-the beast and the-ones worshiping the image of-him.  And the two were-thrown, living, into the lake of-[the] fire burning with sulphur.  21And the rest were-killed by the sword the-one having-come out-of the mouth of-him, of-the-One sitting on the horse, and all the birds were-fully-satisfied from the flesh[es] of-them.</span>
