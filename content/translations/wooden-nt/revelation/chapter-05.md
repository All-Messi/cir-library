<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw on the right (hand) of-the-One sitting on the throne (a) book/scroll written inside/front and out/back, securely-sealed with-seven seals.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-saw (a) strong angel proclaiming with (a) loud voice, <em>“Who (is) worthy to-open-up the book/scroll and to-undo</em><em>/break</em><em> the seals of-it?”  </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And nobody was-able in [the] heaven neither on [the] earth nor under the earth to-open-up the book/scroll nor to-look-at it.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And I-was-crying/began-to-cry much, because nobody was-found worthy to-open-up the book/scroll nor to-look-at it.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And one of the elders says to-me, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not└cry</em><em>.  Behold, the lion [the] of the tribe of-Judah, the root of-David</em><em>,</em><em> conquered/overcame to-open-up the book/scroll and the seven seals of-it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And I-saw in (the) midst of-the throne and the four living-beings and in-(the) midst of-the elders (a) Lamb standing as-if having-been-slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of-[the] God, sent into all the earth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And he-came and has-received/taken out-of the right (hand) of-the-One sitting on the throne.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And when he-received/took the book/scroll, the four living-beings and the twenty(-)four elders fell before the Lamb, having each (a) harp and gold bowls<sup>fem</sup> having-been-full of-incense[s]<sup>neut</sup>, which<sup>fem</sup> are the prayers of-the saints; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and they-sing (a) new song, saying, <em>“Worthy you-are to-receive/take the book/scroll,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd to-open the seals of-</em><em>it;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>b</em><em>ecause you-were-slain</em><em>,</em><em> and you-bought for-[the] God with the blood of-you</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>f</em><em>rom every tribe and language and people and </em><em>nation;</em></span>
