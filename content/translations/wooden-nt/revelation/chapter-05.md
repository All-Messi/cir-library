## Revelation Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw on the right (hand) of-the-One sitting on the throne (a) book/scroll written inside/front and out/back, securely-sealed with-seven seals.  2And I-saw (a) strong angel proclaiming with (a) loud voice, "Who (is) worthy to-open-up the book/scroll and to-undo/break the seals of-it?"  3And nobody was-able in [the] heaven neither on [the] earth nor under the earth to-open-up the book/scroll nor to-look-at it.  4And I-was-crying/began-to-cry much, because nobody was-found worthy to-open-up the book/scroll nor to-look-at it.  5And one of the elders says to-me, "Do┘not└cry.  Behold, the lion [the] of the tribe of-Judah, the root of-David, conquered/overcame to-open-up the book/scroll and the seven seals of-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And I-saw in (the) midst of-the throne and the four living-beings and in-(the) midst of-the elders (a) Lamb standing as-if having-been-slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of-[the] God, sent into all the earth. 7And he-came and has-received/taken out-of the right (hand) of-the-One sitting on the throne.  8And when he-received/took the book/scroll, the four living-beings and the twenty(-)four elders fell before the Lamb, having each (a) harp and gold bowlsfem having-been-full of-incense[s]neut, whichfem are the prayers of-the saints; 9and they-sing (a) new song, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And I-looked, and I-heard (the) sound/voice of-many angels around the throne and the living-beings and the elders, and the number of-them was ten-thousands of-ten thousands and thousands of-thousands, 12saying with-(a)-loud voice,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And every creation/creature that (was) in [the] heaven and on [the] earth and under the earth and on the sea and all the-things in them I-heard, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the four living-beings were-saying, "Amen."  And the elders fell-down and worshiped.</span>
