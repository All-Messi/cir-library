## Revelation Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw (a) beast coming-up out-of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns and on the horns of-it ten diadems and on the heads of-it (were) names of-blasphemy.  2And the beast that I-saw was like (a) leopardfem, and the feet of-it (was) like (a) bear and the mouth of-it (was) like (a) lion, and the dragon gave to-it the power of-it and the throne of-it and great authority.  3And (I-saw) one of-the heads of-it as-if slain unto death/fatally wounded, and the wound of-the death/fatal wound of-it was-healed.  And the whole earth was-amazed after/at the beast, 4and they-worship the dragon that gave [the] authority to-the beast, and they-worshiped the beast, saying, "Who (is) like the beast, and who is-able to-make-was with it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And (a) mouth speaking great-things and blasphemies was-given to-it, and authority was-given to-it to-make/use/do for-forty [and]ms two months.  6And it-opened the mouth of-it unto blasphemies against [the] rod to-blasphemy the name of-him and the tabernacle of-him, the-ones tabernacling in [the] heaven.  7And it-was-given to-it to-make war with the saints and to-conquer them, and authority was-given to-it over every tribe and people and language and nation.  8And all the-ones dwelling on the earth worshiped it, of-whom the name [of-him] is┘not└written in the book of-[the] life of-the Lamb [the] slain before [the] foundation of-(the)-world.  		( or, written before [the] foundation of-(the)-world in the book . . .)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> If anybody has (an) ear, let-him-hear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> If anybody (is) for captivity, into captivity he-goes. If anybody (is) for-being-killed with (a) sword, him to-be-killed with (a) sword. This is the patience and the faith of-the saints.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And I-saw another beast coming-up out-of the earth, and it-had two horns like (a) lamb, and it-was-speaking like (a) dragon, 12and it-exercises all the authority of-the first beast in-front-of it, and it-makes the earth and the-ones dwelling in-it in-order-that they-might-worship the first [the] beast, the wound of-[the] death of-which was-healed.  13And it-does great signs in-order-that it┘even└makes fire to-come-down out-of the sky onto the earth in-front-of [the] men, 14and it deceives the-ones dwelling on the earth on-account-of the signs that it-gave to-it to-do in-front-of the beast, saying to-the-ones dwelling on the earth to-make (an) image to-the beast that has the wound of-the sword and lived.  15And it-was-given to-it to-give breath to-the image of-the beast in-order-that the image of-the beast might┘└speak and do [in-order-that]ms as-many-as-ever2 do┘not└worship the image of-the beast would-be-put-to-death.  16And it-makes all—the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves—in-order-that they-might-give (a) stamp/mark to-them on the right [the] hands of-them or on the forehead of-them, 17and in-order-that anybody would be-able to-buy or to-sell except2 the- one having the stamp/mark, the name of-the beast or the number of-the name of-it.  18Here is [the] wisdom:  let┘the-one having discernment└figure-out the number of-the beast, it-is (the) number of-(a)-man, the number of-him (is) six-hundred sixty six.</span>
