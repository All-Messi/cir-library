## Revelation Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>(The) Revelation of-Jesus Christ that [the] God gave him to-show to-the servants of-him that are-necessary to-occur in quickness/soon, and he-signified (them), having-sent through the angel of-him to-the servant of-him, John, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>who testified the word of-[the] God and the testimony of-Jesus Christ as-many-things-as he-saw.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Blessed (is) the-one reading and the-ones hearing/heeding the words of-the prophecy and keeping the-things written in it, for the time (is) near.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>John, to-the seven churches [the] in [the] Asia.  Grace to-you and peace from the-One being and the-One he-was and the-One coming, and from the seven spirits that (are) before the throne  of-him, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and from Jesus Christ, the witness, the faithful-One, the firstborn of-the dead and the ruler of-the kings of-the earth. To-the-One loving us and having-loosed us from the sins of-us by the blood of-him, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and he-made us (into-a) kingdom, priests to-the God and Fathers of-him.  To-him (be) [the] glory and [the] might unto the ages of-the ages/forever<sup>3</sup> [and-ever<sup>2</sup>]<sup>ms</sup>.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><em>Behold</em><em>, he-comes with the clouds,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd every eye </em><em>will-see</em><em>-him,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>e</em><em>ven who pierced him,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd all the tribes of-the earth will-mourn over him.</em> Yes, truly. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em> am the Alpha and the Omega,”</em> says (the) Lord [the] God, <em>“</em><em>the-One being and </em><em>the he</em><em>-was and the-One coming, the Almighty.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I, John, the brother of-you and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience/endurance in Jesus, was on the island [the] called Patmos on-account-of the word of-[the] God and the testimony of-Jesus.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I-was in (the) Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I-heard behind me (a) loud voice/sound like (a) trumpet, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>saying, <em>“What you-see write in/into (a) b</em><em>l</em><em>ood and sent (it) to-the seven churches:  to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to </em><em>Laodicia</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-turned-around to-see the voice that was-speaking with me; and, having-turned-around, I-saw seven gold lampstands.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And in (the) midst of-the lampstands (was) (one)-like (a/the) son/Son of-man, dressed (with a) long-robe and (a) gold belt/breastplate-around [to] the chest[s].  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And the head of-him and the hair[s] (were) white like white wool, like snow; and the eyes of-him (were) like (a) flame of-fire.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the feet of-him (were) like polished-brass as having-been-melted/refined in (a) furnace.  And the/his voice (was) like (the) sound of many waters, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and having in the right hand of-him seven stars and out-of the mouth of-him (a) sharp, two-edged sword coming-out, and the face of-him shines like the sun in the power of-it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And when I-saw him, I-fell to the feet of-him as-if dead, and he-put the right (hand) of-him on me, saying, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not└fear</em><em>.  I am the first and the last, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> the-One living, and I-was dead </em><em>and,</em><em> behold, I-am living </em><em>forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em> and </em><em>ever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>, and I-have the keys of-[the] death and the grave.  </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> write what-things you-saw and what-things are and what-things are-about to-be after these-things.  </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> mystery of-the seven stars that you-saw on the right (hand) of-me and the seven [the] gold</em><em> lampstands—the seven stars are angels/preachers</em><em>/messengers</em><em> of-the seven churches and the seven [the] lampstands are (the) seven churches.”</em></span>
