## Revelation Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The) Revelation of-Jesus Christ that [the] God gave him to-show to-the servants of-him that are-necessary to-occur in quickness/soon, and he-signified (them), having-sent through the angel of-him to-the servant of-him, John, 2who testified the word of-[the] God and the testimony of-Jesus Christ as-many-things-as he-saw.  3Blessed (is) the-one reading and the-ones hearing/heeding the words of-the prophecy and keeping the-things written in it, for the time (is) near.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> John, to-the seven churches [the] in [the] Asia.  Grace to-you and peace from the-One being and the-One he-was and the-One coming, and from the seven spirits that (are) before the throne  of-him, 5and from Jesus Christ, the witness, the faithful-One, the firstborn of-the dead and the ruler of-the kings of-the earth. To-the-One loving us and having-loosed us from the sins of-us by the blood of-him, 6and he-made us (into-a) kingdom, priests to-the God and Fathers of-him.  To-him (be) [the] glory and [the] might unto the ages of-the ages/forever3 [and-ever2]ms.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Behold, he-comes with the clouds, 8"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says (the) Lord [the] God, "the-One being and the he-was and the-One coming, the Almighty."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I, John, the brother of-you and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience/endurance in Jesus, was on the island [the] called Patmos on-account-of the word of-[the] God and the testimony of-Jesus.  10I-was in (the) Spirit on the Lord's day, and I-heard behind me (a) loud voice/sound like (a) trumpet, 11saying, "What you-see write in/into (a) blood and sent (it) to-the seven churches:  to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicia."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And I-turned-around to-see the voice that was-speaking with me; and, having-turned-around, I-saw seven gold lampstands.  13And in (the) midst of-the lampstands (was) (one)-like (a/the) son/Son of-man, dressed (with a) long-robe and (a) gold belt/breastplate-around [to] the chest[s].  14And the head of-him and the hair[s] (were) white like white wool, like snow; and the eyes of-him (were) like (a) flame of-fire.  15And the feet of-him (were) like polished-brass as having-been-melted/refined in (a) furnace.  And the/his voice (was) like (the) sound of many waters, 16and having in the right hand of-him seven stars and out-of the mouth of-him (a) sharp, two-edged sword coming-out, and the face of-him shines like the sun in the power of-it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And when I-saw him, I-fell to the feet of-him as-if dead, and he-put the right (hand) of-him on me, saying, "Do┘not└fear.  I am the first and the last, 18and the-One living, and I-was dead and, behold, I-am living forever3 and ever2, and I-have the keys of-[the] death and the grave.  19So write what-things you-saw and what-things are and what-things are-about to-be after these-things.  20The mystery of-the seven stars that you-saw on the right (hand) of-me and the seven [the] gold lampstands—the seven stars are angels/preachers/messengers of-the seven churches and the seven [the] lampstands are (the) seven churches."</span>
