## Revelation Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-showed me (the) river of-(the)-water of-life, bright as crystal, flowing-out of-the throne of-[the] God and the Lamb.  2In (the) midst of-the street of-it and the river from-there/on-that-side and from-here/on-this-side (a) tree of-life bearing twelve fruits, according-to every month/monthly bearing the fruit of-it, and the leaves of-the tree (were) for (the) healing of-the nations.  3And every/any curse will┘not└be anymore.  And the throne of-[the] God and the Lamb will-be in it, and the servants of-them will-worship/serve him.  4And they-will-see the face of-him, and the name of-him will-be on the foreheads of-them.  5And night will┘not└be anymore, and they-do┘not└have need of-(the)-light of-(a)-lamp and (the) light of-(the)-sun, because (the) Lord [the] God will-shine on them, and they-will-rule unto the ages of-the ages/forevermore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And he-said to-me, "These [the] words (are) faithful and true, and the Lord [the] God of-the spirits of-the prophets sent the angel of-him to-show to-the servants of-him what-things are-necessary to-happen in quickness/quickly/soon.  7And behold I-am-coming quickly/soon.  Blessed (is) the-one keeping the words of-the prophecy of-[the] this book."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And-I John (am) the-one hearing and seeing these-things; and when I-heard and I-saw, I-fell to-worship before the feet of-the angel the-one showing me these-things.  9And he-says to-me, "See (that you) not (do it).  I-am (a) fellow-servant of-you and of-the brothers of-you the prophets and the-ones keeping the words of-[the] this book.  Worship [the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And he-says to-me, "Do┘not└seal-up the words of-the prophecy of-[the] this book, for the time is near.  11Let┘the filthy-one└be-filthy still, and let┘the righteous-one└do righteousness still, and let┘the holy one└be-holy still. 12"Behold, I-am-coming soon and the reward of-me (is) with me to-give to-each as the work of-him is.  13I (am) the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 14"Blessed (are) the-ones washing the robes/clothes of-them, in-order-that the right of-them will-be to the tree of-[the] life and by the gates they-may-enter into the city.  15Outside (will be) [the] dogs and [the] sorcerers and [the] sexually-immoral and [the] murderers and [the] idolaters and the-ones living and doing/making (a) lie. 16"I Jesus sent the angel of-me to-testify to-you these-things to-the churches.  I am the root and descendant of-David, the bright [the] morning [the] Star."  17And the Spirit and the bride say, 'Come'; and let┘the-one hearing└say, 'Come'; and let┘the-one thirsting└come; let┘the-one desiring└receive (the) water of-life freely. 18"I testify to-everyone the-one hearing the words of-the prophecy of-[the] this book:  if anybody adds to them, [the] God will-add to him the plagues the-ones written in [the] this book.  19And if anybody takes-away from the words of-the book of-[the] this prophecy, [the] God will-take-away the part of-him from the tree of-[the] life and from the Holy [the] City the-ones written in [the] this book.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The-one testifying these-things says, "Yes; I-am-coming quickly/soon."  Amen.  Come, Lord Jesus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The grace of-the Lord Jesus (be) with all.</span>
