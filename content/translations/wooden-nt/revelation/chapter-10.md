## Revelation Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw another strong angel descending out-of the sky wrapped/dressed in (a) cloud, and a rainbow (was) on the head of-him, and the face of-him (was) like the sun, and the feet of-him (were) like pillars/columns of-fire, 2[and] having in the hand of-him (an) opened-up little-book.  And he-put the right [the] foot of-him on the sea, and the left (foot) on [the] land; 3and he-shouted with-(a)-loud voice as (a) lion roars; and when he-shouted, the seven thunders spoke the voices of-them.  4And when the seven thunders spoke, I-was-about to-write, and I-heard (a) voice out-of [the] heaven/sky, saying, "Seal-up what-things the seven thunders said, and do┘not└write them."  5And the angel that I-saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted-up the right [the] hand of-him to [the] heaven, 6and he-swore by the-One living unto the ages of-the ages5/forevermore5—who created the sky and the-things in it and the earth and the-things in it and the sea and the-things in it—that time will-be no-longer; 7but/indeed in the days of-the sound of-the seventh angel, when he-is-about to-trumpet—and/that the mystery of-[the] God was-finished when he-evangelized the servants of-himself the prophets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the voice that I-heard out-of [the] heaven/sky speaking again with me and saying, "Go take the little-book [the] opened-up in the hand of-the angel [the] standing on the sea and on the land."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And I-went-away to the angel, saying to-him to-give to-me the little-book.  And he-says to-me, "Take (it) and eat it, and it-will-make┘the stomach of-you└bitter, but in the mouth of-you it-will-be sweet like honey."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And I-took the little-book out-of the hand of-the angel, and I-ate┘it└up; and it-was in the mouth of-me sweet like honey; and when I-ate it, the stomach of-me was-made-bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And they-say to-me, "It-is-necessary for-you to-prophesy again to peoples and nations and languages and many kings."</span>
