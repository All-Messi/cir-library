## Revelation Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After this I-saw four angels standing on/at the four corners of-the earth, holding the four winds of-the earth in-order-that wind might┘not└blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on every tree.  2And I-saw another angel coming-up from the rising of-(the)-sun, having (the) seal of-(the)-living God, and he-shouted with-(a)-loud voice to-the four angels to-whom it-was-given [to-them] to-harm the land and the sea, 3saying, "Do┘not└harm the land nor the sea nor the trees until we-seal the slaves of-the God of-us on the foreheads of-them."  4And I-heard the number of-the-ones having-been-sealed, (a) hundred fortyᴖfour thousand, having-been-sealed from every tribe of-(the)-sons of-Israel:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> After these-things I-looked, and, behold, a great crowd that nobody was-able to number [it], out-of every nation and tribe and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with-white robes, and palm-branches/fronds (were) in the hands of-them.  10And they-are-shouting with-(a)-loud voice, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And all the angels stood in-a-circle/around the throne and the elder and the four living-beings, and they-fell-down before the throne on the faces of-them and worshiped [the] God, 12saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And one of the elders answered, saying to-me, "Who are these [the] wrapped/dressed with-respect-to-[the] white [the] robes and whence did-they-come?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And I-said, "My lord, you know." "These are the-ones coming out-of the great [the] tribulation and they-washed the robes of-them and made┘them└white in the blood of-the Lamb.  15On-account-of this they-are before the throne of-[the] God and serve him day and night in the sanctuary of-him; and the-One sitting on the throne tabernacles/dwells with them.  16They-will┘not└hunger anymore nor thirst anymore, neither will┘the sun└fall on them nor any heat.  17Because the Lamb [the] in-the-midst-of the throne will-shepherd them, and he-will-lead them to springs of-living water."</span>
