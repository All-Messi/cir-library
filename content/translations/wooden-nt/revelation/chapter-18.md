<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And after these-things I-saw another angel coming-down out-of the sky having-great authority, and the earth was-lit-up by the glory of-him.  2And he-shouted with (a) loud voice, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And I-heard another voice out-of [the] heaven, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Pay-back to-her as also she paid,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> As-many-things-as she-glorified herself and lived sensually,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> On-account-of this in one day the plagues of-her will-come:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the kings of-earth, the-ones having-committed-sexual-immortality with her and having-lived-luxuriously (with her) will-cry and mourn over her when they-see the smoke of-the burning of-her, 10standing from afar on-account-of the fear of-the torment of-her, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the merchants of-the earth mourn and weep over her, because nobody any-longer buys the merchandise of-her, 12merchandise of-gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and linen-goods and purple and silk and red, and every scented wood and every ivory vessel and every vessel of-precious wood and copper and iron and marble, 13and cinnamon and spice and incense[s] and perfume/oil and frankincense and wine and olive-oil and fine-wheat-flour and wheat and cattle and sheep and horses and four-wheeled-carriages and slaves and souls of-men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the fruit of-the desire of-the soul of-you 15[The] these merchants the-ones having-become-wealthy from her will-stand from afar on-account-of the fear of-the torment of-her, crying and mourning, 16saying, And every ship-captain and the-one sailing to (a) place and sailors and as-many-as ply the sea, stood from afar 18and kept-crying-out, seeing the smoke of-the burning of-her, saying, "What (is) like the great [the] city?"  19And they-threw dust on the heads of-them and were-crying-out, crying and mourning, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Rejoice over her, heaven,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And one strong angel picked-up (a) stone like (a) large millstone and threw (it) into the sea, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And let┘(the) sound of-harps and musicians and flutists and trumpeters</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And let┘the light of-(a)-lamp certainly not└shine in you anymore,</span>
