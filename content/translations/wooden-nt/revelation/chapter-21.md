## Revelation Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw (a) new heaven/sky and (a) new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth and the sea are not anymore.  2And I-saw the Holy City, (the) New Jerusalem, coming-down out-of the sky/[the] heaven from [the] God, prepared like (a) bride decorated/adorned/made-beautiful for-the husband of-her.  3And I-heard (a) loud voice from the throne, saying, "Behold, the tent/tabernacle of-[the] God (is) with [the] men, and he-will-tabernacle with them.  And they will-be peoples of-him, and [the] God himself will-be with them—[(the) God of-them]ms.  4And every tear will-be-wiped-out of the eyes of-them, and [the] death will be neither sorrow nor crying neither suffering/pain will-be anymore [because]ms the first-things passed—away."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And the-One sitting on the throne said, "Behold, I-am-making all-things news," and he-said, "Write, because these [the] words/things/matters are faithful and true."  6And he-said to-me, "They-have-come-to-pass.  I [am]ms the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.  I will-give to-the-one thirsting from the spring of-the water of-[the] life freely.  7The-one conquering will-inherit these-things, and I-will-be God to-him and he will-be son to-me.  8And the fearful/cowardly and unfaithful and corrupted and murders and sexually-immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all [the] liars (will have) the part of-them in the lake [the] burning with fire and sulphur, which is the second [the] death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And one of the seven angels came the-one having the seven bowls [the] full of-the seven [the] last plagues, and he-spoke with me, saying, "Come, I-will-show you the bride, the wife of-the Lamb."  10And he-carried┘me└away in (the) spirit onto (a) great and high mountain, and he-showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming-down out-of the sky/[the] heaven from [the] God, 11having the glory of-[the] God, the brilliance of-it (was) like (a0 precious stone like (a) jasper stone bright-as-crystal, 12having (a) great and high wall, having twelve gates and on the gates twelve angels and name etched, which is/are [the names]ms of-the-twelve tribes of-(the)-sons of-Israel.  13From (the) east three gates, and from (the) north three gates, and from (the) south three gates and from (the) west three gates.  14And the wall of-the city having twelve foundations/foundation-stones and on them names of-the twelve apostles of-the Lamb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the-one speaking with me was-having (a) measure, (a) gold rod, in-order-that he-might-measure the city and the gates of-it and the wall of-it.  16And the city lies foursquare/four-sided and the length of-it (was) as-much-as [also]ms the width, and he-measured the city with-the rod up-to twelve thousand stades, the length and the width and the height of-it is/are equal.  17And he-measured the wall of-it:  (a) hundred forty four cubits, (the) measure of-(a)-man, that is of-(an)-angel.  18And the foundation-material of-the wall of-it (was) jasper, and the city (was) pure gold like pure hyacinth.  19The foundations of-the wall of-the city (were) adorned with every precious stone.  The first [the] foundation (was) jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 20the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian/cornelian/sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase/green-quartz; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.  21And the twelve gates (were) twelve pearls, each2 one of-the gates was of one pearl, and the street of-the city (was) pure gold like transparent/pure crystal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And I-did┘not└see (a) sanctuary, for the Lord [the] God [the] Almighty and the Lamb (are the) sanctuary.  23And the city does┘not└have need of-the sun nor the moon in-order-that they-might-give-light to-it, and the Lamb (is) the lamp of-it.  24And the nations will-walk through the light of-it, and the kings of-the earth bring the glory of-them into it.  25And the gates of-it will┘certainly not└be-closed during-(the)-day, for no night is there.  26And they-will-bring the glory and the honor of-the nations into it.  27And every common (thing) and [the-one]ms doing (an) abomination and (a) lie, will┘certainly not└enter into it, except/only2 the-ones written in the book of the life of-the Lamb.</span>
