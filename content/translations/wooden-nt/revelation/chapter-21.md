## Revelation Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And I-saw (a) new heaven/sky and (a) new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth and the sea are not anymore.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-saw the Holy City, (the) New Jerusalem, coming-down out-of the sky/[the] heaven from [the] God, prepared like (a) bride decorated/adorned/made-beautiful for-the husband of-her.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And I-heard (a) loud voice from the throne, saying, <em>“Behold, the tent/tabernacle of-[the] God (is) with [the] men, and he-will-</em><em>tabernacle with them.  And </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> will-be peoples of-him, and [the] God himself will-be with them—[(the) God of-them]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> every tear will-be-wiped-</em><em>out of the eyes of-them, and [the] death will be neither sorrow nor crying neither suffering/pain will-be anymore [because]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> </em><em>the </em><em>first-things</em><em> passed—</em><em>away.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And the-One sitting on the throne said, <em>“Behold, I-am-making all-things news,” and he-said, “Write, because these [the]</em><em> </em><em>words/things/matters are faithful and true.”  </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> he-said to-me, “They-have-come-to-pass.  I [am]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.  I will-give to-the-one thirsting from the spring of-the water of-[the] life freely.  </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>The</em><em>-one conquering wi</em><em>ll-inherit these-things, and I-</em><em>will-be God to-him and </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> will-be son to-me.  </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the fearful/cowardly and unfaithful and corrupted and murders and </em><em>sexually-immoral</em><em> and sorcerers and idolaters and all [the] liars (will have) the part of-them in the lake [the] burning with fire and </em><em>sulphur</em><em>, which is the second [the] death.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And one of the seven angels came the-one having the seven bowls [the] full of-the seven [the] last plagues, and he-spoke with me, saying, <em>“Come, I-will-show you the bride, the wife of-the Lamb.</em><em>”</em>  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And he-carried┘me└away in (the) spirit onto (a) great and high mountain, and he-showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming-down out-of the sky/[the] heaven from [the] God, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>having the glory of-[the] God, the brilliance of-it (was) like (a0 precious stone like (a) jasper stone bright-as-crystal, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>having (a) great and high wall, having twelve gates and on the gates twelve angels and name etched, which is/are [the names]<sup>ms</sup> of-the-twelve tribes of-(the)-sons of-Israel.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>From (the) east three gates, and from (the) north three gates, and from (the) south three gates and from (the) west three gates.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And the wall of-the city having twelve foundations/foundation-stones and on them names of-the twelve apostles of-the Lamb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And the-one speaking with me was-having (a) measure, (a) gold rod, in-order-that he-might-measure the city and the gates of-it and the wall of-it.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the city lies foursquare/four-sided and the length of-it (was) as-much-as [also]<sup>ms</sup> the width, and he-measured the city with-the rod up-to twelve thousand stades, the length and the width and the height of-it is/are equal.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And he-measured the wall of-it:  (a) hundred forty four cubits, (the) measure of-(a)-man, that is of-(an)-angel.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And the foundation-material of-the wall of-it (was) jasper, and the city (was) pure gold like pure hyacinth.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>The foundations of-the wall of-the city (were) adorned with every precious stone.  The first [the] foundation (was) jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian/cornelian/sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase/green-quartz; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And the twelve gates (were) twelve pearls, each<sup>2</sup> one of-the gates was of one pearl, and the street of-the city (was) pure gold like transparent/pure crystal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And I-did┘not└see (a) sanctuary, for the Lord [the] God [the] Almighty and the Lamb (are the) sanctuary.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And the city does┘not└have need of-the sun nor the moon in-order-that they-might-give-light to-it, and the Lamb (is) the lamp of-it.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And the nations will-walk through the light of-it, and the kings of-the earth bring the glory of-them into it.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And the gates of-it will┘certainly not└be-closed during-(the)-day, for no night is there.  <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And they-will-bring the glory and the honor of-the nations into it.  <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And every common (thing) and [the-one]<sup>ms</sup> doing (an) abomination and (a) lie, will┘certainly not└enter into it, except/only<sup>2</sup> the-ones written in the book of the life of-the Lamb.</span>
