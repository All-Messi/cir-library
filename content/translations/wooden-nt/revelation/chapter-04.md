## Revelation Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things I-looked, and behold (an) open/opened door (was) in [the] heaven, and the first [the] voice/sound that I-heard (was) like (a) trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come-up here, and I-will-show you what-things it-is-necessary to-happen after these-things."  2Immediately I-became/was in (the) spirit, and behold (a) throne was-sitting in (the) heaven, and One-sitting on the throne, 3and the-One (was) like in-appearance to-(a)-jasper and sardis/carnelian/cornelian stone, and (a) rainbow (was) around the throne like in-appearance to-(an)-emerald.  4And around the throne (I saw) twenty four thrones, and on the thrones twenty four elders, and seven lampstand of-fire (were) sitting/standing before the throne, which are the seven spirits of-[the] God, 6and before the throne (was) like (a) sea clear like crystal. And in (the) midst of-the throne and around the throne (were) four living-beings full of-eyes in-front and in-back.  7And the first [the] living-being (was) like (a) lion, and the second living-being (was) like (a) calf, and the third living-being (was) having the face like (a) man, and the fourth living-being (was) like (an) eagle flying/in-flight.  8And the four living-beings—each-one3 (was) having six2 wings, around and within full of-eyes, and they-do┘not└have rest during-the-day and during-the-night, saying,</span>
