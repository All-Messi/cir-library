## Revelation Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After these-things I-looked, and behold (an) open/opened door (was) in [the] heaven, and the first [the] voice/sound that I-heard (was) like (a) trumpet speaking with me, saying, <em>“Come-up here, and I-will-show you what-things it-is-necessary to-happen after these-things.”</em>  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Immediately I-became/was in (the) spirit, and behold (a) throne was-sitting in (the) heaven, and One-sitting on the throne, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and the-One (was) like in-appearance to-(a)-jasper and sardis/carnelian/cornelian stone, and (a) rainbow (was) around the throne like in-appearance to-(an)-emerald.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And around the throne (I saw) twenty four thrones, and on the thrones twenty four elders, and seven lampstand of-fire (were) sitting/standing before the throne, which are the seven spirits of-[the] God, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and before the throne (was) like (a) sea clear like crystal. And in (the) midst of-the throne and around the throne (were) four living-beings full of-eyes in-front and in-back.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the first [the] living-being (was) like (a) lion, and the second living-being (was) like (a) calf, and the third living-being (was) having the face like (a) man, and the fourth living-being (was) like (an) eagle flying/in-flight.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the four living-beings—each-one<sup>3</sup> (was) having six<sup>2</sup> wings, around and within full of-eyes, and they-do┘not└have rest during-the-day and during-the-night, saying, <em>“Holy, holy, holy,</em> <em>	</em><em>	Lord, [the] God [the] Almighty,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>t</em><em>he-One was and the-One being, and the-One coming.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And when the living-beings give glory and honor and thanksgiving to-the-One sitting on the throne, the-One living forever<sup>3</sup> and(-)ever<sup>2</sup>, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>the twenty four elders will-fall before the-One sitting on the throne, and they-will-worship the-One living forever<sup>3</sup> and(-)ever<sup>2</sup>, and they-will-throw/cast/toss the crowns of-them before the throne, saying, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em>-are worthy, [the] Lord and [the] God of-us,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>t</em><em>o-receive [the] glory and [the] honor and [the] power,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>b</em><em>ecause you </em><em>created [the] all-things,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd on-account-of the will of-you they-were and were-created.”</em></span>
