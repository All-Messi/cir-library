## Revelation Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> To-the angel/evangelist/messenger of-the church in Ephesus write:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I-know the works of-yousg and the hard-work and the endurances of-you and that you-are┘not└able to-tolerate evil-(people), and you-put-to-the-test the ones calling themselves apostles and are not, and you-found them false-ones/liars.  3And you have patience, and you-endured on-account-of the name of-me, and have┘not└grown-weary.  4But I-have against you that you-left the first [the] love of-you.  5Remember then whence you-have-fallen, and repent and do the first works.  Now if not/otherwise2 I-am-coming to-you, and I-will-remove the lampstand of-you out-of the place of-it, if you-do┘not└repent.  6But you-have this, that you-hate the works of-the Nicolaitans, which I-also hate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches. To-the-one overcoming—I-will-give to-him to-eat of the tree of-[the] life, which is in the Paradise of-[the] God.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I-know the tribulation of-you and the poverty—but you-are rich—and the blasphemy of the-ones saying themselves to-be Jews and are not, but (are the) synagogue of-[the] Satan.  10Fear nothingsg thatpl you-are-about to-suffer.  Behold, the devil will cast (some) of-you into prison in-order-that you-may-be-tried, and you-will-have tribulation ten days.  Be faithful until death, and I-will-give you the crown of-[the] life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.  The-one overcoming will┘certainly not└be-harmed by/of the second [the] death.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I-know where you-dwell, where the throne of-[the] Satan (is), and you-are holding-onto the name of-me, and you-did┘not└deny the faith of-me even in the days of-Antipas the faithful [of-me] [the] witness of-me, who was-murdered beside you, where [the] Satan dwells.  14But I-have against you (a)-few things because you-have there ones-holding the teaching of-Balaam, who used-to-teach [the] Balak to-cast (a) stumbling-block before the sons of-Israel to-eat things-sacrificed-to-idols and to-commit-sexual-immorality.  15Thus you also have ones-holding the teaching of-[the]ms Nicolaitans likewise.  16So repent; but if not, I-am-coming to-you quickly/soon, and I-will-make-war with them with the sword of-the mouth of-me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.  To-the-one overcoming—I-will-give to-him of-the hidden [the] manna; and I will-give to-him (a) white stone, and on the stone (a) new name written, which nobody knows except2 the-one receiving (it).'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I-know the works of-you and [the] love and [the] faith and [the] service and [the] perseverance of-you, and (that) the last [the] works of-you (are) more than-the first.  20But I-have against you that you put-up-with the woman Jezebel the-one calling herself (a) prophetess and teacher, and deceives [the] my servants to-commit-sexual-immorality and to-eat things-offered-to-idols.  21And I-gave her time in-order-that she-might-repent and she-does┘not└want to-repent from the sexual-immorality of her.  22Behold, I-am-putting her in (a) bed/sickbed and the-ones committing-adultery with her into great tribulation, unless2 they-repent of the works of-her/themms.  23And the children of-her I-will-kill with death, and all the churches will-know that I am the-One examining minds and hearts; and I-will-give to-youpl to-each according-to the works of-youpl.  24And I-say to-you—the rest [the-ones] in Thyatira as-many-as do┘not└have [the] this teaching, who did┘not└know the deep-things of-[the] Satan, as they-say—I-do┘not└put on you another burden, 25except what you-have hold-onto until when2 I-come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the-one overcoming and the-one keeping the works of-me till (the) end— 28as I-also have-received from the Father of-me, I┘also└give to-him the morning [the] star.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.'</span>
