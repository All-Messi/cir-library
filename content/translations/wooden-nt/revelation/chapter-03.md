## Revelation Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And to-the angel/evangelist/messenger of-the church in Sardis write: I-know the works of-you that you-have (a) name that you-live but you-are dead.  2Become alert and strengthen the left-things that were-about to-die; for I-have┘not└found the-works of-you fulfilled before the God of-me.  3Remember then how you-have-received and heard, and keep (it) and repent.  If then you-do┘not└wake-up, I-will-come like (a) thief, and you-will┘certainly not└know at-what hour I-will-come upon you.  4But you-have (a) few names in Sardis that did┘not└defile the garments of-them, and they-will-walk with me in white because they-are worthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The-one overcoming thus will-be-dressed in white garments, and I will┘certainly not└erase the name of-him out-of the book of-[the] life, and I-will-confess the name of-him before the Father of-me and before the angels of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I-know the works of-you.  Behold, I-have-put before you (an) opened door, which nobody is-able to close [it], because you-have (a) little power and you-kept the word of-me and did┘not└deny the name of-me.  9Behold, I-give/cause (the-ones) of the synagogue of-[the] Satan, the-ones saying themselves to-be Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I-will-make them in-order-that they-will-come and bow-down before the feet of-yousg, and know that I loved you; 10because you-kept the word of-the patience of-me, and-I will-keep you out-of the hour of-the trial, the-one about to-come on the whole earth to-try the-ones dwelling on the earth.  11I-am-coming soon/quickly.  Hold-onto what you-have, in-order-that nobody may-take the crown of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The-one overcoming—I-will-make him (a) pillar in the sanctuary of-the God of-me, and he-will┘certainly not└go outside again, and I-will-write on him the name of-the God of-me and the name of-the city of-the God of-me, the new Jerusalem, the-one descending out-of [the] heaven from the God of-me, and the new [the] name of-me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him-hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> I-know the works of-you that you-are neither cold nor hot.  Oh-that/I-would you were cold or hot.  16So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I-will spew you out-of the mouth of-me.  17Because you-say [that], "I-am rich and have-prospered and I-have no need," and do┘not└know that you are [the] miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked, 18I-advise you to-buy from me gold refined by fire in-order-that you-may-be-rich, and white garments in-order-that you-may-be-clothed and the shame of-the nakedness of-you may┘not└show/be-evident/be-manifest, and eye-salve to-anoint the eyes of-you in-order-that you-may-see.  19As-many-as2 I love I-rebuke and discipline.  So be-earnest and repent.  20Behold, I-stand at the door and knock.  If anybody hears the voice of-me and opens the door, I-will┘[also]ms└come-in to him and dine with him and he with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The-one overcoming—I-will-give to-him to-sit with me on the throne of-me, as I-also overcame and sat with the Father of-me on the throne of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The-one having (an) ear, let-him hear what the Spirit is-saying to-the churches.'"</span>
