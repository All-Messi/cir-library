## Revelation Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And (a) reed like (a) rod was-given to-me, saying, "Arise and measure the sanctuary of-[the] God and the altar and the-ones worshiping in it.  2And leave-out the court [the] outside the sanctuary and do┘not└measure it, because it-was-given to-the nations, and they-will-tread-on the holy [the] city for forty [and]ms two months.  3And I-will-give to-the two witnesses of-me, and they-will-prophesy (a) thousand two-hundred (and) sixty-days dressed in-sackcloth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> These are the two olive-trees and the two lampstands [the] standing before the God of-the earth.  5And if anybody wants to-harm them, fire comes-out from the mouth of-them and devours the enemies of-them.  And if anybody wants to-harm them, thus it-is necessary for-him to-be-killed.  6These have [the] authority to-shut-up the sky, in-order-that rain might┘not└rain for-the days of-the prophecy of-them, and they-have authority over the water[s] to-turn them/it into blood and to-strike the earth with every/any plague as-many-times-as2 they-desire.  7And when they end the witness of-them, the beast [the] ascending from the abyss will-make war with them and will-conquer them and will-kill them.  8And the corpse of-them (will lie) in the street of-the great [the] city, which spiritually is-called Sodom and Egypt, where also the Lord of-them was-crucified.  9And they┘from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations└look-at the corpse of-them for-three and (a) half days, and the corpse of-them they-do┘not└allow to-be-put into (a) grave.  10And the-ones dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate and will-send gifts to-one-another because these [the] two prophets tormented the-ones dwelling on the earth.  11And after [the] three days and (a) half, (the) breath of-life from [the] God entered into them; and they-stood on the feet of-them, and great fear fell on the-ones looking-at them.  12And they-heard (a) voice out-of the sky/[the] heaven, saying to-them, "Come-up here," and they-went-up into [the] heaven in the/a cloud, and the enemies of-them watched them.  13And in that [the] hour, (a) severe earthquake occurred, and the/a tenth of-the city fell; and (the) names of-(the) men were-killed by the earth-quake, seven thousand; and the rest became fearful and gave glory to-the God of-[the] heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The second [the] woe went-away.  Behold, the third [the] woe comes swiftly/soon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the seventh angel trumpeted, and loud voices happened in [the] heaven, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the twenty four elders [the]ms before [the] God, sitting on the thrones of-them, fell on the faces of-them and worshiped [the] God, 17saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the sanctuary of-[God] [the] in [the] heaven opened, and the ark of-the covenant of-him was-seen in the sanctuary of him, and lightnings and voices and thunders and (an) earthquake and large hail occurred.</span>
