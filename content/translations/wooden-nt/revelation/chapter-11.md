## Revelation Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And (a) reed like (a) rod was-given to-me, saying, <em>“Arise and measure the sanctuary of-[the] God and t</em><em>he altar and the-ones worshipin</em><em>g in it.  </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> </em><em>leave-out</em><em> the court [the] outside the sanctuary and </em><em>do┘not└measure</em><em> it, because </em><em>it-was-given to-the nations, and they-will-tread-on the holy [the] city for forty [and]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> two months.  </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> I-will-give to-the two witnesses of-me, and they-will-prophesy (a) thousand </em><em>two-hundred</em><em> (and) sixty-days dressed in-sackcloth.</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> These are the two olive-trees and the two lampstands [the] standing before the God of-the earth.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And if anybody wants to-harm them, fire comes-out from the mouth of-them and devours the enemies of-them.  And if anybody wants to-harm them, thus it-is necessary for-him to-be-killed.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>These have [the] authority to-shut-up the sky, in-order-that rain might┘not└rain for-the days of-the prophecy of-them, and they-have authority over the water[s] to-turn them/it into blood and to-strike the earth with every/any plague as-many-times-as<sup>2</sup> they-desire.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And when they end the witness of-them, the beast [the] ascending from the abyss will-make war with them and will-conquer them and will-kill them.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the corpse of-them (will lie) in the street of-the great [the] city, which spiritually is-called Sodom and Egypt, where also the Lord of-them was-crucified.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And they┘from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations└look-at the corpse of-them for-three and (a) half days, and the corpse of-them they-do┘not└allow to-be-put into (a) grave.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And the-ones dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate and will-send gifts to-one-another because these [the] two prophets tormented the-ones dwelling on the earth.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And after [the] three days and (a) half, (the) breath of-life from [the] God entered into them; and they-stood on the feet of-them, and great fear fell on the-ones looking-at them.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And they-heard (a) voice out-of the sky/[the] heaven, saying to-them, <em>“Come-up here,”</em> and they-went-up into [the] heaven in the/a cloud, and the enemies of-them watched them.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And in that [the] hour, (a) severe earthquake occurred, and the/a tenth of-the city fell; and (the) names of-(the) men were-killed by the earth-quake, seven thousand; and the rest became fearful and gave glory to-the God of-[the] heaven.</span>
