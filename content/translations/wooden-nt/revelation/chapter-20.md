## Revelation Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw (an) angel descending out-of [the] heaven/the sky, having the key of-the abyss and (a) big chain on the hand of-him.  2And he-seized the dragon, the old [the] snake, who is (the) devil and [the] Satan, and bound him for-(a)-thousand years, 3and threw him into the abyss and locked (it) and sealed (it) over him, in-order-that he-might┘not└deceive the nations anymore till the thousand years would-be-finished.  After these-things it-is-necessary for-him to-be-loosed for-(a)-little time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And I-saw thrones and they-sat on-them, and judgment was-given to-them, and (I saw) the souls of-the-ones beheaded on-account-of the testimony of-Jesus and on-account-of the word of-[the] God, and who did┘not└worship the beast nor the image of-him and did┘not└receive the mark on the forehead and on the hand of-them, and they-lived and ruled with [the] Christ for-(a)-thousand years.  5The rest of-the dead did┘not└live until the thousand years would-be-finished.  This (is) the first [the] resurrection.  6Blessed and holy (is) the-one having (a) part in the first [the] resurrection.  Over these the second death does┘not└have authority/power, but they-will-be priests of-[the] God and of-[the] Christ, and they-will-rule with him for-[the]ms thousand years.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And when the thousand years are-finished, [the] Satan will-be-loosed from the prison of-him, 8and he-will-be-free to-deceive the nations [the] in the four corners of-the earth, [the] Gog and Magog, to-assemble them to [the] war, of-whom the number of-them (is) like the sand of-the sea.  9And they-came-up on/over the breadth of-the earth and encircled the camp of-the saints and the beloved [the] city and fire came-down out-of the sky/[the] heaven and devoured them.  10And the devil, the-one deceiving them, was-thrown into the lake of-[the] fire and sulphur, where also the beast and the false-prophet (were), and they-will-be-tormented day and night for the ages of the ages/forevermore.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And I-saw (a) great white throne and the-One sitting on it, from the face of-whom the earth and [the] heaven fled, and (a) place was┘not└found for-them.  12And I-saw the dead, the great and the small, standing in-front-of the throne; and the books were-opened, and another book was-opened, which is (the book) of-life, and the dead were-judged from the-things in the books according-to the deeds of-them.  13And the sea gave-up the dead the-ones in it, and [the] death and the grave gave-up the dead the-ones in them, and each were/was judged according-to the works of-them/him.  14And [the] death and the grave were-thrown in the lake of-[the] fire.  This is the second [the] death—the lake of-fire.  15And if anybody was┘not└found written in the book of-[the] life, he-was-thrown into the lake of-[the] fire.</span>
