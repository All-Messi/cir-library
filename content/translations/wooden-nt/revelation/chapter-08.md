<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And when he-opened the seventh [the] seal, silence became in [the] heaven for┘about└ (a)-half-hour.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-saw the seven angels who stood before [the] God and seven trumpets were-given to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having (a) gold censer; and much incense[s] was-given to-him, in-order-that he-would-give/put the prayers of-all the saints on the gold [the] altar [the] before the throne.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the smoke of-the incense-offerings for-the prayers of-the saints went-up from (the) hand of-the-angel before [the] God.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the angel has-taken the incense-container/censer and filled it and from the fire of-the altar and cast (it) into the earth, and thunders and sounds/voices and lightnings and (an) earthquake happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the seven angels the-ones having the seven trumpets prepared them in-order-that they-might-trumpet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the first trumpeted, and hail happened and fire mingled/mixed with/in blood and it-was-thrown into te earth, and the/a third of-the earth/ground was-scorched, and the/a third of-the trees were-burned-up, and all green grass was-burned-up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the second angel trumpeted, and as-it-were (a) big mountain burning with-fire was-cast into the sea, and the/a third of-the sea became blood, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and the/a third of-the creatures/creations [the] in the sea [the] having life[s] died, and the/a third of-the ships were-destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And the third angel trumpeted, and (a) big star, burning like (a) lamp, fell out-of the sky, and it-fell on the/a third of-the rivers and on the springs of-[the] water[s].  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And the name of-the star is-called [the] Wormwood, and the/a third of-the waters became [for] bitter and many of-the men died from the waters because they-became-bitter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And I-looked and I-heard one eagle flying in-the-middle-of-the-sky, saying with-(a)-loud voice, <em>“Woe, woe, woe with-respect-to-the-ones dwelling on the earth from/because-of the remaining soundings of-the trumpet of-the three angles [the-ones] about to-trumpet.</em><em>”</em></span>
