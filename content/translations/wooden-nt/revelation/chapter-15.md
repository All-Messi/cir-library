## Revelation Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-saw another sign in [the] heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having seven plagues—the last, because in them the wrath of-[the] God was-finished.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And I-saw as-it-were (a) crystal-clear glass sea mixed with-fire and the-ones overcoming from the beast and from the image of-him and from the number of-the name of-him, standing on the crystal-clear [the] sea, having harps of-[the] God.  3And they-are-singing the Song of-Moses, the servant of-[the] God, and the Song of-the Lamb, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Who will┘certainly not└fear (you), Lord,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And after these-things I-looked, and the sanctuary of-the tabernacle of-the testimony in [the] heaven was-opened.  6And the seven angels [the-ones]ms having the seven plagues came-out of the sanctuary dressed in linen pure and bright, and wrapped around the waste[s] with-gold belts.  7And one of the four living-beings gave to-the seven angels seven gold bowls full of-the wrath of-[the] God, the-One living unto the ages of-the ages/forevermore5.  8And the sanctuary was-filled with-smoke from the glory of-[the] God and from the power of-him; and nobody was-able to-enter into the sanctuary until the seven plagues of-the seven angels should-be-finished.</span>
