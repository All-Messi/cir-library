<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And (a) great sign appeared in the sky, (a) woman clothed with-the sun, and the mon (was) under the feet of-her, and on the head of-her (as) (a) crown of-twelve stars, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and having in (the) womb/being pregnant; and she-is-crying-out suffering-birth-pangs and straining to-give-birth.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And another sign appeared in the sky, and behold, (a) big red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crown on the head of-it; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and the tail of-it is-sweeping-down the/a third of-the stars of-the sky, and casting them onto the earth, and the dragon stood in-front-of the woman [the] about to-give-birth, in-order-that when she-bore the child of-her, it-might-devour it.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And she-bore (a) son (a) male, who will rule all the nations with (an) iron rod.  And the child of-her was-snatched to [the] God and to the throne of-him.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the woman fled into the desert, where she-has there (a) place prepared by [the] God, in-order-that they-might-nourish her (a) thousand two-hundred (and) sixty days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And war occurred in [the] heaven/sky, [the] Michael and the angels of-him [the] to-make-war with the dragon, and the dragon warred and the angels of-him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And he-was┘not└strong-enough, nor was┘(a) place of-them└found still in [the] heaven/sky.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the great [the] dragon, the old [the] serpent, the-one called Diabolos/(the) devil and [the] Satan, the-one deceiving the whole world, was-cast-out into the earth and the angels of-him were-cast-out with him.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And I-heard (a) loud voice in [the] heaven, saying, <em>	</em><em>	“Now was [the] salvation and [the] power</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd </em><em>the kingdom of-the G</em><em>od of-us</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd the authority of-the Messiah of-</em><em>him</em><em>;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>b</em><em>ecause the accuser of-the brothers of-us was-cast-out,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>t</em><em>he-one accusing </em><em>them before the G</em><em>od of-us</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>d</em><em>uring-day and night was-cast-out</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And I-saw another beast coming-up out-of the earth, and it-had two horns like (a) lamb, and it-was-speaking like (a) dragon, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and it-exercises all the authority of-the first beast in-front-of it, and it-makes the earth and the-ones dwelling in-it in-order-that they-might-worship the first [the] beast, the wound of-[the] death of-which was-healed.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And it-does great signs in-order-that it┘even└makes fire to-come-down out-of the sky onto the earth in-front-of [the] men, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and it deceives the-ones dwelling on the earth on-account-of the signs that it-gave to-it to-do in-front-of the beast, saying to-the-ones dwelling on the earth to-make (an) image to-the beast that has the wound of-the sword and lived.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And it-was-given to-it to-give breath to-the image of-the beast in-order-that the image of-the beast might┘└speak and do [in-order-that]<sup>ms</sup> as-many-as-ever<sup>2</sup> do┘not└worship the image of-the beast would-be-put-to-death.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And it-makes all—the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves—in-order-that they-might-give (a) stamp/mark to-them on the right [the] hands of-them or on the forehead of-them, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and in-order-that anybody would be-able to-buy or to-sell except<sup>2</sup> the- one having the stamp/mark, the name of-the beast or the number of-the name of-it.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Here is [the] wisdom:  let┘the-one having discernment└figure-out the number of-the beast, it-is (the) number of-(a)-man, the number of-him (is) six-hundred sixty six.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>On</em><em>-account-of this, celebrate, [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> heavens,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and </em><em>the-ones</em><em> tabernacling </em><em>in-them</em><em>.</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>Woe</em><em> </em><em>with-respect-to</em><em> the earth and the sea</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	because the devil came down to you</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	having great wrath, knowing that-he-has little time.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And when the dragon saw that he-was-cast into the earth, he-persecuted the woman who gave-birth-to the male.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And the two wings of-the/a big the/a eagle were-given to-the woman in-order-that she-might-flee into the desert to the place of-her, where she-is-nourished there for-(a)-time and times and half (a)-time away from the face of-the serpent.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the serpent cast out-of the mouth of-it after the woman water like (a) river, in-order-that it-might-make her swept-away-(by-the-river).  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened the mouth of-it and drank/swallowed-up the river that the dragon cast out-of the mouth of-it.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And the dragon was-angered and went-away to-make-war with the rest of-the seed of-her the-ones keeping the laws of-[the] God and having the testimony of-Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And it-stood on the sand of-the sea(shore).  <strong>13</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>And I-saw (a) beast coming-up out-of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns and on the horns of-it ten diadems and on the heads of-it (were) names of-blasphemy.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the beast that I-saw was like (a) leopard<sup>fem</sup>, and the feet of-it (was) like (a) bear and the mouth of-it (was) like (a) lion, and the dragon gave to-it the power of-it and the throne of-it and great authority.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And (I-saw) one of-the heads of-it as-if slain unto death/fatally wounded, and the wound of-the death/fatal wound of-it was-healed.  And the whole earth was-amazed after/at the beast, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and they-worship the dragon that gave [the] authority to-the beast, and they-worshiped the beast, saying, <em>“Who (is) like the beast, and who is-able to-make-was with it?”</em></span>
