## Revelation Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-heard (a) loud voice out-of the sanctuary, saying to-the seven angels, "Go and pour-out the seven bowls of-the wrath of-[the] God on the earth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the first went-away and poured-out the bowl of-him on the earth, and (a) bad and evil sore/boil came on the men [the-ones] having the mark of-the beast and (on) the-ones worshiping the image of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the second poured-out the bowl of-him on the sea, and it-became blood like (the blood of) (a) dead (man), and evil every soul of-life died, the-things in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the third poured-out the bowl of-him on the rivers and the springs of-[the] water[s], and it/they-became blood.  5And I-heard the angel of-the water[s], saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And I-heard the altar saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the fourth poured-out the bowl of-him on the sun, and it-was-given to-him to-burn/scorch [the] men with-fire.  9And [the] men were-burned (a) great burning, and they-blasphemed the name of-[the] God [the-one] having power/authority over [the] these plagues, and they-did┘not└repent to-given glory to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the fifth poured-out the bowl of-him on the throne of-the beast, and the kingdom of-him became darkened, and they-gnawed the tongues of-them from [the] pain, 11and they-blasphemed the God of-[the] heaven from the pain of-them and from the sores/boils, and they-did┘not└repent of the works of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the sixth poured-out the bowl of-him on the great [the] river [the] Euphrates, and the water of-it dried-up, in-order-that the way of-the kings [the] from (the) east of-(the)-sun might-be-prepared.  13And I-saw out-of the mouth of-the dragon and out-of the mouth of-the beast and out-of the mouth of-the false–prophet three unclean spirits like frogs; 14for they-are spirits of-demons—doing signs—that go-out to-the kings of-the whole earth to-assemble them to [the] war of the great [the] day of-[the] God [the] Almighty.  15"Behold, I-am-coming like (a) thief; blessed (is) the-one watching and keeping┘the clothes of-him└on in-order-that he-might┘not└walk naked and they/people-might-see the shame of-him."  16And he/they assembled them to the place [the] called 'Harmagedon' in-Hebrew.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the seventh poured-out the bowl of-him on the air and (a) loud voice out-of the sanctuary from the throne, saying, "It-is done."  18And lightning-flashes and voices and thunders happened, and (a) severe earthquake happened, such-as did┘not└happen from-when man became on the earth—such (a) great earthquake, so mighty.  19And the great [the] city became [into] three parts and the cities of-the Gentiles fell.  And Babylon the Great was-remembered before [the] God to-give to-her the cup of-the wine of-the wrath of-the revenge of-him.  20And every island fled and mountains were┘not└found.  21And large hail-stones like talents are-coming-down out-of the sky on [the] men, and [the] men blasphemed/railed-out-against [the] God from the plague of-the hail, because exceedingly great is the plague of-it.</span>
