## Revelation Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And I-heard (a) loud voice out-of the sanctuary, saying to-the seven angels, <em>“Go and pour-out the seven bowls of-the wrath of-[the] God on the earth.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the first went-away and poured-out the bowl of-him on the earth, and (a) bad and evil sore/boil came on the men [the-ones] having the mark of-the beast and (on) the-ones worshiping the image of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the second poured-out the bowl of-him on the sea, and it-became blood like (the blood of) (a) dead (man), and evil every soul of-life died, the-things in the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the third poured-out the bowl of-him on the rivers and the springs of-[the] water[s], and it/they-became blood.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And I-heard the angel of-the water[s], saying, <em>“You-are just, the-One being and the-One he-was, the Holy-One,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>b</em><em>ecause </em><em>you-judged</em><em> these-</em><em>things;</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <em>because</em><em> (the) blood of-(the)-saints and pro</em><em>phets they-poured-out,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd blood you-have-given to-them to-drink.</em> <em>	</em><em>	They-are worthy.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And I-heard the altar saying, <em>“Yes, Lord, [the] God [the] Almighty,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>t</em><em>rue and just (are) the judgments of-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the fourth poured-out the bowl of-him on the sun, and it-was-given to-him to-burn/scorch [the] men with-fire.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] men were-burned (a) great burning, and they-blasphemed the name of-[the] God [the-one] having power/authority over [the] these plagues, and they-did┘not└repent to-given glory to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the fifth poured-out the bowl of-him on the throne of-the beast, and the kingdom of-him became darkened, and they-gnawed the tongues of-them from [the] pain, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and they-blasphemed the God of-[the] heaven from the pain of-them and from the sores/boils, and they-did┘not└repent of the works of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the sixth poured-out the bowl of-him on the great [the] river [the] Euphrates, and the water of-it dried-up, in-order-that the way of-the kings [the] from (the) east of-(the)-sun might-be-prepared.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And I-saw out-of the mouth of-the dragon and out-of the mouth of-the beast and out-of the mouth of-the false–prophet three unclean spirits like frogs; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>for they-are spirits of-demons—doing signs—that go-out to-the kings of-the whole earth to-assemble them to [the] war of the great [the] day of-[the] God [the] Almighty.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Behold</em><em>, I-am-coming like (a) thief; blessed (is) the-one watching and </em><em>keeping</em>┘<em>the</em><em> clothes </em><em>of-him</em>└on<em> in-order-that </em><em>he-might┘not└walk</em><em> naked and they</em><em>/people</em><em>-might-see the shame </em><em>of-him.”</em>  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And he/they assembled them to the place [the] called ‘Harmagedon’ in-Hebrew.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the seventh poured-out the bowl of-him on the air and (a) loud voice out-of the sanctuary from the throne, saying, <em>“It-is done.”</em>  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And lightning-flashes and voices and thunders happened, and (a) severe earthquake happened, such-as did┘not└happen from-when man became on the earth—such (a) great earthquake, so mighty.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And the great [the] city became [into] three parts and the cities of-the Gentiles fell.  And Babylon the Great was-remembered before [the] God to-give to-her the cup of-the wine of-the wrath of-the revenge of-him.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And every island fled and mountains were┘not└found.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And large hail-stones like talents are-coming-down out-of the sky on [the] men, and [the] men blasphemed/railed-out-against [the] God from the plague of-the hail, because exceedingly great is the plague of-it.</span>
