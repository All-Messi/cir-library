## Revelation Chapter **17**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And one of the seven angels [the] having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, <em>“Come, I-will-show you the judgment of-the great [the] prostitute [the] sitting on (the) much/many water[s], </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>with</em><em> whom the kings of-the earth committed-sexual-immorality and the-</em><em>one</em><em>s</em><em> dwelling-on the earth got/were</em><em>-drunk from the wine of-the sexual-immorality of-her.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>And he-carried┘me└away in spirit into (a) deserted-place, and I-saw (a) woman sitting on (a) red beast, full-of names of-blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the woman was clothed in-purple and scarlet and adorned with-gold and precious stone and pearls, having (a) gold cup in the hand of-her full of-abominations and the defilements/uncleannesses of-the sexual-immorality of-her, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and on the forehead of-her (a) name written, ‘Mystery,’ ‘Babylon the Great,’ ‘the mother of-sexual-immoralities and of-the abominations of-the earth.’  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And I-saw the woman drunk from the blood of-the saints and from the blood of-the witnesses of-Jesus. And I-marveled having-seen her (a) great marvel.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the angel said to-me, <em>“On-account-of what did-you-marvel?  </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> will-tell you the mystery of-the woman and the beast [the] bearing her [the] having the seven heads and the ten horns.  </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> beast that you-saw was and is not and will rise-up </em><em>out-of</em><em> the deep and goes into destruction, and the-ones dwelling on all the earth, the name of-whom </em><em>is┘not└written</em><em> on the book of-[the] life from (the) foundation of-(the)-world, seeing the beast that it-was and is not and will-be-present.  </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Here</em><em> (is) the mind [the] having wisdom:  the seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is-sitting on them.  And seven kings are.  </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>[The] five fell, the one is, the other </em><em>did┘not-yet└come</em><em>, and when </em><em>he-comes it-is-necessary for-him to-remain (a) little-while.</em><em>  </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the beast that was and is not, is also itself (the) eighth and is of the seven and goes into destruction.  </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the ten horns that you-saw are ten kings, who </em><em>did</em>┘<em>not-yet</em>└<em>receive</em><em> </em><em>(a) kingdom/rule</em><em> but receive authority as kings for-one hour with the feast.  </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>These</em><em> have one purpose, and [the] power and authority of-them they-give to-the beast.  </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>These</em><em> make-war with the Lamb, and the Lamb conquers them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and the ones with-him (are) called and chosen and faithful.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And he-says to-me,<em> “The water[s] that you-saw </em><em>where the prostitute sits are/is crowds and nations an</em><em>d languages,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> the ten horns that you-saw </em><em>and the beast—these hate the prostitute and will-make her desolate and naked, they-will-eat the flesh[es] of-her and </em><em>they-will-burn</em>┘her└<em>up</em><em> with fire.  </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> [the] God put/gave into the hearts of-them to-serve the purpose of-him and to-</em><em>serve </em><em>one purpose and to-give the kingdom of-them to-the beast until the words of-[the] God will-be-finished.  </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the woman that you-saw is the great [the] city the-one having rule over the kings of-the earth.</em></span>
