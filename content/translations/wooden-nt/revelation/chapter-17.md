## Revelation Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And one of the seven angels [the] having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I-will-show you the judgment of-the great [the] prostitute [the] sitting on (the) much/many water[s], 2with whom the kings of-the earth committed-sexual-immorality and the-ones dwelling-on the earth got/were-drunk from the wine of-the sexual-immorality of-her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he-carried┘me└away in spirit into (a) deserted-place, and I-saw (a) woman sitting on (a) red beast, full-of names of-blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.  4And the woman was clothed in-purple and scarlet and adorned with-gold and precious stone and pearls, having (a) gold cup in the hand of-her full of-abominations and the defilements/uncleannesses of-the sexual-immorality of-her, 5and on the forehead of-her (a) name written, 'Mystery,' 'Babylon the Great,' 'the mother of-sexual-immoralities and of-the abominations of-the earth.'  6And I-saw the woman drunk from the blood of-the saints and from the blood of-the witnesses of-Jesus. "On-account-of what did-you-marvel?  I will-tell you the mystery of-the woman and the beast [the] bearing her [the] having the seven heads and the ten horns.  8The beast that you-saw was and is not and will rise-up out-of the deep and goes into destruction, and the-ones dwelling on all the earth, the name of-whom is┘not└written on the book of-[the] life from (the) foundation of-(the)-world, seeing the beast that it-was and is not and will-be-present.  9Here (is) the mind [the] having wisdom:  the seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is-sitting on them.  And seven kings are.  10[The] five fell, the one is, the other did┘not-yet└come, and when he-comes it-is-necessary for-him to-remain (a) little-while.  11And the beast that was and is not, is also itself (the) eighth and is of the seven and goes into destruction.  12And the ten horns that you-saw are ten kings, who did┘not-yet└receive (a) kingdom/rule but receive authority as kings for-one hour with the feast.  13These have one purpose, and [the] power and authority of-them they-give to-the beast.  14These make-war with the Lamb, and the Lamb conquers them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and the ones with-him (are) called and chosen and faithful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And he-says to-me, "The water[s] that you-saw where the prostitute sits are/is crowds and nations and languages, 16and the ten horns that you-saw and the beast—these hate the prostitute and will-make her desolate and naked, they-will-eat the flesh[es] of-her and they-will-burn┘her└up with fire.  17For [the] God put/gave into the hearts of-them to-serve the purpose of-him and to-serve one purpose and to-give the kingdom of-them to-the beast until the words of-[the] God will-be-finished.  18And the woman that you-saw is the great [the] city the-one having rule over the kings of-the earth.</span>
