## Revelation Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And I-looked, and behold the Lamb on [the] Mount Zion and with him (a) hundred forty four thousand having the name of-him written on the foreheads of-them.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And I-heard (a) sound out-of the sky like (the) sound of-many waters and (the) sound of-loud thunder, the sound that I-heard (was) like harpists harping on the harps of-them.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And they-sing [as-it-were]<sup>ms</sup> (a) new song before the throne and before the four living-beings and the elders, and nobody was-able to-learn the song except<sup>2</sup> the hundred forty four thousand [the] bought from the earth.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>These are who were┘not└defiled with women, for they-are virgins<sup>mas</sup>; these (are) the-ones following the Lamb wherever<sup>2</sup> he-goes.  These were-purchased from [the] men (as a) first-fruit to-[the] God and to-the Lamb, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and in the mouth of-them (a) lie was┘not└found; they-are without-blemish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And I-saw another angel flying in (the) middle-of-the-sky, having (the) eternal gospel to-preach to-the-ones dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and language and people, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>saying in-a-loud voice, <em>“Fear [the] God and give him glory, because the hour of-the judgment of-him, and worship the-One having-made the sky and the earth and sea and springs of-water[s].</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And another angel, (a) second-one, followed, saying, <em>“</em><em>She-fell!  She-fell! </em><em> Babylon the Great that all the nations has/have-drunk from the wine of-the wrath of-the sexual-immorality of-her.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And another angel, (a) third-one, followed them, saying with (a) loud voice, <em>“If anybody worships the beast and the image of-it and receives (the) mark on the forehead of-him or on the hand of-him, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>even</em><em> </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> will-drink from the wine of-the wrath of-[the] God [the] mixed undiluted in the cup of-the wrath of-him, and he-will-be-tormented with fire and sulfur/brimstone before (the) holy angels and before the Lamb.  </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the smoke of-the torment of-them goes-up </em><em>for (the) ages of(the)-ages/</em><em>forevermore</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>, and </em><em>they-do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>have</em><em> rest </em><em>day and night/dur</em><em>ing</em><em>-(the)-day and during-(the)-night</em><em>—the-ones worshiping the beast and the image of it; and if anybody receive the stamp/mark of-the name of-him.  </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Here</em><em> is the perseverance</em><em>/patience</em><em> of-the saints, the-ones keeping the commandments and the faith of-Jesus.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And I-heard (a) voice out-of [the] heaven, <em>“Write</em><em>:  ‘</em><em>blessed (are) the dead, the-ones dying in (the) Lord from now-on.’” </em> <em>“</em><em>Yes, says the Spirit, in-order-that they-will-receive-rest from the labors of-them, for the works of-them will-follow with-them.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And I-looked, and behold (a) white cloud, and one-sitting on the cloud like (a) son of-man, having on the head of-him (a) gold crown and in the hand of-him (a) sharp scythe.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And another angel came out-of the sanctuary, shouting with (a) loud voice to-the-one sitting on the cloud, <em>“Send the scythe and harvest, because the hour to-harvest came, because the harvest of-the earth ripened.”</em>  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the-one sitting on the cloud swung the scythe of-him over the earth and the earth was-harvested.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And another angel came-out of the sanctuary [the] in [the] heaven, he having also (a) sharp scythe.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And another angel [came-out]<sup>ms</sup> of the altar, [the] having authority over [the] fire and he-shouted with-(a)-loud voice to-the one having the sharp [the] scythe, saying, “Reach-in the sharp [the] pruning-knife of-you and gather the clusters of-[the] grapevine of-the earth, because the clusters of-it ripened.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And the angel put the pruning-knife of-him into the earth and gathered the grape-clusters of-the earth and put (them) into the great [the] winepress of-the wrath of-[the] God.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And winepress was-trampled outside the city, and blood ran-out from the winepress until the bridles of-the horses for six-hundred (and) (a) thousand stades.</span>
