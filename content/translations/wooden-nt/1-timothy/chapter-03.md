## 1 Timothy Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Faithful (is) the saying:  "if anyone aspires-to (the) work-of-an-overseer/bishop, he-desires (a) good work."  2So it-is-necessary for the/a bishop/overseer to-be above-reproach, husband of-one wife, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able-to-teach, 3not-addicted-to-wine, not pugnacious, but gentle, not contentious, not-greedy-for-money, 4managing [the] his household well, having children in obedience with all good-character—5now if anyone does┘not└know-how to manage [the] his own household, how will-he-take-care-of (the) church of-God?—6not (a) new-convert lest2, being-conceited/proud, he-should fall into (the) condemnation of-the devil.  7And it-is-necessary also (for him) to-have (a) good reputation from the-ones outside in-order-that he┘not└fall into (the) disgrace and trap/snare of-the devil.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Likewise (it is necessary for) deacons (to be) of-good-character, not deceitful, not addicted to-a-lot-of wine, not greedy-for-dishonest-gain, 9having the mystery of-the faith in (a) clear conscience.  10And let┘these also first└be-examined; then let-them-serve-as-deacons, being blameless.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Likewise (it is necessary for their) wives (to be) of-good-character, not given-to-malicious-gossip, temperate, faithful in all-things.  12Let┘deacons└be husbands of-one wife, managing (their) children well and those of-their households.  13For the-ones having-served┘well└as-deacons obtain (a) good standing for-themselves and much boldness in (the) faith [the] in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I-am-writing these-things to-you, hoping to-come to you in speed.  15But if I-delay, in-order-that you-may-know-how it-is-necessary to-behave in (the) house of-God, which is (the) church of-(the)-living God, (a) pillar and foundation of-the/of-[the] truth.  16And without-denial great is the mystery of-[the] godliness.</span>
