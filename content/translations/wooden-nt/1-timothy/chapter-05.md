## 1 Timothy Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Do┘not└rebuke (an) elder, but urge (him) like (a) father, younger-(men) like brothers, 2older-(women) like mothers, younger-(women) like sisters in all purity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Honor widows (that are) indeed [the] widows.  4If any widow has children or grandchildren, let-them-learn first to-practice godliness in-respect-to-[the] their own household and to-repay2 the/their parents, for this is acceptable before [the] God.  5And the widow indeed and left-alone-one puts-(her)-hope in God and continues with [the] prayers and [the] thanksgiving night and day.  6But the-onefem living-in-self-indulgence is-dead, living.  7And command these-things in-order-that they-may-be above-reproach.  8And if anybody does┘not└take-care-of his-own, and especially (his own) household, he-has-denied the faith and is worse than-(an)-unbeliever.  9Let┘(a) widow└be-enrolled not having-become/being less than-sixty years, (the) wife of-one husband, 10testified-to in good works, if she-reared-children, if she-showed-hospitality, if she-washed (the) feet of-(the)-saints, if she-helped (the-ones) in-distress, if she-followed every good work.  11But reject younger widows, for when they-are-controlled-by-sensual-desires-against [the] Christ, they-want to-marry, 12having condemnation because they-set-aside the/their first promise; 13and at-the-same-time they┘also└get-in-the-habit-of/learn to-be/being idle, going-around from-house-to-house2, and not only idle, but also (becoming) gossipy-ones and busybodies, talking-about/telling [the] things they-should not.  14So I-want younger (widows to-get-married, to-bear-children, to-manage the household, to-give the opponent no occasion for slander.  15For already some turned-aside after [the] Satan.  16If any believingfem (woman) has widows, let-her-help them and let┘the church not└be-burdened, in-order-that it-may-help the widows indeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Let┘the managing- ell elders└be-counted-worthy of-double honor, especially the-ones laboring in (the) word and teaching.  18For the scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Do┘not└accept (an) accusation against (an) elder except3 on-the-word-of two or three witnesses.  20The-ones continuing-in-sin rebuke in-front-of all in-order-that the rest may┘also└have fear.  21I-solemnly-charge (you) before [the] God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you-keep these-things without discrimination, doing nothing according-to partiality.  22Lay hands hastily on-nobody, nor share other-people's sins.  Keep yourself pure.  23No-longer drink-water, but use (a) little wine on-account-of the stomach and the frequent sicknesses of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> The sins of-some men are quite-evident, leading (them) into condemnation, and for-some (their sins) also dog┘them└later.  25Likewise also [the] good [the] deeds (are) evident, and the-ones having otherwise are┘not└able to-be-hidden.</span>
