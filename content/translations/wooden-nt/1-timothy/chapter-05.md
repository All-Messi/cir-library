## 1 Timothy Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Do┘not└rebuke (an) elder, but urge (him) like (a) father, younger-(men) like brothers, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>older-(women) like mothers, younger-(women) like sisters in all purity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Honor widows (that are) indeed [the] widows.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If any widow has children or grandchildren, let-them-learn first to-practice godliness in-respect-to-[the] their own household and to-repay<sup>2</sup> the/their parents, for this is acceptable before [the] God.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the widow indeed and left-alone-one puts-(her)-hope in God and continues with [the] prayers and [the] thanksgiving night and day.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But the-one<sup>fem</sup> living-in-self-indulgence is-dead, living.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And command these-things in-order-that they-may-be above-reproach.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And if anybody does┘not└take-care-of his-own, and especially (his own) household, he-has-denied the faith and is worse than-(an)-unbeliever.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Let┘(a) widow└be-enrolled not having-become/being less than-sixty years, (the) wife of-one husband, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>testified-to in good works, if she-reared-children, if she-showed-hospitality, if she-washed (the) feet of-(the)-saints, if she-helped (the-ones) in-distress, if she-followed every good work.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But reject younger widows, for when they-are-controlled-by-sensual-desires-against [the] Christ, they-want to-marry, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>having condemnation because they-set-aside the/their first promise; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and at-the-same-time they┘also└get-in-the-habit-of/learn to-be/being idle, going-around from-house-to-house<sup>2</sup>, and not only idle, but also (becoming) gossipy-ones and busybodies, talking-about/telling [the] things they-should not.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So I-want younger (widows to-get-married, to-bear-children, to-manage the household, to-give the opponent no occasion for slander.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For already some turned-aside after [the] Satan.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>If any believing<sup>fem</sup> (woman) has widows, let-her-help them and let┘the church not└be-burdened, in-order-that it-may-help the widows indeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Let┘the managing- ell elders└be-counted-worthy of-double honor, especially the-ones laboring in (the) word and teaching.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For the scripture says, <strong>“You-shall</strong><strong>┘not└</strong><strong>muzzle (an) ox threshing</strong><strong>”</strong><strong>;</strong> and, “The laborer (is) worthy of-the pay of-him.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Do┘not└accept (an) accusation against (an) elder except<strong><sup>3</sup></strong> on-the-word-of two or three witnesses.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The-ones continuing-in-sin rebuke in-front-of all in-order-that the rest may┘also└have fear.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I-solemnly-charge (you) before [the] God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you-keep these-things without discrimination, doing nothing according-to partiality.  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Lay hands hastily on-nobody, nor share other-people’s sins.  Keep yourself pure.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>No-longer drink-water, but use (a) little wine on-account-of the stomach and the frequent sicknesses of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The sins of-some men are quite-evident, leading (them) into condemnation, and for-some (their sins) also dog┘them└later.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Likewise also [the] good [the] deeds (are) evident, and the-ones having otherwise are┘not└able to-be-hidden.</span>
