## 1 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So first of-all, I-urge entreaties, prayers, petitions, thanksgivings be-made on-behalf-of all men, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>on-behalf-of kings and all the-ones being in authority, in-order-that we-may-lead (a) peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and seriousness.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>This (is) good and acceptable before [the] God, the Savior of-us, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>who wants all men to-be-saved and to-come to (a) knowledge of-(the)-truth.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For (there is) one God, and one Mediator of/between God and men, (the) man Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>the-One having-given himself (as a) ransom for many, the/a testimony in-his-own times; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>unto which <u>I</u> was-appointed (a) herald and apostle—I-am-telling (the) truth; I-am┘not└lying—(a) teacher of-Gentiles in faith and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So I-want [the] men to-pray in every place, holding-up holy hands without anger and dispute.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Likewise [also]<sup>ms</sup> (I want) women to-adorn themselves with appropriate clothing with modesty and decency, not with elaborate-hairstyles and gold or pearls or expensive clothes, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>but with good deeds, as befits women  professing godliness.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Let┘(a) woman/wife└learn in quietness in all deference.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And I-do┘not└allow (a) woman to-teach or to-have-authority over a man, but to-be in quietness.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For Adam was-formed first, then Eve.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And Adam was┘not└deceived, but the woman, having-been-deceived, has-become in transgression.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But she-will-be-saved through [the] child-bearing if they-remain in faith and love and sanctification with decency.</span>
