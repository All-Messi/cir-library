## 1 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So first of-all, I-urge entreaties, prayers, petitions, thanksgivings be-made on-behalf-of all men, 2on-behalf-of kings and all the-ones being in authority, in-order-that we-may-lead (a) peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and seriousness.  3This (is) good and acceptable before [the] God, the Savior of-us, 4who wants all men to-be-saved and to-come to (a) knowledge of-(the)-truth.  5For (there is) one God, and one Mediator of/between God and men, (the) man Christ Jesus, 6the-One having-given himself (as a) ransom for many, the/a testimony in-his-own times; 7unto which I was-appointed (a) herald and apostle—I-am-telling (the) truth; I-am┘not└lying—(a) teacher of-Gentiles in faith and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So I-want [the] men to-pray in every place, holding-up holy hands without anger and dispute.  9Likewise [also]ms (I want) women to-adorn themselves with appropriate clothing with modesty and decency, not with elaborate-hairstyles and gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 10but with good deeds, as befits women  professing godliness.  11Let┘(a) woman/wife└learn in quietness in all deference.  12And I-do┘not└allow (a) woman to-teach or to-have-authority over a man, but to-be in quietness.  13For Adam was-formed first, then Eve.  14And Adam was┘not└deceived, but the woman, having-been-deceived, has-become in transgression.  15But she-will-be-saved through [the] child-bearing if they-remain in faith and love and sanctification with decency.</span>
