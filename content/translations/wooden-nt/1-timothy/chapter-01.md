## 1 Timothy Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus according-to (the) commandment of-God, (the) Savior of-us, and Christ Jesus, the hope of-us, 2to-Timothy, loyal son in (the) faith.  Grace, mercy, (and) peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Lord of-us. Even-a	3As I-urged you to-remain in Ephesus, going into Macedonia, in-order-that you-may-instruct certain-ones not to-teach-strange-doctrine, 4nor to-pay-attention to-myths and endless genealogies, which bring-about speculation[s] rather than (the) economy of-God [the] in faith.  5But the goal of-[the] instruction is love out-of (a) pure heart and (a) good conscience and (a) sincere faith, 6which some, having-lost-their-way, turned-away-from into empty-talk, 7desiring to-be teachers-of-the-Law, not understanding either what-things they-say-or about what-things they-confidently-assert.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Now we-know that the Law (is) good if (a) person uses it lawfully, 9knowing this:  that (the) Law does┘not└exist for-(a)-righteous (person), but for-lawless and rebellious (people), for-godlessness and sinners, for-unholy and profane, murders-of-fathers and murders-of-mothers, for man-slayers, 10sexually-immoral (men), homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if any other-thing contradicts [the] sound doctrine 11according-to the gospelneut of-[the] glory of-the blessed God, whichnuet I was-entrusted-with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I-have gratitude to-Christ Jesus the Savior of-us, the-One having-strengthened me, because he considered me faithful, having-appointed me to ministry 13though┘formerly2└being (a) blasphemer and persecutor and insolent-person.  But I-was-given-mercy because I-did (it) ignorantly in disbelief.  14but the grace of-the Lord of-us overflowed with (the) faith/trust and love [the] in Christ Jesus.  15Faithful (is) the saying and worthy of-all acceptance—that "Christ Jesus came into the world to-save sinners, of-whom I am foremost."  16Indeed, on-account-of this I-was-given-mercy in-order-that in me, (the) foremost (sinner), Christ Jesus might-show [the] complete patience as (an) example of-the-ones going to-believe in him unto eternal life.  17Now to-the King of-the ages, immortal, invisible, (the) only God (be) honor and glory forevermore5.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> This [the] instruction I-am-entrusting to-you, (my) son Timothy, according-to the prophesies having-come-earlier in-regard-to you, in-order-that by them you-might-fight the good fight, 19having faith and (a) good conscience, which some, having-rejected, suffered-shipwreck concerning the faith, 20of-whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I-delivered to-[the] Satan in-order-that they-might-learn not to-blaspheme.</span>
