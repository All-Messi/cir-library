## 1 Timothy Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now the Spirit says expressly that in (the) last times some will-fall-away-from the faith, paying-attention-to deceiving spirits and doctrines of-demons, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>in (the) hypocrisy of-liars, having-been-seared with-respect-to [the] their conscience, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>preventing to-marry, abstaining-from foods, which [the] God created for reception with thanksgiving by-the-ones faithful and having-known the truth, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>because every creation of-God (is) good and nothing rejected, being-received with thanksgiving; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>for it-is-sanctified by (the) word of-God and prayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Pointing-out these-things to-the brothers, you-will-be (a) good minister of-Christ Jesus, being nourished by-the words of-the faith and the good teaching that you-have-followed.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But stay-away-from [the] profane, silly myths.  But exercise yourself unto godliness.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For [the] bodily exercise is profitable unto (a)-little/little, but [the] godliness is profitable unto all-things, having promise of-life [the] now and [the] coming.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Faithful/reliable (is) the saying and worthy of-all acceptance:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Command and teach these-things.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Let┘nobody└disregard the youth of-you, but become (an) example of-the faithful-ones in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Until I-come, give-attention to-[the] reading, to-[the] exhortation, to-[the] teaching.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Do┘not└neglect the spiritual-gift in you, which was-given to-you by prophecy with (the) laying-on of-[the] hands of-the eldership.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Cultivate these-things, be in these-things in-order-that the progress of-you may-be evident to-all.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Pay-close-attention to-yourself and the teaching; persevere in-respect-to-them; for doing this, you-will-save both yourself and the-ones hearing you.</span>
