## 1 Timothy Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let┘as-many-as are slaves under (the) yoke└consider [the] their masters worthy of-all honor, in-order-that the name of-[the] God and the doctrine may┘not└be-slandered.  2And let┘the-ones having faithful masters not└disregard (them) because they-are brothers; but let-them-serve-as-slaves all-the-more, because the-ones benefiting-from the/their service are faithful and beloved.  Teach and encourage these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> If anybody teaches-otherwise and does┘not└agree-with sound words [the] of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ and the teaching according-to godliness, 4he-has-become-conceited, understanding nothing, but having-(an)-unhealthy-desire about questions and quarrels-about-words, out-of which arises jealousy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, 5constant-arguings of-men depraved with-respect-to the mind and having-been-deprived of-the truth, supposing [the] godliness to-be (a) means-of-gain.  6But [the] godliness with contentment is (a) great means-of-gain.  7For we-have-brought nothing into the world; because neither are-we-able to-take┘anything└out.  8But having-food and shelter[s]/covering[s], we-will-be-content with-these.  9But the-ones wanting to-be rich fall into temptation and (a) snare/trap and many ignorant/foolish and harmful desires that sink/plunge [the] men into ruin and destruction.  10For the love-of-money is (the) root of-all [the] evil-things, longing-for which some were-deceived/wandered-away from the faith and impaled themselves through with-many pains/sorrows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But you, O man of-God, flee these-things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness.  12Fight the good fight of-[the] faith, take-hold of-[the] eternal life, to which you-were called and you-confessed the good confession before many witnesses.  13I-charge [you]ms before [the] God, the-One giving-life-to [the] all-things, and Christ Jesus the-One having-testified before Pontius Pilate the good confession, 14(that) you keep the commandment stainless/spotless, unreproachable, until the appearance of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, 15which in his own time the blessed and only master will-show, the King of-the ruling-ones  and Lord of-[the] lording-ones, 16the-One alone having immortality, living-in light unapproachable, whom nobody of-men saw nor is-able to-see, to-whom (be) honor and eternal might.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Command the rich in the present age not to-be-arrogant, neither to-put-hope on (the) uncertainty of-wealth, but on God the-One supplying us all-things richly unto enjoyment; 18to-do-good, to-be-rich in good deeds, to-be generous, ready-to-share, 19treasuring-up for-themselves (a) good foundation for the future-thing, in-order-that they-may-take-hold-of [the] life indeed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> O Timothy, guard the-thing entrusted (to you), avoiding [the] worldly empty-talk[s] and (the) opposition of-[the] knowledge falsely-so-called, 21which some, professing, strayed-away concerning the faith.</span>
