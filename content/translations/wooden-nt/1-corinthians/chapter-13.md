## 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If I-speak in the languages of-[the] men and [the] angels, but do┘not└have love, I-have-become (a) noisy gong or crashing cymbal. 2And if I-have prophecy and know-all [the] mysteries and all [the] knowledge and if I-have all [the] faith so-as to-remove mountains, and do┘not└have love, I-am nothing. 3And-if I-give-away┘all the belongings of-me└to-feed (the poor), and if I-deliver-over the body of-me in-order-that I-may-be-burned-up, and I-do┘not└have love, I-am-profited nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Love (is) longsuffering: love is kind; is┘not└jealous, [the] [love]ms is┘not└conceited, is┘not└arrogant, 5does┘not└behave-improperly, does┘not└seek the-things of-itself, is┘not└easily-upset, does┘not└keep-track of-[the] evil, 6does┘not└rejoice in [the] injustice, but rejoices in the truth; 7puts-up-with all things, believes all-things, hopes all-things, endures all-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> [The] love never falls. But if (there are) prophecies, they-will-be-put-away; if (there are) languages, they-will-stop; if (there is) knowledge, it-will-pass-away. 9For we-know in part and we prophesy in part. 10But when the perfect comes, the in-part will-pass-away. 11When I-was (a) child, I-used-to-speak like (a) child, think like (a) child, reason like (a) child. When I-became (a) man, I-put-away the-things of-the/a child. 12For now we-see by (a) mirror in (an) obscure-image, but then I-will-know even-as also I-was-known 13But now remains faith, hope, love, these [the] three-things; but [the] love (is the) greatest of-these.</span>
