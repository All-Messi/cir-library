## 1 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In-this-way let┘(a) man└consider us: as ministers of-Christ and stewards of-(the)-mysteries of-God. 2Here beyond-that it-is-required in [the] stewards that (a) person be-found reliable. 3But to-me it-is (a) very-small-thing that I-should-be-examined by you or by (a) human court; indeed I-do┘not-even└judge myself. I-am-aware-of┘nothing└against myself, but I-do┘not└stand-justified by this; but the-One examining me is (the) Lord. 5So-that do┘not└judge anything ahead-of time until the Lord comes, who also will-bring-to-light hidden-things of-[the] darkness and will-disclose the plans of-the hearts, and then [the] praise will-be to-each from [the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now these-things, brothers, I-applied to myself and Apollos on-account-of you, in-order-that you-might-learn in us [the] not above what-things have-been-written, in-order-that not one of-you-be-conceited on-behalf-of the one against the other. 7For who regards yousg? And what do-you-have that-you-did┘not└receive? But if you┘also└received (it), why be-proud as-if not having-received (it)? 8Already you stand-filled; already you-became-rich; you-came-to-rule without us. And I-wish you-had-come-to-rule in-order-that we might┘also└rule-with you. 9For I-think [the] God commended us [the] apostles last as sentenced-to-death, because we-became (a) spectacle to-the world and to-angels and to-men. 10We (are) fools on-account-of Christ, but you (are) wise in Christ. We (are) weak; but you (are) strong. You (are) distinguished (people), but we (are) without-honor. 11Up-to the present hour we┘both└hunger and thirst and are-poorly-clothed and are-harassed and homeless; 12and we-labor, working with-[the] our hands. Insulted, we-bless; persecuted, we-endure; 13slandered, we-speak-words-of-encouragement. We-became like the rubbish of-the world, (the) scum of-all-things till now.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Not shaming you, do-I-write these-things, but as my beloved children to-admonishing. 15For if you-have countless instructors in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became-your-father through the gospel. 16So I-urge you, be imitators of-me. 17On-account-of this I-sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in (the) Lord, who will remind┘you└of the ways of-me [the] in Christ Jesus, even-as everywhere I-teach in every church. 18 Now some were-conceited as I not coming to you. 19But I-will-come to you soon if the Lord wills, and I-till-know, not the word of-the-ones conceited, but the power. 20For the kingdom of-[the] God (is) in word, but in power. 21What do-you-want? Should-I-come with (a)</span>
