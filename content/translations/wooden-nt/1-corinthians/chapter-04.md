## 1 Corinthians Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>In-this-way let┘(a) man└consider us: as ministers of-Christ and stewards of-(the)-mysteries of-God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Here beyond-that it-is-required in [the] stewards that (a) person be-found reliable. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But to-me it-is (a) very-small-thing that I-should-be-examined by you or by (a) human court; indeed I-do┘not-even└judge myself. I-am-aware-of┘nothing└against myself, but I-do┘not└stand-justified by this; but the-One examining me is (the) Lord. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So-that do┘not└judge anything ahead-of time until the Lord comes, who also will-bring-to-light hidden-things of-[the] darkness and will-disclose the plans of-the hearts, and then [the] praise will-be to-each from [the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now these-things, brothers, I-applied to myself and Apollos on-account-of you, in-order-that you-might-learn in us [the] not above what-things have-been-written, in-order-that not one of-you-be-conceited on-behalf-of the one against the other. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For who regards you<sup>sg</sup>? And what do-you-have that-you-did┘not└receive? But if you┘also└received (it), why be-proud as-if not having-received (it)? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Already you stand-filled; already you-became-rich; you-came-to-rule without us. And I-wish you-had-come-to-rule in-order-that we might┘also└rule-with you. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For I-think [the] God commended us [the] apostles last as sentenced-to-death, because we-became (a) spectacle to-the world and to-angels and to-men. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>We (are) fools on-account-of Christ, but you (are) wise in Christ. We (are) weak; but you (are) strong. You (are) distinguished (people), but we (are) without-honor. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Up-to the present hour we┘both└hunger and thirst and are-poorly-clothed and are-harassed and homeless; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and we-labor, working with-[the] our hands. Insulted, we-bless; persecuted, we-endure; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>slandered, we-speak-words-of-encouragement. We-became like the rubbish of-the world, (the) scum of-all-things till now.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Not shaming you, do-I-write these-things, but as my beloved children to-admonishing. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For if you-have countless instructors in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus <u>I</u> became-your-father through the gospel. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So I-urge you, be imitators of-me. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>On-account-of this I-sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in (the) Lord, who will remind┘you└of the ways of-me [the] in Christ Jesus, even-as everywhere I-teach in every church. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong>Now some were-conceited as I not coming to you. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But I-will-come to you soon if the Lord wills, and I-till-know, not the word of-the-ones conceited, but the power. <sup>20</sup>For the kingdom of-[the] God (is) in word, but in power. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>What do-you-want? Should-I-come with (a) rod to you, or in love and (a) spirit of-gentleness?</span>
