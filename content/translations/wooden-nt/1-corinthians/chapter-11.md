## 1 Corinthians Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be-imitators of-me even-as I-also (am) of-Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Now I-praise you, because you-have-remembered all-things of-me, and hold-firmly-to the traditions, even-as I-delivered (them) to-you. 3Now I-want you to-know that [the] Christ is the head of-every husband, and the/a husband (is the head) of-(a)-wife, and [the] God is (the) head of-[the] Christ. 4Every man praying or prophesying having (something) on (his) head disgraces the head of-him. 5And every woman praying or prophesying uncovered with-respect-to-the head disgraces the head of-her. For it-is one and the same-thing (for it to be) [the] shaved. 6For if (a) woman is-uncovered, let-her-cut-her-hair-off; and if (it is) shameful for-(a)-woman to-cut-her-hair-off or shave-(it)-off, let-her-be-covered. 7For (a) man ought not cover the/his head, being (the) image and glory of-God. And the woman is (the) glory of-(the)-man. 8For (a) man is not of-(the)-woman, but (the) woman on-account-of the man. 10On-account-of this, the woman ought to-have authority on the/her head on-account-of the angels. 11However, in (the) Lord the woman (is) neither without (the) man nor (the) man without (the) woman. 12For as the woman (is) out-of the man, so also the man (is) through the woman, and [the] all-things (are) out-of [the] God. 13Judge in you yourselves: is-it proper for-(a)-woman to-pray to-[the] God uncovered? 14Does┘not [the] nature itself└teach you that if (a) man lets-his-hair-grow-long it-is (a) dishonor to-him, 15but if (a) woman lets-her-hair-grow-long, it-is (an) honor to-her? 16Now if anybody wants to-be contentious, we do┘not└have such (a) custom nor the churches of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But instructing (you) with-respect-to-this, I-am┘not└praising (you), because you-come-together, not for the better, but for the worse. 18For first-of-all you coming-together in church, I hear divisions to-be among you, and partly I-believe it. 19For it-is-necessary even for-divisions to-be among you, in-order-that the approved-ones may-become apparent among you. 20So you assembling together3, it-is┘not└possible to-eat the Lord's Supper. 21For each brings [the] his-own meal at the eating, and one is-hungry and another is-sated. 22Do-you┘not└have houses for [the] eating and drinking? Or do-you-treat┘the church of-[the] God└with-contempt, and embarrass the-ones not having? What am-I-to-say to-you? Will-I-praise you? In this I-will┘not└praise (you).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> For I-received from the Lord what also I-delivered to-you, that the Lord on the night in-which he-was-betrayed took (a) loaf; 24and, having-given-thanks, broke (it), and said, "This is the body of-me [the] for you. Do this in [the] my remembrance." 25Likewise also the cup after [the] dining, saying, "This [the] cup is the new covenant in [the] my blood; do this as-often-as2 you drink (it) in [the] my remembrance." 26For as-often-as2 you-eat [the] this bread and drink the cup, you-proclaim the death of-the Lord until2 he-comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So whoever2 eats the loaf or drinks the cup of-the Lord in-an-unworthy-manner will-be guilty of-the body and the blood of-the Lord. 28And let┘(a) man└examine himself and in-this-way let-him-eat [of] the bread and let-him-drink [of] the cup. 29For the-one eating and drinking eats and drinks condemnation to-himself, not discerning the body and blood [of-the Lord]ms. 30On-account-of this, many among you (are) weak and sick, and (a) considerable (number) are-asleep. 31But if we-were-examining ourselves, we-would┘not└be-condemned. 32But being judged, we-are-disciplined by the Lord in-order-that we-might┘not└be-condemned with the world. 33So, my brothers, assembling unto [the] eating, wait-for one-another. 34If anybody is-hungry, let-him-eat at home in-order-that you-might┘not└assemble to condemnation. But the remaining-things, I-will-give-instruction-about when2 I-come.</span>
