## 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Sexual-immorality is┘actually└reported among you, and such immorality that (is) not -even among the Gentiles, that somebody would-be-living-with (the) wife of-the/his father. 2And are you proud and not mourning instead in-order-that the-one having-done this [the] deed should-be-removed from (the) midst of-you? 3For I, being-absent with-the body but present in-the spirit, have┘already└judged, as-if being-present, the-one having-committed this thus. 4In the name of-the Lord [of-us]ms Jesus, you having-been-assembled and [the] my spirit with the power of-the Lord of-us Jesus, 5deliver such-(a person) to-[the] Satan for (the) destruction of-the flesh, in-order-that the spirit may-be-saved in the day of-the Lord. 6The pride of-you (is) not good. Do-you┘not└know that (a) little yeast leavens the whole lump? 7Clean-out the old yeast in-order-0that you-may-be (a) new lump, even-as you-are unleavened, for also Christ the Passover of-us was sacrificed. 8So let-us celebrate-the-festival, not with old yeast nor with yeast of-evil and wickedness, but with unleavened (bread) of-sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I-wrote to-you in the/my letter not to associate-with immoral-people, 10at-all (meaning) with-[the] immoral-people of-[the] this world or with covetous-people and swindlers or idolaters, because you-would-have┘then└been-obligated to-leave [from] the world. 11But now I-wrote to-you not to-associate if (a) certain (man) named (a) brother is (an) immoral-person or covetous-person or idolater or slanderer or drunkard, not to-eat-with [the] such-(a)-person. 12For what (is) to-me to-judge the-ones outside? Do┘you not└judge the-ones inside? 13But the-ones outside [the] God will-judge. "Remove (the) wicked-(man) out-of you yourselves."</span>
