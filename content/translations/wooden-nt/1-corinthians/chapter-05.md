## 1 Corinthians Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Sexual-immorality is┘actually└reported among you, and such immorality that (is) not -even among the Gentiles, that somebody would-be-living-with (the) wife of-the/his father. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And are you proud and not mourning instead in-order-that the-one having-done this [the] deed should-be-removed from (the) midst of-you? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For I, being-absent with-the body but present in-the spirit, have┘already└judged, as-if being-present, the-one having-committed this thus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>In the name of-the Lord [of-us]<sup>ms</sup> Jesus, you having-been-assembled and [the] my spirit with the power of-the Lord of-us Jesus, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>deliver such-(a person) to-[the] Satan for (the) destruction of-the flesh, in-order-that the spirit may-be-saved in the day of-the Lord. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The pride of-you (is) not good. Do-you┘not└know that (a) little yeast leavens the whole lump? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Clean-out the old yeast in-order-0that you-may-be (a) new lump, even-as you-are unleavened, for also Christ the Passover of-us was sacrificed. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So let-us celebrate-the-festival, not with old yeast nor with yeast of-evil and wickedness, but with unleavened (bread) of-sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I-wrote to-you in the/my letter not to associate-with immoral-people, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>at-all (meaning) with-[the] immoral-people of-[the] this world or with covetous-people and swindlers or idolaters, because you-would-have┘then└been-obligated to-leave [from] the world. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But now I-wrote to-you not to-associate if (a) certain (man) named (a) brother is (an) immoral-person or covetous-person or idolater or slanderer or drunkard, not to-eat-with [the] such-(a)-person. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For what (is) to-me to-judge the-ones outside? Do┘you not└judge the-ones inside? <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But the-ones outside [the] God will-judge. <strong>“Remove (the) wicked-(man) </strong><strong>out-of</strong><strong> you yourselves.”</strong></span>
