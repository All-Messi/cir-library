## 1 Corinthians Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now concerning [the] spiritual gifts, brothers, I-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You-know that when you-were Gentiles, you-were led-astray to [the] dumb [the] idols. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Wherefore I-make-known to-you that nobody speaking by (the) Spirit of-God, says, “Jesus (is) accursed”; and nobody is-able to-say, “Jesus (is) Lord,” except<sup>2</sup> by the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Love (is) longsuffering: love is kind; is┘not└jealous, [the] [love]<sup>ms</sup> is┘not└conceited, is┘not└arrogant, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>does┘not└behave-improperly, does┘not└seek the-things of-itself, is┘not└easily-upset, does┘not└keep-track of-[the] evil, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>does┘not└rejoice in [the] injustice, but rejoices in the truth; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>puts-up-with all things, believes all-things, hopes all-things, endures all-things. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>[The] love never falls. But if (there are) prophecies, they-will-be-put-away; if (there are) languages, they-will-stop; if (there is) knowledge, it-will-pass-away. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For we-know in part and we prophesy in part. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But when the perfect comes, the in-part will-pass-away. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When I-was (a) child, I-used-to-speak like (a) child, think like (a) child, reason like (a) child. When I-became (a) man, I-put-away the-things of-the/a child. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For now we-see by (a) mirror in (an) obscure-image, but then I-will-know even-as also I-was-known <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But now remains faith, hope, love, these [the] three-things; but [the] love (is the) greatest of-these.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For even-as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of-the body, being many, are one body, so also [the] Christ. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For also by one Spirit we all were-baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we-were-made-to-drink one Spirit. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For also the body is not one member but many. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If the/a foot says, “Because I-am not (a) hand, I-am not of the body,” not from this (is it) not of the body? <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And if the/an ear says, “Because I-am not (an) eye, I-am not of the body, [not] from this is-it not of the body? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If the whole body (were an) eye, where (would) the hearing (be)? If (the) whole (body were) hearing, where (would) the smelling (be)? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But now [the] God placed the members, each one of-them, in the body just-as he-wanted. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>If they were all one member, where (would) the body (be)? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But now (there are) many members, but one body. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And the eye is┘not└able to-say to-the hand, “I-do┘not└have-need of-you,” or again the head (is not able to say) to-the feet, “I-do┘not└have-need of-you.” <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But more by-much the seeming to-be weaker-members of-the body are necessary, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and what-ones we-suppose to-be less-honorable—to-these we-treat-with greater honor, and the unseemly (members) of-us have greater propriety, <sup>24</sup>and the seemly (members) of-us have no need (of it), but [the] God put┘the body└together, giving greater honor to-the-one lacking, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>in-order-that (a) division might┘not└be in the body, but the members might-have┘the same└care for one-another. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer-with (it); if one member is-glorified, all the members rejoice-with (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now you are (the) body of-Christ and individually members (of it). <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And whom [the] God appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then (workers of) miracles, then spiritual-gifts of-healings, helps, administrations, kinds of-languages. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Not┘all (are) apostles, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) prophets, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) teachers, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) (workers of) miracles, └are-they? <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Not┘ all have spiritual-gifts of healing, └do-they? Not┘ all speak in languages, └do-they? Not┘<sup> </sup>all translate, └do-they? <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Now desire-earnestly the greater [the] gifts. And yet I-show you according-to (a) better way. <strong>13</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>If I-speak in the languages of-[the] men and [the] angels, but do┘not└have love, I-have-become (a) noisy gong or crashing cymbal. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And if I-have prophecy and know-all [the] mysteries and all [the] knowledge and if I-have all [the] faith so-as to-remove mountains, and do┘not└have love, I-am nothing. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And-if I-give-away┘all the belongings of-me└to-feed (the poor), and if I-deliver-over the body of-me in-order-that I-may-be-burned-up, and I-do┘not└have love, I-am-profited nothing.</span>
