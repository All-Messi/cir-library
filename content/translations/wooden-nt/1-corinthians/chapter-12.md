## 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now concerning [the] spiritual gifts, brothers, I-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware. 2You-know that when you-were Gentiles, you-were led-astray to [the] dumb [the] idols. 3Wherefore I-make-known to-you that nobody speaking by (the) Spirit of-God, says, "Jesus (is) accursed"; and nobody is-able to-say, "Jesus (is) Lord," except2 by the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Now there-are varieties of-spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit, 5and there-are varieties of-ministries, and the same Lord, 6and there-are varieties of-activities, but the same God the-one working [the] all-things in all (people). 7But to-each the manifestation of-the Spirit is-given for the common-good. 8For to-one (the) word of-wisdom is-given by the Spirit, but to-another (the) word of-knowledge according-to the same Spirit. 9To-another, faith by the same Spirit, but to-another spiritual-gifts of healings by the one Spirit. 10But to-another workings of-miracles, but to-another prophecy, and to-another varieties of-spirits, to-another kinds of-languages, but to-another translation of-languages. 11And all these-things the One and the same Spirit works, distributing to-each individually even-as he-desires.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> For even-as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of-the body, being many, are one body, so also [the] Christ. 13For also by one Spirit we all were-baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we-were-made-to-drink one Spirit. 14For also the body is not one member but many. 15If the/a foot says, "Because I-am not (a) hand, I-am not of the body," not from this (is it) not of the body? 16And if the/an ear says, "Because I-am not (an) eye, I-am not of the body, [not] from this is-it not of the body? 17If the whole body (were an) eye, where (would) the hearing (be)? If (the) whole (body were) hearing, where (would) the smelling (be)? 18But now [the] God placed the members, each one of-them, in the body just-as he-wanted. 19If they were all one member, where (would) the body (be)? 20But now (there are) many members, but one body. 21And the eye is┘not└able to-say to-the hand, "I-do┘not└have-need of-you," or again the head (is not able to say) to-the feet, "I-do┘not└have-need of-you." 22But more by-much the seeming to-be weaker-members of-the body are necessary, 23and what-ones we-suppose to-be less-honorable—to-these we-treat-with greater honor, and the unseemly (members) of-us have greater propriety, 24and the seemly (members) of-us have no need (of it), but [the] God put┘the body└together, giving greater honor to-the-one lacking, 25in-order-that (a) division might┘not└be in the body, but the members might-have┘the same└care for one-another. 26And if one member suffers, all the members suffer-with (it); if one member is-glorified, all the members rejoice-with (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Now you are (the) body of-Christ and individually members (of it). 28And whom [the] God appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then (workers of) miracles, then spiritual-gifts of-healings, helps, administrations, kinds of-languages. 29Not┘all (are) apostles, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) prophets, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) teachers, └are-they? Not┘ all (are) (workers of) miracles, └are-they? 30Not┘ all have spiritual-gifts of healing, └do-they? Not┘ all speak in languages, └do-they? Not┘ all translate, └do-they? 31Now desire-earnestly the greater [the] gifts.</span>
