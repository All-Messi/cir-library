## 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now about [the]-things offered to idols. We┘all└have knowledge. [The] knowledge puffs up; [the] love builds up. 2If anybody thinks (himself) to-know something, he-did┘not-yet└come-to-know as it-is-necessary to-know. 3And if anybody loves [the] God, this-one has-been-known by him. 4About [the] eating things-offered-to-idols. We know (there is) no idol in (the) world and that nobody (is) God but2 one. 5For even if there-are so-called gods either in heaven or on earth, as there-are many gods and many lords, 6 [but] for-us (there is) one God the Father, from whom (are) [the] all-things and we (exist) for him, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom (are) [the] all-things and we (exist) through him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But [the] knowledge (is) not in all. But some, by-the custom of-the idols until now, eat as something-offered-to-(an)-idol; and the conscience of-them, being-weak, is defiled. 8But food will┘not└commend us to-[the] God. Neither if we-do┘not└eat are-we-worse; nor if-we-eat are-we-better. 9But beware lest somehow this [the] right of-you becomes (a) stumbling block to-the weak. 10For if somebody sees the-one having knowledge sitting in (a) idol's-temple, will┘the conscience of-him, being weak, not└be-encouraged to-eat to the (idol the-things offered-to-the-idol? 11For the-one being weak, the brother on-account-of whom Christ died, is-destroyed by [the] your knowledge. 12And in-this-manner sinning against the/a brother and wounding the conscience of-them, being weak, you-sin against Christ. 13So if food makes┘the brother of-me└stumble,, I-will┘certainly not└eat meat forever3, in-order-that I-will┘not make the brother of-me└stumble.</span>
