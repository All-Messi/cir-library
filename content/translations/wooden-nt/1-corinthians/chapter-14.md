## 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Pursue [the] love, and earnestly-desire [the] spiritual (gifts), but specifically in-order-that you-may-be-prophesying. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Ffor the-one speaking in (a) language is┘not└speaking to-men but to-God, because nobody is-understanding; but by-(the)-Spirit he-speaks mysteries. <sup>3</sup>But the-one prophesying speaks to-men edification and exhortation and consolation. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The-one speaking in-(a)-language builds┘himself└up, but the-one prophesying builds┘(the) church└up. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Now I-am-willing for you all to-speak in-languages, but specifically in-order-that you-may-be-prophesying. And the-one prophesying (is) greater than the-one speaking in-languages unless<sup>3</sup> he-translates in-order-that the church may-receive edification.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in languages, what will I profit you unless<sup>2</sup> I-speak to-you either with revelation or with knowledge or with prophecy or [with]<sup>ms</sup> teaching? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Even [the] lifeless things giving sound—whether (a) flute, whether (a) harp—if they do┘not└give (a) distinction in-[the] tones, how will the-thing played-on-the flute or the-thing played-on-the harp be-known? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For also if (a) bugle gives (an) indistinct sound, who will-prepare himself for battle? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So also you by the/a language, unless<sup>2</sup> you give clear speech, how will┘the-thing spoken└be-known? For you-will-be speaking into (the) air. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Perhaps<sup>2</sup> there-are (a) great-many kinds of-sounds in (the) world, and none (is) meaningless. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So if I-do┘not└know the meaning of-the sound, I-will-be to-the-one speaking (a) foreigner, and the-one speaking in me (will be a) foreigner. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So also you, since you-are zealots of-spiritual (gifts), seek for the edification of-the church in-order-that you-may-abound. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Wherefore let┘the-one speaking in-(a)-language└pray that he-may-translate. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>[For]<sup>ms</sup> if I-pray in-(a)-language the spirit of-me prays, but the mind of-me is unfruitful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>What then is-it? I-will-pray with-the Spirit, and I-will┘also└pray with-the mind; I-will-sing with-the Spirit, and I-will┘also└sing with-the mind. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Otherwise if you-bless with-(the)-spirit, how will┘the-one filling the place of-the ungifted└say [the] “Amen” over [the] your thanksgiving? Because what you-are-saying he-does┘not└understand. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For you are-giving-thanks well, but the other is┘not└being-edified. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I-thank [the] God, I-speak in-languages more than you all, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>but in church I-want to-speak five words with-[the] mind of-me, in-order-that I-may-instruct others too rather-than ten-thousand words in-(a)-language.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Brothers, do┘not└be children in-the/your thinking, but in-respect-to-[the] evil be-children, and in-the/your minds be mature. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>In the Law it-has-been-written [that], <strong>“</strong><strong>‘</strong><strong>With foreign-speaking-ones</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd with (the) lips of strangers</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	I-will-speak to-[the] </strong><strong>this</strong><strong> people,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd not-even </strong>so <strong>will-they-listen</strong>-to me,’ says (the) Lord.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> So [the] languages are [for (a) sign, not to-[the] believers, but to-[the] unbelievers, but [the] prophecy (is) not for-[the] unbelievers, but for-[the] believers. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>If then the whole church comes together<sup>3</sup>, and all are-speaking in languages, and ungifted-ones or unbelieving-ones come-in, will-they┘not└say that you-are crazy? <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But if all are-prophesying and (a) certain unbelieving-one or ungifted-one comes-in, he-will-be-convicted by all; he-will-be-called-to-account by all. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The hidden-things of-the heart of-him become manifest, and so, having-fallen on (his) face, he-will-worship [the] God, declaring [that], “Surely [the] God is among you.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>What is-it then, brothers? When you-assemble, each has (a) psalm, has (a) teaching, has (a) revelation, has (a) language, has (a) translation. Let┘all-things└be to edification. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>If anybody is-speaking in-(a)-language, (let it be) by two or [the] at-the most three and in turn; and let┘one└translate. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And if there-is not (a) translator, let-him-be-silent. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>For you are-able one-at-(a)-time to-prophesy, in-order-that all may-learn and all may-be-encouraged. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And (the) spirits of-(the)-prophets are-subject to-(the)-prophets, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>for [the] God is not (a God) of-confusion, but of-peace. As in all the churches of-the saints, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>let┘└the women be-quiet in the church-services. Speaking is┘not└permitted to-them, but let-them-be-in deference, even-as the Law also says. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And if they-want to-learn-about something, let-them-ask their husbands at home. For it-is embarrassing for (a) woman to-speak in church. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Or did┘the word of-[the] God└go-out from you, or did-it-come to you only?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>If anybody considers (himself a) prophet or spiritual, let-him-know that what I-am-writing to-you is (a) commandment of-(the) Lord. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>But if anybody does-not-recognize (this), he-is-not-recognized. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>So, [my]<sup>ms</sup> brothers, earnestly-desire [the] to-prophesy and do┘not└prevent [the] speaking in-languages. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>But let┘all-things└be (done) properly and according-to order.</span>
