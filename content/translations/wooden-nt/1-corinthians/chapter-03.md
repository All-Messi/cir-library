## 1 Corinthians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And-I, brothers, was┘not└able to-speak to-you as spiritual but as physical, as infants in Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I-gave┘you milk└to-drink, not solid-food. For you-are still physical, for where jealousy and strife (are) among you, are not you fleshly and walk according-to man? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For when anybody (of you) says, “<u>I</u> am of-Paul,” and another (says), “<u>I</u> (am) of-Apollos,” are-you not men? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers by whom you-came-to-believe, and to-each as the Lord gave. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I-planted, Apollos watered, but God made-(it)-grow. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So neither is the-one planting anything, nor the-one watering, but God the-One making-(it)-grow. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Now the-one planting and the-one watering are one, but each will-receive [the] his-own pay according-to [the] his-own work. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For we-are fellow-workers of-God; you are God’s field, God’s building.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>According-to the grace of-[the] God [the] given to-me as (a) wise general-contractor I-laid (a) foundation, and another builds-on (it). But let┘each└watch how he builds-on (it). <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For nobody is-able to-lay another foundation than the-one laid, which is Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And if anybody builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>the work of-each will-become evident, for the day will-make-(it)-clear, because it-will-be-reveled by fire. And what-kind the work of-each is the fire itself will-test. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If the work of-anybody will-remain that he-build-on (the foundation), he-will-receive pay. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If the work of-anybody will-be-burned-up, he-will-suffer-loss, but he himself will-be-saved, but so as by fire. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Do-youknow that you-are (a) temple of-God and the Spirit of-[the] God lives in you? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>If anybody destroys the temple of-[the] God, [the] God will-destroy this-one. For the temple of-[the] God is holy, which you are. Let┘nobody└deceive himself. If anybody thinks (himself) to-be wise among you in this [the] age/world, let-him-become foolish in-order-that he-might-become wise. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For it-has-been-written, <strong>“(He is) the One catching the wise in the craftiness of-them,”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>and again, <strong>“</strong><strong>(The) Lord knows the reasonings of-the wise that they-are empty.”</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>So-that let┘nobody└boast in men. For all-things are of-you, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>whether Paul, whether Apollos, whether Cephas, whether (the) world, whether life, whether death, whether things-present, whether things-to-come. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>You (are) of-Christ, and Christ (is) of-God.</span>
