## 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now about the collection [the] for the saints. Even-as I-directed the churches of-[the] Galatia, so you-do also. 2Every first (day) of-(the)-week, let┘each of-you└lay by him storing-up whatever2 things-go-well, in-order-that when I-come, collections will┘not└take place. 3And when I-arrive, whomever2 you approve—I-will-sent these through letters to-carry the gift of-you to Jerusalem. 4And if it-is fitting for-[the] me-also to-go, they-will-go with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now I-will-come to you when I-pass-through Macedonia, for I-do-pass-through Macedonia. 6And perhaps I-will-stay with you or even winter (with you), in-order-that you-may-send┘me└forward whenever2 I-come. 7For I-do┘not└want to-see you now in passing, for I-hope to-remain with you for (a) certain time, if the Lord allows. 8But I-will-stay in Ephesus until [the] Pentecost. 9For (a) door opened to-me, wide and effective, and (there are) many opponents.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Now if Timothy comes, see-to-it in-order-that he-may-be with you without-fear, for he-is-working the work of-(the)-Lord, as I-am too. 11Let┘not anybody then└disregard him, but send┘him└forward in peace, in-order-that he-may-come to me; for I-expect him with the brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now about Apollos the brother. I-encouraged him many-things in-order-that he-might-come to you with the brothers, and not at-all was-it (his) will that he-might-come now. But he-will-come when he-has-opportunity.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Be-alert, stand-firm in the faith, be-courageous, be-strong. 14Let┘all-things of-you└be in love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Now I-encourage you, brothers (you-know the household of-Stephanas that it was (the) first fruits of-[the] Achaia, and they-set themselves for ministry to-the saints) in-order-that you also submit to-[the] such and to everybody [the] helping-with-the-work and laboring. 17Now I-rejoice over the coming of-Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these supplied [the] your lacking-thing. 18For they-refreshed [the] my spirit and [the] yours. So acknowledge [the] such.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The churches of-[the] Achaia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you in the Lord heartily with the church in their house. 20All the brothers greet you. Greet one-another with (a) holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The salutation by-[the] my-own hand—Paul's.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> If anybody does┘not└love the Lord, let-him-be accursed. Lord, come! 23The grace of-the Lord Jesus (be) with you. 24The love of-me with us all in Christ Jesus.</span>
