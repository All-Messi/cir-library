## 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, called (to be an) apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God, and Sosthenes our brother, 2to-the church of-[the] God [the] being in Corinth, to-the sanctified ones-ones in Christ Jesus, called (to be) saints with all the-ones calling-on the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours. 3Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I-thank the God of-me always about you for the grace of-[the] God [the] having-been-given to-you in Christ Jesus, 5because in everything you-were-made rich in him, in all word and all knowledge, 6even-as the testimony of-[the] Christ was-confirmed in you, 7so-that you tend┘not└to-be-lacking in any gracious-gift, expectantly-awaiting the revelation of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, 8who also will-continue-to-confirm you to (the) end blameless in the day of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ. 9[The] God (is) faithful through whom you-were-called into (the) fellowship of-the Son of-him Jesus Christ the Lord of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Now I-beseech you, brothers, through the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ in-order-that you-may-say the same-thing and no divisions my-be among you, but you-may-be united in the same mind and in the same purpose. 11For it-was-made-evident to-me about you, my brothers, by the-ones of-Chloe that quarrels are among you. 12Now I-say this, that. each of-you is saying, "I am of-Paul," and "I (am) of-Apollos," and "I (am) of-Cephas," and "I (am) of Christ." 13Has┘Christ└been-divided-up? Paul was┘not┘┘└crucified for you, └└was-he? Or you-were┘not┘┘└baptized in the name of-Paul, └└were-you? 14I-am-thankful [to-[the] God]ms that I-baptized nobody of-you except2 Crispus and Gaius, 15in-order-that somebody would┘not└say that you-were-baptized in [the] my name. 16And I┘also└did-baptize the household of-Stephanus. Besides I-do┘not└know whether I-baptized any other. 17For Christ did┘not└send me to-perform-baptisms, but to-preach-the-good-news, not in wisdom of-word[s] in-order-that the cross of-[the] Christ might┘not└be-reduced.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For the word [the] of-the cross is foolishness to-the-ones perishing on-the-one-hand, but it-is (the) power of-God to-the-ones being-saved. 19For it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Where (is the) wise(-one)? Where (is the) scribe? Where (is the) skillful-reasoner of-this [the] world? [The] God made-foolish the wisdom of-the world, has-he-not? 21For when in [the] wisdom of-[the] God the world did┘not└know [the] God by [the] wisdom, [the] God was-well-pleased by the 'foolishness' of-the thing-preached to-save the-ones believing. 22For also Jews ask-for signs and Greeks seek wisdom; 23but we preach Christ crucified, to-Jews, on-the-one-hand, (a) stumbling block, and-on-the-other-hand to-Gentiles foolishness, 24to them the-ones called both Jews and Greeks, Christ (the) power of-God and wisdom of-God, 25because the foolishness of-[the] God is wiser than-[the] men and the weakness of-[the] God (is) stronger than-[the] men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> For you-see the calling of-you, brothers, that not many wise, not many mighty, not many of-notable-birth. 27But the foolishness of-the world [the] God chose, in-order-that he-might-put┘the wise└to-shame; and the weaknesses of-the world [the] God chose, in-order-that he-might-put┘the wise└to-shame; 28and the insignificant-things of-the world and the despised-things [the] God chose, the-things not being, in-order-that the-things being he-might-nullify, 29in-order-that every flesh may┘not└boast before [the] God. 30But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became (the) wisdom of-us from God, both righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 31in-order-that even-as it-has-been-written, "Let┘the-one boasting└boast in the Lord."</span>
