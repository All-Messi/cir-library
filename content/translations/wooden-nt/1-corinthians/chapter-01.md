## 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul, called (to be an) apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God, and Sosthenes our brother, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to-the church of-[the] God [the] being in Corinth, to-the sanctified ones-ones in Christ Jesus, called (to be) saints with all the-ones calling-on the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I-thank the God of-me always about you for the grace of-[the] God [the] having-been-given to-you in Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>because in everything you-were-made rich in him, in all word and all knowledge, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>even-as the testimony of-[the] Christ was-confirmed in you, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>so-that you tend┘not└to-be-lacking in any gracious-gift, expectantly-awaiting the revelation of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>who also will-continue-to-confirm you to (the) end blameless in the day of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>[The] God (is) faithful through whom you-were-called into (the) fellowship of-the Son of-him Jesus Christ the Lord of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now I-beseech you, brothers, through the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ in-order-that you-may-say the same-thing and no divisions my-be among you, but you-may-be united in the same mind and in the same purpose. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For it-was-made-evident to-me about you, my brothers, by the-ones of-Chloe that quarrels are among you. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Now I-say this, that. each of-you is saying, “<u>I</u> am of-Paul,” and “<u>I</u> (am) of-Apollos,” and “<u>I </u>(am) of-Cephas,” and “<u>I</u> (am) of Christ.” <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Has┘Christ└been-divided-up? Paul was┘not<sup>┘┘</sup>└crucified for you, <sup>└└</sup>was-he? Or you-were┘not<sup>┘┘</sup>└baptized in the name of-Paul, <sup>└└</sup>were-you? <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I-am-thankful [to-[the] God]<sup>ms</sup> that I-baptized nobody of-you except<sup>2</sup> Crispus and Gaius, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>in-order-that somebody would┘not└say that you-were-baptized in [the] my name. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And I┘also└did-baptize the household of-Stephanus. Besides I-do┘not└know whether I-baptized any other. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For Christ did┘not└send me to-perform-baptisms, but to-preach-the-good-news, not in wisdom of-word[s] in-order-that the cross of-[the] Christ might┘not└be-reduced.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For the word [the] of-the cross is foolishness to-the-ones perishing on-the-one-hand, but it-is (the) power of-God to-the-ones being-saved. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For it-has-been-written, <strong>“I-will-destroy the wisdom of-the wise,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd the understanding of-the understanding-ones I-will-nullify/set-aside.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Where (is the) wise(-one)? Where (is the) scribe? Where (is the) skillful-reasoner of-this [the] world? [The] God made-foolish the wisdom of-the world, has-he-not? <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For when in [the] wisdom of-[the] God the world did┘not└know [the] God by [the] wisdom, [the] God was-well-pleased by the ‘foolishness’ of-the thing-preached to-save the-ones believing. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For also Jews ask-for signs and Greeks seek wisdom; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>but we preach Christ crucified, to-Jews, on-the-one-hand, (a) stumbling block, and-on-the-other-hand to-Gentiles foolishness, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>to them the-ones called both Jews and Greeks, Christ (the) power of-God and wisdom of-God, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>because the foolishness of-[the] God is wiser than-[the] men and the weakness of-[the] God (is) stronger than-[the] men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For you-see the calling of-you, brothers, that not many wise, not many mighty, not many of-notable-birth. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But the foolishness of-the world [the] God chose, in-order-that he-might-put┘the wise└to-shame; and the weaknesses of-the world [the] God chose, in-order-that he-might-put┘the wise└to-shame; <sup>28</sup>and the insignificant-things of-the world and the despised-things [the] God chose, the-things not being, in-order-that the-things being he-might-nullify, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>in-order-that every flesh may┘not└boast before [the] God. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became (the) wisdom of-us from God, both righteousness and sanctification and redemption, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>in-order-that even-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“</strong><strong>Let┘the-one</strong><strong> </strong><strong>boasting└boast</strong><strong> in the Lord.”</strong></span>
