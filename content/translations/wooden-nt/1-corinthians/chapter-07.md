## 1 Corinthians Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now about what-things you-wrote. (It is) good for (a) man not to-touch (a) woman. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But on-account-of [the] sexual-immorality, each man should-have [the] his-own wife, and each woman should-have [the] her-own husband. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The husband needs-to-give to-the wife the/her due; and likewise also the wife (needs-to-give) to-the husband the/his due. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The wife does┘not└have-authority-over [the] her body, but the husband (does). And likewise the husband also does┘not└have-authority-over [the] his body, but the wife (does). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Do┘not└deprive one-another, except<sup>2</sup> for (a) time by agreement in-order-that you<sup>pl</sup>-may-devote-yourselves to-[the] prayer and be together<sup>3</sup> again, in-order-that [the] Satan may┘not└tempt you<sup>pl</sup> on-account-of the self-control of-you. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But I-say this according-to concession, not according-to commandment. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But I-want all men to-be also as myself, but each has his-own gracious-gift from God, the–one thus, on-the-one-hand, and the-other thus, on-the-other-hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But I-say to-the unmarried and [the] widows, (it is) good if they-remain as I-am. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But if they-do┘not└have-self-control, they-should-marry, for it-is better to-marry than to-burn-(with-desire). <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But to-the-ones married I-instruct—not I, but the Lord—that (a) wife not divorce [from] (her) husband (, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>but if she-does-leave, she-needs-to-stay single or be-reconciled to-the/her husband), and that husband not leave (his) wife. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But to-the rest I say, not the Lord, if any brother has (an) unbelieving wife and the-one is-willing to-live with him, let-him┘not└leave her. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And if any-wife has (an) unbelieving husband and this-one is-willing to-live with her, let-her┘not└leave the/her husband. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For the unbelieving [the] husband stands-sanctified by the wife. Otherwise<sup>2</sup> the children of-you would-be illegitimate, but now they-are legitimate. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And if the unbelieving (spouse) leaves, let-(him)-leave. The brother or the sister does┘not└stand-bound in [the] such case. But [the] God has-called us in peace. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For why do-you-know, wife, whether you-will-save the husband, or why do-you-know, husband, you-will-save the wife?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Only<sup>2</sup> as the Lord assigned to-each, as [the] God has-called each, so let-him-walk. And so I-direct in all the churches. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Was┘anybody└called circumcised? Let-him┘not└become-uncircumcised. Has┘anybody└been-called in uncircumcision? Let-him┘not└be-circumcised. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>[The] circumcision is nothing, and [the] uncircumcision is nothing, but (a) keeping of-(the)-commandments of-God. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In the calling which each was-called, let-him-remain in this. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Were-you-called as-(a)-slave? Let-it┘not└matter to-you. But even if you-are-able to-become free, make-use-of (it) instead. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For the/a slave having-been-called in (the) Lord is (a) freeman of-(the)-Lord. Likewise the-one having-been-called as-free is (a) slave of-(the)-Lord. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>You-were-bought for-(a)-price. Do┘not└become slaves of-men. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>In what each was-called, brothers, let-him-remain in this with God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Now about virgins. I-do┘not└have (a) commandment of-(the)-Lord, but I-give (my/an) opinion as one-mercied by (the) Lord to-be faithful. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>So I-think (it is) good for-(a)-man thus [the] be-be. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Are-you-bound to-(a)-wife? Do┘not└seek (a) divorce. Are-you-separate from-(a)-wife? Do┘not└seek (a) wife. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>But if you do marry, you-did┘not└sin, and if the/a virgin marries, she-did┘not└sin, but [the] such-people will-have trouble in-the flesh, but I-am-trying-to-spare you. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And I-say this, brothers, the time has-been shortened from-now-on<sup>2</sup> I-order-that both the-ones having wives may be as-though not having (them), <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><u>and</u> the-ones crying as not crying, and the-ones rejoicing as not rejoicing, and the-ones buying as not possessing, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>and the-ones using the world as not using-(it)-fully. For the form of-this [the] world is-passing-away. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And I-want you to-be without worry. (The/An) unmarried-person is-concerned-about [the]-things of-the Lord—how he-may-be-pleasing to-the Lord. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>But the-one having-married is-concerned-about [the]-things of-the world—how he-may-be pleasing to-the/his wife, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and has-been-divided. And the/a woman [the]-one unmarried and the/a virgin is-concerned-about [the]-things of-the Lord, in-order-that she-may-be holy both in-[the] body and [the] spirit. But the-one having-married is-concerned-about [the]-things of-the world—how she-may-please the/her husband. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Now I-am-saying this for [the] benefit of-you yourselves, not in-order-that I-may-put-on you (a) restriction, but for the orderly-thing and devotion to-the Lord undistracted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> If any man thinks (himself) to-be behaving-insensitively toward the/his virgin (daughter), if she-is full-grown, and it-ought to-be thus, let-him-do what he-wants; he-is┘not└sinning; let-them marry. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>But who has-established firm in the heart of-him, not having necessity, and has control about [the] his will and has-decided this in his heart to-keep the virgin of-him, he-will-do well. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>So both the-one giving-in-marriage the virgin of-him does well and the-one not giving-in-marriage will-do better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> (A) wife stands-bound for as-much┘time└as the husband of-her is-living. But if the/her husband dies, she-is free to-be-married to-whomever she-wants—only in (the) Lord. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>But she-is happier if she-remains as-she-is, in [the] my opinion. And I-think I-also have (the) Spirit of-God</span>
