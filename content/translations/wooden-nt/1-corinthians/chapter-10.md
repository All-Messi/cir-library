## 1 Corinthians Chapter **10**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware, brothers, that the fathers of-us were all under the cloud and passed–through the sea, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and all were-baptized to [the] Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and all ate the same spiritual food, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from (a) spiritual rock following (them), and the rock was [the] Messiah. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But not with [the] most of-them was┘[the] God└pleased, for they-were-struck-down in the wilderness. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But these-things became examples for-us unto our [the] not being coveters of-evil-things even-as they-also coved (them). <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Nor be idolaters even-as some of-them, as it-has-been-written, <strong>“The people sat-down to-eat and to-drink</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>a</strong><strong>nd got-up to-play/carouse.”</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Now I-praise you, because you-have-remembered all-things of-me, and hold-firmly-to the traditions, even-as I-delivered (them) to-you. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Now I-want you to-know that [the] Christ is the head of-every husband, and the/a husband (is the head) of-(a)-wife, and [the] God is (the) head of-[the] Christ. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Every man praying or prophesying having (something) on (his) head disgraces the head of-him. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And every woman praying or prophesying uncovered with-respect-to-the head disgraces the head of-her. For it-is one and the same-thing (for it to be) [the] shaved. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For if (a) woman is-uncovered, let-her-cut-her-hair-off; and if (it is) shameful for-(a)-woman to-cut-her-hair-off or shave-(it)-off, let-her-be-covered. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For (a) man ought not cover the/his head, being (the) image and glory of-God. And the woman is (the) glory of-(the)-man. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For (a) man is not of-(the)-woman, but (the) woman on-account-of the man. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>On-account-of this, the woman ought to-have authority on the/her head on-account-of the angels. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>However, in (the) Lord the woman (is) neither without (the) man nor (the) man without (the) woman. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For as the woman (is) out-of the man, so also the man (is) through the woman, and [the] all-things (are) out-of [the] God. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Judge in you yourselves: is-it proper for-(a)-woman to-pray to-[the] God uncovered? <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Does┘not [the] nature itself└teach you that if (a) man lets-his-hair-grow-long it-is (a) dishonor to-him, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but if (a) woman lets-her-hair-grow-long, it-is (an) honor to-her? <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Now if anybody wants to-be contentious, we do┘not└have such (a) custom nor the churches of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Nor commit-sexual-immorality, and in one day fell twenty-three-thousand. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Neither let-us-put┘[the] Christ└to-trial even-as some of-them tried (him), and were-destroyed by [the] snakes. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Neither complain as some of-them complained, and were-destroyed by the destroyer. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>These-things happened to-them as-examples, and they-were-written for (a) warning to-us, to whom the ends of-the ages have-come. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So-that let┘the-one supposing to-stand└beware lest he-fall. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>(A) trial has┘not└overtaken you except<sup>2</sup> human. But [the] God (is) faithful, who will┘not└allow you to-be tried above what you-are-able, but will-provide with the trial also the way-out unto [the] being-able to-endure (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So, my beloved, flee from [the] idolatry. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I-am-talking as to-wise-men; regard what I-am-saying. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The cup of-[the] blessing that we-bless, is-it not (a) sharing of-the blood of-[the] Christ? The loaf that we-break, is-it not (a) sharing-with the body of-[the] Christ? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Because (there is) one loaf, we the many are one body, for we┘the all└share [of] the one loaf. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Look-at [the] Israel according-to the flesh. Are the–ones eating the sacrifices not sharers of-the altar? <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So what am-I-saying? That (a) sacrificed-to-idols-thing is anything or that (an) idol is anything? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>(No), but that what-things they-sacrifice, [they sacrifice]<sup>ms</sup> to demons and not to-God. And I-do┘not└want you to be sharers of-[the] demons. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>You-are┘not└able to-drink (the) cup of-(the)-Lord and (the) cup of-demons; you-are┘not└able to-share (the) table of (the) Lord and (the) table of-demons. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Or do-we-provoke┘the Lord└to jealousy? We-are not stronger than-he (is), are we?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But instructing (you) with-respect-to-this, I-am┘not└praising (you), because you-come-together, not for the better, but for the worse. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For first-of-all you coming-together in church, I hear divisions to-be among you, and partly I-believe it. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For it-is-necessary even for-divisions to-be among you, in-order-that the approved-ones may-become apparent among you. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>So you assembling together<sup>3</sup>, it-is┘not└possible to-eat the Lord’s Supper. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For each brings [the] his-own meal at the eating, and one is-hungry and another is-sated. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Do-you┘not└have houses for [the] eating and drinking? Or do-you-treat┘the church of-[the] God└with-contempt, and embarrass the-ones not having? What am-I-to-say to-you? Will-I-praise you? In this I-will┘not└praise (you).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For I-received from the Lord what also I-delivered to-you, that the Lord on the night in-which he-was-betrayed took (a) loaf; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and, having-given-thanks, broke (it), and said, “This is the body of-me [the] for you. Do this in [the] my remembrance.” <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Likewise also the cup after [the] dining, saying, “This [the] cup is the new covenant in [the] my blood; do this as-often-as<sup>2</sup> you drink (it) in [the] my remembrance.” <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>For as-often-as<sup>2</sup> you-eat [the] this bread and drink the cup, you-proclaim the death of-the Lord until<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> he-comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So whoever<sup>2</sup> eats the loaf or drinks the cup of-the Lord in-an-unworthy-manner will-be guilty of-the body and the blood of-the Lord. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And let┘(a) man└examine himself and in-this-way let-him-eat [of] the bread and let-him-drink [of] the cup. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>For the-one eating and drinking eats and drinks condemnation to-himself, not discerning the body and blood [of-the Lord]<sup>ms</sup>. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>On-account-of this, many among you (are) weak and sick, and (a) considerable (number) are-asleep. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>But if we-were-examining ourselves, we-would┘not└be-condemned. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>But being judged, we-are-disciplined by the Lord in-order-that we-might┘not└be-condemned with the world. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>So, my brothers, assembling unto [the] eating, wait-for one-another. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>If anybody is-hungry, let-him-eat at home in-order-that you-might┘not└assemble to condemnation. But the remaining-things, I-will-give-instruction-about when<sup>2</sup> I-come.</span>
