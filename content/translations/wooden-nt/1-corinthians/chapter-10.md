## 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware, brothers, that the fathers of-us were all under the cloud and passed–through the sea, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and all were-baptized to [the] Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and all ate the same spiritual food, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from (a) spiritual rock following (them), and the rock was [the] Messiah. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But not with [the] most of-them was┘[the] God└pleased, for they-were-struck-down in the wilderness. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But these-things became examples for-us unto our [the] not being coveters of-evil-things even-as they-also coved (them). <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Nor be idolaters even-as some of-them, as it-has-been-written, <strong>“The people sat-down to-eat and to-drink</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>a</strong><strong>nd got-up to-play/carouse.”</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nor commit-sexual-immorality, and in one day fell twenty-three-thousand. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Neither let-us-put┘[the] Christ└to-trial even-as some of-them tried (him), and were-destroyed by [the] snakes. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Neither complain as some of-them complained, and were-destroyed by the destroyer. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>These-things happened to-them as-examples, and they-were-written for (a) warning to-us, to whom the ends of-the ages have-come. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So-that let┘the-one supposing to-stand└beware lest he-fall. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>(A) trial has┘not└overtaken you except<sup>2</sup> human. But [the] God (is) faithful, who will┘not└allow you to-be tried above what you-are-able, but will-provide with the trial also the way-out unto [the] being-able to-endure (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So, my beloved, flee from [the] idolatry. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>I-am-talking as to-wise-men; regard what I-am-saying. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The cup of-[the] blessing that we-bless, is-it not (a) sharing of-the blood of-[the] Christ? The loaf that we-break, is-it not (a) sharing-with the body of-[the] Christ? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Because (there is) one loaf, we the many are one body, for we┘the all└share [of] the one loaf. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Look-at [the] Israel according-to the flesh. Are the–ones eating the sacrifices not sharers of-the altar? <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So what am-I-saying? That (a) sacrificed-to-idols-thing is anything or that (an) idol is anything? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>(No), but that what-things they-sacrifice, [they sacrifice]<sup>ms</sup> to demons and not to-God. And I-do┘not└want you to be sharers of-[the] demons. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>You-are┘not└able to-drink (the) cup of-(the)-Lord and (the) cup of-demons; you-are┘not└able to-share (the) table of (the) Lord and (the) table of-demons. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Or do-we-provoke┘the Lord└to jealousy? We-are not stronger than-he (is), are we?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For I-received from the Lord what also I-delivered to-you, that the Lord on the night in-which he-was-betrayed took (a) loaf; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and, having-given-thanks, broke (it), and said, “This is the body of-me [the] for you. Do this in [the] my remembrance.” <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Likewise also the cup after [the] dining, saying, “This [the] cup is the new covenant in [the] my blood; do this as-often-as<sup>2</sup> you drink (it) in [the] my remembrance.” <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>For as-often-as<sup>2</sup> you-eat [the] this bread and drink the cup, you-proclaim the death of-the Lord until<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> he-comes.</span>
