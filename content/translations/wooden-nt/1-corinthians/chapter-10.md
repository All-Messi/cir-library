## 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware, brothers, that the fathers of-us were all under the cloud and passed–through the sea, 2and all were-baptized to [the] Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 3and all ate the same spiritual food, 4and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from (a) spiritual rock following (them), and the rock was [the] Messiah. 5But not with [the] most of-them was┘[the] God└pleased, for they-were-struck-down in the wilderness. 6But these-things became examples for-us unto our [the] not being coveters of-evil-things even-as they-also coved (them). 7Nor be idolaters even-as some of-them, as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nor commit-sexual-immorality, and in one day fell twenty-three-thousand. 9Neither let-us-put┘[the] Christ└to-trial even-as some of-them tried (him), and were-destroyed by [the] snakes. 10Neither complain as some of-them complained, and were-destroyed by the destroyer. 11These-things happened to-them as-examples, and they-were-written for (a) warning to-us, to whom the ends of-the ages have-come. 12So-that let┘the-one supposing to-stand└beware lest he-fall. 13(A) trial has┘not└overtaken you except2 human. But [the] God (is) faithful, who will┘not└allow you to-be tried above what you-are-able, but will-provide with the trial also the way-out unto [the] being-able to-endure (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> So, my beloved, flee from [the] idolatry. 15I-am-talking as to-wise-men; regard what I-am-saying. 16The cup of-[the] blessing that we-bless, is-it not (a) sharing of-the blood of-[the] Christ? The loaf that we-break, is-it not (a) sharing-with the body of-[the] Christ? 17Because (there is) one loaf, we the many are one body, for we┘the all└share [of] the one loaf. 18Look-at [the] Israel according-to the flesh. Are the–ones eating the sacrifices not sharers of-the altar? 19So what am-I-saying? That (a) sacrificed-to-idols-thing is anything or that (an) idol is anything? 20(No), but that what-things they-sacrifice, [they sacrifice]ms to demons and not to-God. And I-do┘not└want you to be sharers of-[the] demons. 21You-are┘not└able to-drink (the) cup of-(the)-Lord and (the) cup of-demons; you-are┘not└able to-share (the) table of (the) Lord and (the) table of-demons. 22Or do-we-provoke┘the Lord└to jealousy? We-are not stronger than-he (is), are we?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> All-things are-possible, but not all-things are-profitable; all-things are possible, but not all-things build-up. 24Let┘nobody└seek [the] his-own, but the-thing of-the other. 25Eat everything [the] sold in (the) food-market, judging nothing on-account-of [the] conscience. 26For "the earth (is) the Lord's and the fullness of-it." 27If anybody of-the unbelievers calls you and you-want to-go, eat everything [the] set-before you, judging nothing on-account-of [the] conscience. 28But if anybody says to-you, "This is (an) offered-to-idol-thing, do┘not└eat on-account-of that-one [the] having-called-(it)-to-(your)-attention and [the] conscience—29but conscience, I-say, not his-own [the] (conscience), but the (conscience) of-the other. For why is┘the freedom of-me└judged by (the) conscience of-another? 30If I participate with-thanksgiving, why am-I-blasphemed for what I am-grateful? 31So whether you-eat, whether you drink, whether you-do anything, do all-things to (the) glory of-God. 32Be inoffensive both to-Jews and Greeks and to-the church of-[the] God, 33just-as I-also please all-men in-all-things and, not seeking the profit of-myself, but the (profit) of-the many, in-order-that they-may-be-saved.</span>
