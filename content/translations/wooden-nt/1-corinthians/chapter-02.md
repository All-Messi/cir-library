## 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And-I, having-come to you, brothers, I-did┘not└come according-to superiority of-word or wisdom, proclaiming to-you the mystery of-[the] God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For I-did┘not└determine to-know anything among you except<sup>2</sup> Jesus Christ and this-one crucified. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And-I in weakness and in fear and in much trembling was with you, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and the word of-me and the proclamation of-me (were) not in persuasive words, but in demonstration of-spirit and power, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>in-order-that the faith of-you might┘not└be in (the) wisdom of-men, but in (the) power of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But we-speak wisdom among the mature, (a) wisdom not of-this [the] world nor of-the rulers of-this [the] world, the-ones passing-away. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But we-speak (the) wisdom of-God predestined before the ages to (the) glory of-us, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>which nobody of-the rulers of-this [the] world/age knew. For if they-had-known, they-would┘not└have-crucified the Lord of-[the] glory. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But even-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“What-things eye </strong><strong>did┘not└see</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and ear </strong><strong>did┘not└hear</strong><strong>,</strong> and it-did┘not└occur to (the) heart of-man what-things [the] God prepared for-the-ones loving him.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But [the] God revealed (them) to-us by the Spirit, for the Spirit examines all-things, even the deep-things of-[the] God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For who of-men knows the-things of-[the] man except<sup>2</sup> the spirit of-[the] man the-one in him? So also the-things of-[the] God nobody knows/knew except<sup>2</sup> the Spirit of-[the] God. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But we did┘not└receive the spirit of-the world, but the Spirit [the] from [the] God, in-order-that we-might-come-to-know the-things graciously-given to-us by [the] God; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>which-things we┘also└speak, not in taught words of-human wisdom, but in (words) taught by-(the)-Spirit, explaining spiritual-things with-spiritual-(words). <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But (a) natural man does┘not└accept the-things of-the Spirit of-[the] God, for they-are foolishness to-him, and they-are┘not└able to-come-to-know (them) because they-are┘spiritually└examined. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But the spiritual (man) examines all [the]<sup>ms</sup> things, but he himself is┘not└examined by anybody. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For <strong>“who knows (the) mind of-(the)-Lord that will-instruct him?”</strong> But we have (the) mind of-Christ.</span>
