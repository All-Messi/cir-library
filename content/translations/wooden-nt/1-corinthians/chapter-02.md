## 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And-I, having-come to you, brothers, I-did┘not└come according-to superiority of-word or wisdom, proclaiming to-you the mystery of-[the] God. 2For I-did┘not└determine to-know anything among you except2 Jesus Christ and this-one crucified. 3And-I in weakness and in fear and in much trembling was with you, 4and the word of-me and the proclamation of-me (were) not in persuasive words, but in demonstration of-spirit and power, 5in-order-that the faith of-you might┘not└be in (the) wisdom of-men, but in (the) power of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But we-speak wisdom among the mature, (a) wisdom not of-this [the] world nor of-the rulers of-this [the] world, the-ones passing-away. 7But we-speak (the) wisdom of-God predestined before the ages to (the) glory of-us, 8which nobody of-the rulers of-this [the] world/age knew. For if they-had-known, they-would┘not└have-crucified the Lord of-[the] glory. 9But even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But [the] God revealed (them) to-us by the Spirit, for the Spirit examines all-things, even the deep-things of-[the] God. 11For who of-men knows the-things of-[the] man except2 the spirit of-[the] man the-one in him? So also the-things of-[the] God nobody knows/knew except2 the Spirit of-[the] God. 12But we did┘not└receive the spirit of-the world, but the Spirit [the] from [the] God, in-order-that we-might-come-to-know the-things graciously-given to-us by [the] God; 13which-things we┘also└speak, not in taught words of-human wisdom, but in (words) taught by-(the)-Spirit, explaining spiritual-things with-spiritual-(words). 14But (a) natural man does┘not└accept the-things of-the Spirit of-[the] God, for they-are foolishness to-him, and they-are┘not└able to-come-to-know (them) because they-are┘spiritually└examined. 15But the spiritual (man) examines all [the]ms things, but he himself is┘not└examined by anybody. 16For "who knows (the) mind of-(the)-Lord that will-instruct him?" But we have (the) mind of-Christ.</span>
