## 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now I-make-known to-you, brothers, the gospel that I-preached to-you, that you also received, and in which you┘also└stand, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and by which you-are-being-saved if you-hold-on-firmly to which word I-preached to-you—unless<sup>2</sup> you-believed in vain. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For I-delivered to-you among first-things, what also I-received, that Christ died for the sins of-us according-to the scriptures, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and that he-was-buried and that he-has-been-raised on-the third [the] day according-to the scriptures, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and that he-appeared to-Cephas, then to-the twelve, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and that he-appeared to-over five-hundred brothers at-the-same-time, of whom the more remain till now, but some fell-asleep. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then he-appeared to-James, then to-all the apostles. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And last of-all he-appeared also-to-me, as-it-were, to-one born-at-and-unusual-time-of-year. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For I am the least of-the apostles, who am not worthy to-be-called (an) apostle, because I-persecuted the church of-[the] God. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But by-(the)-grace of-God I-am what I-am, and the grace of-him [the] to me was not in vain, but I-labored more than they all, but not I, but the grace of-[the] God [the] with me. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So whether I or those, thus we-preach and thus you-believed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Now if Christ is-preached that he-has-been-raised from (the) dead, how do┘some among you└say that (there) is no resurrection of-(the)-dead? <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And if (there) is no resurrection of-(the)-dead, neither has┘Christ└been-raised. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And if Christ has┘not└been-raised, then [also]<sup>ms</sup> the preaching of-us (is) vain, and the faith of-you (is) vain. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And we-are┘also└found (to be) false-witnesses of-[the] God, because we-testified according-to [the] God that he-raised [the] Christ, whom he-did┘not└raise if then (the) dead are┘not└raised. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For if (the) dead are┘not└raised, neither has┘Christ└been raised. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And if Christ has┘not└been-raised, the faith of-you (is) usless; you-are still in the sins of-you, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and then the-ones having-fallen-asleep in Christ perished. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>If only in this [the] life we have-been-hoping in Christ, we-are of-all men most-to-be-pitied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>But now Christ has-been-raised from (the) dead, (the) first fruit of-the-ones having-fallen-asleep. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For since by man death (was), also through man (was the) resurrection of-(the)-dead. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For as in [the] Adam all die, so also in [the] Christ all will-be-made-alive. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And each in [the] his proper-order: Christ (the) first fruit, then the-ones of-[the] Christ at the coming of-him, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>then the end when he-delivers the kingdom to-the God and Father when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>For it-is-necessary for-him to-reign until<sup>2</sup> he-puts all the/his enemies under the feet of-him. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>The last enemy (that) will-be-abolished (is) [the] death. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>For <strong>“</strong><strong>he-will-put┘all-things└</strong><strong>in-</strong><strong>subjection</strong><strong> under the feet of-him</strong><strong>”</strong>; and when he-says that ‘all-things have-been-put-in-subjection,’ (it is) evident that the-One having-subjected the ‘all-things’ to-him (is) excepted. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And when he-subjects the ‘all-things’ to-him, then [also]<sup>ms</sup> the Son himself will-be-subjected to-the-One having-subjected the ‘all-things’ to-him, in-order-that [the] God (may be) [the]<sup>ms</sup> all-things in all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Otherwise what will┘the-ones baptized for the dead└do? If not-at-all are┘the dead└raised, why then are-they baptized for them? <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Why also are┘we└in-danger every hour? <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Daily<sup>2</sup> I-die, by [the] your boasting [, brothers,]<sup>ms</sup> that I-have in Christ Jesus the Lord of-us. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>If, figuratively speaking, I-fought-with-wild-beasts in Ephesus, what to-me (is) the profit? If (the) dead are┘not└raised, <strong>“Let-us-eat and drink,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or tomorrow we-die.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Do┘not└be-decieved, “Bad company ruins good morals.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Come-to-you-senses as-regards-righteousness, and do┘not└keep-sinning; for some have (an) ignorance of-God. I-speak to-you to-shame.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But somebody will-say, “How are┘the dead└raised, and with-what-kind-of body do-they-come?” <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Foolish-one! What you sow does┘not└come-to-life if it-does┘not└die. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And what you-sow—you-do┘not└sow the body [the] going-to-become, but (a) bare seed perhaps<sup>2</sup> of-wheat or of-something of-the rest. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>Now [the] God gives it (a) body even-as he-desired, and each of-the seeds its-own body. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Not every flesh (is) the same flesh, but one of-men, and another (the) flesh of-cattle, and another (the) flesh of-birds, and another of-fish. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And (there are) heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But (the) glory of-the heavenly-ones is one-kind, and the (glory) of-the earthly-ones (is) another. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>(There is) one glory of-(the)-sun, and another glory of-(the)-moon, and another glory of-(the)-stars, for (a) star differs-from (a) star in glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So also (is) the resurrection of-the dead. It-is-sown in corruption; it-is-raised in incorruption. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>It-is-sown in dishonor; it-is-raised in glory. It-is sown in weakness; it-is-raised in power. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>It-is-sown (a) physical body; it-is-raised (a) spiritual body. If there-is (a) physical body, there-is also (a) spiritual-one. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>So also it-has-been-written, <strong>“The</strong> ‘first’ <strong>man </strong>‘Adam’ <strong>became [for] a living soul.”</strong> The last Adam (became) [for] (a) life-giving spirit. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>But the spiritual-thing (is) not first, but the physical-one, then the spiritual. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>The first man (was) out-of (the) earth—made-of-dust; the second man (is) out-of heaven. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>As the earthly (is), so also (are) the earthy-ones; and as the heavenly (is), so also (are) the heavenly-ones. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>And even-as we-bore the image of-the earthly, we-will┘also└bear the image of-the heavenly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now I-say this, brothers, because flesh and blood is┘not└able to-inherit (the) kingdom of-God, nor does┘the perishable└inherit the imperishable. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>Behond, I-tell you (a) mystery. All will┘not└sleep, but all will-be-changed, <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>in (an) instant, in (the) blink of-(an)-eye, at the last trumpet-blast. For the-trumpet-will-blow and the dead will-be-raised imperishable, and we-will-be-changed. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>For it-is-necessary for-this [the] perishable to-put-on imperishableness and this [the] mortal to-put-on immortality. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>And when this [the] perishable puts-on imperishableness and this [the] mortal puts-on immortality, then the written [the] word will-come-about, <strong>“[The] death was-swallowed-up in victory.</strong></span>
