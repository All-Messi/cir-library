## 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Does┘anybody of-you having (a) matter against the other└dare to-go-to-law before the unrighteous and not before the saints? 2Or do-you┘not└know that the saints will-judge the world? And if the world is-judged by you, are-you unable (to be judges) of-(the)-least (matters)? 3Do-you┘not└know that we-will-judge angels, much-less matters-of-everyday-life? 4So if you-have matters-of-this life, do-you-appoint these (as judges) the-ones to (your shame: 5I-speak to-you to (your) humiliation: (is it) so (that) there-is nobody among you wise, who will be-able to-decide in-the-midst2 of the brother of-him? 6But brother goes-to court with brother and this before unbelievers? 7Already [then]ms it-is (a) defect to-you actually that you-have lawsuits with each-other. On-account-of what rather not be wronged? 8But you wrong and defraud, and this brothers. 9Or do-you┘not└know that unjust-ones will┘not└inherit (the) kingdom of-God? do┘not└deceive-yourselves. Neither immoral-people nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals 10not thieves nor covetous-people, not drunkards, not revilers, not swindlers will-inherit (the) kingdom of-God. 11And some-of you-were these, but you-were-made-righteous in the name of-the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of-the God of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> All-things are-possible for-me, but not all-things are-to-(my)-advantage. All-things are-possible for-me, but I will┘not└be-brought-under-authority by any (of them). 13(The) solid-foods (are) for-the stomach and the stomach (is) for-(the) solid-foods. But [the] God will-destroy both this and these. But the body (is) not for-[the] sexual-immorality, but for-the Lord, and the Lord (is) for-the body. 14But [the] God both raised the Lord and he-will-raise┘us└up by the power of-him. 15Do-you┘not└know that the bodies of-you are members of-Christ? So having-taken the members of-[the] Christ, will-I-make (them) members of-(a)-prostitute? Goodness, no! 16[Or]ms do-you┘not└know that the-one uniting-himself to-the/a prostitute is one body (with her)? For he-says, "The two will-be [for] one flesh." 17The-one joining-himself to-the Lord is one spirit. 18Flee [the] sexual-immorality. Every sin that (a) man [if] does is outside the body. But the-one committing sexual-immorality sins against [the] his-own body. 19Or do-youpl┘not└know that the body of-youpl is (a) temple of-the in youpl Holy Spirit that you-have from God, and you-are not your own? 20For you-were-bought with-(a)-price? Indeed glorify [the] God in the body of-youpl.</span>
