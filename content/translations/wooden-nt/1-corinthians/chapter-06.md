## 1 Corinthians Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Does┘anybody of-you having (a) matter against the other└dare to-go-to-law before the unrighteous and not before the saints? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Or do-you┘not└know that the saints will-judge the world? And if the world is-judged by you, are-you unable (to be judges) of-(the)-least (matters)? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Do-you┘not└know that we-will-judge angels, much-less matters-of-everyday-life? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So if you-have matters-of-this life, do-you-appoint these (as judges) the-ones to (your shame: <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I-speak to-you to (your) humiliation: (is it) so (that) there-is nobody among you wise, who will be-able to-decide in-the-midst<sup>2</sup> of the brother of-him? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But brother goes-to court with brother and this before unbelievers? <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Already [then]<sup>ms</sup> it-is (a) defect to-you actually that you-have lawsuits with each-other. On-account-of what rather not be wronged? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But you wrong and defraud, and this brothers. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Or do-you┘not└know that unjust-ones will┘not└inherit (the) kingdom of-God? do┘not└deceive-yourselves. Neither immoral-people nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>not thieves nor covetous-people, not drunkards, not revilers, not swindlers will-inherit (the) kingdom of-God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And some-of you-were these, but you-were-made-righteous in the name of-the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of-the God of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>All-things are-possible for-me, but not all-things are-to-(my)-advantage. All-things are-possible for-me, but I will┘not└be-brought-under-authority by any (of them). <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>(The) solid-foods (are) for-the stomach and the stomach (is) for-(the) solid-foods. But [the] God will-destroy both this and these. But the body (is) not for-[the] sexual-immorality, but for-the Lord, and the Lord (is) for-the body. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But [the] God both raised the Lord and he-will-raise┘us└up by the power of-him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Do-you┘not└know that the bodies of-you are members of-Christ? So having-taken the members of-[the] Christ, will-I-make (them) members of-(a)-prostitute? Goodness, no! <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>[Or]<sup>ms</sup> do-you┘not└know that the-one uniting-himself to-the/a prostitute is one body (with her)? For he-says, <strong>“The two will-be [for] one flesh.”</strong> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The-one joining-himself to-the Lord is one spirit. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Flee [the] sexual-immorality. Every sin that (a) man [if] does is outside the body. But the-one committing sexual-immorality sins against [the] his-own body. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Or do-you<sup>pl</sup>┘not└know that the body of-you<sup>pl</sup> is (a) temple of-the in you<sup>pl</sup> Holy Spirit that you-have from God, and you-are not your own? <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For you-were-bought with-(a)-price? Indeed glorify [the] God in the body of-you<sup>pl</sup>.</span>
