## Acts Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But [also]<sup>ms</sup> he-arrived in Derbe and in Lystra. And, behold, a-certain disciple was there, Timothy by-name, (the) son of-(a)-Jewish woman of-faith and of-(a)-Greek father, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>who was testified-to by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>This-one [the] Paul wanted to-go-out with him; and having-taken (him), he-circumcised him on-account-of the Jews [the] being in [the] those places, for all knew that the father of-him was (a) Greek. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And as they-were-traveling-through the cities, they-were-delivering to-them to-keep the decrees [the] judged by the apostles and elders [the] in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So the churches were-being-strengthened in-the/[the] faith, and they-were-increasing in–[the] number according-to (the) day/daily<sup>2</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And they-went/passed-through [the] Phrygia and Galatia country, having-been-prevented by the Holy Spirit to-speak the word in the Asia. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And having-gone down-to [the] Mysia, they-tried to-travel into [the] Bithynia, and the Spirit of-Jesus did┘not└let them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But having-gone-past [the] Mysia, they-went-down to Troas. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And (a) vision through/during [the]<sup>ms</sup> night appeared to-[the] Paul, a-certain man, (a) Macedonian, was standing and urging him and saying, <em>“Having-traveled-through into Macedonia, help us.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And when he-saw the vision, immediately we-sought to-go-out into Macedonia, concluding that [the] God had-called us to-evangelize them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-set-sail from Troas, we-ran-a-straight-course to Samothrace, and on-the next-day to Neapolis, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and-from-there to Philippi, which is (a) city of-(the)-first part of-[the] Macedonia, (a) colony. And we-were staying in this [the] city certain days. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And on-the day of-the Sabbath, we-went-out outside the city beside (a) river where we-were-supposing prayer to-be; and having-sat-down, we-began-talking with the women having-gathered-together. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And a-certain woman, Lydia by-name, (a) dealer-in-purple-cloth, of-(the)-city of-Thyatira, fearing [the] God/(a) God-fearer, was-listening, the heart of-whom the Lord opened to-give-herself to-the-things spoken by [the] Paul. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And when she-was-baptized and the house of-her, she-urged (us), saying, <em>“If you-have-found me to-be trustworthy/faithful to-t</em><em>he Lord, having-entered the hous</em><em>e of-me, remain”</em>; and she-persuaded us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And it-happened, we going to [the] prayer, a-certain slave-girl, having (a) spirit-of-divination, met us, who was-bringing much profit to-the lords of-her, fortune-telling. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>This-one, dogging [the] Paul and us, kept shouting, saying, <em>“These [the] men (are) servants of-[the] God Most High, who proclaim to-us (the) way of-salvation.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And she-kept-doing this for many days. And Paul, having-been-greatly-annoyed and having-turned around, said to-the spirit, <em>“I-charge you in (the) name of-Jesus Christ to-come-out from her.”</em><em> </em>And it-came-out the very hour. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And the lords of-her, having-seen that the hope of-the profit of-them had-gone-out, seizing [the] Paul and [the] Silas, dragged (them) into the marketplace to-the rulers; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and having-brought┘them└to the soldiers/magistrates/praeters, said, <em>“These [the] men are-stirring-up the city of-us, being Jews, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>and they-are-proclaiming customs that are┘not└legal for-</em><em>us to-observe nor to-do, being R</em><em>omans.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And the crowd joined-in-the-attack against them, and the soldiers/magistrates/praeters, having-torn-off the clothes of-them, were-commanding to-beat┘them└with-rods; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and having-laid┘many blows└on them, they-put them in prison having-ordered the jailor to-keep them safely/securely; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>who, having-received such (an) order, put them in the inner prison and secured the feet of-them in [the] stocks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And about [the] midnight Paul and Silas, praying, were-singing-praises-to [the] God, and the prisoners were-listening-to them. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And suddenly (a) severe earthquake occurred so-that the foundations of-the prison were-shaken. And immediately all the doors were-opened and the shackles of-all were-unfastened. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And the jailor, having been asleep and seeing the doors of-the prison opened, having-drawn [the]<sup>ms</sup> sword, was-about to-kill himself, supposing/thinking the prisoners to-have-fled-out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But [the]<sup>ms</sup> Paul shouted with-(a)-loud voice, saying, <em>“Do no harm to-yourself, for we-are </em><em>all </em><em>here.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And having-asked-for (a) light, he-rushed-in and, having-become trembling, fell-to [the] Paul and [the]<sup>ms</sup> Silas, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>and, having-brought them out, said, <em>“Sirs, what is-necessary for-me to-do in-order-that I-may-be-saved.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the-ones/they said, <em>“Trust in the Lord</em><em> Jesus</em><em>,</em><em> and you-will-be-saved, you and the household of-you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And they-spoke the word of-the Lord to-him with all the-ones in-the house of-him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And having-taken┘them└aside in that [the] hour of-the night, he-washed out the wounds-from-the blows, and he-was-baptized, he and all the-ones of-him immediately, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and having-brought them into the house he-set table and rejoiced with-his-household having-trusted [the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And when day came, the soldiers/magistrates/praeters sent the-ones having-billy-clubs/police-officers, saying, <em>“Release [the] those men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And the jailor reported [the] these<sup>ms</sup> to [the] Paul [that]. <em>“The soldiers/magistrates/praeters sent in-order-that you-may-be-released.</em><em> </em><em>Now then having-gone-out, go/travel in peace.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But [the] Paul said to them, <em>“Having-beaten</em><em> us publicly, uncondemned, being Roman men, they-put (us) in prison, and now privately the</em><em>y</em><em>-put/are-putting┘(us)└out?</em><em> </em><em>No, for; but having-come, let-them┘themselves└lead-us-out.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And when the police/officers reported [the] these words to-the soldiers/magistrates/praeters, and they-were-afraid, having-heard that they-are/were Romans. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And having-come they-urged them and having-brought┘(them)└out, they-began-to-ask (them) to-go-away from the city. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And having-gone-out from the prison, they-entered to [the] Lydia; and having-seen (her) they-summoned the brothers and went-out.</span>
