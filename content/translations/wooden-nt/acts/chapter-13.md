## Acts Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And in Antioch according-to the being church were prophets and teachers both[the] Barnabas; and Symeon, the-one called Niger; and Lucius, the Cyrenian; Manean, the foster-brother of-Herod the tetrarch; and Saul.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy [the] Spirit said, <em>“Now separate for-me [the] Barnabas and Saul to the work that I-have-called┘them└to.”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then having-fasted and having-prayed and having-laid┘[the] hands└on them, they-sent┘them└off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They then, having-been-sent-out by the Holy Spirit, came-down to Seleucia, and from-there they-sailed to Cyprus; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and having-arrived in Salamis, they-proclaimed the message of-[the] God in the synagogue of-the Jews, and they-were-having John (as an) assistant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And having-passed-through the whole [the] island as-far-as Paphos, they-found a-certain man, (a) sorcerer, (a) false-prophet, (a) Jew to-whom (was the) name Bar-Jesus; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, (an) intelligent man. This-one, having-summoned Barnabas and Saul, was-trying to-hear the message of-[the] God. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But Elymas the sorcerer—for thus the name of-him is-translated—opposed/resisted them, trying to-turn the proconsul from the faith. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And Saul—the-one also (known as) Paul, having-been-filled with–(the)-Holy Spirit, having-looked-straight-at him, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>said, <em>“O full of-all deceit and all wrong-doing, son of-(the)-devil, enemy of-all righteousness, you-will┘not</em><em>└└</em><em>└cease perverting the straight [the] ways of-[the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> Lord, </em><em>└└</em><em>will-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And now behold (the) hand of-(the)-Lord (is) on you, and you-will-be blind, not</em><em> seeing the sun for (a) season.</em><em>”</em> And immediately mist fell on him and darkness, and going-around he-started-looking-for (a) hand-leader. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Then the proconsul, having-seen the-thing having-happened, believed, being-amazed at the teaching of-the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-departed from [the] Paphos, the-ones around Paul went to Perga of-[the] Pamphylia, but John, having-left from them, returned to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And they, having-left from [the] Perga, arrived in Antioch the Pisidia; and, having-entered into the synagogue on-the day of-the Sabbath, sat-down. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And after the reading of-the Law and the prophets, the synagogue-leaders sent to them, saying, <em>“Men brothers, if any word/message of-encouragement is in you to the people, speak.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And Paul, having-arisen and having-signaled with-the hand, said, <em>“Men Israelites </em><em>and the God-fearers/the-ones fearing [the] God</em><em>, listen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The God of-[the] this people Israel chose the fathers of-us and exalted the people in the sojourn in (the) Egypt</em><em>,</em><em> and with (a) high arm he-led them out-of it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>And for</em><em>–(the) time of┘about└forty-years nourished them in the desert; </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>and, having-destroyed seven nations in (the) land Canaan, he-gave┘the land of-them└as-an-inheritance </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>for-about four hundred and fifty years, and after these-things he-gave (them) judges until Samuel [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> prophet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And-from-there they-asked-for (a) king, and [the] God gave them [the] Saul</em><em>,</em><em> son of-Kish</em><em>,</em><em> (a) man out-of (the) tribe of-Benjamin, </em><em>for-</em><em>forty-years; </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>and having-set</em><em>┘him└</em><em>aside, he-raised-up [the] David for-them [for] king</em><em>,</em><em> for-whom </em><em>he┘also└</em><em>said, having-testified, “I-found David the (son) of-[the] Jesse, (a) man according-to the heart of-me, who will-do all the wills of-me</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>From the seed of-this-one [the] God according-to promise brought to-[the] Israel (a) Savior Jesus, </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>John, having-preached before the face of-the entrance of-him (a) baptism of-repentance to-all the people Israel.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>But as John </em><em>was-fulfill</em><em>ing</em><em> the course, he-was-saying, ‘</em><em>What </em><em>do-you</em><em> suppose me </em><em>to-be?</em><em> </em><em>I am not.</em><em> </em><em>But </em><em>he-comes</em><em> after me of-whom I-am not worthy to-untie the sandal of</em><em>-the/his feet.’</em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Men brothers, sons of-(the)-stock of-Abraham and the-one</em><em>s among you fearing [the] God, </em><em>the message of-[the] this salvation was-sent to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>For the-ones dwelling in Jerusalem and the rulers of-them, not knowing this-One and the voices of-the prophets [the] read </em><em>every-Sabbath</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>/from Sabbath to Sabbath</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>, having-condemned (him), fulfilled (them); </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>and, having- no cause of-death, they-asked Pilate (that) he be-slain.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>But when they-finished all the-things having-been-written concerning him, having-taken┘him└down from the cross, they-put (him) in (a) tomb.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>But [the] God raised him from (the) dead, </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>who appeared for many days to-the-ones having-come-up-with him from [the] Galilee to Jerusalem, who [now]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> are witnesses of-him to the people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> </em><em>are-evangelizing</em><em> you with-respect-to-the-promise made to the fathers, </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>that </em><em>[the] God has-fulfilled this to-the sons [of-them]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> to-us, having-resurrected Jesus as also in the second [the] Psalm it-has-been-written,</em> <em>	</em><em>‘</em><strong><em>You are (the) Son of-</em></strong><strong><em>me;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>oday I have begotten you</em></strong><strong><em>’;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup><em>and that he-res</em><em>urrected him from (the) dead no</em><em>-longer to-be-going to-return to corruption, thus he-has-said [that],</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><em>‘</em><em>I-will-give</em><strong><em> you the holy, the sure-things of-David.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup><em>Wherefore also </em><em>he-says</em><em> in another (psalm),</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>‘You-will┘not└give the Holy-One of-you to-see corruption.’</em></strong> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong><strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>For David, having-served for-his-own generation the plan of-[the] God, slept and was-laid to the fathers of-him and he-saw corruption; </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>but whom [the] God raised did┘not└see corruption.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>38</sup></em></strong><em>So let-it-be known to-you, men brothers, that through this-One is-proclaimed to-you forgiveness of-sins, [eve</em><em>n</em><em>]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> from all-things that you-were┘not└able to-be-justified by (the) </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-Moses, </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>in this-One everyone [the] believing is-justified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>So beware lest the-thing having-been-written in the prophets should-come-on (you):</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Behold, [the-ones] treating-with-contempt,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd marvel and </em></strong><strong><em>perish</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>b</em></strong><strong><em>ecause I will-work (a) work in the days of-you, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><em>(a) work</em><strong><em> that </em></strong><strong><em>you-will┘</em></strong><strong><em>surely not└believe </em></strong> <strong><em>even if somebody </em></strong><strong><em>fully-related</em></strong><strong><em> (it) to-you.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they going-out, they-were-requesting [the] these words on the next Sabbath to-be-spoken to-them. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And the synagogue having-been-broken-up, many of-the Jews and the God-fearing proselytes followed [the] Paul and [the] Barnabas, who, speaking-to them, were-persuading them to-continue in-the grace of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And on-the coming Sabbath nearly all the city was-gathered-together to-hear the word/message of-the Lord. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>And the Jews, having-seen the crowds, were-filled with-jealousy and began-talking-against the-things being-spoken by Paul, blaspheming. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And [the] Paul and [the] Barnabas, having-spoken-boldly, said, <em>“It-was necessary (that) the word/message of-[the] God be-spoken to-you first.</em><em> </em><em>Since you-are-pushing┘it└away and judge yourselves </em><em>not worthy</em><em> of-[the] eternal life, behold, we-are-turning to the ‘Gentiles’; </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>for so the Lord has-commanded us,</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>‘I</em></strong><strong><em>-have-put you for (a) light to-(the)-nations/Gentiles,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	[the] you to-be for salvation unto (the) last of-the earth.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>And the Gentiles having-heard, began-to-rejoice and began-to-glorify the word/message of-the Lord, and as-many-as were appointed to eternal life believed. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>And the word/message of-the Lord was-being-spread throughout all the region. <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>And the Jews incited the God-fearing [the] respected women and the first-ones of-the city, and raised-up persecution against [the] Paul and Barnabas and cast/put┘them└out from the borders of-them. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And the-ones/they, having-shaken-off the dust of-the feet against them, went to Iconium; <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>and the disciples were-being-filled with-joy and (the) Holy Spirit.</span>
