## Acts Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And in Antioch according-to the being church were prophets and teachers both[the] Barnabas; and Symeon, the-one called Niger; and Lucius, the Cyrenian; Manean, the foster-brother of-Herod the tetrarch; and Saul.  2And they serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy [the] Spirit said, "Now separate for-me [the] Barnabas and Saul to the work that I-have-called┘them└to." 3Then having-fasted and having-prayed and having-laid┘[the] hands└on them, they-sent┘them└off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They then, having-been-sent-out by the Holy Spirit, came-down to Seleucia, and from-there they-sailed to Cyprus; 5and having-arrived in Salamis, they-proclaimed the message of-[the] God in the synagogue of-the Jews, and they-were-having John (as an) assistant. 6And having-passed-through the whole [the] island as-far-as Paphos, they-found a-certain man, (a) sorcerer, (a) false-prophet, (a) Jew to-whom (was the) name Bar-Jesus; 7who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, (an) intelligent man. This-one, having-summoned Barnabas and Saul, was-trying to-hear the message of-[the] God. 8But Elymas the sorcerer—for thus the name of-him is-translated—opposed/resisted them, trying to-turn the proconsul from the faith. 9And Saul—the-one also (known as) Paul, having-been-filled with–(the)-Holy Spirit, having-looked-straight-at him, 10said, "O full of-all deceit and all wrong-doing, son of-(the)-devil, enemy of-all righteousness, you-will┘not└└└cease perverting the straight [the] ways of-[the]ms Lord, └└will-you? 11And now behold (the) hand of-(the)-Lord (is) on you, and you-will-be blind, not seeing the sun for (a) season." And immediately mist fell on him and darkness, and going-around he-started-looking-for (a) hand-leader. 12Then the proconsul, having-seen the-thing having-happened, believed, being-amazed at the teaching of-the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-departed from [the] Paphos, the-ones around Paul went to Perga of-[the] Pamphylia, but John, having-left from them, returned to Jerusalem. 14And they, having-left from [the] Perga, arrived in Antioch the Pisidia; and, having-entered into the synagogue on-the day of-the Sabbath, sat-down. 15And after the reading of-the Law and the prophets, the synagogue-leaders sent to them, saying, "Men brothers, if any word/message of-encouragement is in you to the people, speak."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And Paul, having-arisen and having-signaled with-the hand, said, "Men Israelites and the God-fearers/the-ones fearing [the] God, listen. 17The God of-[the] this people Israel chose the fathers of-us and exalted the people in the sojourn in (the) Egypt, and with (a) high arm he-led them out-of it. 18And for–(the) time of┘about└forty-years nourished them in the desert; 19and, having-destroyed seven nations in (the) land Canaan, he-gave┘the land of-them└as-an-inheritance 20for-about four hundred and fifty years, and after these-things he-gave (them) judges until Samuel [the]ms prophet. 21And-from-there they-asked-for (a) king, and [the] God gave them [the] Saul, son of-Kish, (a) man out-of (the) tribe of-Benjamin, for-forty-years; 22and having-set┘him└aside, he-raised-up [the] David for-them [for] king, for-whom he┘also└said, having-testified, "I-found David the (son) of-[the] Jesse, (a) man according-to the heart of-me, who will-do all the wills of-me. 23From the seed of-this-one [the] God according-to promise brought to-[the] Israel (a) Savior Jesus, 24John, having-preached before the face of-the entrance of-him (a) baptism of-repentance to-all the people Israel. 25But as John was-fulfilling the course, he-was-saying, 'What do-you suppose me to-be? I am not. But he-comes after me of-whom I-am not worthy to-untie the sandal of-the/his feet.' 26"Men brothers, sons of-(the)-stock of-Abraham and the-ones among you fearing [the] God, the message of-[the] this salvation was-sent to-you. 27For the-ones dwelling in Jerusalem and the rulers of-them, not knowing this-One and the voices of-the prophets [the] read every-Sabbath3/from Sabbath to Sabbath3, having-condemned (him), fulfilled (them); 28and, having- no cause of-death, they-asked Pilate (that) he be-slain. 29But when they-finished all the-things having-been-written concerning him, having-taken┘him└down from the cross, they-put (him) in (a) tomb. 30But [the] God raised him from (the) dead, 31who appeared for many days to-the-ones having-come-up-with him from [the] Galilee to Jerusalem, who [now]ms are witnesses of-him to the people. 32And we are-evangelizing you with-respect-to-the-promise made to the fathers, 33that [the] God has-fulfilled this to-the sons [of-them]ms to-us, having-resurrected Jesus as also in the second [the] Psalm it-has-been-written, 34and that he-resurrected him from (the) dead no-longer to-be-going to-return to corruption, thus he-has-said [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Wherefore also he-says in another (psalm), 36"For David, having-served for-his-own generation the plan of-[the] God, slept and was-laid to the fathers of-him and he-saw corruption; 37but whom [the] God raised did┘not└see corruption. 38So let-it-be known to-you, men brothers, that through this-One is-proclaimed to-you forgiveness of-sins, [even]ms from all-things that you-were┘not└able to-be-justified by (the) Law of-Moses, 39in this-One everyone [the] believing is-justified. 40So beware lest the-thing having-been-written in the prophets should-come-on (you):</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And they going-out, they-were-requesting [the] these words on the next Sabbath to-be-spoken to-them. 43And the synagogue having-been-broken-up, many of-the Jews and the God-fearing proselytes followed [the] Paul and [the] Barnabas, who, speaking-to them, were-persuading them to-continue in-the grace of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> And on-the coming Sabbath nearly all the city was-gathered-together to-hear the word/message of-the Lord. 45And the Jews, having-seen the crowds, were-filled with-jealousy and began-talking-against the-things being-spoken by Paul, blaspheming. 46And [the] Paul and [the] Barnabas, having-spoken-boldly, said, "It-was necessary (that) the word/message of-[the] God be-spoken to-you first. Since you-are-pushing┘it└away and judge yourselves not worthy of-[the] eternal life, behold, we-are-turning to the 'Gentiles'; 47for so the Lord has-commanded us,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> And the Gentiles having-heard, began-to-rejoice and began-to-glorify the word/message of-the Lord, and as-many-as were appointed to eternal life believed. 49And the word/message of-the Lord was-being-spread throughout all the region. 50And the Jews incited the God-fearing [the] respected women and the first-ones of-the city, and raised-up persecution against [the] Paul and Barnabas and cast/put┘them└out from the borders of-them. 51And the-ones/they, having-shaken-off the dust of-the feet against them, went to Iconium; 52and the disciples were-being-filled with-joy and (the) Holy Spirit.</span>
