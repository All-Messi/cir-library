<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things having-departed from [the] Athens, he-came to Corinth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And having-found a-certain Jew, Aquila by-name—(a) Pontian as-to-[the] nation, recently come from [the] Italy—and Priscilla (the) wife of-him, on-account-of Claudius’ having-ordered all the Jews to-depart from [the] Rome, he-came to-them; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and on-account-of the/their being similar-in-trade, he-was-staying with them and was-working for by-[the] trade they-were tent-makers. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And he-was-reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath<sup>2</sup>/from Sabbath to Sabbath<sup>2</sup>, and was-persuading Jews and Greeks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And when [the] Silas and [the] Timothy came-down from Macedonia, [the] Paul was-being-absorbed with the message, testifying to-the Jews that [the] Christ/Messiah was Jesus. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And they opposing-themselves and blaspheming, having-shaken-out the/his clothes, he-said to-them, <em>“The blood of-you (be) on the head of-you; </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> (am) pure; from the now I-will-go to the Gentiles.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And having-departed from-there, he-entered into (the) house of-(a)-certain Titus Justus, (a) God-fearer, the house of-whom was being-next-door to-the synagogue. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Crispus the synagogue-ruler believed-in the Lord with the whole house of-him; and many of-the Corinthians, hearing, were-coming-to-believe and were-being-baptized.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the Lord said in (the) night through (a) dream to [the] Paul<em>, “Do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>be-afraid, but speak and do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>be-silent, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>becau</em><em>s</em><em>e </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am wit</em><em>h you</em><em>;</em><em> and nobody will-attack you the/in-order-to do┘you└evil, because </em><em>much</em><em> people </em><em>is</em><em> to-me in [the] this city.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-settled-down for-(a)-year and six months, teaching among them the word of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now Gallio being proconsul of-[the] Achaia, the Jews together rose-up-against [the] Paul and led him to the judgment-seat, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>saying [that], <em>“This-one persuades [the] men to-worship [the] Lord from-beside the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Paul being-about to-open the/his mouth, [the] Gallio said to the Jews, <em>“If it-were some injustice or evil wrong-doing, O Jews, according-to reason I-would-have-borne-with you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>But if they-are arguments about (a) word and names and (the) </em><em>L</em><em>aw [the] according-to you, you┘yourselves└will-see-to-it.</em><em> </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> do┘not└want to-be (a) judge of-these-things.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And he-drove them away-from the judgment-seat. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And all having-laid-hold-of Sosthenes, the synagogue ruler, they-began-beating (him) in-front-of the judgment-seat. And nothing of-these-things was-a-care to-[the] Gallio.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now [the] Paul, having-remained┘yet quite-a-number of days└with the brothers, having-said-goodbye, sailed-out for [the] Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having-shaved the/his head in Cenchrea, for he-was-having (a) vow. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And they-arrived at Ephesus, and┘he-left them└there and himself, having-entered into the synagogue, he-reasoned with-the Jews. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And they asking (him) to-remain for more time, he-did┘not└consent, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>but, having-said-goodbye and having-said, <em>“Again I-will-return to you, [the] God willing,</em><em>”</em> he-set-sail from [the] Ephesus, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and having-arrive/landed/gone-down at Caesarea, having-gone-up and having-greeted the church, he-went-down to Antioch. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And having-spent some time, he-went-out in sequence passing-through the Galatia territory and Phrygia, establishing/strengthening the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And a-certain Jew, Apollos by-name, (an) Alexandrian by nation/background, (an) eloquent/learned man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the scriptures. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>This-one was instructed with-respect-to the way of-the Lord, and enthusiastic in-[the] spirit was-speaking and teaching accurately the-things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of-John. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And this-one began to-speak-boldly in the synagogue. And Priscilla and Aquila having-heard him, took┘him└aside and more-accurately explained to-him the way [of-[the] God]<sup>ms</sup>. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And he desiring to-pass-through into [the] Achaia, the brothers, having-encouraged him, wrote to-the disciples to-receive him, who, having-appeared, helped much the-ones having-believed/trusted through [the] grace. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>For vigorously he-was-refuting [the] Jews publicly, showing through the scriptures the Christ to-be Jesus.</span>
