<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And when [the] Silas and [the] Timothy came-down from Macedonia, [the] Paul was-being-absorbed with the message, testifying to-the Jews that [the] Christ/Messiah was Jesus. 6And they opposing-themselves and blaspheming, having-shaken-out the/his clothes, he-said to-them, "The blood of-you (be) on the head of-you; I (am) pure; from the now I-will-go to the Gentiles." 7And having-departed from-there, he-entered into (the) house of-(a)-certain Titus Justus, (a) God-fearer, the house of-whom was being-next-door to-the synagogue. 8And Crispus the synagogue-ruler believed-in the Lord with the whole house of-him; and many of-the Corinthians, hearing, were-coming-to-believe and were-being-baptized.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the Lord said in (the) night through (a) dream to [the] Paul, "Do┘not└be-afraid, but speak and do┘not└be-silent, 10because I am with you; and nobody will-attack you the/in-order-to do┘you└evil, because much people is to-me in [the] this city."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-settled-down for-(a)-year and six months, teaching among them the word of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now Gallio being proconsul of-[the] Achaia, the Jews together rose-up-against [the] Paul and led him to the judgment-seat, 13saying [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Paul being-about to-open the/his mouth, [the] Gallio said to the Jews, "If it-were some injustice or evil wrong-doing, O Jews, according-to reason I-would-have-borne-with you. 15But if they-are arguments about (a) word and names and (the) Law [the] according-to you, you┘yourselves└will-see-to-it. I do┘not└want to-be (a) judge of-these-things." 16And he-drove them away-from the judgment-seat. 17And all having-laid-hold-of Sosthenes, the synagogue ruler, they-began-beating (him) in-front-of the judgment-seat. And nothing of-these-things was-a-care to-[the] Gallio.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now [the] Paul, having-remained┘yet quite-a-number of days└with the brothers, having-said-goodbye, sailed-out for [the] Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having-shaved the/his head in Cenchrea, for he-was-having (a) vow. 19And they-arrived at Ephesus, and┘he-left them└there and himself, having-entered into the synagogue, he-reasoned with-the Jews. 20And they asking (him) to-remain for more time, he-did┘not└consent, 21but, having-said-goodbye and having-said, "Again I-will-return to you, [the] God willing," he-set-sail from [the] Ephesus, 22and having-arrive/landed/gone-down at Caesarea, having-gone-up and having-greeted the church, he-went-down to Antioch. 23And having-spent some time, he-went-out in sequence passing-through the Galatia territory and Phrygia, establishing/strengthening the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And a-certain Jew, Apollos by-name, (an) Alexandrian by nation/background, (an) eloquent/learned man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the scriptures. 25This-one was instructed with-respect-to the way of-the Lord, and enthusiastic in-[the] spirit was-speaking and teaching accurately the-things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of-John. 26And this-one began to-speak-boldly in the synagogue. And Priscilla and Aquila having-heard him, took┘him└aside and more-accurately explained to-him the way [of-[the] God]ms. 27And he desiring to-pass-through into [the] Achaia, the brothers, having-encouraged him, wrote to-the disciples to-receive him, who, having-appeared, helped much the-ones having-believed/trusted through [the] grace. 28For vigorously he-was-refuting [the] Jews publicly, showing through the scriptures the Christ to-be Jesus.</span>
