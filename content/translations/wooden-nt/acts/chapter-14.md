## Acts Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened them to-enter/their-entering together<sup>3</sup>/according-to the same into the synagogue of-the Jews and to-speak/speaking there so-that (a) great multitude of┘both└Jews and Greeks believed. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the having-disbelieving Jews arose and treated-badly the souls of-the Gentiles against the brothers. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then for-sufficient time being-bold for the Lord [the] testifying to the word of-the grace of-him, giving signs and wonders to-become/occur through the hands of-them. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the crowd of-the city was-divided; and some were with the Jews, and some were with the apostles. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And there-occurred (an) attempt of┘both└the Gentiles and the Jews with the rulers of-them, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>having-become-aware (of it), they-fled into the cities of-[the] Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe and the surrounding region. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And-there they-were evangelizing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And a-certain man in Lystra crippled with-respect-to-the feet was-sitting, lame from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, who never walked. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>This-one heard [the] Paul speaking, who, having-looked-straight-at him, and seeing that he-has/had faith to-be-healed, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>said with-(a)-loud voice, <em>“Stand-up straight on-the feet of-you,”</em> and he-jumped-up and began-to-walk. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And the crowds, having-seen what Paul did, lifted-up the voice of-them in-Lycaonian, saying, <em>“The gods, being-like men, came down to us.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And they-started calling Barnabas Zeus/Jupiter, and [the] Paul Hermes/Mercury because <u>he</u> was the-one leading the word. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And the priest of Zeus-[the-one being]-Before-the-City, having-brought oxen/bulls and garlands to the gates of-the city with the crowds was=wanting to-offer-sacrifice. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having-heard, having-torn the clothes of-them, rushed into the crowd, shouting, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and saying, <em>“Men, why are-you-doing these-things?</em><em> </em><em><u>We</u></em><em> also are men likened to-you, preaching (that) you turn-away from these [the] empty-things to (the) living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea all the-things in them; </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>who in having-gone-by generations allowed all the nations to-go in-their-own-ways; </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>although he-did</em><em>┘not└leave himself with-out witness, showing-good-things, giving to-you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling the hearts of-you with food and gladness.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And saying these-things, they┘scarcely└stopped the crowds [the not] doing-sacrifice to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and, having-persuaded the crowds and having-stoned [the] Paul, they-dragged (him) outside the city thinking him to-have-died. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And the disciples having-encircled him, having-stood-up, he-went-into the city. And on-the next-day he-went-out with [the] Barnabas to Derbe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And evangelizing [the] that city and having-made significant-numbers-of disciples, they-returned to [the] Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>confirmed the souls of-the disciples, encouraging (them) to-remain in-[the] faith and (saying) that through many tribulations it-is-necessary-for us to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And having-hand-appointed for-them elders according-to the church<sup>2</sup>/in every church<sup>2</sup>, having-prayed with fasting, entrusted them to-the Lord to/in whom they-had-trusted. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And having-passed-through [the] Pisidia, they-came to [the] Pamphylia; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and having-spoken the word/message in Perga, they-went-down to Attalia, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and-from-there they-sailed to Antioch, whence they-were delivered to-the grace of-[the] God to the work that they-fulfilled. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And having-arrived and having-gathered-together the church, they-began-to-report as-many-things-as [the] God did with them and that he-opened (a) door of-faith for-the Gentiles/nations. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And they-were-spending not (a) little time with the disciples.</span>
