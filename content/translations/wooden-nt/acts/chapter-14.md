## Acts Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened them to-enter/their-entering together3/according-to the same into the synagogue of-the Jews and to-speak/speaking there so-that (a) great multitude of┘both└Jews and Greeks believed. 2And the having-disbelieving Jews arose and treated-badly the souls of-the Gentiles against the brothers. 3Then for-sufficient time being-bold for the Lord [the] testifying to the word of-the grace of-him, giving signs and wonders to-become/occur through the hands of-them. 4And the crowd of-the city was-divided; and some were with the Jews, and some were with the apostles. 5And there-occurred (an) attempt of┘both└the Gentiles and the Jews with the rulers of-them, 6having-become-aware (of it), they-fled into the cities of-[the] Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe and the surrounding region. 7And-there they-were evangelizing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And a-certain man in Lystra crippled with-respect-to-the feet was-sitting, lame from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, who never walked. 9This-one heard [the] Paul speaking, who, having-looked-straight-at him, and seeing that he-has/had faith to-be-healed, 10said with-(a)-loud voice, "Stand-up straight on-the feet of-you," and he-jumped-up and began-to-walk. 11And the crowds, having-seen what Paul did, lifted-up the voice of-them in-Lycaonian, saying, "The gods, being-like men, came down to us." 12And they-started calling Barnabas Zeus/Jupiter, and [the] Paul Hermes/Mercury because he was the-one leading the word. 13And the priest of Zeus-[the-one being]-Before-the-City, having-brought oxen/bulls and garlands to the gates of-the city with the crowds was=wanting to-offer-sacrifice. 14But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having-heard, having-torn the clothes of-them, rushed into the crowd, shouting, 15and saying, "Men, why are-you-doing these-things? We also are men likened to-you, preaching (that) you turn-away from these [the] empty-things to (the) living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea all the-things in them; 16who in having-gone-by generations allowed all the nations to-go in-their-own-ways; 17although he-did┘not└leave himself with-out witness, showing-good-things, giving to-you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling the hearts of-you with food and gladness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And saying these-things, they┘scarcely└stopped the crowds [the not] doing-sacrifice to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and, having-persuaded the crowds and having-stoned [the] Paul, they-dragged (him) outside the city thinking him to-have-died. 20And the disciples having-encircled him, having-stood-up, he-went-into the city. And on-the next-day he-went-out with [the] Barnabas to Derbe.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And evangelizing [the] that city and having-made significant-numbers-of disciples, they-returned to [the] Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 22confirmed the souls of-the disciples, encouraging (them) to-remain in-[the] faith and (saying) that through many tribulations it-is-necessary-for us to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God. 23And having-hand-appointed for-them elders according-to the church2/in every church2, having-prayed with fasting, entrusted them to-the Lord to/in whom they-had-trusted. 24And having-passed-through [the] Pisidia, they-came to [the] Pamphylia; 25and having-spoken the word/message in Perga, they-went-down to Attalia, 26and-from-there they-sailed to Antioch, whence they-were delivered to-the grace of-[the] God to the work that they-fulfilled. 27And having-arrived and having-gathered-together the church, they-began-to-report as-many-things-as [the] God did with them and that he-opened (a) door of-faith for-the Gentiles/nations. 28And they-were-spending not (a) little time with the disciples.</span>
