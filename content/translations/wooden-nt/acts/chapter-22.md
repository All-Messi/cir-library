## Acts Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Men brothers and fathers, listen-to the defense of-me to you now." 2And having-heard that in-the Hebrew dialect he-was-speaking-to them, they-had more quietness, and he-says, 3"I am (a) Jewish man, having-been-born in Tarsus of-[the] Cilicia, having-been-reared in [the] this city, at the feet of-Gamaliel, having-been-educated according-to strictness of-the ancestral Law, being (a) zealot of-[the] God even-as you all are today; 4I┘who└persecuted The Way to death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, 5even-as also the high-priests and all the presbytery testifies with-reference-to-me, from whom also having-received letters to the brothers, I-traveled to Damascus with-the-purpose-of-leading also the-ones being there having-been-bound to Jerusalem in-order-that they-might-be-punished. 6"And it-happened to-me while-traveling and getting-near to-the Damascus at-midday, (that) suddenly out-of the sky (a) bright light shone around me, 7and I-fell to the ground and heard (a) voice saying to-me, 'Saul, Saul, why are-you-persecuting me?' 8And I answered, 'Who are-you, Lord' and he-said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you-are-persecuting.' 9But the-ones being with me saw the light and did not understand the-One speaking to-me. 10And I-said, 'What shall-I-do, Lord?' And the Lord said to men, 'Arising, go into Damascus and-there it-will-be-told to-you concerning all which it-has-been-appointed to-you to-do.' 11But when I-was┘not└seeing from the glory/brightness if-[the] that light, being-led-by-the-hand by the-ones being-with me, I-went into Damascus. 12"And a-certain Ananias, (a) devout man according-to the Law, was-testified-to by all the Jews dwelling (there), 13having-come to me and having stood-by (me), said to-me, 'Brother Saul, see-again.' And-I in-the very hour looked-up at him. 14And the-one said, 'The God of-the fathers of-us chose┘you└beforehand to-know the will of-him and to-see the righteous-One and to-hear (a) voice from the mouth of-him, 15because you-will-be (a) witness for-him to all men of-what-things you-have-seen and you-have-heard. 16And now why are-you-delaying? Having-arisen, get-baptized and wash-away the sins of-you, calling-on the name of-him.' 17"And it-happened to-us having-returned to Jerusalem, that/and I praying in the temple, I-came-to-be in (a) trance 18and saw him speaking to-me, 'Hurry and leave in quickness from Jerusalem, because they-will┘not└accept testimony of-you about me.' 19And-I said, 'Lord, they┘themselves└know that I was imprisoning and beating from synagogue to synagogue/in every synagogue[s] the-ones believing in you. 20And when the blood of-Stephen the witness of-you was-being-poured-out, I┘myself└was standing-by and approving and guarding the cloaks of-the-ones killing him.' 21And he-said to-me, 'Go, because I-will-send┘you└out far-away to (the) Gentiles.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And they-were-listening until this [the] word, and they-lifted-up the voices of-them, saying, "Take from the earth [the] such (a man), for it-is┘not└fittiing for-him to-live."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And they screaming and tearing the/their clothes and throwing dust into the air, 24the tribune/chiliarch commanded him to-be-brought into the barracks, having-said to-examine him by-scourging in-order-that he-might-know on-account-of what matter they-were shouting-against him thus. 25And when they-stretched┘him└out with-the straps, [the] Paul said to the centurion standing-by [whether], "Is-it-legal to-scourge (a) Roman man uncondemned?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the centurion having-heard, having-gone-to the tribune/chiliarch, reported, saying, "What are-you-about to-do? For [the] this man is (a) Roman."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And the tribune/chiliarch, having-come, said to-him, "Tell me, are you (a) Roman?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And the tribune/chiliarch answered, "I bought [the] this citizenship with-much money."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Then immediately the-ones about to-interrogate him stepped-away/withdrew, and the tribune/chiliarch was afraid, having-come-to-know that he-was (a) Roman and that he-had bound him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Now on-the next-day, wanting to-come-to-know the true-thing/for certain [the] why he-was-being-accused by the Jews, unbounded him and commanded the high-priests and all the Sanhedrin to-assemble, and, having-led┘[the] Paul└down, he-stood (him) before/to them.</span>
