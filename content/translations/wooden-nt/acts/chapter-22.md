<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup><em>“</em><em>Men brothers and fathers, listen-to the defense of-me to </em><em>y</em><em>ou now.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And having-heard that in-the Hebrew dialect he-was-speaking-to them, they-had more quietness, and he-says, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I am (a) Jewish man, having-been-born in Tarsus of-[the] Cilicia, having-been-reared in [the] this city, at the feet of-Gamaliel, having-been-educated according-to strictness of-the ancestral </em><em>L</em><em>aw, being (a) </em><em>zealot of-[the] God even-as you all are today; </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I┘who└persecuted The Way to death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>even-as also the high-priests and all the presbytery testifies with-reference-to-me, from who</em><em>m also</em><em> having-received letters to the brothers, I-traveled to Damascus with-the-purpose-of-leading also the-ones being there having-</em><em>been-</em><em>bound to Jerusalem in-order-that they-might-be-punished.</em><em> </em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“And it-happ</em><em>en</em><em>ed to-me while-traveling and getting-near to-the Damascus at-midday, (that) suddenly out-of the sky (a) bright light shone around me, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>and I-fell to the ground and heard (a) voice saying to-me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are-</em><em>you</em><em>-persecuting me?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> answered, ‘</em><em>Who are-you, Lord’</em><em> </em><em>and he-said to me, </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am Jesus the Nazarene, whom </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>-are-persecuting.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>But the-ones being with me saw</em><em> the light and did not understand the-One speaking to-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And I-said, ‘What shall-I-do, Lord?’</em><em> </em><em>And the Lord said to men, ‘Arising, go into Damascus and-there it-will-be-told to-you concerning all which it-has-been-appointed to-you to-do.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>But when I-was</em><em>┘not└</em><em>seeing from the</em><em> glory/brightness if-[the] that light, being-led-by-the-hand by the-ones being-with me, I-went into Damascus.</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>“And a-certain Ananias, (a) devout man according-to the </em><em>L</em><em>aw, was-testified-to by all the Jews dwelling (there), </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>h</em><em>aving-come to me and having stood-by (me), said to-me, ‘Brother Saul, see-again.’</em><em> </em><em>And-I </em><em>in-the</em><em> </em><em>very </em><em>hour </em><em>looked-up</em><em> at him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And the-one said, ‘The God of-the fathers of-us chose┘you└beforehand to-know the will of-him and to-see the righteous-One and to-hear (a) voice from the mouth of-him, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>because you-will-be (a) witness for-him to all men of-what-things you-have-seen and you-have-heard.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And now why </em><em>are-you-delaying</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Having-arisen</em><em>,</em><em> get-baptized and wash-away the sins of-you, calling-on the name of-him.’</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>And it-happened to-us</em><em> having-returned to Jerusalem, that/and</em><em> I</em><em> </em><em>praying in the temple, </em><em>I-</em><em>came-to-be in (a) trance </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>and saw him speaking to-me, ‘Hurry and leave in quickness from Jerusalem, because they-will</em>┘not└<em>accept testimony of-you about me.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>And-I said, ‘Lord, they</em>┘<em>themselves</em>└<em>know that I was imprisoning and beating from synagogue to synagogue/</em><em>in every synagogue[s]</em><em> the-ones believing in you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And when the blood of-Stephen the witness of-you was-being-poured-out, I</em>┘<em>myself</em>└<em>was standing-by and approving and guarding the cloaks of-the-ones killing him.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And he-said to-me, ‘Go, because I-will-send</em>┘<em>you</em>└<em>out far-away to (the) Gentiles.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they-were-listening until this [the] word, and they-lifted-up the voices of-them, saying, <em>“Take from the earth [the] such (a man), for it-is┘not└fittiing for-him to-live.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And they screaming and tearing the/their clothes and throwing dust into the air, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>the tribune/chiliarch commanded him to-be-brought into the barracks, having-said to-examine him by-scourging in-order-that he-might-know on-account-of what matter they-were shouting-against him thus. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And when they-stretched┘him└out with-the straps, [the] Paul said to the centurion standing-by [whether], <em>“Is-it-legal to-scourge (a) Roman man uncondemned?”</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And the centurion having-heard, having-gone-to the tribune/chiliarch, reported, saying, <em>“What are-you-about to-do?</em><em> </em><em>For [the] this man is (a) Roman.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the tribune/chiliarch, having-come, said to-him, <em>“Tell me, are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> (a) Roman?”</em><em> </em> And the [Paul] said, <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And the tribune/chiliarch answered, “<em><u>I</u></em><em> bought [the] this citizenship with-much money.”</em><em> </em> But [the] Paul said,<em> “But </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> was</em>┘also└<em>born</em>.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>Then immediately the-ones about to-interrogate him stepped-away/withdrew, and the tribune/chiliarch was afraid, having-come-to-know that he-was (a) Roman and that he-had bound him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now on-the next-day, wanting to-come-to-know the true-thing/for certain [the] why he-was-being-accused by the Jews, unbounded him and commanded the high-priests and all the Sanhedrin to-assemble, and, having-led┘[the] Paul└down, he-stood (him) before/to them.</span>
