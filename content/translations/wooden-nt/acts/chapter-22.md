<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>“</em><em>Men brothers and fathers, listen-to the defense of-me to </em><em>y</em><em>ou now.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And having-heard that in-the Hebrew dialect he-was-speaking-to them, they-had more quietness, and he-says, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I am (a) Jewish man, having-been-born in Tarsus of-[the] Cilicia, having-been-reared in [the] this city, at the feet of-Gamaliel, having-been-educated according-to strictness of-the ancestral </em><em>L</em><em>aw, being (a) </em><em>zealot of-[the] God even-as you all are today; </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I┘who└persecuted The Way to death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>even-as also the high-priests and all the presbytery testifies with-reference-to-me, from who</em><em>m also</em><em> having-received letters to the brothers, I-traveled to Damascus with-the-purpose-of-leading also the-ones being there having-</em><em>been-</em><em>bound to Jerusalem in-order-that they-might-be-punished.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they-were-listening until this [the] word, and they-lifted-up the voices of-them, saying, <em>“Take from the earth [the] such (a man), for it-is┘not└fittiing for-him to-live.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And they screaming and tearing the/their clothes and throwing dust into the air, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>the tribune/chiliarch commanded him to-be-brought into the barracks, having-said to-examine him by-scourging in-order-that he-might-know on-account-of what matter they-were shouting-against him thus. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And when they-stretched┘him└out with-the straps, [the] Paul said to the centurion standing-by [whether], <em>“Is-it-legal to-scourge (a) Roman man uncondemned?”</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the centurion having-heard, having-gone-to the tribune/chiliarch, reported, saying, <em>“What are-you-about to-do?</em><em> </em><em>For [the] this man is (a) Roman.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the tribune/chiliarch, having-come, said to-him, <em>“Tell me, are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> (a) Roman?”</em><em> </em> And the [Paul] said, <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And the tribune/chiliarch answered, “<em><u>I</u></em><em> bought [the] this citizenship with-much money.”</em><em> </em> But [the] Paul said,<em> “But </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> was</em>┘also└<em>born</em>.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Then immediately the-ones about to-interrogate him stepped-away/withdrew, and the tribune/chiliarch was afraid, having-come-to-know that he-was (a) Roman and that he-had bound him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now on-the next-day, wanting to-come-to-know the true-thing/for certain [the] why he-was-being-accused by the Jews, unbounded him and commanded the high-priests and all the Sanhedrin to-assemble, and, having-led┘[the] Paul└down, he-stood (him) before/to them.</span>
