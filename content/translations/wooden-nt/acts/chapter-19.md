## Acts Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] Apollos’ being in [the] Corinth (that) Paul, having-gone through the inland/higher parts, came-down to Ephesus and found some disciples, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and said to them [whether]. <em>“Did you-receive (the) Holy Spirit having-believed</em>?<em>”</em> And the-ones/they (said) to him, <em>“[But] we-did┘not└know (the) Holy Spirit was/was-(given).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he-said, <em>“Into what then were–you-baptized?”</em> And the-ones/they said, <em>“Into the baptism of-John.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And Paul said, <em>“John baptized (a) baptism of-repentance, saying to-the people [in-order]-that they-might-believe in the-One coming after him,” that is, in [the] Jesus.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-heard, they-were-baptized into the name of-the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And Paul, having-laid┘[the]<sup>ms</sup> hands└on them, the Holy [the] Spirit came on them, and they-began-to-speak with-languages and began-to-prophesy <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And all the men were about twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And having-gone into the synagogue and was-persuading (them) [with-respect-to-the-things]<sup>ms</sup> concerning the kingdom of-[the] God. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Now when some began-to-be-resistant and started-disbelieving, speaking-evil-of The Way before the multitude/group, having-withdrawn from them, he-separated the disciples, according-to-[the] day<sup>2</sup>/daily<sup>2</sup>reasoning in the School of Tyrannus. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And this happened for two years, so-that all the-ones dwelling-in [the] Asia heard the word of-the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And [the] God was-doing miracles not the-ones normally-experienced through the hands of-Paul, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>so-that even handkerchiefs or aprons were-being-carried from the-surface-of┘his└body to the-ones being-sick and the diseases left from them and [the] evil [the] spirits went-out. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And some also of the circulating Jews went-from place-to-place, putting-under oath, tried-to-name on the-ones having the/# evil [the] spirits the name of-the Lord Jesus, saying, <em>“I-adjure you with-respect-to-[the] Jesus whom Paul is-preaching.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And seven-sons of-(a)-certain Sceva, (a) Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the evil [the] spirit, having-answered, said to-them, <em>“I-recognize [the] Jesus and I-know [the] Paul, but who are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the man in whom the evil [the] spirit was, jumping on them, having-overpowered both, was-strong against them so-that (they) fled out-of [the] that house naked and traumatized. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And this-thing became known to all, both Jews and Greeks the-ones dwelling-in [the] Ephesus, and fear fell on them all; and the name of-the Lord Jesus was-being-magnified. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And many of-the-ones having-believed started-coming, confessing and declaring the deeds of-them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And (a) significant-number of-the-ones having-practiced [the] black-magic/magical-arts, having-brought the/their books, were-burning (them) before all, and they-added the value of-them and they-found fifty thousand pieces-of-silver. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The word of-the Lord was-growing so mightily<sup>2</sup> and was-growing-strong</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And when these-things were-fulfilled, [the] Paul intended in [the] spirit, having-passed-through Macedonia and Achaia, to-travel to Jerusalem, having-said [that], <em>“After [the] my coming-to-be there, it-is-necessary also to-see Rome.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And having-sent into [the] Macedonia two of-the-ones ministering to-him, Timothy and Epaphras, <u>he</u> spent time in [the] Asia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And at [the] time no little disturbance came-to-be concerning The Way. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>For a-certain Demetrius by-name, (a) silversmith making silver shrines of-Artemis/Diana, was-bringing to-the artisans no little business, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>whom having-gathered-together even/also the-workers concerning [the] such-things, said, <em>“Men, you-know that from this [the] trade [the] prosperity is to-us; </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>and you-observe and hear that not only of-Ephesus, but nearly all [the] Asia [the] this Paul, having-persuaded, led-away/misled (a) significant people, saying that gods are not the-ones becoming/being-made by hands.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And not only is┘this </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> trade└in-danger to/for us to-come into disrepute, but also the temple of-the great goddess Artemis/Diana to-be-regarded into nothing and to-be dethroned-from the greatness of-her whom the whole-of Asia and the world worships.</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And having-heard and having-come-to-be full of-rage, they-began to-shout, saying, <em>“Great (is) Artemis/Diana of-(the)-Ephesians.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And the city was-filled with-[the] confusion, and they-rushed together into the theater, having-dragged Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, companions of-Paul. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And Paul desiring to-enter into the theater, the disciples were┘not└allowing him; <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>and some also of-the Asiarchs, being friends to-him, having-sent to-him, were-urging (him) not to-give himself into the theater. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Then they-were-shouting one-thing-and-another<sup>2</sup>, for the gathering was stirred-up; and the more did┘not└know for-the-sake-of what they-had-come-together. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And out-of the crowd they-concluded (that it was) Alexander, the Jews having-put┘him└forward. And [the] Alexander, having-signaled-with the/his hand, was-wanting to-make-a-defense to-the people/populace. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But having-come-to-realize that he-was (a) Jew, one voice arose out-of all for about two hours shouting<em>, </em> <em>“Great (is) Artemis/Diana of-(the)-Ephesians.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And the town-clerk, having-quieted the crowd, says, <em>“Ephesian men, for who is (the) man that does┘not└know the city of-(the)-Ephesians being</em><em>/is</em><em> guardian/temple-keeper of-the great Artemis/Diana and Zeus/Jupiter-Fallen-from-Heaven.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Thes</em><em>e</em><em>-things</em><em> being undeniable</em><em>,</em><em> it-is-necessary for-us to-be calm and to-do nothing rash.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>For you brought [the] these men neither (as)</em><em> temple-robbers nor blaspheming</em><em> the goddess of-us.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Therefore</em><em> </em><em>if Demetrius and the artisans with </em><em>him have (a) matter against anybody, courts are-in-session and proconsuls </em><em>are,.</em><em> </em><em>Let-them-bring-charges-against</em><em> </em><em>one-another</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>And if </em><em>you-seek</em><em> more, it-will-be-settled in [the] lawful assembly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>For we┘also└are-in-danger to-be-accused of-(a)-riot concerning the day, no cause being concerning which we-will┘not└be-able to-account-for (the) matter concerning [the] this uproar.”</em><em> </em> And having-said these-things, he-dismissed the assembly.</span>
