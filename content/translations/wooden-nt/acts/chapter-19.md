## Acts Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in [the] Apollos' being in [the] Corinth (that) Paul, having-gone through the inland/higher parts, came-down to Ephesus and found some disciples, 2and said to them [whether]. "Did you-receive (the) Holy Spirit having-believed?" And the-ones/they (said) to him, "[But] we-did┘not└know (the) Holy Spirit was/was-(given)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he-said, "Into what then were–you-baptized?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And Paul said, "John baptized (a) baptism of-repentance, saying to-the people [in-order]-that they-might-believe in the-One coming after him," that is, in [the] Jesus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-heard, they-were-baptized into the name of-the Lord Jesus. 6And Paul, having-laid┘[the]ms hands└on them, the Holy [the] Spirit came on them, and they-began-to-speak with-languages and began-to-prophesy 7And all the men were about twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-gone into the synagogue and was-persuading (them) [with-respect-to-the-things]ms concerning the kingdom of-[the] God. 9Now when some began-to-be-resistant and started-disbelieving, speaking-evil-of The Way before the multitude/group, having-withdrawn from them, he-separated the disciples, according-to-[the] day2/daily2reasoning in the School of Tyrannus. 10And this happened for two years, so-that all the-ones dwelling-in [the] Asia heard the word of-the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And [the] God was-doing miracles not the-ones normally-experienced through the hands of-Paul, 12so-that even handkerchiefs or aprons were-being-carried from the-surface-of┘his└body to the-ones being-sick and the diseases left from them and [the] evil [the] spirits went-out. 13And some also of the circulating Jews went-from place-to-place, putting-under oath, tried-to-name on the-ones having the/# evil [the] spirits the name of-the Lord Jesus, saying, "I-adjure you with-respect-to-[the] Jesus whom Paul is-preaching." 14And seven-sons of-(a)-certain Sceva, (a) Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 15And the evil [the] spirit, having-answered, said to-them, "I-recognize [the] Jesus and I-know [the] Paul, but who are you?" 16And the man in whom the evil [the] spirit was, jumping on them, having-overpowered both, was-strong against them so-that (they) fled out-of [the] that house naked and traumatized. 17And this-thing became known to all, both Jews and Greeks the-ones dwelling-in [the] Ephesus, and fear fell on them all; and the name of-the Lord Jesus was-being-magnified. 18And many of-the-ones having-believed started-coming, confessing and declaring the deeds of-them. 19And (a) significant-number of-the-ones having-practiced [the] black-magic/magical-arts, having-brought the/their books, were-burning (them) before all, and they-added the value of-them and they-found fifty thousand pieces-of-silver. 20The word of-the Lord was-growing so mightily2 and was-growing-strong</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And when these-things were-fulfilled, [the] Paul intended in [the] spirit, having-passed-through Macedonia and Achaia, to-travel to Jerusalem, having-said [that], "After [the] my coming-to-be there, it-is-necessary also to-see Rome." 22And having-sent into [the] Macedonia two of-the-ones ministering to-him, Timothy and Epaphras, he spent time in [the] Asia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And at [the] time no little disturbance came-to-be concerning The Way. 24For a-certain Demetrius by-name, (a) silversmith making silver shrines of-Artemis/Diana, was-bringing to-the artisans no little business, 25whom having-gathered-together even/also the-workers concerning [the] such-things, said, "Men, you-know that from this [the] trade [the] prosperity is to-us; 26and you-observe and hear that not only of-Ephesus, but nearly all [the] Asia [the] this Paul, having-persuaded, led-away/misled (a) significant people, saying that gods are not the-ones becoming/being-made by hands. 27And not only is┘this [the] trade└in-danger to/for us to-come into disrepute, but also the temple of-the great goddess Artemis/Diana to-be-regarded into nothing and to-be dethroned-from the greatness of-her whom the whole-of Asia and the world worships."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And having-heard and having-come-to-be full of-rage, they-began to-shout, saying, "Great (is) Artemis/Diana of-(the)-Ephesians." 29And the city was-filled with-[the] confusion, and they-rushed together into the theater, having-dragged Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, companions of-Paul. 30And Paul desiring to-enter into the theater, the disciples were┘not└allowing him; 31and some also of-the Asiarchs, being friends to-him, having-sent to-him, were-urging (him) not to-give himself into the theater. 32Then they-were-shouting one-thing-and-another2, for the gathering was stirred-up; and the more did┘not└know for-the-sake-of what they-had-come-together. 33And out-of the crowd they-concluded (that it was) Alexander, the Jews having-put┘him└forward. And [the] Alexander, having-signaled-with the/his hand, was-wanting to-make-a-defense to-the people/populace. 34But having-come-to-realize that he-was (a) Jew, one voice arose out-of all for about two hours shouting,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And the town-clerk, having-quieted the crowd, says, "Ephesian men, for who is (the) man that does┘not└know the city of-(the)-Ephesians being/is guardian/temple-keeper of-the great Artemis/Diana and Zeus/Jupiter-Fallen-from-Heaven. 36These-things being undeniable, it-is-necessary for-us to-be calm and to-do nothing rash. 37For you brought [the] these men neither (as) temple-robbers nor blaspheming the goddess of-us. 38Therefore if Demetrius and the artisans with him have (a) matter against anybody, courts are-in-session and proconsuls are,. Let-them-bring-charges-against one-another. 39And if you-seek more, it-will-be-settled in [the] lawful assembly. 40For we┘also└are-in-danger to-be-accused of-(a)-riot concerning the day, no cause being concerning which we-will┘not└be-able to-account-for (the) matter concerning [the] this uproar."</span>
