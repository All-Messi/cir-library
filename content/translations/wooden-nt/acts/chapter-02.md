## Acts Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And in the day of-[the] Pentecost [the] being-fulfilled, they-were all together in the same (place). 2And suddenly out-of [the] heaven came (a) roar like (a) rushing strong wind, and it-filled the whole house where they-were sitting. 3And tongues appeared like fire distributed to-them, and it-sat on each one of-them; 4and they┘all└were-filled with–(the)-Holy Spirit, and began to-speak in-other languages as the Spirit was-giving to-them to-speak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And Jews were-dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation of-the-ones under the sky. 6And [the] this sound having-happened, the multitude assembled and was-bewildered, because they┘each one└were-hearing them speaking in-[the] his-own language. 7And they-were-amazed and marveled, saying, "Behold, are┘not└all these [the] speaking Galileans? 8And how are┘we└hearing each-one in-[the] his-own language of-us in which we-were-born?—9Parthians and Medes and Elamites and the-ones dwelling-in Mesopotamia, both Judaea and Cappadocia, 10both Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of-[the] Libya [the] according-to Cyrene, and [the] sojourning Romans, 11both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs, we-hear them speaking in-[the] our languages the mighty-deeds of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And all were-amazed and kept-wondering, saying one to another, "What does┘this└desire to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And others, mocking, started-saying [that], "They-are filled with-new-wine."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Peter, having-stood-up with the eleven, lifted-up the voice of-him and spoke to-them, "Men Jews and the-ones dwelling-in Jerusalem, let┘this└be known to-you and pay-close-attention-to the words of-me. 15For these are┘not└drunk-on-new-wine as you imagine, for it-is (the) third hour of-the day. 16But this is the-thing spoken through the prophet Joel:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And on the man-servants of-me and on the maid-</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And I-will-give wonders in the sky above</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The sun will-be-turned into darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And it-will-be everybody who2 calls-on the name 22"Men Jerusalemites, listen-to [the] these words. Jesus the Nazarene, (a) man approved by [the] God among you by-miracles and wonders and signs that [the] God did through him in (the) midst of-you, even-as you┘yourselves└know—23this-One delivered-up by-the pre-determined plan and foreknowledge of-[the] God through (the) hand of-lawless-ones, having-nailed-to-(a)-cross, you-killed, 24whom [the] God raised-up, having-loosed the pains of-[the] death because his being-held by it was not possible. 25For David says in-regard-to him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> On-account-of this the heart of-me was-glad,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You-made-known to-me (the) ways of-life; 29"Men brothers, it-is-permitted to-speak to you with boldness about the patriarch David that he┘both└died and was-buried and the grave of-him is among us until [the] this day. 30Therefore being (a) prophet, and having-seen that [the] God definitely swore to-him from (the) fruit of-the loins of-him (One) to-sit on the throne of-him—31foreseeing, he-spoke about the resurrection of-the Messiah that</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> This [the] Jesus [the] God raised-up, of-whom we all are witnesses. 33So having-been-exalted to-the right (hand) of-[the] God and having-received from the Father the promise of-the Holy [the] Spirit, he-poured-out this that we [both]ms see and hear. 34For David did┘not└ascend into [the] heaven, but he-says himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> So let┘all (the) house of-Israel└know assuredly that [the] God made him both Lord and Christ—this [the] Jesus whom you crucified."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And having-heard, they-were-stabbed-in the heart, and said to [the] Peter and the rest-of-the apostles, "What shall-we-do, men brothers?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But Peter [says]ms to them, "Repent and let┘each of-you└be-baptized in the name of-Jesus Christ for remission of-the sins of-you and you-will-receive the gift of-the Holy Spirit. 39For the promise is to-you and the children of-you and to-all the-ones to-afar, as-many-as (the) Lord the god of-you will call."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And with-many other words he-testified and kept-encouraging, saying, "Be-saved from [the] this [the] perverse generation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> So the-ones having-received the word of-him were-baptized, and about three-thousand souls on [the] that day were-being-added-together. 42And they-were devoting-themselves to-the teaching of-the apostles and [the] fellowship, the breaking of-[the] bread and [the] prayers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And fear came on-every soul, and many wonders and signs were-occurring through the apostles. 44And all the believing-ones were together3 and kept-having all-things in-common; 45and they-began-selling the/their properties and [the] possessions, and they-were-sharing them with-all as-many-as2 anybody was-having need. 46And according-to (the) day/every day devoting-themselves together in the temple, and breaking bread according-to (the) house/from house to house/in homes, they-were-receiving food together in joy and humility of-heart, 47praising [the] God and having favor with the whole people. And [the] Lord was-adding together3 the-ones being-saved according-to-(the) day/every day.</span>
