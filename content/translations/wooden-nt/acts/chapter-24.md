<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And after five days the high-priest Ananias went-down with some elders and a-certain orator, Tertullus, whopl brought-charges to-the governor against [the] Paul. 2And he, having-been-called, [the] Tertullus began to-accuse, saying, "Obtaining much peace through you and reforms having-occurred to-[the] this nation on-account-of [the] your foresight, 3both in-every (way) and everywhere we-acknowledge, most-excellent Felix, with all gratefulness. 4But in-order-that I-might┘not└weary you more, I-urge you by-[the] your kindness to-listening briefly. 5For having-found [the] this man (a) trouble-maker and stirring-up dissension with-all the Jews [the] according-to the world and (a) leader of-the sect of-the Nazarenes, who even/also tried to-defile/desecrate the temple, 6awhom we┘also└arrested, [6b-8a]ms 8b from whom you┘also└will-be-able, having-examined about all these-things, to-know of-what-things we are-accusing him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the Jews also joined-in-the-attack, claiming these-things thus to-obtain/be.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And [the] Paul answered, the governor having-nodded to-him to-speak, "Knowing that during many years (that) you being (a) judge for-[the] this nation, I┘cheerfully└defend-myself with-respect-the-things concerning myself, 11you being-able to-know that not over twelve days are to-me from which I-went-up to Jerusalem for-worshiping. 12And neither in the temple did-they-find me debating with anybody or making (an) attack of-people in the synagogues nor against the city, 13neither are-they-able to-prove to-you concerning whom now they-accuse me. 14And I-confess this to-you according-to The Way that they-call (a) heresy, thus I-serve the fathers' God, believing all the-things according-to the Law and to-things having-been-written in the prophets, 15having hope, in [the] God which these also themselves expect, (that) resurrection will be both of-(the)-just and of-(the)-unjust. 16In this I┘also myself└do-my-best to-have (an) inoffensive conscience before [the] God and [the] men through everything. 17And through many years I-came to-give alms to the nation of-me and offerings, 18in which they-found me sanctified in the temple not with (a) crowd nor with uproar, 19but some Jews from [the] Asia, who it-was-necessary to-be-present before you and to-make-accusation they-should-have anything against me; 20or let┘these themselves└say what injustice they-found, my standing before the Sanhedrin; 21or concerning this one voice which I-shouted-out among them, standing [that], 'Concerning (the) resurrection of-(the) dead, I am-being-judged today before you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But [the] Felix put┘them└off, knowing more-exactly the-things concerning The Way, having-said, "When Lysias the tribune/chiliarchs comes-down, I-will-decide the-things according-to you; 23having-given-orders to-the centurion (that) both he have freedom and to-prevent nothing of-[the] his-own-ones of-him to-minister to-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And after some days [the] Felix, arriving with Drusilla [the] his wife, being (a) Jewess, summoned [the] Paul and listened-to him about [the] faith in Christ Jesus. 25And he discussing [about] righteousness and self-control and [the] judgment [the] coming, having-become fearful, [the] Felix answered, "Go for-the having/present, and having-taken opportunity, I-will-summon you," 26at-the-same-time hoping (that) money would-be-given to-him by [the] Paul. Wherefore also more-frequently summoning him, he-would-converse-with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But two-years having-been-fulfilled, [the] Felix received (his) successor Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with-the Jews, [the] Felix left┘[the] Paul└behind having-been-bound.</span>
