## Acts Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And after five days the high-priest Ananias went-down with some elders and a-certain orator, Tertullus, who<sup>pl</sup> brought-charges to-the governor against [the] Paul. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And he, having-been-called, [the] Tertullus began to-accuse, saying, <em>	“Obtaining much peace through you and reforms having-occurred to-[the] this nation on-account-of [the] your foresight, </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>both in-every (way) and everywhere we-acknowledge, most-excellent Felix, with all gratefulness.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But in-order-that I-might┘not└weary you more, I-urge you by-[the] your kindness to-</em><em>listening</em><em> briefly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>For having-found [the] this man (a) trouble-maker and stirring-up dissension with-all the Jews [the] according-to the world and (a) leader of-the sect of-the Nazarenes, who even/also tried to-defile/desecrate the temple, </em><strong><sup>6a</sup></strong><em>whom we┘also└arrested, [</em><strong><sup>6b-8a</sup></strong><em>]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> </em><strong><sup>8b</sup></strong><em> from whom you┘also└will-be-able, having-examined about all these-things, to-know of-what-things </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> are-accusing him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And the Jews also joined-in-the-attack, claiming these-things thus to-obtain/be.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And [the] Paul answered, the governor having-nodded to-him to-speak, <em>	“Knowing that during many years (that) you </em><em>being</em><em> (a) judge for-[the] this nation, I┘cheerfully└defend-myself with-respect-the-things concerning myself, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>you being-able to-know that not over twelve days are to-me from which I-went-up to Jerusalem for-worshiping.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And neither in the temple did-they-find me debating with anybody or making (an) attack of-people in the synagogues nor against the city, </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>neither are-they-able to-prove to-you concerning whom now </em><em>they-accuse me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And I-confess this to-you according-to The Way that they-call (a) heresy, thus I-serve the fathers’ God, believing all the-things according-to the </em><em>L</em><em>aw and to-things having-been-written in the prophets, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>having hope, in [the] God which these also themselves expect, (that) resurrection will be both of-(the)-just and of-(the)-unjust.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>In this I┘also myself└d</em><em>o-my-best to-have (an) inoffensive</em><em> conscience before [the] God and [the] men through everything.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And through many years I-came to-give alms to</em><em> the nation of-me and offerings, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>in which they-found me sanctified in the temple not with (a) crowd nor with uproar, </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>but some Jews from [the] Asia, who it-was-necessary to-be-present before you and to-make-accusation they-should-have anything against me; </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>or let┘these themselves└say what injustice they-found, my standing before the Sanhedrin; </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>or concerning this one voice which I-shouted-out among them, standing [that], ‘Concerning (the) resurrection of-(the) dead, </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am-being-judged today before you.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But [the] Felix put┘them└off, knowing more-exactly the-things concerning The Way, having-said, <em>“When Lysias the tribune/chiliarchs comes-down, I-will-decide the-things according-to you; </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>having-given-orders to-the centurion (that) both he have freedom and to-prevent nothing of-</em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> his-own-ones of-him to-minister to-him.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And after some days [the] Felix, arriving with Drusilla [the] his wife, being (a) Jewess, summoned [the] Paul and listened-to him about [the] faith in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And he discussing [about] righteousness and self-control and [the] judgment [the] coming, having-become fearful, [the] Felix answered, <em>“Go for-the having/present, and having-taken opportunity, I-will-summon you,” </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong>at-the-same-time hoping (that) money would-be-given to-him by [the] Paul. Wherefore also more-frequently summoning him, he-would-converse-with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But two-years having-been-fulfilled, [the] Felix received (his) successor Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with-the Jews, [the] Felix left┘[the] Paul└behind having-been-bound.</span>
