## Acts Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And after the uproar [the] having-ceased, [the] Paul, having-summoned the disciples and having-encouraged (them), and having-said-goodbye, went-out to-travel to Macedonia. 2And having-gone-through [the] those parts and having-encouraged them by-much word, he-came into [the] Greece; 3and having-spent three months, (a) plot happening to-him by the Jews, about to-sail to-[the] Syria, (a) purpose came-to-be [the] for-returning through Macedonia. 4But Sopater, [son] of-Pyrrhus, (a) Berean, followed-with him, and Aristarchus and Secundus of-(the)-Thessalonians and Gaius the Derbeite, and Timothy, and Asians Tychicus and Trophimus. 5And these, having-gone-ahead, were-remaining-for us in Troas; 6but we sailed from Philippi with the days of-[the] Unleavened (Bread), and we-came to them in [the] Troas within five days, where we-tarried for-seven days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And on the one (day) of-the week, we assembling to-break bread, [the] Paul began-discoursing to-them, intending to-leave on-the next-day, and extended the/his message until midnight. 8There were sufficient lamps in the upper-room where we-were assembled. 9And a-certain young-man, Eutychus by-name, sitting on the window, being-borne-down by-deep sleep, [the] Paul discoursing for a-long-(time), having-been-overtaken by [the] sleep, fell down from the third-floor and was-taken-up dead. 10And [the] Paul, having-gone-down, fell-on him and having-embraced (him), said, "Do┘not└worry, for the life of-him is in him." 11And having-gone-up and having-broken [the] bread and having-tasted/eaten and having-talked for (a)-sufficient-(time) until dawn, he-went-away thus. 12And they-brought the child alive and were-comforted not by-measure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now we, having-gone-forward/ahead on the ship, sailed to [the] Assos from-there intending to-pick-up [the] Paul, for thus he-had arranged, intending himself to-travel-by-land/on-fit. 14And when he-met us at [the] Assos, taking┘him└aboard, we-came to Mitylene; 15and-from-there having-sailed-away, on-the next-day we-arrived opposite of-Chios, and on-the other/next we-crossed over to Samos, and the following-(day) we-came to Miletus. 16For [the] Paul had-determined to-sail-past [the] Ephesus, in-order-that it-might┘not└be to-him to-spend-time in [the] Asia, for he-was-hurrying, if it-would-be possible for-him to-get to Jerusalem the day of-[the] Pentecost.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And from [the] Miletus, having-sent to Ephesus, he-summoned the elders of-the church. 18And when they-came to-him, he-said to-them, "You know, from (the) first day from which I-came/set-foot in [the] Asia how I-was with you the whole time, 19serving the Lord with all humility and tears and trials the-one having-come-with/on me in the plots of-the Jews, 20as I-did┘not└shrink [not] [the] to-report/tell to-you the-things profitable with-respect-to-anything; and to-teach you publicly and from-house-to-house2, 21thoroughly-testifying both to-Jews and to-Greeks [the] repentance toward God and faith in the Lord of-us Jesus. 22And now, behold, I, having-been-bound in-[the] spirit, am traveling to Jerusalem, not knowing the-things that-will-happen to-me in it, 23except that the Holy Spirit testifies to-me in-every-city2/from-city-to-city, saying that bonds and afflictions are-remaining-for me. 24But I-make the life of-no account as-valuable to myself while to-complete the course of-me and the ministry that I-received from the Lord Jesus, to-thoroughly-testify the gospel of-the grace of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And now I know that no-longer will-you┘all└see the face of-me among whom I-went-around preaching the kingdom. 26Wherefore I-testify to-you in the day today that I-am pure from the blood of-all (men). 27For I-did┘not└shrink-from [the] reporting to-you all the plan of-[the] God for-you. 28Watch yourselves and all the flock in which the Holy Spirit appointed you overseers/bishops to-tend the church of-[the] God, which he-bought by the his-own [the] blood. 29For I know that savage wolves will-enter into you after the departure of-me, not sparing the flock, 30and out-of you yourselves will-rise-up men saying perverted-things [the] to-draw-away [the] disciples after them. 31Wherefore be alert, remembering that for-three-years/for-a-three-year-period night and day, I-did┘not└cease with tears admonishing each one. 32And the-things now I-am-entrusting you to-[the] God and to-the word of-the grace of-him, to-the-One being-able to-build-(you)-up and to-give (you) the inheritance among all the sanctified. 33I-coveted (the) silver or gold or clothes of-nobody. 34You┘yourselves└know that to-the needs of-me and the-ones being with-me [the] these hands ministered. 35With-respect-to-all-things I-showed you that thus laboring, it-is-necessary to-help the-ones being-weak, and to remember the words of-the Lord Jesus that he┘himself└said, "It-is more blessed to-give than to receive.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And having-said these-things, having-put the knees of-him with them all, he-prayed; 37and sufficient strong-weeping of-all happened and having-fallen on the neck of-[the] Paul, they-began-to-kiss┘him└repeatedly, 38grieving/suffering-pain most-of-all at the word which he-had-said that they-would no-longer see the face of-him, and they-were-sending-forward-with him to the ship.</span>
