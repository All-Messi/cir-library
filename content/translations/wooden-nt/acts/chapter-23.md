## Acts Chapter **23**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And [the] Paul, having-looked-intently/straight at-the Sanhedrin, said, <em>“Men brothers, in-all good conscience I-have-conducted-my-life toward-[the] God until this [the] day.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>And the high-priest Ananias commanded the-ones standing-by him to-slap the mouth of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Then [the] Paul said to him, <em>“[The] God will slap you, whitewashed wall!</em><em> </em><em>And you sit judging me according-to the </em><em>L</em><em>aw, and acting-contrary-to-the-</em><em>L</em><em>aw command me to-be-slapped?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And the-one standing-by said, <em>“Are-you-insulting the high-priest of-[the] God?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And [the] Paul said, <em>“I-did</em><em>┘not└</em><em>know that he-was (a) high-priest; for it-has-been-written [that], </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>You-shall┘not└speak</em></strong><strong><em> evil with-respect-to-(a)-ruler of-the people of-you.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But [the] Paul, having-known that the one part was of Sadducees and the other of-Pharisees, began-to-shout in the Sanhedrin, <em>“Men brothers, </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am (a) Pharisee, (the) son of-Pharisees; concerning (the) hope and resurrection of-(the)-dead </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am-being-judged.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>And having said this, (the) sect of-the Pharisees and of (the) Sadducees became (a) dispute, and the multitude was divided. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For Sadducees say resurrection not to-be, neither angel or spirit, but Pharisees confess [the] both. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And (a) great uproar arose and some of-the scribes of-the part of-the Pharisees, having-risen-up, began-to-argue-heatedly/strongly, saying, <em>“We-find nothing bad in [the] this man.</em><em> </em><em>And if (a) spirit or angel spoke to-him </em><em>. . . ?</em><em><sup>”</sup></em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And (a) great dissension arising, the tribune/chiliarch, having-feared lest [the] Paul would-be-torn-in-piece by them, commanded the troops, having-gone-down, to-seize him out-of (the) midst of-them and to-bring (him) into the barracks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And in-the next night, the Lord, having-stood-by him, said, “<em>Take-courage, for as you-are-testifying the-things concerning me in Jerusalem, so also it-is-necessary-for you to-testify in Rome.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And day having-come, the Jews, having-made (a) plot, bound┘themselves└under-(an)-oath, saying neither to-eat or to-drink until<sup>2</sup> they-killed [the] Paul. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And more than forty were the-ones making this [the] conspiracy-under-oath, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>who, having-gone-to the high-priests and the elders, said<em>, </em> <em>“We have</em><em>┘certainly└bound┘ourselves└under-(an)-oath to-taste nothing until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> we-kill [the] Paul.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Now then you with the Sanhedrin inform the tribune/chiliarch in-order-that he-might-bring┘him└down to you as-if intending to-examine more-accurately the-things about him, and </em><em><u>we</u></em><em>, before </em><em>[the] his</em><em> coming, are prepared [the] to-kill him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And the son of-the sister of-Paul, having-heard/overheard-about the ambush, having-come and having-entered into the barracks, told Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>And [the] Paul, having-summoned one of-the centurions, said, <em>“Lead this [the] young-man to the tribune/chiliarch, for he-has something to-report to-him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The the-one/he taking-(him)-along, led him to the tribune/chiliarch, and says, <em>“The prisoner Paul, having-summoned me, asked (me) to-lead this [the] young-man to-you, having something to-say to-you.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>And the tribune/chiliarch, having-taken-(him)-by the hand of-him, and having-withdrawn/stepped-aside privately<sup>2</sup>, said, <em>“What is-it that you-have to-report to-me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And he-said [that], <em>“The Jews are agreed [the] to-ask you [in-order]-that tomorrow you-might-bring┘Paul└down into the Sanhedrin as-if they-intend to-ask something more-exactly about him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Therefore do┘not└be-persuaded by-them, for over forty men of-them are-lying-in-ambush-for him, who bound┘themselves└under-(an)-oath neither to-eat nor to-drink until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> they-kill him.</em><em> </em><em>Even now they-</em><em>a</em><em>re ready</em><em>,</em><em> waiting-for the promise from you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then the tribune/chiliarch dismissed the young-man, having-instructed (him) to-speak-out to-nobody [that], <em>“T</em><em>hese-things you revealed to-me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-summoned [a-certain]<sup>ms</sup> two of-the centurions, he-said, <em>“Prepare two-hundred soldiers in-order-that they-might</em><em>-to as-far-as Caesarea and seventy horsemen and two hundred bowmen/spearmen by (the) third hour of-the night, and </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>to-provide pack-animals in-order-that, having-mounted [the] Paul, they-might-bring┘him└safely-through to Felix the governor.” </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong>having-written (a) letter having [the] this form:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Claudius Lysias to-the most-excellent governor Felix.</em><em> </em><em>Greeting</em><em>.</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>[The] this man, having-been-arrested by the Jews and about to-be-killed by them, having-come-upon (them) with [the] troops, I-rescued, having-learned that he-was (a) Roman.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>And wanting </em><em>to-come-to-know</em><em> the reason on-account-of which they-were-accusing him, I-brought┘him└down into the Sanhedrin of-them, </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>whom I-found being-accused about questions of-the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-</em><em>them, but</em><em> having no accusation worthy of-death or bonds.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>And (a) plot having-been-disclosed to-me to-be against the man, immediately I-sent to you, also having-instructed the accusers to-tell to-you the-things against him.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then the soldiers, according-to the-thing ordered to-them, having-picked-up [the] Paul, brought (him) during the night to [the] Antipatris, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>and on-the next-day, having-left the horsemen to-proceed with him, returned to the barracks, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>who, having-entered into [the] Caesarea and delivering the letter to-the governor, also presented [the] Paul to-him. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And having-read (it) and having-asked from what province he-was, and having-learned that (he was) from Cilicia, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>I-will-give</em><em>┘you└ </em><em>(a)-hearing,”</em> he-said, <em>“when the accusers of-you are present,” </em>having-commanded him to-be-kept in the Praetorium of-[the] Herod.</span>
