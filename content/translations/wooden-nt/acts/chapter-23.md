## Acts Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And [the] Paul, having-looked-intently/straight at-the Sanhedrin, said, "Men brothers, in-all good conscience I-have-conducted-my-life toward-[the] God until this [the] day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And the high-priest Ananias commanded the-ones standing-by him to-slap the mouth of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then [the] Paul said to him, "[The] God will slap you, whitewashed wall! And you sit judging me according-to the Law, and acting-contrary-to-the-Law command me to-be-slapped?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the-one standing-by said, "Are-you-insulting the high-priest of-[the] God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And [the] Paul said, "I-did┘not└know that he-was (a) high-priest; for it-has-been-written [that], 'You-shall┘not└speak evil with-respect-to-(a)-ruler of-the people of-you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But [the] Paul, having-known that the one part was of Sadducees and the other of-Pharisees, began-to-shout in the Sanhedrin, "Men brothers, I am (a) Pharisee, (the) son of-Pharisees; concerning (the) hope and resurrection of-(the)-dead I am-being-judged."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And having said this, (the) sect of-the Pharisees and of (the) Sadducees became (a) dispute, and the multitude was divided. 8For Sadducees say resurrection not to-be, neither angel or spirit, but Pharisees confess [the] both. 9And (a) great uproar arose and some of-the scribes of-the part of-the Pharisees, having-risen-up, began-to-argue-heatedly/strongly, saying, "We-find nothing bad in [the] this man. And if (a) spirit or angel spoke to-him . . . ?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And (a) great dissension arising, the tribune/chiliarch, having-feared lest [the] Paul would-be-torn-in-piece by them, commanded the troops, having-gone-down, to-seize him out-of (the) midst of-them and to-bring (him) into the barracks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And in-the next night, the Lord, having-stood-by him, said, "Take-courage, for as you-are-testifying the-things concerning me in Jerusalem, so also it-is-necessary-for you to-testify in Rome."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And day having-come, the Jews, having-made (a) plot, bound┘themselves└under-(an)-oath, saying neither to-eat or to-drink until2 they-killed [the] Paul. 13And more than forty were the-ones making this [the] conspiracy-under-oath, 14who, having-gone-to the high-priests and the elders, said, "We have┘certainly└bound┘ourselves└under-(an)-oath to-taste nothing until2 we-kill [the] Paul. 15Now then you with the Sanhedrin inform the tribune/chiliarch in-order-that he-might-bring┘him└down to you as-if intending to-examine more-accurately the-things about him, and we, before [the] his coming, are prepared [the] to-kill him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the son of-the sister of-Paul, having-heard/overheard-about the ambush, having-come and having-entered into the barracks, told Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] Paul, having-summoned one of-the centurions, said, "Lead this [the] young-man to the tribune/chiliarch, for he-has something to-report to-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The the-one/he taking-(him)-along, led him to the tribune/chiliarch, and says, "The prisoner Paul, having-summoned me, asked (me) to-lead this [the] young-man to-you, having something to-say to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the tribune/chiliarch, having-taken-(him)-by the hand of-him, and having-withdrawn/stepped-aside privately2, said, "What is-it that you-have to-report to-me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-said [that], "The Jews are agreed [the] to-ask you [in-order]-that tomorrow you-might-bring┘Paul└down into the Sanhedrin as-if they-intend to-ask something more-exactly about him. 21Therefore do┘not└be-persuaded by-them, for over forty men of-them are-lying-in-ambush-for him, who bound┘themselves└under-(an)-oath neither to-eat nor to-drink until2 they-kill him. Even now they-are ready, waiting-for the promise from you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the tribune/chiliarch dismissed the young-man, having-instructed (him) to-speak-out to-nobody [that], "These-things you revealed to-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And having-summoned [a-certain]ms two of-the centurions, he-said, "Prepare two-hundred soldiers in-order-that they-might-to as-far-as Caesarea and seventy horsemen and two hundred bowmen/spearmen by (the) third hour of-the night, and 24to-provide pack-animals in-order-that, having-mounted [the] Paul, they-might-bring┘him└safely-through to Felix the governor." 25having-written (a) letter having [the] this form:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Claudius Lysias to-the most-excellent governor Felix. Greeting. 27[The] this man, having-been-arrested by the Jews and about to-be-killed by them, having-come-upon (them) with [the] troops, I-rescued, having-learned that he-was (a) Roman. 28And wanting to-come-to-know the reason on-account-of which they-were-accusing him, I-brought┘him└down into the Sanhedrin of-them, 29whom I-found being-accused about questions of-the Law of-them, but having no accusation worthy of-death or bonds. 30And (a) plot having-been-disclosed to-me to-be against the man, immediately I-sent to you, also having-instructed the accusers to-tell to-you the-things against him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then the soldiers, according-to the-thing ordered to-them, having-picked-up [the] Paul, brought (him) during the night to [the] Antipatris, 32and on-the next-day, having-left the horsemen to-proceed with him, returned to the barracks, 33who, having-entered into [the] Caesarea and delivering the letter to-the governor, also presented [the] Paul to-him. 34And having-read (it) and having-asked from what province he-was, and having-learned that (he was) from Cilicia, 35"I-will-give┘you└ (a)-hearing," he-said, "when the accusers of-you are present," having-commanded him to-be-kept in the Praetorium of-[the] Herod.</span>
