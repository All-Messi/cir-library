## Acts Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And Saul was agreeing-with [the] putting┘him└to-death. And (a) great persecution happened at that [the] time against the church [the] in Jerusalem, and all were-scattered according-to the regions of-[the] Judaea and Samaria except the apostles. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And devout men buried Stephen and made great mourning over him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But Saul was-destroying the church, entering every [the] house<sup>2</sup>/according-to the house<sup>2</sup>, and dragging men and women, he-was-putting (them) in prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> So the-ones having-been-scattered went-through preaching-the message. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And Philip, going-down to [the]<sup>ms</sup> city of-[the] Samaria, started-preaching [the] Christ to-them. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the crowds together were-paying-close-attention to-the-things being-spoken by [the] Philip in their [the] hearing and seeing the signs that he-was-doing. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For many of-the-ones having unclean spirits were-coming-out crying-out with (a) loud voice, and many paralyzed-ones and lame-ones were-healed. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And much joy came in [the] that city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And a-certain man, Simon by-name, was-previously practicing magic in the city and amazing the nation of-the Samaritans, saying himself to-be somebody great; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>to-whom all were-paying-close-attention from small to great, saying, <em>“This is the power of-[God] [the] called ‘Great.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And they-were-paying-close-attention to-him on-account-of [the] having-amazed them for-(a)-long time with magical-arts. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And when they-believed the Philip preaching about the kingdom of-[the] God and the name of-Jesus Christ, both men and women were-being-baptized. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And [the] Simon also himself believed; and, having-been-baptized, he-was-continuing-with [the] Philip; and seeing both signs and great miracles occurring, he-was-amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the apostles in Jerusalem, having-heard [the] Samaritans has/had-received the word of-[the] God, sent to them Peter and John, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>who having-come-down, prayed about them in-order-that they-might-receive (the) Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For not-yet he-was fallen on none/any of-them, but they-were only baptized in the name of-the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then they-laid [the] hands on them, and they-were-receiving (the) Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now [the] Simon, having-seen that through the laying-on of-the hands of-the apostles the Spirit has/had-been-given, he-offered them money, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Give also-to-me [the] this authority in-order-that whomever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-lay┘[the] hands└on, he-will-receive (the) Holy Spirit.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And Peter said to him, <em>“May the silver of-you be unto destruction with you because you-thought to-obtain the gift of-[the] God through money[s].</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Not to-you </em><em>is</em><em> (a) part or lot in [the] this matter, for the heart of-you </em><em>is</em><em> not straight before [the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>So </em><em>repent from</em><em> [the] this evil of-you and pray to the Lord if perhaps the intent of-the heart of-you will-be-forgiven.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>For I-see you </em><em>being</em><em> in (the) gall of-bitterness and (the) bondage of-iniquity/injustice.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And [the] Simon, having-answered, said, <em>“You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> pray on-behalf-of me to the Lord in-order-that nothing of-which-things you-have-said may-come on me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then the-ones/they, having-thoroughly-testified and having-spoken the word of-the Lord, started-back to Jerusalem, and were-evangelizing many villages of-the Samaritans.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And (an) angel of-(the) Lord spoke to Philip, saying, <em>“Get-up and go down toward-the-south on </em><em>the way [the] going-down from </em> <em>Jerusalem to Gaza; this is desert.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And having-arisen, he-went and (a) man (an) Ethiopian, (a) eunuch, (an) official of-Candace, queen of-(the)-Ethiopians, who was over all the treasury of-her, who had-come to-worship in Jerusalem, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>who also returning a sitting on the chariot of-him and he-was-reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And the Spirit said to-Philip, <em>“G</em><em>o</em><em>-forward and join-yourself to-[the] this chariot.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the Philip, having-run, heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, <em>“Do-you-know what-things you-are-reading?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the/he said, <em>“For how would I-be-able unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> somebody leads me?”</em> And he-invited [the] Philip, having-stepped-up, to-sit with him. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And the passage of-[the] scripture that he-was-reading was this, 	<strong><em>“Like (a) sheep he-was</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong><strong><em>led to (the) s</em></strong><strong><em>laughter,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd like (a) lamb before the/a shearing-one (is) dumb,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>o</em></strong><strong><em> he is┘not└opening the mouth of-him.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> <strong><em>In the humiliation of-him the judgment of-him was-taken away.</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Who will report the generation </em></strong><strong><em>of-him</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Because the life of-him is-being-taken from the earth.”</em></strong> And the eunuch, having-answered [the] Philip, said, <em>“I-ask of-you, concerning whom is┘</em><em>the prophet</em><em>└saying this? </em><em>C</em><em>oncerning himself or concerning somebody other?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And [the] Philip, having-opened the mouth of-him and having-begun from [the] this scripture, preached to-him [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And as they-were-going according-to the road, they-came to some water, and the eunuch says, <em>“Behold, water.</em><em> </em><em>What prevents me to-be-baptized?”</em><em> </em></span>
