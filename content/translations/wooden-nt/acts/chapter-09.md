## Acts Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And [the] Saul, still breathing threatening and murder on the disciples of-the Lord, having-gone to-the high-priest, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>asked from him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, in-order-that, if he-found any being of-The Way, both men and women, he-might-bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And in [the] going it-happened (that) he was-nearing [the] Damascus, and suddenly (a) light shined-around him out-of the sky; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and falling on the ground, he-heard (a) voice saying to-him, <em>“Saul, Saul, why are-you </em><em>persecuting</em><em> me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-said, <em>“Who are-you, Sir?”</em> And the/he (said), <em>“</em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am Jesus whom </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are-persecuting.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>But stand-up and </em><em>enter into</em><em> the city and what</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> it-is-necessary-for </em><em>you</em><em> to-do will-be-told to-you.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the men the-ones traveling-with him had-stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing nobody. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Saul was-raised-up from the ground, and the eyes of-him having-been-opened, he-was-seeing nothing. And leading┘him└by-the-hand, they-led (him) into Damascus. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And for-three days he-was not seeing, and he-did┘not└eat nothing/anything or drink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And a-certain disciple was in Damascus, Ananias by-name, and the Lord said to him in (a) vision, <em>“Ananias.”</em> And the/he said, <em>“Behold, I, Lord.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the Lord (said) to him, <em>“Arise, go to the street [the] called Straight, and look</em><em>┘in (the) house of-Judas└</em><em>for (a man) Saul by-name, (a) Tarsean, for behold he-is-praying.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And he-saw (a) man Ananias [by-name]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> having-entered and having-laid┘hands└on him in-order-that he-might-see.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And Ananias answered, <em>“Lord, I-heard from many about [the] this man how-many┘evil-things└as he-did to-the saints in Jerusalem; </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and he-has authority here from the high-priests to-bind all the-ones calling-on the name of-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But the Lord said to him, <em>“Go, because this-one is (a) chosen vessel to-me [the] to-bear the name of-me before both Gentiles and kings of-(the)-sons of-Israel.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>For </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> will-show him how-many-things it-is-necessary-for him to-suffer on-behalf-of the name of-me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And Ananias went-away and entered into the house; and, having-laid [the] hands on him, he-said, <em>“Brother Saul</em><em>, </em><em>the Lord has-sent me, Jesus the-one having-appeared to-you on the road which you-were-traveling, in-order-that you-might-regain-sight and you-might-be-filled with-(the)-Holy Spirit.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And immediately as-it-were fish-scales/flakes fell from the/his eyes, and he-regained-sight and, having-arisen, he-was-baptized; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and having-received food he-strengthened. And he-was with the disciples in Damascus for-certain days, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and immediately he-began-to-preach in the synagogues (that) [the] this Jesus is/was the Son of-[the] God. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And all the-ones hearing were-amazed and were-saying, <em>“Is this not the-one having-destroyed/killed in Jerusalem the-ones calling-on [the] this name, and he-has-come here for this in-order-that he-might-lead them bound to the high-priests?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And Saul rather was-becoming-stronger and was-bewildering the Jews [the] dwelling in Damascus, showing that this-One is/was the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And as he-was-fulfilling considerable days, the Jews took-counsel to-put┘him└to-death. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And the plot of-them became-known to-[the] Saul. And they-were┘also<sup>2</sup>└watching the gates both during-(the)-day and during-(the)-night in-order-that they-might-put┘him└to-death. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But the disciples of-him, having-taken him during-(the)-night, let┘him└down through the wall, having-lowered (him) in (a) basket.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And having-arrived in Jerusalem, he-tried to-join-himself with-the disciples, and all were fearing him, not believing that he is/was (a) disciples. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But Barnabas, having-taken-hold-of him, led (him) to the apostles and recounted to-them how on the road he-saw the Lord and that he-talked to-him and how in Damascus he-spoke boldly in the name of-[the] Jesus; <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and he-was with them going-in and going-out in Jerusalem speaking-boldly in the name of-the Lord. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And he-began-to-speak also and was-debating with the Hellenists, and the/they were-trying to-put┘him└to-death. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But the brothers, having-realized (it), took┘him└down to Caesarea and sent┘him└away to Tarsus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then the church according-to all [the] Judaea and Galilee and Samaria began-to-have peace, being-built-up and going in-the fear of-the Lord, and was-increasing in-the comfort of-the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And it-happened (that) Peter, travel-around through all-(parts), to-have-come-down also to the saints [the] dwelling-in Lydda, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>and he-found there a-certain man, Aeneas by-name, during eight years lying on (a) bed, who was paralyzed. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And [the] Peter said to-him, <em>“Aeneas, Jesus Christ is-healing you.</em><em> </em><em>Stand-up and make-your-bed for-yourself.”</em><em> </em>And immediately he-stood-up. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And the-ones dwelling-in Lydda and [the] Sharon, who turned to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And in Joppa was a-certain disciple Tabitha by-name, which translated means ‘Dorcas.’ This-one was full of-good works and charity[s] that she-was-doing. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] those days her, having-been-sick, to-die. And having-washed (her), they-put [her]<sup>ms</sup> in (an) upper-room. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And Lydda being near to-[the] Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter is/was in it, sent two men to him, urging (him), <em>“Do┘not└delay to-come-through to us.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And Peter, having-risen, went-with them, whom arriving, they-brought┘(him)└up to the upper-room; and all the widows stood-by, crying and showing (him) shirts and clothes as-many-as Dorcas would-make, being with them. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And having-put out all, [the] Peter also having-put the knees, prayed and having-turned to the body, said, <em>“Tabitha, get-up.”</em> And the/she opened the eyes of-her and, having-seen [Peter], sat-up. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And having-given her (his) hand, he-stood┘her└up. And having-called the saints and the widows, he-presented her living. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And it-became known according-to all [the] Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And it-happened (him) to-remain several days in Joppa with a-certain Simon, (a) tanner.</span>
