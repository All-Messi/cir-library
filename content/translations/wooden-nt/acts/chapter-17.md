## Acts Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-passed-through [the] Amphipolis and Apollonia, they-came to Thessalonica where (a) synagogue of-the Jews was. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And according-to the custom to-[the] Paul, he-went-in to them and on three Sabbaths reasoned-with them from the scriptures. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>explaining and pointing-out/offering-proof that it-was-necessary for-the Christ/Messiah to-suffer and to-resurrect from (the) dead, and that this-One was the Christ/Messiah [the]<sup>ms</sup> Jesus, <em>“whom I-am-proclaiming/advocating to-you.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And some of-them were-persuaded and joined-company-with [the] Paul and [the] Silas, and (some) of the Greek sebomenoi/God-fearers—(a) big group, and (some) of the prominent women not (a) few. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the Jews, having-become-jealous and having-recruited some evil/base men of-the-ones hanging-around-the-marketplace, and having-gathered (A) crowd began-to-set┘the city└in-an-uproar; and assaulting the house of-Jason, they-were-trying to-bring┘them└forward into the dema/public-assembly. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And not-having-found them, they-started-dragging Jason and some brothers to the politarchs, calling/crying-out [that], <em>“These (are) the-ones </em><em>having-turned</em><em>┘the world└</em><em>upside-down/having-upset the worl</em><em>d</em><em>, and they-are-present here, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>whom Jason</em><em> has received, and these all act contrary-to the decrees of-Caesar, saying Jesus to-be another king.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And they-stirred-up the crowd and the politarchs, hearing these-things. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And having-taken-bail-money/(a)-peace-bond from [the] Jason and the rest, they-released them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the brothers immediately during (the) night sent-out both [the] Paul and [the] Silas to Berea, who, having-been-present went into the synagogue of-the Jews. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Now these were more-open-minded than-the-ones in Thessalonica, who welcomed the word/message with all enthusiasm, according-to-(the)-day<sup>2</sup>/daily<sup>2</sup> examining the scriptures whether these-things were so. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Therefore many of-them believed both of the prominent [the] Hellenistic women and men not (a) few. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And when the Jews from [the] Thessalonica found-out that also in [the] Berea the word/message of-[the] God was-proclaimed, they┘also┘┘└came └└there. Shaking-up and stirring-up the crowds, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and immediately then the brothers sent┘[the] Paul└out to-travel as-far-as<sup>2</sup> the sea, and [the] Silas and [the] Timothy stayed-behind. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the-ones conducting [the] Paul led (him) as-far-as Athens; and receiving (a) commandment to [the] Silas and [the] Timothy [in-order]-that as-quickly-as-possible<sup>2</sup> they-might-come to-him, they-went-out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And in [the] Athens Paul waiting-for them, the spirit of-him was-upset in him seeing/looking-at the city being idolatrous. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Then he-was-reasoning in the synagogue with-the Jews and the God-fearers and in the marketplace according-to every day with-the-ones happening-to-be-there/showing-up-there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And some also of-the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were-encountering/discussing-with him, and some were-saying, <em>“What w</em><em>ould [the] this seed-gatherer/ec</em><em>lectic be-trying-to-say?”</em> Now they (were saying), <em>“He seems to-be (a) proponent/proclaimer/preacher of-strange gods,”</em> because he-was-giving-the-good-news-about [the] Jesus and the resurrection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And having-taken-hold-of him, they escorted (him) to the Areopagus<sup>2</sup>/Hill of Ares, saying, <em>“Are-we-able/can-we know what [the] this new [the] teaching being-spoken by you (is)?</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>20</sup></em></strong><em>For you-are-bringing into the ears of-us strange-things.</em><em> </em><em>So-we-want </em><em>to-know</em><em> what these-things want to-be.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Now all Athenians and the sojourning foreigners/strangers spend-their-time in nothing else than to-tell something or to-hear something newer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And [the] Paul, having-been-placed in (the) midst of-the Areopagus, said, <em>“</em><em>Athens</em><em> men, according-to all-things I-see [that] you (are) as┘demon-fearing└as-possible.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>For going-here-and-there and</em><em> </em><em>looking-at the objects-of-worship I-found even (an) altar on which had-been-inscribed, ‘To-(the/an)-Unknown God.’</em><em> </em><em>What </em><em>the you</em><em>┘unknowingly└worship/adore—this </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am-proclaiming to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The God the-one having-made the world/cosmos and all the-things in it—this-One, being Lord of-sky and earth does┘not└dwell in hand-</em><em>made sanctuaries.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Neither is-he-served-as-</em><em>by-a-servant</em><em> as-if-needing anything, himself giving to-all life and breath and [</em><em>the[</em><em> all-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>And he-made out-of/of one every nation of-men to dwell on all (the) face of-the earth, having-set-the-boundaries-of appointed seasons and the boundaries of-the dwelling-places of-them, </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>to-seek [the] God, if then they-might-grope-around-for him and might-find (him, even being not far from each one of-us.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> <em>For in him we-live and move and exist, even as some of-the poets according-to you have-said, ‘For [the] we-are also offspring (of-him).’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>So, being ‘offspring of-[the] God,’ we-ought</em><em> not to-think [the] deity to-be like gold or silver or stone, by-representation of-art and imagination of-man.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>So [the] God, having-overlooked the times of-[the] ignorance, now commands the-things to-[the] men [that] all to-repent everywhere, </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>inasmuch-as he-established (a) day in which he-will judge the world in righteousness, but (a) man whom he-appointed, having-provided assurance to-all having-resurrected him from (the) dead.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And having-heard ‘resurrection (of-the) dead,’ some started-mocking and others said, <em>“We-will-listen-to you concerning this also again.”</em> <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Thus [the] Paul went-out from (the) midst of-them. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But some men, having-stuck with-him, believed, among whom (were) both Dionysius the Areopagus and (a) woman Damaris by-name and others with them.</span>
