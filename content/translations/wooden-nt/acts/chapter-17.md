## Acts Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-passed-through [the] Amphipolis and Apollonia, they-came to Thessalonica where (a) synagogue of-the Jews was. 2And according-to the custom to-[the] Paul, he-went-in to them and on three Sabbaths reasoned-with them from the scriptures. 3explaining and pointing-out/offering-proof that it-was-necessary for-the Christ/Messiah to-suffer and to-resurrect from (the) dead, and that this-One was the Christ/Messiah [the]ms Jesus, "whom I-am-proclaiming/advocating to-you." 4And some of-them were-persuaded and joined-company-with [the] Paul and [the] Silas, and (some) of the Greek sebomenoi/God-fearers—(a) big group, and (some) of the prominent women not (a) few. 5And the Jews, having-become-jealous and having-recruited some evil/base men of-the-ones hanging-around-the-marketplace, and having-gathered (A) crowd began-to-set┘the city└in-an-uproar; and assaulting the house of-Jason, they-were-trying to-bring┘them└forward into the dema/public-assembly. 6And not-having-found them, they-started-dragging Jason and some brothers to the politarchs, calling/crying-out [that], "These (are) the-ones having-turned┘the world└upside-down/having-upset the world, and they-are-present here, 7whom Jason has received, and these all act contrary-to the decrees of-Caesar, saying Jesus to-be another king." 8And they-stirred-up the crowd and the politarchs, hearing these-things. 9And having-taken-bail-money/(a)-peace-bond from [the] Jason and the rest, they-released them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the brothers immediately during (the) night sent-out both [the] Paul and [the] Silas to Berea, who, having-been-present went into the synagogue of-the Jews. 11Now these were more-open-minded than-the-ones in Thessalonica, who welcomed the word/message with all enthusiasm, according-to-(the)-day2/daily2 examining the scriptures whether these-things were so. 12Therefore many of-them believed both of the prominent [the] Hellenistic women and men not (a) few. 13And when the Jews from [the] Thessalonica found-out that also in [the] Berea the word/message of-[the] God was-proclaimed, they┘also┘┘└came └└there. Shaking-up and stirring-up the crowds, 14and immediately then the brothers sent┘[the] Paul└out to-travel as-far-as2 the sea, and [the] Silas and [the] Timothy stayed-behind. 15And the-ones conducting [the] Paul led (him) as-far-as Athens; and receiving (a) commandment to [the] Silas and [the] Timothy [in-order]-that as-quickly-as-possible2 they-might-come to-him, they-went-out.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And in [the] Athens Paul waiting-for them, the spirit of-him was-upset in him seeing/looking-at the city being idolatrous. 17Then he-was-reasoning in the synagogue with-the Jews and the God-fearers and in the marketplace according-to every day with-the-ones happening-to-be-there/showing-up-there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And some also of-the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were-encountering/discussing-with him, and some were-saying, "What would [the] this seed-gatherer/eclectic be-trying-to-say?" Now they (were saying), "He seems to-be (a) proponent/proclaimer/preacher of-strange gods," because he-was-giving-the-good-news-about [the] Jesus and the resurrection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And having-taken-hold-of him, they escorted (him) to the Areopagus2/Hill of Ares, saying, "Are-we-able/can-we know what [the] this new [the] teaching being-spoken by you (is)? 20For you-are-bringing into the ears of-us strange-things. So-we-want to-know what these-things want to-be." 21Now all Athenians and the sojourning foreigners/strangers spend-their-time in nothing else than to-tell something or to-hear something newer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Paul, having-been-placed in (the) midst of-the Areopagus, said, "Athens men, according-to all-things I-see [that] you (are) as┘demon-fearing└as-possible. 23For going-here-and-there and looking-at the objects-of-worship I-found even (an) altar on which had-been-inscribed, 'To-(the/an)-Unknown God.' What the you┘unknowingly└worship/adore—this I am-proclaiming to-you. 24The God the-one having-made the world/cosmos and all the-things in it—this-One, being Lord of-sky and earth does┘not└dwell in hand-made sanctuaries. 25Neither is-he-served-as-by-a-servant as-if-needing anything, himself giving to-all life and breath and [the[ all-things. 26And he-made out-of/of one every nation of-men to dwell on all (the) face of-the earth, having-set-the-boundaries-of appointed seasons and the boundaries of-the dwelling-places of-them, 27to-seek [the] God, if then they-might-grope-around-for him and might-find (him, even being not far from each one of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> For in him we-live and move and exist, even as some of-the poets according-to you have-said, 'For [the] we-are also offspring (of-him).' 29So, being 'offspring of-[the] God,' we-ought not to-think [the] deity to-be like gold or silver or stone, by-representation of-art and imagination of-man. 30So [the] God, having-overlooked the times of-[the] ignorance, now commands the-things to-[the] men [that] all to-repent everywhere, 31inasmuch-as he-established (a) day in which he-will judge the world in righteousness, but (a) man whom he-appointed, having-provided assurance to-all having-resurrected him from (the) dead."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And having-heard 'resurrection (of-the) dead,' some started-mocking and others said, "We-will-listen-to you concerning this also again." 33Thus [the] Paul went-out from (the) midst of-them. 34But some men, having-stuck with-him, believed, among whom (were) both Dionysius the Areopagus and (a) woman Damaris by-name and others with them.</span>
