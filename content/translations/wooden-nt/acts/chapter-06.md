## Acts Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And in [the] these days, the disciples multiplying, (a) murmur arose of-the Hellenists with/toward the Hebrews that the widows of-them were-being-overlooked in the daily [the] service. 2And the twelve, having-called┘the multitude of-the disciples└together, said, "It is not right for-us, having-left the word of-[the] God, to-serve tables. 3Now, brothers, pick out-of you seven men, full of-(the)-Spirit and wisdom whom we-will-appoint over [the] this need; 4and we will-keep-devoting-ourselves to-[the] prayer and the ministry of-the word."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And the word was-pleasing before all the multitude, and they-chose Stephen, (a) man full of-faith and (the) Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, (an) Antioch proselyte, 6whom they-put before the apostles, and, having-prayed, they-laid┘[the] hands└on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the word of-[the] God grew, and the number of-[the] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly, and (a) great crowd of-[the] priests were-obedient to-the/[the] faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And Stephen, full of-grace and power, was-doing great wonders and signs among the people. 9And some arose-up of the synagogue [the] called (The Synagogue) of the Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and the-ones from Cilicia and Asia arguing with–[the] Stephen. 10And they-were┘not└able to-withstand the wisdom and spirit by-which he-was-speaking. 11They they-bribed men saying [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And they-stirred-up the people and the elders and the scribes; and having-attacked (him), they-seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin. 13And they-set-up false witnesses, saying, "[The] this man does┘not└cease speaking words against [the] [this]ms Holy [the] Place and the Law. 14For we-have-heard him saying that Jesus [the] this Nazarene will-destroy [the] this place and will-change the customs that Moses delivered to-us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And having-stared at him, all the-ones sitting in the Sanhedrin saw the face of-him as-if (the) face of-(a)-angel.</span>
