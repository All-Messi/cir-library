## Acts Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And in [the] these days, the disciples multiplying, (a) murmur arose of-the Hellenists with/toward the Hebrews that the widows of-them were-being-overlooked in the daily [the] service. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the twelve, having-called┘the multitude of-the disciples└together, said<em>, </em> <em>“It is not right for-us, having-left the word of-[the] God, to-serve tables.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Now, brothers, </em><em>pick</em><em> out-of you seven men, full of-(the)-Spirit and wisdom whom </em><em>we-will-appoint over [the] this need; </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>and </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> will-</em><em>keep</em><em>-devot</em><em>ing</em><em>-ourselves to-[the] prayer and the ministry of-the word.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And the word was-pleasing before all the multitude, and they-chose Stephen, (a) man full of-faith and (the) Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, (an) Antioch proselyte, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>whom they-put before the apostles, and, having-prayed, they-laid┘[the] hands└on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the word of-[the] God grew, and the number of-[the] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly, and (a) great crowd of-[the] priests were-obedient to-the/[the] faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Stephen, full of-grace and power, was-doing great wonders and signs among the people. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And some arose-up of the synagogue [the] called (The Synagogue) of the Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and the-ones from Cilicia and Asia arguing with–[the] Stephen. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And they-were┘not└able to-withstand the wisdom and spirit by-which he-was-speaking. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They they-bribed men saying [that], <em>“We-have-heard him saying blasphemous words against Moses and [the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And they-stirred-up the people and the elders and the scribes; and having-attacked (him), they-seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And they-set-up false witnesses, saying, <em>“[The] this man does┘not└cease speaking words against [the] [this]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> Holy [the] Place and the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>For we-have-heard him sa</em><em>ying that Jesus [the] this Nazarene will-destroy [the] this place and wil</em><em>l</em><em>-change the customs that Moses delivered to-us.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And having-stared at him, all the-ones sitting in the Sanhedrin saw the face of-him as-if (the) face of-(a)-angel.</span>
