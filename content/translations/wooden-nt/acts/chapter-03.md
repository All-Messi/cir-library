## Acts Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And Peter and John were-going-up into the temple at the ninth [the] hour of-[the] prayer. 2And a-certain man, being lame from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, was-being brought, whom they put according-to (the) day/daily2 at the gate of-the temple [the] called Beautiful [the] to-ask-for alms from the-ones entering into the temple; 3who, having-seen Peter and John about to-enter into the temple, started-asking to-receive alms. 4And Peter, having-looked-directly at him with [the] John, said, "Look at us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-began-to-give-attention to-them, expecting to-receive something from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And Peter said, "Silver and good are not to-me, but what I-do-have—this I-am-giving to-you. In the name of-Jesus Christ the Nazarene, [get-up and]ms walk."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And taking-hold-of him of-the-right (hand), he-raised┘him└up. And immediately the feet and the ankles of-him were-strengthened. 8And jumping-up, he-stood and started-walking; and he-entered with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising [the] God. 9And all the people saw him walking and praising [the] God. 10And they-recognized him that he was the-one sitting for [the] alms at [the] Gate Beautiful of-the temple, and they-were-full-of wonder and amazement at the-thing having-happened to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he clinging-to [the] Peter and [the] John, all the people ran-together to them on the porch [the] called (The Porch) of-Solomon, amazed. 12And [the] Peter, having-seen, responded to the people, "Men Israelites, why are-you-marveling at this, or why are-you-staring at-us as-if by-our-own power or godliness him to-have-made to-walk? 13The God of-Abraham and [the God]ms of-Isaac and [the God] of-Jacob, the God of the fathers of-us, glorified the Servant of-him, Jesus, whom you delivered-up and denied according-to (the) face of-Pilate, having-judged to-release him. 14And you denied the Holy and Just-One and asked-for (a) murderer man to-be-granted to-you, 15and the founder of-[the] life you-put-to-death, whom [the] God raised from (the) dead, of-whom we are witnesses. 16And on-the-basis-of [the] faith of-the name of-him, this-one whom you-see and know, the name of-him strengthened, and [the] faith [the] through him gave to-him [the] this wholeness before you all. 17And now, brothers, I-know that according-to ignorance you-did (it) as also (did) the rulers of-you. 18Now [the] God fulfilled in-this-way what-things he-promised through (the) mouth of-all the prophets (that) the Messiah would-suffer. 19Repent then and turn unto the wiping-out-of the sins of-you, 20in-order-that seasons of-refreshment might-come2 from (the) face of-the Lord, and he-might-send the beforehand-anointing to-you—Christ Jesus, 21whom it-is-necessary-for heaven to-receive until times of-restoration of-all-things that [the] God said through (the) mouth of-the holy prophets of-him from of-old. 22Moses said [that], '[The] Lord the God of-you will-raise-up (a) prophet to-you from the brothers of-you like me. You-shall-hearken-to him according-to all-things as-many-as2 he-says to you. 23And it-will-be every soul that2 does┘not└hearken-to [the] that prophet will-be-cut-off from the people.' 24And all the prophets from Samuel and the-ones afterwards as-many-as spoke also announced [the] these days. 25You are the sons of-the prophets and of-the covenant that [the] God made with the fathers of-you, saying to Abraham, 'And in the seed of-you all the families of-the earth will-be-blessed.' 26To-you first [the] God, having-raised-up the Servant of-him, sent him blessing you in-the-turning each-one from the wicked-deeds of-you."</span>
