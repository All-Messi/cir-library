<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And Peter and John were-going-up into the temple at the ninth [the] hour of-[the] prayer. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And a-certain man, being lame from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, was-being brought, whom they put according-to (the) day/daily<sup>2</sup> at the gate of-the temple [the] called Beautiful [the] to-ask-for alms from the-ones entering into the temple; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>who, having-seen Peter and John about to-enter into the temple, started-asking to-receive alms. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And Peter, having-looked-directly at him with [the] John, said, <em>“Look at us.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And he-began-to-give-attention to-them, expecting to-receive something from them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And Peter said, <em>“Silver and good are not to-me, but what I-do-have—this I-am-giving to-you.</em><em> </em><em>In the name of-Jesus Christ the Nazarene, [get-up and]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> walk.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>And taking-hold-of him of-the-right (hand), he-raised┘him└up. And immediately the feet and the ankles of-him were-strengthened. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And jumping-up, he-stood and started-walking; and he-entered with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising [the] God. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And all the people saw him walking and praising [the] God. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And they-recognized him that <u>he</u> was the-one sitting for [the] alms at [the] Gate Beautiful of-the temple, and they-were-full-of wonder and amazement at the-thing having-happened to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And he clinging-to [the] Peter and [the] John, all the people ran-together to them on the porch [the] called (The Porch) of-Solomon, amazed. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And [the] Peter, having-seen, responded to the people, <em>“</em><em>Men Israelites, why are-you-marveling at this</em><em>,</em><em> or why are-you-staring at-us as-if by-our-own power or godliness hi</em><em>m to-have-made to-walk?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong><em>The G</em></strong><strong><em>od of-Abraham and [the </em></strong><strong><em>G</em></strong><strong><em>od]</em></strong><strong><em><sup>ms</sup></em></strong><strong><em> of-Isaac and [the God] of-Jacob, the God of the fathers of-us, </em></strong><em>glorified the </em><em>Servant</em><em> of-him</em><em>,</em><em> Jesus</em><em>,</em><em> whom </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> delivered-up and denied according-to (the) face of-Pilate, having-judged to-release him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> denied the Ho</em><em>l</em><em>y and Just-One and asked-for (a) murderer man to-be-granted to-</em><em>you, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>and the founder of-[the] life you-put-to-death</em><em>,</em><em> whom [the] God raised from (the) dead, of-whom </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> are witnesses.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And on-the-basis-of [the] faith of-the name of-him, this-one whom you-see and know, the name of-him strengthened</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> faith [the] through him gave to-him [the] this wholeness before you all.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And now, brothers, </em><em>I-know</em><em> that </em><em>according-t</em><em>o</em><em> ignorance you-did (it) as also</em><em> (did) the rulers of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Now [the] God fulfilled in-this-way what-t</em><em>hings he-promised through (the)</em><em> mouth of-all the prophets (that) the Messiah would-suffer.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Repent then and turn unto the wiping-out-of the sins of-you, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>in-order-that seasons of-refreshment might-come</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> from (the) face of-the Lord</em><em>,</em><em> and he-mig</em><em>ht-send the beforehand-anointin</em><em>g to-you—Christ Jesus, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>whom it-is-necessary-for heaven to-receive until times of-restoration of-all-things that [the] God said through (the) mouth of-the holy prophets of-him from of-old.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Moses said </em><em>[that],</em><em> </em><strong><em>‘[The] Lord the God of-you will-raise-up (a) prophet to-you from the brothers of-you like me.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>You-shall-hearken-to him according-to all-things as-many-as</em></strong><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong><strong><em> he-says </em></strong><em>to you</em><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><strong><em>And it-will-be every soul that</em></strong><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong><strong><em> does</em></strong><strong><em>┘not└hearken-to [the] that prophet will-be-cut-off from the people.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>And all the prophets from Samuel and the-ones afterwards as-many-as spoke also announced [the] these days.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>You are the sons of-the prophets and of-the covenant </em><em>that</em><em> [the] God made with the fathers of-you, saying to Abraham, </em><strong><em>‘And in the seed of-you all the families of-the earth will-be-blessed.’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>To-you first [the] God</em><em>,</em><em> having-raised-up the Servant of-him</em><em>, </em><em>sent him blessing you in-the-turning </em><em>each-one from the wicked-deeds</em><em> of-you.”</em></span>
