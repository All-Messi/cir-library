<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the apostles and the brothers the-ones being according-to [the] Judaea heard that the Gentiles also received the word/message of-[the] God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And when Peter went-up to Jerusalem, the-ones from (the) Circumcision began-to-take-issue with him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>saying [that], <em>“You-went-in with men having uncircumcision and ate-with them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And Peter, having-begun, started-laying-before them in-orderly-fashion, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Therefore the-ones having-been-dispersed by the tribulation [the] having-arisen over Stephen went-through as-far-as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word/message to-nobody except<sup>2</sup> to-Jews only.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And some of them were Cypriote men and Cyrenians, who, having-come to Antioch, began-to-speak also to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And (the) hand of-(the)-Lorde was with them, and a large number [the-one]<sup>ms</sup>, having-believed, turned to the Lord. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And the matter was-heard in the ears of-the church [the] being in Jerusalem concerning them, And they-sent Barnabas [to-go-through]<sup>ms</sup> as-far-as Antioch; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>who, having-arrived and having-seen the grace [the]<sup>ms</sup> of-[the] God, rejoiced and began-to-encourage all with-[the] purpose of-[the] heart to-remain to-the Lord, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>because he-was (a) good man and full of-(the)-Holy Spirit and of-faith, and (a) large crowd was added to-the Lord. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And he-went-out to-Tarsus to-look┘Saul└up; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and, having-found him, he-brought (him) to Antioch, and it-was even for-(a)-whole year (that) he-met-with them and he-called the disciples Christians in Antioch first.</span>
