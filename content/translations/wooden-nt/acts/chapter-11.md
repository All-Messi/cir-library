## Acts Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the apostles and the brothers the-ones being according-to [the] Judaea heard that the Gentiles also received the word/message of-[the] God. 2And when Peter went-up to Jerusalem, the-ones from (the) Circumcision began-to-take-issue with him, 3saying [that], "You-went-in with men having uncircumcision and ate-with them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And Peter, having-begun, started-laying-before them in-orderly-fashion, saying, 5"I was in (the) city Joppa praying, and I-saw (a) vision, (a)-certain vessel descending like (a) large piece-of-cloth with-four corners having-been-let-down out-of the sky, and it-came to me; 6into which, having-stared/looked, I-was-considering and I-saw [the] four-footed-animals of-the earth and [the] wild-animals and [the] reptiles and [the] birds of-the sky. 7And also I-heard (a) voice saying to-me, 'Get-up, Peter; kill and eat.' 8And I-said, 'Not-at-all, sir; because (a) common or unclean-thing never entered into the mouth of-me? 9And (the) voice answered [from] (a) second (time) out-of the sky, 'What-things [the] God cleansed, you do┘not└consider-common.' 10And this happened up-to three-times and all-things were-pulled┘back└up into the sky; 11and, behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which we-were, having-been-sent from Caesarea to me. 12But the Spirit said to-me to-go-with them, having-doubted nothing. And with me also [the] these six brothers went and we-entered into the house of-the man. 13And he-reported to-us how he-saw [the/an]ms angel having-stood in the house of-him and having-said, 'Send to Joppa and summon Simon the-one being called Peter, 14who will-tell to you words by which you and all the house of-you may-be-saved.' 15Now in the beginning of-my speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on them as also on us in (the) beginning. 16And I-remembered the word of-the Lord when he-was-saying, 'John baptized with-water, but you will-be-baptized in (the) Holy Spirit.' 17If then [the] God gave to-them the same gift as also to-us having-believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I able to-prevent [the] God?" 18And having-heard these-things, they-became-silent and glorified [the] God, saying, "Then also to-the Gentiles [the] God gave [the] repentance to life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Therefore the-ones having-been-dispersed by the tribulation [the] having-arisen over Stephen went-through as-far-as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word/message to-nobody except2 to-Jews only.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And some of them were Cypriote men and Cyrenians, who, having-come to Antioch, began-to-speak also to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. 21And (the) hand of-(the)-Lorde was with them, and a large number [the-one]ms, having-believed, turned to the Lord. 22And the matter was-heard in the ears of-the church [the] being in Jerusalem concerning them, And they-sent Barnabas [to-go-through]ms as-far-as Antioch; 23who, having-arrived and having-seen the grace [the]ms of-[the] God, rejoiced and began-to-encourage all with-[the] purpose of-[the] heart to-remain to-the Lord, 24because he-was (a) good man and full of-(the)-Holy Spirit and of-faith, and (a) large crowd was added to-the Lord. 25And he-went-out to-Tarsus to-look┘Saul└up; 26and, having-found him, he-brought (him) to Antioch, and it-was even for-(a)-whole year (that) he-met-with them and he-called the disciples Christians in Antioch first.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And in these [the] days prophets came-down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28And one of them, Agabus by-name, having-gotten-up signified by the Holy Spirit (that) (a) severe famine would be over the whole world, which occurred at Claudius. 29And even-as anybody of the disciples was-having-means, each of-them determined to-sent for (a) ministry/service to-the brothers dwelling in [the] Judaea, 30which also they-did, having-sent to the elders through (the) hand of-Barnabas and Saul.</span>
