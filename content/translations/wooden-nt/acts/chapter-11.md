## Acts Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the apostles and the brothers the-ones being according-to [the] Judaea heard that the Gentiles also received the word/message of-[the] God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And when Peter went-up to Jerusalem, the-ones from (the) Circumcision began-to-take-issue with him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>saying [that], <em>“You-went-in with men having uncircumcision and ate-with them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And Peter, having-begun, started-laying-before them in-orderly-fashion, saying, <strong><em><sup>5</sup></em></strong><strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em><u>I</u></em><em> was in (the) city Joppa praying, and I-saw (a) vision, (a)-certain vessel descending like (a) large piece-of-cloth with-four corners having</em><em>-been-let-down ou</em><em>t-of the sky</em><em>, and it-came to me;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>i</em><em>nto which</em><em>,</em><em> having-stared/looked</em><em>, I-was-considering</em><em> and I-saw [the] four-footed-animals of-the earth and [the] wild-animals and [the] reptiles and [the] birds of-the sky.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>And also I</em><em>-heard (a) voice saying to-me, ‘Get-up, Peter; kill and eat.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>And I-said, ‘Not-at-all, </em><em>sir;</em><em> because (a) common or unclean-thing </em><em>n</em><em>ever </em><em>entered into</em><em> the mouth of-me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And (the) voice answered [from] (a) second (time) out-of the sky, ‘What-things [the] God cleansed, </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> do┘not└conside</em><em>r-common.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And this happened up-to three-times and all-things wer</em><em>e-pulled┘back└</em><em>up into the sky; </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>and</em><em>,</em><em> behold</em><em>,</em><em> immedia</em><em>tely three men stood at the hous</em><em>e in which we-were, having-been-sent from Caesarea to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>But the Spirit said to-me to-go-with them</em><em>, having-doubted</em><em> nothing.</em><em> </em><em>And with me also [the] these six brothers went and </em><em>we-entered into</em><em> the house of-the man. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>And he-reported to-us how he-saw [the</em><em>/an</em><em>]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> angel having-stood in the house of-him and having-said, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon the-one being called Peter, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>who will-tell to you words by which you </em><em>and all</em><em> the house of-you may-be-saved.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Now in the beginning of-my speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on them as also on us in (the) beginning.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And I-remembered the word of-the Lord when he-was-saying, ‘John baptized with-water, but </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> will-be-baptiz</em><em>ed in (the) H</em><em>oly Spirit.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If then [the] God gave to-them the same gift as also to-us having-believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> able to-prevent [the] God?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>And having-heard these-things, they-became-silent and glorified [the] God, saying, “Then also to-the Gentiles [the] God gave [the] repentance to life.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Therefore the-ones having-been-dispersed by the tribulation [the] having-arisen over Stephen went-through as-far-as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word/message to-nobody except<sup>2</sup> to-Jews only.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And some of them were Cypriote men and Cyrenians, who, having-come to Antioch, began-to-speak also to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And (the) hand of-(the)-Lorde was with them, and a large number [the-one]<sup>ms</sup>, having-believed, turned to the Lord. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And the matter was-heard in the ears of-the church [the] being in Jerusalem concerning them, And they-sent Barnabas [to-go-through]<sup>ms</sup> as-far-as Antioch; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>who, having-arrived and having-seen the grace [the]<sup>ms</sup> of-[the] God, rejoiced and began-to-encourage all with-[the] purpose of-[the] heart to-remain to-the Lord, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>because he-was (a) good man and full of-(the)-Holy Spirit and of-faith, and (a) large crowd was added to-the Lord. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And he-went-out to-Tarsus to-look┘Saul└up; <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and, having-found him, he-brought (him) to Antioch, and it-was even for-(a)-whole year (that) he-met-with them and he-called the disciples Christians in Antioch first.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And in these [the] days prophets came-down from Jerusalem to Antioch. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And one of them, Agabus by-name, having-gotten-up signified by the Holy Spirit (that) (a) severe famine would be over the whole world, which occurred at Claudius. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And even-as anybody of the disciples was-having-means, each of-them determined to-sent for (a) ministry/service to-the brothers dwelling in [the] Judaea, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>which also they-did, having-sent to the elders through (the) hand of-Barnabas and Saul.</span>
