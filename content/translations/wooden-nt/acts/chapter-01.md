## Acts Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The first volume I-made about all-things, O Theophilus, that [the] Jesus began both to-do and to-teach, 2until which day he-was-taken-up, having-given-commission by (the) Holy Spirit to-the/his apostles whom he-chose, 3to-whom also he-presented himself living after his [the] suffering in many proofs, through forth days, appearing to-them and saying the-things about the kingdom of-the God; 4and assembling-with (them) commanded them not to-depart from Jerusalem, but to-await the promise of-the Father, "which you-heard-from me, 5that John baptized with-water, but you will-be-baptized in (the) Holy Spirit not after these many days."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then the-ones having-assembled started-asking him, saying, "Lord, [if] will-you-restore at [the] this time the kingdom to-[the] Israel?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-said to them, "It-is not of-you to-know (the) times or seasons that the Father put in [the] his-own authority, 8but you-will-receive power, the Holy Spirit having-come on you; and you-will-be witnesses of-me both in Jerusalem and in all [the] Judaea and Samaria and to the end of-the earth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And having-said these-things, they watching, he-was-taken-up; and (a) cloud received him from the eyes of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And as they-were staring into the sky, he going, behold also, two men stood-by them in white clothes, 11who also said, "Men Galileans, why are-you-standing (here) looking into the sky? This [the] Jesus, the-One having-been-received-up from you into the sky, thus will-come which way2/the same way2 you-saw him going into the sky."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then they-returned to Jerusalem from (the) hill [the] called "(The Mount)-of-Olives," which is near Jerusalem having/being (a) road/way of-(the)-Sabbath. 13And when they entered, they-went-up into the upper-room where they-were staying, both [the] Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James (son of) Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot and Judas (son of) James. 14These all were continuing in-close-company together in-[the] prayer with (the) women and Mary the mother of-[the] Jesus and the brothers of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And in [the] these days, Peter, having-arisen in the midst of-the brothers, said [and (a) crowd of-names was together3 about (a) hundred (and) twenty], 16"Men brothers, it-was-necessary-for the scripture to-be-fulfilled that the Holy [the] Spirit spoke-ahead-of-time through (the) mouth of-David about Judas, the-one having-become (the) guide to-the-ones having-arrested Jesus, 17because he-was numbered among us and obtained the/his portion of-[the] this ministry. [18This-one then purchased (a) field from (the) pay of-the injustice and having-become headfirst/swollen, he-burst-open in-the-midst and all the entrails of-him gushed-out. 19And it-became known to-all the-ones dwelling-in Jerusalem, so-that [the] that field was-called in-[the] their-own language Aceldama, that is, 'Field of-Blood.'] 20For it-has-been-written in (the) Book of Psalms,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So it-is-necessary—of-the men traveling-with us in all (the) time in which the Lord Jesus went-in and went-out with us, 22beginning from the baptism of-John to the day which he-was-taken-up from us—that one of-these become (a) witness with us of-the resurrection of-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And they-set two: Joseph, the-one called Barsabbas, who was-called Justus, and Matthias. 24And having-prayed, they-said, "You, Lord, heart-knower of-all, show which one of these [the] two you-chose 25to-receive the place of-[the] this ministry and apostleship from which Judas went to [the] his-own [the] place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they-gave lots for-them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he-was-included-with the eleven apostles.</span>
