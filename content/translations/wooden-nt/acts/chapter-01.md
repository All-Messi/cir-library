## Acts Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The first volume I-made about all-things, O Theophilus, that [the] Jesus began both to-do and to-teach, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>until which day he-was-taken-up, having-given-commission by (the) Holy Spirit to-the/his apostles whom he-chose, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>to-whom also he-presented himself living after his [the] suffering in many proofs, through forth days, appearing to-them and saying the-things about the kingdom of-the God; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and assembling-with (them) commanded them not to-depart from Jerusalem, but to-await the promise of-the Father, <em>“</em><em>which you-heard-from me, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>that John baptized with-water, but you will-be-baptized in (the) Holy Spirit not after these</em><em> many days.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then the-ones having-assembled started-asking him, saying, <em>“Lord, [if] will-you-restore at [the] this time the kingdom to-[the] Israel?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-said to them, <em>“It-is not of-you to-know (the) times or seasons that the Father put in [the] his-own authority, </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>but you-will-receive power, the Holy Spirit having-come on you; and you-will-be witnesses of-me both in Jerusalem and in all [the] Judaea and Samaria and to the end of-the earth.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And having-said these-things, they watching, he-was-taken-up; and (a) cloud received him from the eyes of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And as they-were staring into the sky, he going, behold also, two men stood-by them in white clothes, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>who also said, <em>“Men Galileans, why are</em><em>-you-stand</em><em>ing (here) looking into the sky?</em><em> </em><em>T</em><em>his [the] Jesus, the-One having-been-received-up from you into the sky</em><em>,</em><em> thus will-come </em><em>which way</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>/the same way</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-saw him going into the sky.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then they-returned to Jerusalem from (the) hill [the] called “(The Mount)-of-Olives,” which is near Jerusalem having/being (a) road/way of-(the)-Sabbath. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And when they entered, they-went-up into the upper-room where they-were staying, both [the] Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James (son of) Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot and Judas (son of) James. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>These all were continuing in-close-company together in-[the] prayer with (the) women and Mary the mother of-[the] Jesus and the brothers of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And in [the] these days, Peter, having-arisen in the midst of-the brothers, said [and (a) crowd of-names was together<sup>3</sup> about (a) hundred (and) twenty],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> <em>So it-is-necessary—of-the men traveling-with us in all (the) time in which the Lord Jesus went-in and went-out with us, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>beginning from the baptism of-John to the day which he-was-taken-up from us—that one of-these become (a) witness with</em><em> us of-the resurrection of-him.”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And they-set two: Joseph, the-one called Barsabbas, who was-called Justus, and Matthias. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And having-prayed, they-said, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em>, Lord, heart-knower of-all, show which one of these [the] two yo</em><em>u-chose </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>to-receive the place o</em><em>f-[the] this ministry and apostleship from which Judas went to [the] his-own [the] place.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they-gave lots for-them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he-was-included-with the eleven apostles.</span>
