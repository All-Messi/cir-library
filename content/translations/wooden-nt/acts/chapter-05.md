## Acts Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And a-certain man, Ananias by-name, with Sapphira the wife of-him, sold a-piece-of-land, 2and kept-back from the price, the/his wife also sharing-knowledge (of it); and having-brought a-certain part, put (it) by the feet of-the apostles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And [the] Peter said, "Ananias, on-account-of what did┘[the] Satan└fill the heart of-you (that) you lied-to the Holy [the] Spirit and kept-back from the price of-the piece-of-land? 4Remaining, did-it┘not└remain, and having-been-sold, was-it┘(not)└remaining in [the] your authority? Why because did-you-put [the] this matter in the heart of-you? You did┘not└lie to-men, but to-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And [the] Ananias, hearing [the] these words, having-fallen-down, breathed-his-last, and great fear came-to-be on all the-ones hearing. 6And the younger-men, having-risen-up, wrapped┘him└up and, having carried┘him└out, buried (him).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And (a) space of┘about└three hours happened, the wife of-him also came-in, not having-known the-thing happened. 8And Peter responded to her,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And [the] Peter (said) to her, "Why because was-it-agreed by-you to-test the Spirit of-God? Behold, the feet of-the-ones having-buried the husband of-you (are) at the door, and they-will-carry┘you└out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And immediately she-fell at the feet of-him and breathed-her-last. And the young-men, having-entered, found her dead and, having-carried-(her)-out, buried her beside the husband of-her; 11and great fear came on the whole church and on all the ones hearing these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And through the hands of-the apostles were-happening many signs and wonders among the people. And they-were all together in [the] Solomon's Porch; 13and nobody of-the rest were-daring to-associate-with them, but the people were magnifying them. 14And believing-ones were┘more└being-added to-the Lord, crowds both of-men and women, 15so-that even into the streets they-were-carrying-out the sick and put (them) on beds and cots, in-order-that, Peter coming, even the/his shadow might overshadow anybody of-them. 16And the multitude of-[the] towns in-the-vicinity of-Jerusalem, were-coming-together, bringing sick-ones and ones-hassled by unclean spirits, who all were-being-healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the high-priest having-arisen and all the-ones with him, the being sect of-the Sadducees, were-full of-jealousy, 18and they-laid [the] hands on the apostles and put them in public prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord during (the) night, having-opened the doors of-the prison and having-led┘them└out, said, 20"Go and, having-stood, speak in the temple to-the people all the words of-[the] this life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And having-heard, they-entered into the temple under the early-morning3/at daybreak3, and began-to-teach. And the high-priest having-arrived, and the-ones with him called-together the Sanhedrin and all the Council of-the sons of-Israel, and they-sent to the prison for-them to-be-brought.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the having-arrived, officers did┘not└find them in the prison; and, having-returned, they-reported, 23saying [that], "We-found the prison locked in all safety and the guards standing at the doors, but having-opened we-found nobody inside."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And when they-heard [the] these words, and the captain of-the temple and the high-priests were-wondering about them—whatever2 this would become. 25And a-certain one, having-arrived, reported to-them [that], "Behold, the men whom you-put in [the] prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then the captain, having-gone-away with the officers were-bringing them not with violence, for they-were-fearing the people lest they-would-stone them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And having-led them, they-stood (them) in the Sanhedrin; and the high-priest asked them, saying, "With instruction we-instructed you not to-teach in [the] this name, and behold you-have-filled [the] Jerusalem with-the teaching of-you, and plan to-bring on us the blood of-[the] this man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And Peter, having-responded and the apostles said, "It-is-necessary to-obey God rather than men. 30The God of-the fathers of-us raised Jesus whom you did-murder, having-hung (him) on (a) cross. 31[The] God exalted this-One as-Leader and Savior to-the right-(hand) of-him [the] to-give repentance to-[the] Israel and remission of-sins. 32And we are witnesses of-[the] these words/matters and the Holy [the] Spirit that [the] God gave to-the-ones obeying him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the-ones/they, having-heard, became-enraged and were-planning to-kill them. 34And a-certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin, having-arisen, name to-him Gamaliel, (a) teacher-of-the-Law respected by all the people, commanded (them) to-put the men outside/aside for-a-little-while, 35and he-said to them, "Men Israelites, take-heed-to yourselves in-respect-to [the] these men what you-are-about to-do. 36For before these [the] days Theudas rose-up, saying himself to-be something, to-whom (a) number of-men were-inclined, about four-hundred, who was-killed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed, and they-became for nothing. 37After this-one, Judas the Galilean rose-up in the days of-the enrollment and drew-aside people after him; and that-one was-destroyed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed. 38And the-things now, I-say to-you, set┘[the] these men└aside and leave┘them└alone; because if [the] this plan or [the] this work is from men, it-will-be-overthrown; 39but if it-is from God, you-will┘not└be-able to-overthrow them, lest-at-any-time you-be-found even to-be-battling God." And they-took his advice/obeyed him. 40And they-summoned the apostles, having-beaten (them), they-commanded (them) not to speak in the name of-[the] Jesus and released them. 41So the-ones/they were-going-out rejoicing from (the) face of-the Sanhedrin, because they-were-considered-important-enough to-be-disgraced. 42And every day in the temple and from house to house2/according-to (the) house2 they-did┘not└cease teaching and preaching the Christ (was) Jesus.</span>
