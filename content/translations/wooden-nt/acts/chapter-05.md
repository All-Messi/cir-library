<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong>A</strong>nd a-certain man, Ananias by-name, with Sapphira the wife of-him, sold a-piece-of-land, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and kept-back from the price, the/his wife also sharing-knowledge (of it); and having-brought a-certain part, put (it) by the feet of-the apostles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And [the] Peter said, <em>“Ananias, on-account-of what did┘[the] Satan└fill the heart of-you (that) you lied-to the Holy [the] Spirit and kept-back from the price of-the piece-of-land?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Remaining, did-it┘not└remai</em><em>n, and having-been-sold, was-it</em>┘<em>(</em><em>not</em><em>)</em>└<em>r</em><em>emaining in [the] your authority?</em><em> </em><em>Why because did-you-put [the] </em><em>this </em><em>matter in the heart </em><em>of-you</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>You did┘not└lie to-men, but to-[the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And [the] Ananias, hearing [the] these words, having-fallen-down, breathed-his-last, and great fear came-to-be on all the-ones hearing. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the younger-men, having-risen-up, wrapped┘him└up and, having carried┘him└out, buried (him).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And (a) space of┘about└three hours happened, the wife of-him also came-in, not having-known the-thing happened. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Peter responded to her, <em>“Tell me, whether you-sold the piece-of-land for-so-much?”</em><em> </em> And the/she said, <em>“Yes, for-so-much.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And [the] Peter (said) to her, <em>“Why because was-it-agreed by-you to-test the Spirit of-God?</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the feet of-the-ones having-buried the husband of-you (are) at the door, and they-will-carry┘you└out.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And immediately she-fell at the feet of-him and breathed-her-last. And the young-men, having-entered, found her dead and, having-carried-(her)-out, buried her beside the husband of-her; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and great fear came on the whole church and on all the ones hearing these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And through the hands of-the apostles were-happening many signs and wonders among the people. And they-were all together in [the] Solomon’s Porch; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and nobody of-the rest were-daring to-associate-with them, but the people were magnifying them. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And believing-ones were┘more└being-added to-the Lord, crowds both of-men and women, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>so-that even into the streets they-were-carrying-out the sick and put (them) on beds and cots, in-order-that, Peter coming, even the/his shadow might overshadow anybody of-them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the multitude of-[the] towns in-the-vicinity of-Jerusalem, were-coming-together, bringing sick-ones and ones-hassled by unclean spirits, who all were-being-healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the high-priest having-arisen and all the-ones with him, the being sect of-the Sadducees, were-full of-jealousy, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and they-laid [the] hands on the apostles and put them in public prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord during (the) night, having-opened the doors of-the prison and having-led┘them└out, said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>“Go and, having-stood, speak in the temple to-the people all the words of-[the] this life.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And having-heard, they-entered into the temple under the early-morning<sup>3</sup>/at daybreak<sup>3</sup>, and began-to-teach. And the high-priest having-arrived, and the-ones with him called-together the Sanhedrin and all the Council of-the sons of-Israel, and they-sent to the prison for-them to-be-brought.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the having-arrived, officers did┘not└find them in the prison; and, having-returned, they-reported, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>saying [that], <em>“We-found the prison locked in all safety and the guards standing at the </em><em>doors, but</em><em> having-opened we-found nobody inside.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And when they-heard [the] these words, and the captain of-the temple and the high-priests were-wondering about them—whatever<sup>2</sup> this would become. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And a-certain one, having-arrived, reported to-them [that], <em>“Behold, the men whom you-put in </em><em>[the] prison</em><em> are in the temple</em><em>,</em><em> standing and teaching the people.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then the captain, having-gone-away with the officers were-bringing them not with violence, for they-were-fearing the people lest they-would-stone them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And having-led them, they-stood (them) in the Sanhedrin; and the high-priest asked them, saying, <em>“With instruction we-instructed you no</em><em>t</em><em> to-teach in </em><em>[the] this</em><em> </em><em>name, and</em><em> behold you-have-filled [the] Jerusalem with-the teaching of-you</em><em>,</em><em> and plan to-bring on us the blood of-[the] this man.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And Peter, having-responded and the apostles said, <em>“It-is-necessary to-obey God rather than men.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>The G</em><em>od of-the fathers of-us raised Jesus whom </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> did-murder, having-hung (him) on (a) cross.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>[The] God exalted this-One as-Leader and Savior</em><em> to-the right-(hand) of-him [the] to-give repentance to-[the] Israel and remission of-sins.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>And we are witnesses of-[the] these words/matters and the Holy [the] Spirit that [the] God gave to-the-ones obeying him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the-ones/they, having-heard, became-enraged and were-planning to-kill them. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And a-certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin, having-arisen, name to-him Gamaliel, (a) teacher-of-the-Law respected by all the people, commanded (them) to-put the men outside/aside for-a-little-while, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>and he-said to them, <em>“Men Israelites, take-heed-to yourselves in-respect-to [the] these men what you-are-about to-do.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>For before these [the] days Theudas rose-up, saying himself to-be something, to-whom (a) number of-men were-inclined, about </em><em>four-hundred</em><em>, who was-killed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed, and they-became for nothing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>After this-one, Judas the Galilean rose-up in the days of-the enrollment and drew-aside people after him; and that-one was-destroyed and all as-many-as obeyed him were-dispersed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>And the-things now, I-say to-you, set┘[the] these men└aside</em><em> and leave┘them└alone; because if [the] this plan or [the] this work is from men, it-will-be-o</em><em>verthrown;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>but if it-is from God, you-will┘not└be-able to-overthrow them, lest-at-any-time you-be-found </em><em>even </em><em>to-be-battling</em><em> </em><em>God.</em><em>”</em><em> </em> And they-took his advice/obeyed him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And they-summoned the apostles, having-beaten (them), they-commanded (them) not to speak in the name of-[the] Jesus and released them. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>So the-ones/they were-going-out rejoicing from (the) face of-the Sanhedrin, because they-were-considered-important-enough to-be-disgraced. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And every day in the temple and from house to house<sup>2</sup>/according-to (the) house<sup>2</sup> they-did┘not└cease teaching and preaching the Christ (was) Jesus.</span>
