## Acts Chapter **25**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then Festus, having-arrived-at the province, after three days went-up to Jerusalem from Caesarea; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and the chief-priests and the first-ones of-the Jews brought-charges against [the] Paul and were-urging him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>asking (a) favor against him in-order-that he-might-summon him to Jerusalem, making (an) ambush to-kill him along the road. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then [the] Festus answered to-keep [the] Paul in Caesarea, and himself to-be-going to-leave shortly. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“Then let┘the-ones able among you,” </em>he-says,<em> “having-gone-down with (me)</em><em>,</em><em> if anything is amiss in-the-</em><em>man,└</em><em>accuse/prosecute him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And having-spent among them not more than-eight or ten days, having-gone-down to Caesarea, the next-day having-sat-down on the judgment-seat, he-commanded [the] Paul to-be-brought. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And he being-present, the Jews, having-come-down from Jerusalem, stood-around him bringing many and grievous charges that they-were┘not└able to-prove. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>[The] Paul defending-himself [that], <em>“Neither against the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesarea did I-sin with-respect-to-anything.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>But [the] Festus, desiring to-gain┘favor└with the Jews, answering, said to-[the] Paul, <em>“Are-you-willing, having-gone-up to Jerusalem, to-be-judged there before/at me concerning these-things?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>But [the] Paul said, <em>“I-am stood before/at the judgment-seat of-Caesar, where it-is-necessary-for me to-be-judged.</em><em> </em><em>I-wronged Jews nothing as also </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> very-well know.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>If then I-am-(a)-wrong-doer and have-practiced anything worthy of-death, I-do┘not└refuse [the] to-die.</em><em> </em><em>But if nothing is </em><em>of-which-things</em><em> these are-accusing me, nobody is able to-deliver (me) to-them.</em><em> </em><em>I-appeal to-Caesar.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then [the] Festus, having-conferred with the/his council, answered, <em>“You-have-appealed to-Caesar.</em><em> </em><em>To Caesar you-will-go.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Now some days passing, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea greeting [the] Festus. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And as they-were-tarrying there many days, [the] Festus laid (before him) the-things according-to [the] Paul, saying, <em>“A-certain man has-been left-behind by Felix bound, </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>concerning whom, I having-been in Jerusalem the chief-priests and the elders of-the Jews brought-charges, asking-for sentence against him; </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>to whom I-answered that it-is not (a) custom for-Romans to-hand-over any man before</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the accused should-have the accusers according-to face and should-receive opportunity of-defense concerning the charges.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>So they, having assembled here, having-made no delay, on-the next-day, having-sat on the judgment-seat, I-commanded the man to-be-brought; </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>concerning whom the accusers, having-stood-up, were-bringing no matter of-</em><em>which evil</em><em>-things </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> was-supposing, </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>but certain controversial-things concerning [the] their/their-own religion they-had with him and concerning a-certain Jesus, having-died/dead whom [the] Paul was-claiming to-be-alive.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>I</u></em><em>, being-uncertain-where-to-go</em><em>/being-uncertain-how-to-proceed with-respect-to-the investigation concerning these-things, was-asking whether he-would-be-willing to-go to Jerusalem and-there to-be-judged concerning these-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But [the] Paul having-appealed (that) him to-be-held in the decision of-[the] Caesar, I-commanded hi</em><em>m to-be-kept until when I-</em><em>w</em><em>ould</em><em>-send┘him└up to Caesar.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And Agrippa (said) to-Festus, <em>“I┘also myself└would-like to-hear the man.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Tomorrow,” </em>he-says,<em> “you-will-hear hm.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So the-next-day [the] Agrippa having-come and [the] Bernice with much pomp having-entered into the auditorium, and with tribunes/chiliarchs and men [the] according-to prominence of-the city and [the] Festus having-commanded, [the] Paul was-brought. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And [the] Festus says, <em>“King Agrippa and all the men present-with us, you-see this-one concerning whom all the multitude of-the Jews appealed to-me both in Jerusalem and here, clamoring (that) it-to-be-necessary-for him not to-be-living anymore.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>But </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> found nothing worthy of-death him to-have-done, but this-one himself, having-appealed-to [the] Caesar, I determined to-send (him), </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>concerning whom I-do┘not└have anything to-write to-the lord, wherefore I-brought him to you and especially to you, King Agrippa, in-order-that, (an) investigation having-occurred, I-might-have what I-may-write.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>For it-seems senseless to-me with-respect-to</em><em>-</em><em>sending (a) prisoner not even to-specify the matters against him.”</em></span>
