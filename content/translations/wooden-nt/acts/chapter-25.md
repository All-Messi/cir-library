## Acts Chapter 25

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then Festus, having-arrived-at the province, after three days went-up to Jerusalem from Caesarea; 2and the chief-priests and the first-ones of-the Jews brought-charges against [the] Paul and were-urging him, 3asking (a) favor against him in-order-that he-might-summon him to Jerusalem, making (an) ambush to-kill him along the road. 4Then [the] Festus answered to-keep [the] Paul in Caesarea, and himself to-be-going to-leave shortly. 5"Then let┘the-ones able among you," he-says, "having-gone-down with (me), if anything is amiss in-the-man,└accuse/prosecute him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And having-spent among them not more than-eight or ten days, having-gone-down to Caesarea, the next-day having-sat-down on the judgment-seat, he-commanded [the] Paul to-be-brought. 7And he being-present, the Jews, having-come-down from Jerusalem, stood-around him bringing many and grievous charges that they-were┘not└able to-prove. 8[The] Paul defending-himself [that], "Neither against the Law of-the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesarea did I-sin with-respect-to-anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But [the] Festus, desiring to-gain┘favor└with the Jews, answering, said to-[the] Paul, "Are-you-willing, having-gone-up to Jerusalem, to-be-judged there before/at me concerning these-things?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But [the] Paul said, "I-am stood before/at the judgment-seat of-Caesar, where it-is-necessary-for me to-be-judged. I-wronged Jews nothing as also you very-well know. 11If then I-am-(a)-wrong-doer and have-practiced anything worthy of-death, I-do┘not└refuse [the] to-die. But if nothing is of-which-things these are-accusing me, nobody is able to-deliver (me) to-them. I-appeal to-Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then [the] Festus, having-conferred with the/his council, answered, "You-have-appealed to-Caesar. To Caesar you-will-go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now some days passing, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea greeting [the] Festus. 14And as they-were-tarrying there many days, [the] Festus laid (before him) the-things according-to [the] Paul, saying, "A-certain man has-been left-behind by Felix bound, 15concerning whom, I having-been in Jerusalem the chief-priests and the elders of-the Jews brought-charges, asking-for sentence against him; 16to whom I-answered that it-is not (a) custom for-Romans to-hand-over any man before2 the accused should-have the accusers according-to face and should-receive opportunity of-defense concerning the charges. 17So they, having assembled here, having-made no delay, on-the next-day, having-sat on the judgment-seat, I-commanded the man to-be-brought; 18concerning whom the accusers, having-stood-up, were-bringing no matter of-which evil-things I was-supposing, 19but certain controversial-things concerning [the] their/their-own religion they-had with him and concerning a-certain Jesus, having-died/dead whom [the] Paul was-claiming to-be-alive. 20And I, being-uncertain-where-to-go/being-uncertain-how-to-proceed with-respect-to-the investigation concerning these-things, was-asking whether he-would-be-willing to-go to Jerusalem and-there to-be-judged concerning these-things. 21But [the] Paul having-appealed (that) him to-be-held in the decision of-[the] Caesar, I-commanded him to-be-kept until when I-would-send┘him└up to Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And Agrippa (said) to-Festus, "I┘also myself└would-like to-hear the man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the-next-day [the] Agrippa having-come and [the] Bernice with much pomp having-entered into the auditorium, and with tribunes/chiliarchs and men [the] according-to prominence of-the city and [the] Festus having-commanded, [the] Paul was-brought. 24And [the] Festus says, "King Agrippa and all the men present-with us, you-see this-one concerning whom all the multitude of-the Jews appealed to-me both in Jerusalem and here, clamoring (that) it-to-be-necessary-for him not to-be-living anymore. 25But I found nothing worthy of-death him to-have-done, but this-one himself, having-appealed-to [the] Caesar, I determined to-send (him), 26concerning whom I-do┘not└have anything to-write to-the lord, wherefore I-brought him to you and especially to you, King Agrippa, in-order-that, (an) investigation having-occurred, I-might-have what I-may-write. 27For it-seems senseless to-me with-respect-to-sending (a) prisoner not even to-specify the matters against him."</span>
