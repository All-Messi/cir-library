## Acts Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And at that [the] time Herod the king put┘[the] hands└on to-abuse certain-ones [the] from the church. 2And he-killed James the brother of-John with-(a)-sword. 3And having-seen that is/was pleasing to-the Jews, he-proceeded to-arrest Peter also—and the days of-[the] Unleavened (Bread) were—4whom also, having-arrested, he-put in prison, having-delivered (him) to-four quaternions/detachments of-soldiers to-guard him, wanting after the Passover to-bring┘him└up to-the people. 5So [the] Peter was-being-kept in the prison, and prayer was earnestly taking-place by the church to [the] God concerning him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now when [the] Herod was-about to-bring him, [the] that night [Peter] was sleeping between soldiers, bound with-two chains, and in-front-of the gate they-were keeping the prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And behold (an) angel of-(the)-Lord stood-by, and (a) light shined in the prison-cell. And having-tapped the side of-[the] Peter, he-started-raising┘him└up, saying, "Get-up in-quietness," and the chains of-him fell from the/his hands. 8And the angel said to him, "Be-lively and put-on the sandals of-you," and he-did so. And he-says to-him, "Put┘the cloak of-you└on and follow me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And having-gone-out, he-followed and did┘not└know that the-thing happening through the angel is/was real. And he was-seeming to-see (a) vision. 10And having-passed through (a) first guard-post and (a) second, they-came to the iron [the] gate [the] leading into the city, which automatically opened to-them; and, having-gone-out, they-went-forward one street, and immediately the angel left him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And [the] Peter, having-come to himself, said, "Now I-know for-sure that [the]ms Lord sent-out the angel of-him and rescued me from (the) hand of-Herod and all the anticipation of-the people of-the Jews." 12And having-become aware, he-went to the house of-[the] Mary, the mother of-John, the-one being-called mark, where (a)-significant-(number) was assembled and were-praying. 13And he, having-knocked-on the door of-the gate, (a) girl came to-answer, Rhoda by-name, 14and having-recognized the voice of-the Peter, from [the] joy she-did┘not└open the gate; but having-run in, she-reported [the] Peter to-be standing in-front-of the gate. 15and the-ones said to her, "You-are-out-of-your mind." But the (girl) kept-insisting (it) thus to-be; and the-ones began-to-say, "It-is the angel of-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But [the] Peter remained, knocking. And having-opened (the gate), they-saw him and they-were-astounded. 17And having-signaled to-them with-the hand to-be-quiet, he-rehearsed [to-them]ms how [the] Lord led-(him)-out of the prison and said, "Report these-things to-James and to-the brothers"; and having-gone-out, he-went to another place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now day having-come, not (a) little disturbance was among the soldiers as-to-what then [the] Peter became. 19And Herod, having-looked-for him and not having-found (him). Having-examined the guards, commanded (them) to-be-put-to-death, and having-gone-down from [the] Judaea to Caesarea, he-continued (there).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now he-was very-angry-with the Tyreans and Sidonians, and together they-came to him; and having-persuaded Blastus, the-ne over the bedroom of-the king, they-started-asking-for peace on-account-of the region of them [the] to-be-sustained by/from the king. 21And on-(an)-appointed day [the] Herod, having-put-on royal apparel [and]ms having-sat on the judgment-seat, began-to-orate to them; 22and the populace began-to-shout, "(The) voice of-God and not of-man." 23And immediately (an) angel of-(the) Lord struck him on-account-of which-things he-did┘not└give [the] glory to-[the] God; and having-become worm-eaten, he-died.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And the word of-[the] God grew and was-multiplying. 25And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, having-fulfilled the/their ministry, having-taken-along-with (them) John the-one surnamed/nicknamed Mark.</span>
