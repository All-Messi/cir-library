## Acts Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And some, having-come-down from [the] Judaea, began-to-teach the brothers [that], <em>“Unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-are-circumcised by-the custom of-[the] Moses, you-are┘not└able to-be-saved.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And no little dispute and controversy having-arisen by-[the Paul and [the] Barnabas with them, they-appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to-go-up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about [the] this controversy. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then the-ones having-been-sent-forward by the church were-passing-through both [the] Phoenicia and Samaria, they-were-relating-fully the conversion of-the Gentiles and they-were-making great joy for-all the brothers. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And having-passed-on to Jerusalem, they-were-welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they-reported as-many-things-as [the] God did with them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And some of-the-ones from the sect of-the Pharisees, having-believed, rose-up, saying that it-is/was-necessary to-circumcise them, and command (them) to-keep the Law of-Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the apostles and the elders assembled to-see about [the] this issue. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And much questioning/controversy having-arisen, Peter, having-arisen, said to-them, “Men brothers, you know that from early days [the] God chose among you through the mouth of-me (that) [the] Gentiles hear the word of-the gospel and believe. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the heart-knower God testified to-them, having-given the Holy [the] Spirit to-them even as also to-us; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and he-was-making┘no└distinction between both us and them having-cleansed the hearts of-them by-[the] faith. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Now then why are-you-making-trial-of [the] God to-put (a) yoke on the neck of-the disciples that neither the fathers of-us nor we were-strong-enough to-bear? <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But through the grace of-the Lord Jesus we-believe (us) to-be-saved according-to which way they-also (are saved).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And all the multitude was-silent, and they-were-listening-to Barnabas and Paul recounting as-many┘signs and wonders└as [the] God did among the Gentiles through them. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And after [the] them to-be-silent, James answered, saying, <em>“Men brothers listen-to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Simeon recounted even-as at-the-first [the] God wa</em><em>s-concerned having-taken out-of </em><em>(the) Gentiles (a) people for-the name of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And to-this the words of-the prophets agree, even-as it-has-been-written,</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><strong>‘</strong><strong><em>“After </em></strong><strong><em>these-things</em></strong><strong><em>, I-will-return</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd I-will-rebuild the tabernacle of-David,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>he-one having-</em></strong><strong><em>fallen;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd I-will-rebuild the ruined-things of-it,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and I-will-straighten┘it└</em></strong><strong><em>up;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong><em>in-order-that</em></strong><strong><em><sup>2</sup></em></strong><strong><em> the remainder</em></strong><strong><em>s of-[the] men</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>m</em></strong><strong><em>ay-seek the Lord,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>ven all the nations/Gentiles </em></strong> <strong><em>on whom the name of-me </em></strong><strong><em>has-been-called</em></strong><strong><em> [upon </em></strong> <strong><em>them],</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>says the Lord doing these things,</em></strong> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>known</em><em> </em><em>from of-</em><em>old.</em><em>’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup><em>Wherefore I judge not to-trouble the-ones turning to [the] God from ‘the nations/Gentiles,’ but </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>to-send to-them </em><em>[the] to-abstain from the defilement of-[the] idols and [the] sexual-immorality and the thing strangled and [the] blood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>For Moses from old generations has the-ones preaching him in the synagogues </em><em>according-to (the) city</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>/in every city</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> in which, being-read </em><em>according-to the Sabbath</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>/every Sabbath</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then it-seemed-good to-the apostles and the elders with the whole church, having-chosen men from them to-send (them) to Antioch with [the] Paul and Barnabas, Judas [the] called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>having-written through (the) hands of-them, <em>“The apostles and the elders, brothers, to-the brothers [the] of (the) Gentiles/nations according-to [the] Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>When we-heard that certain-ones [having-gone-out]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> from us troubled you with-words, unsettling the souls of-you, to-whom we-did┘not└give-commandment, </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>it-seemed-good to-us, having-become of-one-accord/agreed, having-chosen men to-send to you with the beloved-ones of-us Barnabas and Paul, </em><strong><em><sup>26</sup></em></strong><em>men having-given the lives of-them on-behalf-of the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>So we-have-sent Judas and Silas and them by word to-report the same-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>For it-seemed-good to-the Holy [the] Spirit and to-us to-lay-on you no more burden than these necessary-things, </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>to-abstain-from idols and blood and things-strangled and sexual-immorality from which, </em><em>thoroughly-keeping</em><em> yourselves, you-will-do well.</em><em> </em><em>Farewell.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And the-ones then, having-been-dismissed, went-down to Antioch; and having-brought-together the multitude, they-delivered the letter. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And having-read (it), they rejoiced over the comfort/encouragement. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Both Judas and Silas, also themselves being prophets, confirmed (them). <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And having-spent time, they-were-dismissed with peace from the brothers to the-ones having-sent them. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>But Paul and Barnabas were-continuing-to-spent-time in Antioch, teaching and preaching/evangelizing the word of-the Lord with also many others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And after certain days, Paul said to Barnabas, <em>“Returning, indeed let-us-visit the brothers </em><em>in-every-city/according-to-(the)-city</em><em> in which we-proclaimed the word of-the Lord (to see) how they-are-doing.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And Barnabas was-wanting to-take-along also [the] John [the-one] called Mark. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>But Paul was-thinking-(it)-best not to-take-along-with-them this-one [the] having-departed from them from Pamphylia and not having-gone with them to the work. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And (a) sharp-disagreement arose so-that they separated from one-another; and [the] Barnabas, having-taken-along [the] Mark, sailed-out to Cyprus, <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>and Paul, having-chosen Silas, went-out having-been-delivered to-the grace of-the Lord by the brothers. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And they-were-passing-through [the] Syria and [the]<sup>ms</sup> Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span>
