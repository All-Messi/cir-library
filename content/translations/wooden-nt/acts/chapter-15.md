## Acts Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And some, having-come-down from [the] Judaea, began-to-teach the brothers [that], "Unless2 you-are-circumcised by-the custom of-[the] Moses, you-are┘not└able to-be-saved." 2And no little dispute and controversy having-arisen by-[the Paul and [the] Barnabas with them, they-appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to-go-up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about [the] this controversy. 3Then the-ones having-been-sent-forward by the church were-passing-through both [the] Phoenicia and Samaria, they-were-relating-fully the conversion of-the Gentiles and they-were-making great joy for-all the brothers. 4And having-passed-on to Jerusalem, they-were-welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they-reported as-many-things-as [the] God did with them. 5And some of-the-ones from the sect of-the Pharisees, having-believed, rose-up, saying that it-is/was-necessary to-circumcise them, and command (them) to-keep the Law of-Moses.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the apostles and the elders assembled to-see about [the] this issue. 7And much questioning/controversy having-arisen, Peter, having-arisen, said to-them, "Men brothers, you know that from early days [the] God chose among you through the mouth of-me (that) [the] Gentiles hear the word of-the gospel and believe. 8And the heart-knower God testified to-them, having-given the Holy [the] Spirit to-them even as also to-us; 9and he-was-making┘no└distinction between both us and them having-cleansed the hearts of-them by-[the] faith. 10Now then why are-you-making-trial-of [the] God to-put (a) yoke on the neck of-the disciples that neither the fathers of-us nor we were-strong-enough to-bear? 11But through the grace of-the Lord Jesus we-believe (us) to-be-saved according-to which way they-also (are saved).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And all the multitude was-silent, and they-were-listening-to Barnabas and Paul recounting as-many┘signs and wonders└as [the] God did among the Gentiles through them. 13And after [the] them to-be-silent, James answered, saying, "Men brothers listen-to me. 14Simeon recounted even-as at-the-first [the] God was-concerned having-taken out-of (the) Gentiles (a) people for-the name of-him. 15And to-this the words of-the prophets agree, even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Wherefore I judge not to-trouble the-ones turning to [the] God from 'the nations/Gentiles,' but 20to-send to-them [the] to-abstain from the defilement of-[the] idols and [the] sexual-immorality and the thing strangled and [the] blood. 21For Moses from old generations has the-ones preaching him in the synagogues according-to (the) city2/in every city2 in which, being-read according-to the Sabbath3/every Sabbath3."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then it-seemed-good to-the apostles and the elders with the whole church, having-chosen men from them to-send (them) to Antioch with [the] Paul and Barnabas, Judas [the] called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, 23having-written through (the) hands of-them, "The apostles and the elders, brothers, to-the brothers [the] of (the) Gentiles/nations according-to [the] Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting. 24When we-heard that certain-ones [having-gone-out]ms from us troubled you with-words, unsettling the souls of-you, to-whom we-did┘not└give-commandment, 25it-seemed-good to-us, having-become of-one-accord/agreed, having-chosen men to-send to you with the beloved-ones of-us Barnabas and Paul, 26men having-given the lives of-them on-behalf-of the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ. 27So we-have-sent Judas and Silas and them by word to-report the same-things. 28For it-seemed-good to-the Holy [the] Spirit and to-us to-lay-on you no more burden than these necessary-things, 29to-abstain-from idols and blood and things-strangled and sexual-immorality from which, thoroughly-keeping yourselves, you-will-do well. Farewell."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the-ones then, having-been-dismissed, went-down to Antioch; and having-brought-together the multitude, they-delivered the letter. 31And having-read (it), they rejoiced over the comfort/encouragement. 32Both Judas and Silas, also themselves being prophets, confirmed (them). 33And having-spent time, they-were-dismissed with peace from the brothers to the-ones having-sent them. 35But Paul and Barnabas were-continuing-to-spent-time in Antioch, teaching and preaching/evangelizing the word of-the Lord with also many others.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And after certain days, Paul said to Barnabas, "Returning, indeed let-us-visit the brothers in-every-city/according-to-(the)-city in which we-proclaimed the word of-the Lord (to see) how they-are-doing." 37And Barnabas was-wanting to-take-along also [the] John [the-one] called Mark. 38But Paul was-thinking-(it)-best not to-take-along-with-them this-one [the] having-departed from them from Pamphylia and not having-gone with them to the work. 39And (a) sharp-disagreement arose so-that they separated from one-another; and [the] Barnabas, having-taken-along [the] Mark, sailed-out to Cyprus, 40and Paul, having-chosen Silas, went-out having-been-delivered to-the grace of-the Lord by the brothers. 41And they-were-passing-through [the] Syria and [the]ms Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span>
