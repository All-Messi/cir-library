## Acts Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And they speaking to the people, the priests and the captain-of-the-temple-guard and the Sadducees confronted them, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>greatly-annoyed on-account-of their teaching the people and proclaiming in [the] Jesus the resurrection [the] of (the) dead. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And they-laid┘[the] hands└on them and put (them) in jail till the next-day, for evening was already. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And many of-the-ones having-heard the word believed, and [the]<sup>ms</sup> number of-the men became [about]<sup>ms</sup> five thousand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And on the next-day it-happened (that) the rulers of-them and the elders and the scribes were-gathered-together in Jerusalem, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and Annas the high-priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as-many-as were of (the) high-priestly family. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And having-stood them in the midst, they began-to-interrogate (them), <em>“By what power or by what name did┘</em><em><u>you</u></em><em>└do this?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then Peter, filled with-(the)-Holy Spirit, said to them, <em>“Rulers of-the people and elders, </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>if </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> today are-bein</em><em>g-exami</em><em>ned over (the) good-deed of-(a)</em><em>-sick man—by what this-one has-been-saved/healed, </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>let-it-be known to-you and to-all the people of-Israel that by the name of-Jesus Christ </em><em>the Nazarene whom </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> crucified, whom [the] God raised from (the) dead—by this-One this-one stands before you well.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>This-One is</em> <strong><em>‘The S</em></strong><strong><em>tone, the-One having-been-rejected by you the builders,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the-One having-become [for] (the) head of-(the) corner.’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>And [the</em><em>] salvation is not in any other;</em><em> no other name is under the sky the-One having-been-given among men by whom it-is-necessary-for us to-be-saved.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And seeing the boldness of [the] Peter and John, and realizing that they-are/were unlearned and laymen, they-were-marveling and were-well-aware-of them that they were with [the] Jesus, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and looking-at the man standing with them healed, they-were-having nothing to-reply. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But having-commanded them to-go-away outside the Sanhedrin, they-began-to-counsel with one-another, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>saying, <em>“What shall-we-do to-[the] these men? for because (a) notable/known sign through them has-become apparent to-all the-ones dwelling-in Jerusalem, and we-are┘└able to-deny (it); </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>but in-order-that it┘not└spread to more into the people, let-us-warn them no-longer to-speak in the name of-this-One to-none/any of-men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And having-called them, they-ordered (them) not┘at-all<sup>2</sup>└to-speak or teach in the name of-the Jesus, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and [the] Peter and John, having-answered, said to them, <em>“Whether it-is right before [the] God to-listen-to you rather than</em><em> to-</em><em>[the] God, you-judge; </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>for </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> are┘not└able not to-speak what-things we-saw and heard.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the-ones being-threatened-further, they-released them, finding nothing [the] how they-might-punish them on-account-of the people, because they┘all└were-glorifying [the] God over the-thing having-happened. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For the man was of-more than forty-years on whom [the] this sign of-[the] healing had-taken-place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And having-been-released, they-went to [the] their-own (people) and reported as-many-things-as the chief-priests and the elders said to them. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And the-ones/they, having-heard, together raised (their) voice to [the] God and said, <em>“Master, you the-One having-made the sky and the earth and the sea and all the-things in them, </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>the-One having-spoken through (the) Holy Spirit (through the) mouth of-David your servant, the father of-us,</em> <strong><em>‘Why did (the) nations rage</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and </em></strong><strong><em>(the)</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>peoples</em></strong><strong><em> imagine </em></strong><strong><em>empty-things</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><strong><em>The kings of-the earth stood-together</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and the rulers </em></strong><strong><em>gathered together</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>against the Lord </em></strong> <strong><em>and against the Anointed-One/Messiah/Christ of/him.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>For ‘they gathered’ assuredly</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> in [the] this city against the Holy Servant of-you, Jesus, whom you ‘anointed,’ both Herod and Pontius Pilate with (the) ‘</em><em>nations’</em><em> </em><em>and the ‘people’ of-Israel, </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>to-do as-many-things-as the hand of-you and the plan of-you predestined to-occur.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>And the-things now, Lord, look on the threats of-them and give to-the servants of-you to-speak the word of-you with all boldness.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>And you stretched-out with the hand [of-you]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> to healing and signs and wonders to-happen through the name of-the ‘Holy Servant’ Jesus.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And they-having-prayed, the place in which they-were assembled was-shaken, and all were-filled with-the Holy Spirit and began to-speak the word of-[the] God with boldness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Now (the) heart and soul of-the multitude of-the-ones having-believed was one, and not-even one was-saying anything of-the/his possessions to-be his-own, but all-things were common to-them. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And with great power the apostles were delivering the testimony of-the resurrection of-the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>For not anybody was needy among them, for as-many-as were owners of pieces-of-land and of-houses, selling (them), were bringing the values/prices of-the-things having-been-sold, <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>and they-were-putting (them) at the feet of-the apostles, it-was-being distributed to-each even-as<sup>2</sup> anybody was-having-need. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And Joseph [the] called Barnabas by the apostles, which is translated “Son-of-Encouragement,” (as) Levite, (a) Cypriot by-[the] background/race, <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>(a) field being to-him, having-sold (it), brought the proceeds and laid (it) at the feet of-the apostles.</span>
