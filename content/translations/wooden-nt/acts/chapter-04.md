## Acts Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And they speaking to the people, the priests and the captain-of-the-temple-guard and the Sadducees confronted them, 2greatly-annoyed on-account-of their teaching the people and proclaiming in [the] Jesus the resurrection [the] of (the) dead. 3And they-laid┘[the] hands└on them and put (them) in jail till the next-day, for evening was already. 4And many of-the-ones having-heard the word believed, and [the]ms number of-the men became [about]ms five thousand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And on the next-day it-happened (that) the rulers of-them and the elders and the scribes were-gathered-together in Jerusalem, 6and Annas the high-priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as-many-as were of (the) high-priestly family. 7And having-stood them in the midst, they began-to-interrogate (them),</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then Peter, filled with-(the)-Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of-the people and elders, 9if we today are-being-examined over (the) good-deed of-(a)-sick man—by what this-one has-been-saved/healed, 10let-it-be known to-you and to-all the people of-Israel that by the name of-Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom you crucified, whom [the] God raised from (the) dead—by this-One this-one stands before you well. 11This-One is</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And [the] salvation is not in any other; no other name is under the sky the-One having-been-given among men by whom it-is-necessary-for us to-be-saved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And seeing the boldness of [the] Peter and John, and realizing that they-are/were unlearned and laymen, they-were-marveling and were-well-aware-of them that they were with [the] Jesus, 14and looking-at the man standing with them healed, they-were-having nothing to-reply. 15But having-commanded them to-go-away outside the Sanhedrin, they-began-to-counsel with one-another, 16saying, "What shall-we-do to-[the] these men? for because (a) notable/known sign through them has-become apparent to-all the-ones dwelling-in Jerusalem, and we-are┘└able to-deny (it); 17but in-order-that it┘not└spread to more into the people, let-us-warn them no-longer to-speak in the name of-this-One to-none/any of-men."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And having-called them, they-ordered (them) not┘at-all2└to-speak or teach in the name of-the Jesus, 19and [the] Peter and John, having-answered, said to them, "Whether it-is right before [the] God to-listen-to you rather than to-[the] God, you-judge; 20for we are┘not└able not to-speak what-things we-saw and heard."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the-ones being-threatened-further, they-released them, finding nothing [the] how they-might-punish them on-account-of the people, because they┘all└were-glorifying [the] God over the-thing having-happened. 22For the man was of-more than forty-years on whom [the] this sign of-[the] healing had-taken-place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And having-been-released, they-went to [the] their-own (people) and reported as-many-things-as the chief-priests and the elders said to them. 24And the-ones/they, having-heard, together raised (their) voice to [the] God and said, "Master, you the-One having-made the sky and the earth and the sea and all the-things in them, 25the-One having-spoken through (the) Holy Spirit (through the) mouth of-David your servant, the father of-us,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The kings of-the earth stood-together,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> For 'they gathered' assuredly2 in [the] this city against the Holy Servant of-you, Jesus, whom you 'anointed,' both Herod and Pontius Pilate with (the) 'nations' and the 'people' of-Israel, 28to-do as-many-things-as the hand of-you and the plan of-you predestined to-occur. 29And the-things now, Lord, look on the threats of-them and give to-the servants of-you to-speak the word of-you with all boldness. 30And you stretched-out with the hand [of-you]ms to healing and signs and wonders to-happen through the name of-the 'Holy Servant' Jesus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And they-having-prayed, the place in which they-were assembled was-shaken, and all were-filled with-the Holy Spirit and began to-speak the word of-[the] God with boldness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Now (the) heart and soul of-the multitude of-the-ones having-believed was one, and not-even one was-saying anything of-the/his possessions to-be his-own, but all-things were common to-them. 33And with great power the apostles were delivering the testimony of-the resurrection of-the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all. 34For not anybody was needy among them, for as-many-as were owners of pieces-of-land and of-houses, selling (them), were bringing the values/prices of-the-things having-been-sold, 35and they-were-putting (them) at the feet of-the apostles, it-was-being distributed to-each even-as2 anybody was-having-need. 36And Joseph [the] called Barnabas by the apostles, which is translated "Son-of-Encouragement," (as) Levite, (a) Cypriot by-[the] background/race, 37(a) field being to-him, having-sold (it), brought the proceeds and laid (it) at the feet of-the apostles.</span>
