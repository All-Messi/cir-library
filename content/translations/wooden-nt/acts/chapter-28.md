## Acts Chapter **28**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-been-saved/having-escaped, then we-came-to know that the island was-called Malta/Melite<sup>ms</sup>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the natives were-showing to-us no [the] little/usual kindness; for, having-kindled (a) fire on-account-of the present [the] rain and on-account-of the cold, they-welcomed us all. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And Paul, having-gathered a-certain bundle of-sticks and having-put (it) on the fire, (a) viper, having-come-out from the heat, fastened-on the hand of-him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And when the natives saw the beast hanging from the hand of-him, they-began-to-say to one-another, <em>“Surely [the] this man is (a) murderer, whom, h</em><em>aving-escaped/having-been-saved-</em><em>from </em><em>the sea, [the] j</em><em>ustice did┘not└allow to-live.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He then, having-shaken-off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the-ones were-expecting him to-be-about to-be-swollen or to-fall-down suddenly dead; but after much (time) they expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, changing-their-minds, they-began-to-say him to-be (a) god.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now in the-things around the [that] place, lands were to-the first/chief (man) of-the island, Publius by-name, who having-welcomed us, entertained us hospitably for-three days. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And it-was that the father of-Publius to-be-lying sick with-fever and dysentery, to-whom [the] Paul, having-entered-in, having-prayed, having-laid┘hands└on him healed him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And this having-happened, also the rest [the] in/on the island having sicknesses were-coming and were-being-healed, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>who also with-many honors honored us; and for-(the ones)-sailing, they-put-on (the boat) the-things unto the necessities.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And after three months we-set-sail in (an) Alexandrian boat having-wintered on the island, with-the-figurehead Dioscuri. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And, having-put-in at Syracuse, we-remained three days; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>whence, weighing anchor, we-reached Rhegium, and after one day we-came to Puteoli, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>where, having-found brothers, we-were-encouraged by them to-remain seven days, and so we-came into [the] Rome. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And from there the brothers, having-heard the-things about us, came for (a) meeting as-far-as (the) Forum of-Appius and Three Tavern, whom [the] Paul, having-seen, having-thanked [the] God, took courage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And when we-entered into Rome, it-was-allowed to-[the] Paul to-remain by himself with the/a soldier guarding him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And it-was, after three days him to-summon the-ones being first of-the Jews; and they, having-come-together, he-began-to-say to them, <em>“I, men brothers, having-done nothing against the people or the ancestral [the] customs, was delivered bound into the hands of-the Romans, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>who, having-examined me, were-wanting to-release (me) on-account-of </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> being no cause of-death in me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>But the Jews objecting, I-was-compelled to-appeal to-Caesar, not as-if having-anything to-accuse the nation of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>So on-account-of this [the] reason, I-called to-see you and to-speak-to (you), for for-the-sake-of the hope of-[the] Israel I-am-bound with-respect-to [the] this chain.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And they said to him, “</em><em><u>We</u></em><em> receive</em><em>d</em><em> neither letters about you from the Jews</em><em>;</em><em> nor any of-the-brothers, having-been-present, reported or said anything evil about you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> we-request to-hear what-things you-think, for about [the]</em><em> </em><em>this </em><em>faction</em><em>/sect</em><em> it-</em><em>is</em><em> known to-us that everywhere it-is-spoken-against</em><em>/opposed</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-appointed to-him (a) day, very-many came to him into the/his guest-room, to-whom he-expounded, thoroughly-testifying the kingdom of-[the] God, and trying-to-persuade them both about [the] Jesus and from the Law of-Moses and the prophets, from morning to evening. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And some were-persuaded by-the-things spoken, and some disbelieved. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And being un-agreed with one-another, they-left, Paul having-spoken one word, that <em>“Well did┘the Holy Spirit└speak through Isaiah the prophet to the fathers of-you, </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>saying,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Prophesy to [the] </em></strong><strong><em>this</em></strong><strong><em> people and say,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>“You-will┘certainly└hear</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd </em></strong><strong><em>certainly not </em></strong><strong><em>understand;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd you-will┘certainly└see</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd certainly not </em></strong><strong><em>perceive;</em></strong></span>
