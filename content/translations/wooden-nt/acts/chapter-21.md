## Acts Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And when it-happened [that] we had-debarked, having-departed from them, having-run-(a)-straight-course, we-came to [the] Cos and on-the next-day to [the] Rhodes and-from-there to Patara, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and, having-found (a) ship crossing to [the] Phoenix, having-boarded, we-set-sail. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-come-in-sight-of [the] Cyprus and having-left┘it└behind on-the-left we-kept/were-sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was-unloading the/its cargo. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And looking-up [the] disciples remained there seven days, who kept-saying to-[the] Paul through/by the Holy Spirit not to-go-on to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But it-happened when the days were-finished, having-gone-out, we-started-to-travel, all with wives and children—until outside the city, and having-put the knees on the beach, praying—having-sent┘us└forward, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>we-said-goodbye-to one-another and boarded [into] the ship, and those returned into [the] their-own-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And we, having-completed the voyage from Tyre, reached Ptolemais, and, having-greeted the brothers, remained with them for-one day. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And on-the next-day, having-left, we-came to Caesarea, and having-entered into the house of-Philip the evangelist, being of-the seven, we-remained with him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Now to-this-one were four virgin daughters prophesying. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And we remaining for several days, a-certain prophet came-down from Judaea, Agabus by-name. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And having come to us and having-taken the belt of-[the] Paul, having-bound the feet and the hands of-himself, said, <em>“</em><em>The Holy Spirit says these-things, ‘The man of-whom is [the] this b</em><em>elt thus the Jews will-bind in J</em><em>erusalem</em><em>,</em><em> and they-will-deliver to (the) hands of-(the)-Gentiles.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And when we-heard these-things, both <u>we</u> and the locals began-urging him [the] not to-go-up to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Then [the] Paul answered, <em>“What are-you-doing crying and breaking-in-pieces the heart of-me?</em><em> </em><em>For </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> </em><em>have readily/am prepared</em><em>, not only to-be-bound, but also to-die in Jerusalem on-behalf-of the name of-the Lord Jesus.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Now he not being-persuaded, we-became-quiet, having-said, <em>“May┘the will of-the Lord└happen.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Now after [the] these days, having-gotten-ready, we-started-to-go-up to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And they┘also of-the disciples from Caesarea└went-along with us, leading (us) to-Mnason, (a)-certain Cyprian, (a) long-time disciple with whom we-would-lodge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now we having-arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And on-the next-day [the] Paul went-in with us to James, and all the elders became/were-present. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And having-greeted them, he-began-to-relate each one-by-one<sup>2</sup> of-what-things [the] God did among the Gentiles through the ministry of-him. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And the-ones having-heard were-glorifying [the] God and said to-him, <em>“You-see, brother, how-many myriads/ten-thousands are among the Jews of-the-ones having-</em><em>believed</em><em> and all are zealots of-the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And they-were-taught concerning you that you-teach all the Jews according-to the Gentiles </em><em>apostasy</em><em> from Moses, saying them not to-circumcise the/their children nor to-walk by-the customs.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>What </em><em>is-it</em><em> them?</em><em> </em><em>Surely</em><em> </em><em>they-will-hear</em><em> that </em><em>you-have-c</em><em>om</em><em>e</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Therefore do this that we-say-to-you.</em><em> </em><em>Four men are to-us having (a) vow on themselves.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Having-taken</em><em> these, be-sanctified with them and pay-the-expenses/support/finance for them in-order-that they-will-</em><em>shave the/their head, and all will-know that nothing is of-what-things they-have-been-taught concerning you, but </em><em>you</em><em> also yourself conduct-yourself, keeping the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>And concerning the having-believed Gentiles </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> instructed-by-letter,</em><em> </em><em>having-decided them to-guard</em><em>-against both [the] idolatry and blood and (the) strangled-thing and sexual-immorality.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then [the] Paul, having-taken the men on-the-next day, having-been-sanctified with them, went into the temple reporting/giving-notice the completion of-the days of-[the] sanctification until<sup>2 </sup>the offering/sacrifice was-offered on-behalf-of each one of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now when the seven days were-about to-be-completed, [the] Jews from [the] Asia, having-seen him in the temple, began stirring-up all the crowd and laid [the] hands on him, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>shouting, <em>“Men Jerusalemites, help; this is the man the-one teaching all everywhere against the people and the </em><em>L</em><em>aw and [the] this place, and besides also brought-in Greeks into the temple and has-defiled [the] this holy place.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> For they-beforehand-had-seen<sup>2</sup> Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him whom they were-supposing [the] Paul brought into the temple. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And the whole city was-aroused and (a) concourse/rushing-together of-the people occurred; and, laying-hold of-[the] Paul, they-started dragging him outside the temple and immediately the doors/gates were-closed. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And they trying to-kill him, (a) report went-up to-the tribune/chiliarch of-the cohort that all Jerusalem was-being-stirred-up; <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>who immediately, taking-along soldiers and centurions, ran-down on them; and the-ones having-seen the tribune/chiliarch and the soldiers stopped beating [the] Paul. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The tribune/chiliarch, having-come-up, laid-hold of-him and commanded (him) to-be-bound with two chains, and began-asking who he-might-be and what he-had-done2.  <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But among the crowd some were shouting something other. And he not being-able to-come-to-know certainly<sup>2</sup> on-account-of the uproar, he-commanded him to-be-led into the barracks. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And when he-got on the stairs, it-came-about (that) he-was-being-carried by the soldiers on-account-of the violence of-the crowd/mob, <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>for the crowd of-the people was-following, shouting, <em>“</em><em>Tak</em><em>e</em><em>┘</em><em>him</em><em>└</em><em>away!/</em><em>Away with him!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And being-about to-enter into the barracks, [the] Paul says to-the tribune/chiliarch [whether], <em>“Is-it-possible for-me to-say something to you?”</em> And he-said, <em>“Do-you-know Greek?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Then </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are not</em><em>-</em><em>,</em><em>-</em><em>are-you, the Egyptian the-one before these [the] days having-stirred-up-a-revolt and having-led into the desert the four thousand men of-the Assassins?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And [the] Paul said, <em>“</em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am (a) Jewish man, (a) Tarsian of-[the] Cilicia, (a) citizen of┘no└insignificant city.</em><em> </em><em>And I-ask you, permit me to speak to the people.</em><em>”</em></span>
