## Acts Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And when it-happened [that] we had-debarked, having-departed from them, having-run-(a)-straight-course, we-came to [the] Cos and on-the next-day to [the] Rhodes and-from-there to Patara, 2and, having-found (a) ship crossing to [the] Phoenix, having-boarded, we-set-sail. 3And having-come-in-sight-of [the] Cyprus and having-left┘it└behind on-the-left we-kept/were-sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was-unloading the/its cargo. 4And looking-up [the] disciples remained there seven days, who kept-saying to-[the] Paul through/by the Holy Spirit not to-go-on to Jerusalem. 5But it-happened when the days were-finished, having-gone-out, we-started-to-travel, all with wives and children—until outside the city, and having-put the knees on the beach, praying—having-sent┘us└forward, 6we-said-goodbye-to one-another and boarded [into] the ship, and those returned into [the] their-own-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And we, having-completed the voyage from Tyre, reached Ptolemais, and, having-greeted the brothers, remained with them for-one day. 8And on-the next-day, having-left, we-came to Caesarea, and having-entered into the house of-Philip the evangelist, being of-the seven, we-remained with him. 9Now to-this-one were four virgin daughters prophesying. 10And we remaining for several days, a-certain prophet came-down from Judaea, Agabus by-name. 11And having come to us and having-taken the belt of-[the] Paul, having-bound the feet and the hands of-himself, said, "The Holy Spirit says these-things, 'The man of-whom is [the] this belt thus the Jews will-bind in Jerusalem, and they-will-deliver to (the) hands of-(the)-Gentiles.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And when we-heard these-things, both we and the locals began-urging him [the] not to-go-up to Jerusalem. 13Then [the] Paul answered, "What are-you-doing crying and breaking-in-pieces the heart of-me? For I have readily/am prepared, not only to-be-bound, but also to-die in Jerusalem on-behalf-of the name of-the Lord Jesus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Now he not being-persuaded, we-became-quiet, having-said, "May┘the will of-the Lord└happen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Now after [the] these days, having-gotten-ready, we-started-to-go-up to Jerusalem. 16And they┘also of-the disciples from Caesarea└went-along with us, leading (us) to-Mnason, (a)-certain Cyprian, (a) long-time disciple with whom we-would-lodge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Now we having-arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. 18And on-the next-day [the] Paul went-in with us to James, and all the elders became/were-present. 19And having-greeted them, he-began-to-relate each one-by-one2 of-what-things [the] God did among the Gentiles through the ministry of-him. 20And the-ones having-heard were-glorifying [the] God and said to-him, "You-see, brother, how-many myriads/ten-thousands are among the Jews of-the-ones having-believed and all are zealots of-the Law. 21And they-were-taught concerning you that you-teach all the Jews according-to the Gentiles apostasy from Moses, saying them not to-circumcise the/their children nor to-walk by-the customs. 22What is-it them? Surely they-will-hear that you-have-come. 23Therefore do this that we-say-to-you. Four men are to-us having (a) vow on themselves. 24Having-taken these, be-sanctified with them and pay-the-expenses/support/finance for them in-order-that they-will-shave the/their head, and all will-know that nothing is of-what-things they-have-been-taught concerning you, but you also yourself conduct-yourself, keeping the Law. 25And concerning the having-believed Gentiles we instructed-by-letter, having-decided them to-guard-against both [the] idolatry and blood and (the) strangled-thing and sexual-immorality."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then [the] Paul, having-taken the men on-the-next day, having-been-sanctified with them, went into the temple reporting/giving-notice the completion of-the days of-[the] sanctification until2 the offering/sacrifice was-offered on-behalf-of each one of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Now when the seven days were-about to-be-completed, [the] Jews from [the] Asia, having-seen him in the temple, began stirring-up all the crowd and laid [the] hands on him, 28shouting, "Men Jerusalemites, help; this is the man the-one teaching all everywhere against the people and the Law and [the] this place, and besides also brought-in Greeks into the temple and has-defiled [the] this holy place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> For they-beforehand-had-seen2 Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him whom they were-supposing [the] Paul brought into the temple. 30And the whole city was-aroused and (a) concourse/rushing-together of-the people occurred; and, laying-hold of-[the] Paul, they-started dragging him outside the temple and immediately the doors/gates were-closed. 31And they trying to-kill him, (a) report went-up to-the tribune/chiliarch of-the cohort that all Jerusalem was-being-stirred-up; 32who immediately, taking-along soldiers and centurions, ran-down on them; and the-ones having-seen the tribune/chiliarch and the soldiers stopped beating [the] Paul. 33The tribune/chiliarch, having-come-up, laid-hold of-him and commanded (him) to-be-bound with two chains, and began-asking who he-might-be and what he-had-done2.  34But among the crowd some were shouting something other. And he not being-able to-come-to-know certainly2 on-account-of the uproar, he-commanded him to-be-led into the barracks. 35And when he-got on the stairs, it-came-about (that) he-was-being-carried by the soldiers on-account-of the violence of-the crowd/mob, 36for the crowd of-the people was-following, shouting, "Take┘him└away!/Away with him!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And being-about to-enter into the barracks, [the] Paul says to-the tribune/chiliarch [whether], "Is-it-possible for-me to-say something to you?" And he-said, "Do-you-know Greek? 38Then you are not-,-are-you, the Egyptian the-one before these [the] days having-stirred-up-a-revolt and having-led into the desert the four thousand men of-the Assassins?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And [the] Paul said, "I am (a) Jewish man, (a) Tarsian of-[the] Cilicia, (a) citizen of┘no└insignificant city. And I-ask you, permit me to speak to the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And he having-permitted, [the] Paul, standing on the stairs, signaled with-the/his hand to-the people, and all silence having-become, he-spoke (to them) in-the Hebrew dialect, saying,</span>
