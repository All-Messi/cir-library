## Jude Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Jude, servant of-Jesus Christ and brother of-James, to-the-ones having-been-beloved by God (the) Father and having-been-kept by-Jesus Christ, elect.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Mercy to-you and peace and love be-multiplied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Beloved, making all diligence to-write to-you about the shared salvation of-us, I-had necessity to-write to-you, urging (you) to-keep-contending-strongly for-the faith once-and-for-all delivered to-the saints.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For some men sneaked-in-under-false-pretenses, the-ones long-ago having-been-written-beforehand to this [the] condemnation, ungodly, having-perverted the grace of-[the] our God into sensuality, and denying the only Master and Lord of-us Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Now I-want to-remind you<sup>acc</sup>, knowing<sup>acc</sup> all-things once-and-for-all, that [Jesus]/[God]/[Lord]<sup>ms</sup>, having-saved (a) people out-of (the) land of-Egypt, afterward<sup>2</sup>/the second-[time] destroyed the-ones not having-trusted/believed.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And angels the-ones not having-kept the domain of-them, but having-abandoned [the] their abode, he-has-kept for judgment of-(the)-great day in-permanent bonds under gloom/darkness, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them the same way, having-lived-immorally and having-gone-away after other flesh, are-set-forward (as an) example being-subjected-to (a) judgment of-eternal fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>However, likewise also these-(men), having-visons/dreaming, defile (the) flesh, reject authority, and slander/blaspheme glories/angelic-majesties, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and [the] Michael the archangel, when disputing-with the devil, argued about the body of-Moses, did┘not└take-it-on-himself to-bring railing condemnation, but said, “(The) Lord rebuke you.”  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But these revile-slander-blaspheme as-many-things-as they-do┘not└know/understand, but as-many-things-as they-know by-instinct like [the] unspeaking animals—by these they-destroy themselves.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Woe to-them! because they-went the way of-[the] Cain, and plunged-into the deception of-[the] Balaam for-pay, and perished at-the rebellion of-[the] Korah.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>There are [the] hidden-rocks in the love-feasts of-you, carousing fearlessly, shepherding themselves, wandering stars to-whom the gloom of-[the] darkness has-been-kept forever<sup>2</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>And Enoch, seventh from Adam, also prophesied about-them, saying, “Behold, (the) Lord came with ten-thousand holy-ones of-him <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>to-do judgment against all, to convict every soul about all the deeds of-(the)-ungodliness of-them and about all the harsh-things that ungodly spoke against hm.”  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>These are grumblers, complainers, going according-to the lusts of-them, and the mouth of-them speaks boastful-things, flattering people for-the-sake-of gain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>But you, beloved, remember the words [the] having-been-spoken-beforehand by the apostles of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>that they-used-to keep/they-used-to-say to-you, “In-(the)-last time mockers will-be, going according-to the ungodly [the] lusts of-them.”  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>These are the-ones causing-divisions, materialistic, not having spirit.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But <u>you</u>, beloved, build┘yourselves└up with-the most-holy faith of-you, praying in (the) Holy Spirit, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>keep yourselves (the) love of-God, waiting-for the mercy of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ for eternal life; <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and have-mercy-on some (who are) doubting; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and save some, snatching (them) from (the) fire; and have-mercy-on some with fear, hating even the garment spotted/stained/soiled by the flesh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Now to-the-One able to-keep┘you└from stumbling and to-stand (you) blameless before the glory of-him with great-joy, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>to-the only God (the) Savior of-us through Jesus Christ the Lord of-us (be) glory, majesty, might, and authority before all the age/world/time both now and forever<sup>4</sup>.  Amen.</span>
