## Jude Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jude, servant of-Jesus Christ and brother of-James, to-the-ones having-been-beloved by God (the) Father and having-been-kept by-Jesus Christ, elect.  2Mercy to-you and peace and love be-multiplied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Beloved, making all diligence to-write to-you about the shared salvation of-us, I-had necessity to-write to-you, urging (you) to-keep-contending-strongly for-the faith once-and-for-all delivered to-the saints.  4For some men sneaked-in-under-false-pretenses, the-ones long-ago having-been-written-beforehand to this [the] condemnation, ungodly, having-perverted the grace of-[the] our God into sensuality, and denying the only Master and Lord of-us Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now I-want to-remind youacc, knowingacc all-things once-and-for-all, that [Jesus]/[God]/[Lord]ms, having-saved (a) people out-of (the) land of-Egypt, afterward2/the second-[time] destroyed the-ones not having-trusted/believed.  6And angels the-ones not having-kept the domain of-them, but having-abandoned [the] their abode, he-has-kept for judgment of-(the)-great day in-permanent bonds under gloom/darkness, 7like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them the same way, having-lived-immorally and having-gone-away after other flesh, are-set-forward (as an) example being-subjected-to (a) judgment of-eternal fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> However, likewise also these-(men), having-visons/dreaming, defile (the) flesh, reject authority, and slander/blaspheme glories/angelic-majesties, 9and [the] Michael the archangel, when disputing-with the devil, argued about the body of-Moses, did┘not└take-it-on-himself to-bring railing condemnation, but said, "(The) Lord rebuke you."  10But these revile-slander-blaspheme as-many-things-as they-do┘not└know/understand, but as-many-things-as they-know by-instinct like [the] unspeaking animals—by these they-destroy themselves.  11Woe to-them! because they-went the way of-[the] Cain, and plunged-into the deception of-[the] Balaam for-pay, and perished at-the rebellion of-[the] Korah.  12There are [the] hidden-rocks in the love-feasts of-you, carousing fearlessly, shepherding themselves, wandering stars to-whom the gloom of-[the] darkness has-been-kept forever2.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And Enoch, seventh from Adam, also prophesied about-them, saying, "Behold, (the) Lord came with ten-thousand holy-ones of-him 15to-do judgment against all, to convict every soul about all the deeds of-(the)-ungodliness of-them and about all the harsh-things that ungodly spoke against hm."  16These are grumblers, complainers, going according-to the lusts of-them, and the mouth of-them speaks boastful-things, flattering people for-the-sake-of gain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But you, beloved, remember the words [the] having-been-spoken-beforehand by the apostles of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, 18that they-used-to keep/they-used-to-say to-you, "In-(the)-last time mockers will-be, going according-to the ungodly [the] lusts of-them."  19These are the-ones causing-divisions, materialistic, not having spirit.  20But you, beloved, build┘yourselves└up with-the most-holy faith of-you, praying in (the) Holy Spirit, 21keep yourselves (the) love of-God, waiting-for the mercy of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ for eternal life; 22and have-mercy-on some (who are) doubting; 23and save some, snatching (them) from (the) fire; and have-mercy-on some with fear, hating even the garment spotted/stained/soiled by the flesh.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Now to-the-One able to-keep┘you└from stumbling and to-stand (you) blameless before the glory of-him with great-joy, 25to-the only God (the) Savior of-us through Jesus Christ the Lord of-us (be) glory, majesty, might, and authority before all the age/world/time both now and forever4.  Amen.</span>
