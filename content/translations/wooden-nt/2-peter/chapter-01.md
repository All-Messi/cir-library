## 2 Peter Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Simon Peter, servant and apostle of-Jesus Christ, to-the-ones having-received (a) faith of-the-same kind-as to-us by (the) righteousness of-the God and Savior of-us Jesus Christ.  2Grace to-you and peace be-multiplied in (the) knowledge of-God and of-Jesus the Lord of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As the divine power of-him having-been-given to-us with-respect-to-all-things [the] pertaining-to life and godliness through the knowledge of-the One having-called us by-his-own glory and virtue 4by which-things he-has-given to-us the precious and very-great promises, in-order-that through these-things you-might-become sharers of-(the)-divine nature, having-escaped the corruption in the world in lust.  5And because-of-this itself, having-exerted all diligence, in the faith of-you supply [the] virtue, and in the/your virtue (supply) [the] knowledge, 6and in the/your knowledge (supply) [the] self-control, and in the/your self-control (supply) [the] patience, and in the/your patience (supply) [the] godliness, 7and in the/your godliness (supply) brotherly-kindness, and in the/your brotherly-kindness (supply) love.  8For these-things being to-you and increasing, they-do┘not└make (you) useless or unfruitful unto the knowledge of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ. 9For to-whom these-things are┘not└present, he-is blind, short-sighted, having-received forgetfulness of-the cleansing of-the old sins of-him.  10Wherefore rather, brothers, be-diligent to-make firm the calling and election of-you, for these-things doing you-will┘certainly not ever└stumble.  11For thus richly/abundantly will-be-supplied to-you [the] entrance into the eternal kingdom of-the Lord and Savior of-us Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Wherefore I-will always remind you about these-things although knowing and made-firm in the present truth.  13And I-regard (it as) just, as-long-as2 I-am in this [the] tabernacle, to-stir┘you└up in remembrance, 14knowing that the laying-aside/putting-off of-the tabernacle of-me is soon/swift-in-coming, even-as also the Lord of-us Jesus Christ showed me.  15And I-will-be-diligent also at-any-time to-have you after [the] my departure/exodus to-make [the] remembrance of-these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> For not having-followed-after cleverly-formal myths, we-made-known to-you the power and coming of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, but having-become eyewitnesses of-the majesty of-that-One.  17For having-received from God (the) Father honor and glory, (a) voice borne to-him of-such-kind by the Majestic Glory, "This is the beloved [the] Son of-me in whom I delighted."  18And we heard this [the] voice borne from heaven, being with him in the holy mountain.  19And we-have the prophetic word more firm to/in which you-do well, heeding as to (a) lamp shining in (a) dark place, until2 (the) day dawns and (the) morning-star arises in the hearts of-you, 20knowing this first that every prophecy of-scripture is-not o/from one's-own prognostication, 21for prophecy at-any-time was┘not└carried by-(the)-will of-man, but men spoke from God carried by (the) Holy Spirit.</span>
