## 2 Peter Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Indeed, brothers, I-am-writing to-you this, (a) second letter in whichpl I-am-stirring-up in remembrance the sincere mind of-you 2to-remember the beforehand-written words by the holy prophets and the commandment of-the apostles of-you, (the commandment) of-the Lord and Savior, 3knowing this first that mockers will-come with mockery (the) last of-the-days going/pursuing according-to [the] their-own lusts of-them, 4and saying, "Where is the promise of-the coming/presence of-him, for from which the fathers/ancestors fell-asleep, all-things remain thus from (the) beginning of-creation?"  5For them willing, this escapes-(their)-notice:  that skies were of-old and land standing out-of water and through water by the word of-[the] God, 6on-account-of whichms the then world was-destroyed having-been-flooded by water.  7But now the skies and the earth by the same word have-been treasured-up for-fire, being-kept for-(the)-day of judgment and destruction of-[the] ungodly men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But let┘not one-thing└escape you, beloved, that one day with (the) Lord is like (a) thousand years and (a) thousand years as one day.  9(The) Lord does┘not└delay the promise (of him) as some consider delay, but is-longsuffering toward us, not wanting anypl to-perish, but all to-make-room-for repentance.  10But (the) day of-(the)-Lord will-come like (a) thief in which the heavens with-a-loud-noise will-pass-away, and (the) elements will-be-destroyed by-being-burned-up, and (the) earth and the works in it will┘not└be-found.  11All these-things thus being-destroyed, what-kind-of-(people) is-it-necessary for-you to-be in holy conduct and godliness, 12looking-for and hastening/rushing the presence/coming of-the day of-[the] God on-account-of which the heavens, burning, will-be-destroyed and (the) elements will-be-melted by-being-burned-up.  13But (a) new heavens and (a) new earth let-us-look-for according-to the promise of-him in which righteousness dwells.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Wherefore, beloved, looking-for these-things, be-diligent to-be-found by him in peace spotless and blameless, 15and consider as-salvation the longsuffering of-the Lord of-us, even-as also the beloved brother of-us Paul according-to the wisdom given to-him wrote to-you, 16as also in all the/his letters, speaking in them about these-things in which are some difficult-tings that the unlearned and unsteady/weak will-twist-distort as also the rest-of scriptures to [the[ their-own destruction of-them.  17Therefore you, beloved, knowing-ahead-of-time, be-on-guard in-order-that you-may┘not└fall-from [the] your steadfastness, being-led-away by the error of-[the] morally-corrupt-((men).  18But grow in (the) grace and knowledge of-the Lord and Savior of-us Jesus Christ.  To-him (be) glory both now and forever3.</span>
