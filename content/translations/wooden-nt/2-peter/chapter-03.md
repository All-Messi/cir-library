## 2 Peter Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Indeed, brothers, I-am-writing to-you this, (a) second letter in which<sup>pl</sup> I-am-stirring-up in remembrance the sincere mind of-you <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to-remember the beforehand-written words by the holy prophets and the commandment of-the apostles of-you, (the commandment) of-the Lord and Savior, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>knowing this first that mockers will-come with mockery (the) last of-the-days going/pursuing according-to [the] their-own lusts of-them, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and saying, <em>“Where is the promise of-the coming/presence of-him, for from which the fathers/ancestors fell-asleep, all-things remain thus from (the) beginning of-creation?” </em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For them willing, this escapes-(their)-notice:  that skies were of-old and land standing out-of water and through water by the word of-[the] God, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>on-account-of which<sup>ms</sup> the then world was-destroyed having-been-flooded by water.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But now the skies and the earth by the same word have-been treasured-up for-fire, being-kept<sup> </sup>for-(the)-day of judgment and destruction of-[the] ungodly men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>But let┘not one-thing└escape you, beloved, that one day with (the) Lord is like (a) thousand years and (a) thousand years as one day.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>(The) Lord does┘not└delay the promise (of him) as some consider delay, but is-longsuffering toward us, not wanting any<sup>pl</sup> to-perish, but all to-make-room-for repentance.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But (the) day of-(the)-Lord will-come like (a) thief in which the heavens with-a-loud-noise will-pass-away, and (the) elements will-be-destroyed by-being-burned-up, and (the) earth and the works in it will┘not└be-found.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>All these-things thus being-destroyed, what-kind-of-(people) is-it-necessary for-you to-be in holy conduct and godliness, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>looking-for and hastening/rushing the presence/coming of-the day of-[the] God on-account-of which the heavens, burning, will-be-destroyed and (the) elements will-be-melted by-being-burned-up.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But (a) new heavens and (a) new earth let-us-look-for according-to the promise of-him in which righteousness dwells.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Wherefore, beloved, looking-for these-things, be-diligent to-be-found by him in peace spotless and blameless, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and consider as-salvation the longsuffering of-the Lord of-us, even-as also the beloved brother of-us Paul according-to the wisdom given to-him wrote to-you, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>as also in all the/his letters, speaking in them about these-things in which are some difficult-tings that the unlearned and unsteady/weak will-twist-distort as also the rest-of scriptures to [the[ their-own destruction of-them.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Therefore <u>you</u>, beloved, knowing-ahead-of-time, be-on-guard in-order-that you-may┘not└fall-from [the] your steadfastness, being-led-away by the error of-[the] morally-corrupt-((men).  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But grow in (the) grace and knowledge of-the Lord and Savior of-us Jesus Christ.  To-him (be) glory both now and forever<sup>3</sup>. Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
