## Titus Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Remind them to-subject-themselves to-rulers (and) to-authorities, to-be-obedient, to-be ready for every good deed, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to-slander nobody, to-be uncontentious, gentle, showing all humility to all men.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For once <u>we</u>┘also└ were foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to-various lusts and pleasures, spending-life in evil and envy, hated, hating one-another.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But “when the kindness of-God the Savior of-us and the/his love-for-humanity appeared, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not from works [the] in righteousness that <u>we</u> did, but according-to the mercy of-him he-saved us through (the) washing of-regeneration and renewal of-(the) Holy Spirit, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>whom he-poured-out on us richly through Jesus Christ the Savior of-us, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>in-order-that, having-been-justified by-[the] that grace, we-might-become heirs according-to (the) hope of-eternal life.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Faithful (is) the saying, and concerning these-things I-want you to-be-emphatic in-order-that the-ones having-believed God may-concentrate-on proclaiming good deeds.  These-things are good and profitable for-[the] people.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and rivalries and legal disputes, for they are unprofitable and worthless.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Have-nothing-to-do-with (a) divisive person after one and (a) second warning, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>knowing that [the] such-(a)-person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hasten to-come to me in Nicopolis, for I-have-decided to-spend-the-winter there.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Send-forward diligently Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, in-order-that nothing is-lacking to-them.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And let┘also [the] our (people)└learn to-produce good deeds unto the necessary needs, in-order-that they-may┘not└be unfruitful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> All the-ones with me greet you.  Greet the ones loving us in faith.  [The] grace (be) with you all. Virgil Warren, PhD Translator christir.org</span>
