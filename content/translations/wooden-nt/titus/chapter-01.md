Grace and peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Savior of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> For–the-sake-of this I-left you in Crete in-order-that you-might-set-in-order the remaining-things and appoint elders according-to (the) city, as I instructed you.  6If any (man) is without-fault, (the) husband of-one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation-of reckless-living or disobedient, 7for it-is-necessary-for the/a bishop/overseer to-be without-fault as (a) steward of-God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not (a) drunkard, not (a) violent-person, not greedy-for-dishonest-gain, 8but hospitable, loving-what-is-good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, 9holding-firmly-to the faithful word according-to the teaching, in-order-that he-might-be able also to-exhort in [the] sound [the] doctrine and to-refute the-ones opposing/denying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> This [the] testimony is true, on-account-of which reason rebuke them severely, in-order-that they-might-be-sound in the faith, 14not paying-attention to-Jewish myths and commandments of-men turning-away-from the truth.  15All-things are clean to-the clean, but to-the defiled and unfaithful nothing (is) clean, but both their [the] mind and [the] conscience have-been-defiled.  16They-profess to-know God, but by the/their works they-deny (it), being detestable and disobedient and worthless to every good work.</span>
