<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul, slave of-God and apostle of-Jesus Christ according-to (the) faith of-(the)-elect of-God and (the) knowledge of-(the)-truth [the] according-to godliness <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>in (the) hope of-eternal life, which the unlying God promised before times eternal, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>but/and in-his-own times he-manifested the word of-him in (the) proclamation that <u>I</u> was-entrusted-with according-to (the) commandment of-(the) Savior of-us, God, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>to-Titus, loyal son according-to (our) shared faith.  Grace and peace from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus the Savior of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For–the-sake-of this I-left you in Crete in-order-that you-might-set-in-order the remaining-things and appoint elders according-to (the) city, as <u>I</u> instructed you.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If any (man) is without-fault, (the) husband of-one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation-of reckless-living or disobedient, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>for it-is-necessary-for the/a bishop/overseer to-be without-fault as (a) steward of-God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not (a) drunkard, not (a) violent-person, not greedy-for-dishonest-gain, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>but hospitable, loving-what-is-good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>holding-firmly-to the faithful word according-to the teaching, in-order-that he-might-be able also to-exhort in [the] sound [the] doctrine and to-refute the-ones opposing/denying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> For there-are many disorderly (men), empty-talkers, and deceivers, especially the-ones of the circumcision, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>whom it-is-necessary to-silence, who overturn whole households, teaching what-things are┘not└necessary for-the-sake-of dishonest gain.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>A-certain-one of them, his-own prophet of-them, said, <em>“Cre</em><em>tans (are) always liars, evil animals, lazy gluttons.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> This [the] testimony is true, on-account-of which reason rebuke them severely, in-order-that they-might-be-sound in the faith, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>not paying-attention to-Jewish myths and commandments of-men turning-away-from the truth.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>All-things are clean to-the clean, but to-the defiled and unfaithful nothing (is) clean, but both their [the] mind and [the] conscience have-been-defiled.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They-profess to-know God, but by the/their works they-deny (it), being detestable and disobedient and worthless to every good work.</span>
