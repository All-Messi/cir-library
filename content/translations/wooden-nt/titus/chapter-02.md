<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Likewise urge the younger (men) to-be sensible 7about all-things, presenting yourself (as an) example of-good deeds, (demonstrating) purity in [the] doctrine, respectability, 8sound speech above-criticism, in-order-that the-one from (the) opposition may-be-ashamed, having-nothing bad to-say about us.</span>

Let┘nobody└disregard you.</span>
