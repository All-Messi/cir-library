## Titus Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> speak<sup>imper</sup> what-things are–fitting to-[the] sound doctrine, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>(that) older-men (are) to-be serious-minded, respectable, sensible; sound with-respect-to-[the] faith, [the] love, [the] perseverance; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>(that) older-women likewise (are to be) reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to-much wine, teaching-what-is-good, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>in-order-that they-may advise the young (women) to-be husband-lovers, children-lovers, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>sensible, pure, devoted-to-the-house, upright, deferring to-[the] their husbands, in-order-that the word of-[the] God may┘not└be-slandered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Likewise urge the younger (men) to-be sensible <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>about all-things, presenting yourself (as an) example of-good deeds, (demonstrating) purity in [the] doctrine, respectability, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>sound speech above-criticism, in-order-that the-one from (the) opposition may-be-ashamed, having-nothing bad to-say about us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Urge slaves to-defer to-their masters in all-things, to-be pleasing, not argumentive, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>not embezzling, but showing all good faith in-order-that they-may-adorn the doctrine [the] of-the Savior of-us in all things—God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>For the grace of-[the] God appeared bringing-salvation to-all men, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>instructing us in-order-that, having-renounced [the] ungodliness and worldly pleasures, we-might-live wisely and righteously and godly in the present age, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>looking-for the blessed hope and appearance of [the] glory of-(the) great (the) God and Savior of-us Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>who gave himself for us in-order-that he-might-redeem us from all lawlessness and might-cleanse for-himself (a) special people, (a) zealot of-good deeds.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Say these-things, and urge, and rebuke with all authority.  Let┘nobody└disregard you.</span>
