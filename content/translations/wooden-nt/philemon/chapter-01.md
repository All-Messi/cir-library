## Philemon Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Paul, prisoner of-Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon, the beloved-one and fellow-worker of-us, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and to-Apphia the sister, and to-Archippus the fellow-soldier of-us, and to-the church according-to (the) house of-you<sup>sg</sup>.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>I-thank the God of-me always, making mention of-you<sup>sg</sup> at the prayers of-me, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>hearing-about the love of-you and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>in-order-that the fellowship of-the faith of-you may-be effective in (the) knowledge of-every good-thing [the] in us into Christ.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For I-have much joy and consolation over the love of-you, because the affections of-the saints are-refreshed through you, brother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to-command you the appropriate-thing, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>on-account-of love rather I-appeal-to (you), being of-such-kind as Paul (the) aged, but now also (a) prisoner of-Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I-appeal-to you about [the] my child, whom I-begat in bonds/imprisonment, Onesimus, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>the-one once useless to-you, but now both to-you and to-me useful, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>whom I-sent-back to-you, him, this is, [the] my innermost feelings, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>whom <u>I</u> was-wanting to-have with me in-order-that on-behalf-of you he-might-minister to-me in the bonds/imprisonment of-the gospel.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But without [the] your consent, I-wanted to-do nothing, in-order-that the goodness of-you might-be, not as according-to necessity, but according-to willing(ness).  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For maybe on-account-of this he-was-separated for (a) time, in-order-that you-might-have┘him└back permanently, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>no-longer as (a) slave, but more-than (a) slave, (a) beloved brother, especially to-me, and more by-much to-you, both in (the) flesh and in (the) Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>So if you-have me (as a) partner, accept him as myself.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And if he-wronged you with-respect-to-anything, or owes anything, charge this to-me.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I, Paul, wrote/write (it) with my-own hand:  I-will-repay (it), in-order-that I-do┘not└say to-you that you-owe me yourself.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Yes, brother, I would have-joy in (the) Lord; refresh the inner-feelings of-me in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Confident in-the obedience of-you, I-wrote/write to-you, knowing that even beyond what-things I-am-saying you-will-do.  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And at-the-same-time also prepare me lodging, for I-hope that through the prayers of-you<sup>pl</sup>, I-will-be-returned to-you<sup>pl</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Epaphras, the fellow-prisoner of-me in Christ Jesus greets you.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, the fellow-workers of-me (salute you).  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The grace of-the Lord Jesus Christ (be) with your<sup>p</sup><sup>l</sup> spirit.
