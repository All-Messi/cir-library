## Philemon Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, prisoner of-Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon, the beloved-one and fellow-worker of-us, 2and to-Apphia the sister, and to-Archippus the fellow-soldier of-us, and to-the church according-to (the) house of-yousg.  3Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> I-thank the God of-me always, making mention of-yousg at the prayers of-me, 5hearing-about the love of-you and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints, 6in-order-that the fellowship of-the faith of-you may-be effective in (the) knowledge of-every good-thing [the] in us into Christ.  7For I-have much joy and consolation over the love of-you, because the affections of-the saints are-refreshed through you, brother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to-command you the appropriate-thing, 9on-account-of love rather I-appeal-to (you), being of-such-kind as Paul (the) aged, but now also (a) prisoner of-Jesus Christ.  10I-appeal-to you about [the] my child, whom I-begat in bonds/imprisonment, Onesimus, 11the-one once useless to-you, but now both to-you and to-me useful, 12whom I-sent-back to-you, him, this is, [the] my innermost feelings, 13whom I was-wanting to-have with me in-order-that on-behalf-of you he-might-minister to-me in the bonds/imprisonment of-the gospel.  14But without [the] your consent, I-wanted to-do nothing, in-order-that the goodness of-you might-be, not as according-to necessity, but according-to willing(ness).  15For maybe on-account-of this he-was-separated for (a) time, in-order-that you-might-have┘him└back permanently, 16no-longer as (a) slave, but more-than (a) slave, (a) beloved brother, especially to-me, and more by-much to-you, both in (the) flesh and in (the) Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So if you-have me (as a) partner, accept him as myself.  18And if he-wronged you with-respect-to-anything, or owes anything, charge this to-me.  19I, Paul, wrote/write (it) with my-own hand:  I-will-repay (it), in-order-that I-do┘not└say to-you that you-owe me yourself.  20Yes, brother, I would have-joy in (the) Lord; refresh the inner-feelings of-me in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Confident in-the obedience of-you, I-wrote/write to-you, knowing that even beyond what-things I-am-saying you-will-do.  22And at-the-same-time also prepare me lodging, for I-hope that through the prayers of-youpl, I-will-be-returned to-youpl.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Epaphras, the fellow-prisoner of-me in Christ Jesus greets you.  24Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, the fellow-workers of-me (salute you).  25The grace of-the Lord Jesus Christ (be) with yourpl spirit.
