## 3 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Elder to-Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Beloved, about all-things I-pray you to-be-prosperous and to-be-healthy, even-as the soul of-you prospers.  3For I-was┘very└joyous, brothers coming and testifying to-the truth of-you, even-as you walk in truth.  4I-do┘not└have greater joy in-order-that I-hear [the] my children walking in truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Belovedsg, you-act faithfully with-respect-to-whatever2 you-work for the brothers and this (being for) strangers, 6who testified to-the love of-you before (the) church, whom you-will-do well sending┘them└forward worthily of-[the] God.  7For on-behalf-of the Name, they-went-out, taking nothing from the Gentiles/heathen.  8Therefore we ought to-support [the] such-(men) in-order-that we-may-become fellow-workers in the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> I-wrote something to-the church, but [the] loving-to-be-first of-them Diotrephes does┘not└accept us.  10On-account-of this, if I-come, I-will-call-attention-to the works of-him that he-does, slandering us with-wicked words, and not being-satisfied over such-things, neither himself receives the brothers but prevents the-ones wanting (to receive them) and casts (them) out-of the church.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Belovedsg, do┘not└imitate the evil-thing, but the good-thing.  The-one doing-good is out-of [the] God.  The-one doing-evil has┘not└seen [the] God.  12Demetrius has-been-testified by all and the truth itself, and we also testify and know that the witness of-us is true.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I-was-having many-things to-write to-you, but I-do┘not└want to-write to-you through ink and reed-pen.  14But I-hope to-see you soon, and we-will-speak mouth to mouth.  15Peace to-you.  The friends greet you.  Greet the friends by name.</span>
