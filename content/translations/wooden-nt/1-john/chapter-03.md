## 1 John Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> You-know what-kind-of love the Father has-given to-us in-order-that we-may-be-called children of-God, and we-are.  On-account-of this, the world does┘not└know us because it-did┘not└know him.  2Beloved, now we-are children of-God, and not-yet did-it-appear what we-will-be.  We-know that if he-appears, we-will-be like him, because we-will-see him even-as he-is.  3And every the-one having [the] this truth on him purifies himself even-as that-One is pure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Every the-one doing [the] sin also does [the] lawlessness—and [the] sin is [the] lawlessness.  5And you-know that that-One was-manifested in-order-that he-might-take-away [the] sins, and sin is not in him.  6Every the-one remaining in him does┘not└practice-sinning.  Every the-one practicing-sin has┘not└seen him neither has-known him.  7Little-children, let┘nobody└deceive you.  The-one doing [the] righteousness is righteous, even-as that-One is righteous.  8The-one doing [the] sin is of the devil, because from (the) beginning the devil sins.  Unto this the Son of-[the] God was-manifested in-order-that he-might-destroy the works of-the devil.  9Every the-one having-been-begotten by-[the] God does┘not└do sin, because (the) seed of-him remains in him, and he-is┘not└able to-sin because he-has-been-begotten by [the] God.  10In this the children of-[the] God are manifest and the children of-the devil.  Every the-one not doing righteousness is not from [the] God, and the-one not loving the brother of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Because this is news that you-heard from (the) beginning:  [in-order]-that we should-love one-another; 12not as Cain was of the evil-one, and murdered the brother of-him.  And for-the-sake-of what did-he murder him?  Because the deeds of-him were evil and the-ones of-the brother of-him were righteous.  13And do┘not└marvel if the world hates you.  14We know that we-have-passed-over out-of [the] death into [the] life, because we-love the brothers.  The-one not loving remains in [the] death.  15Every the-one hating the brother of-him is (a) murderer, and you-know that every murderer does┘not└have eternal life residing in him.  16In this we-have-known [the] love:  that that-One laid-down the life of-him for us, and we ought to-lay-down the/our lives for the brothers.  17And whoever2 has the life of-the world and sees the brother of-him have need and shuts-up the compassions of-him, how does┘the love of-[the] God└reside in him?  18Little-children, let-us┘not└love in-word nor with-the tongue, but in deed and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And in this we-will-know that because we-are of the truth, and before him we-will-persuade the heart of-us, 20with-respect-to whatever2 the heart of-us might-condemn (us), because [the] God is greater than-the heart of-us and knows all-things.  21Beloved, if the heart of-us does┘not└condemn (us), we-have boldness toward/with [the] God, 22and whatever we-ask-for, we-receive from him, because we-keep the commandments of-him, and we-do the-things pleasing before him.  23And this is the commandment of-him:  [in-order]-that we-believe in-the name of-the Son of-him Jesus Christ and (that) we-love one-another even-as he-gave commandment to-us.  24And the-one keeping the commandments of-him resides in him, and he in him, and in this we-know that he-resides in us—by the Spirit/spirit whom/that he-gave to-us.</span>
