## 1 John Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>My little-children, I-am-writing these-things to-you in-order-that you-may┘not└keep-sinning.  And if anybody does-sin, we-have (an) Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And he┘himself└is (the) propitiation for the sins of-us, and not only for [the] our (sins), but also for the whole world.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And in this we-know that we-have-known him:  if we-are-keeping the commandments of-him.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The-one saying [that], “I-have-known him,” and is┘not└keeping the commandments of-him, is (a) liar, and in this-one the truth is not.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And whoever<sup>2</sup> keeps the word of-him—truly in this-one the love of-[the] God has-been-completed/perfected.  By this we-know that we-are in him.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The-one saying to-reside in him—he himself ought to-walk thus, even-as that-One walked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Every the-one doing [the] sin also does [the] lawlessness—and [the] sin is [the] lawlessness.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And you-know that that-One was-manifested in-order-that he-might-take-away [the] sins, and sin is not in him.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Every the-one remaining in him does┘not└practice-sinning.  Every the-one practicing-sin has┘not└seen him neither has-known him.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Little-children, let┘nobody└deceive you.  The-one doing [the] righteousness is righteous, even-as that-One is righteous.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The-one doing [the] sin is of the devil, because from (the) beginning the devil sins.  Unto this the Son of-[the] God was-manifested in-order-that he-might-destroy the works of-the devil.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Every the-one having-been-begotten by-[the] God does┘not└do sin, because (the) seed of-him remains in him, and he-is┘not└able to-sin because he-has-been-begotten by [the] God.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>In this the children of-[the] God are manifest and the children of-the devil.  Every the-one not doing righteousness is not from [the] God, and the-one not loving the brother of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Beloved, I-am┘not└writing (a) new commandment to-you, but (an) old commandment that you-were-having from (the) beginning.  The old [the] commandment is the word that you-heard.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Again, I-am-writing (a) new commandment<sup>fem</sup> to-you that<sup>neut</sup> is true in him and in you, because darkness is-passing-away, and the true [the] light is┘already└shining.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The-one saying to-be in the light and hating the brother of-him is in [the] darkness until now.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The-one loving the brother of-him remains in the light, and (a) cause-of-stumbling is not in him.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But the-one hating the brother of-him is in [the] darkness and walks in [the] darkness, and does┘not└know where he-is-going, because the darkness blinded the eyes of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Because this is news that you-heard from (the) beginning:  [in-order]-that we should-love one-another; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>not as Cain was of the evil-one, and murdered the brother of-him.  And for-the-sake-of what did-he murder him?  Because the deeds of-him were evil and the-ones of-the brother of-him were righteous.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And do┘not└marvel if the world hates you.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We know that we-have-passed-over out-of [the] death into [the] life, because we-love the brothers.  The-one not loving remains in [the] death.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Every the-one hating the brother of-him is (a) murderer, and you-know that every murderer does┘not└have eternal life residing in him.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>In this we-have-known [the] love:  that that-One laid-down the life of-him for us, and <u>we</u> ought to-lay-down the/our lives for the brothers.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And whoever<sup>2</sup> has the life of-the world and sees the brother of-him have need and shuts-up the compassions of-him, how does┘the love of-[the] God└reside in him?  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Little-children, let-us┘not└love in-word nor with-the tongue, but in deed and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I-am-writing to-you, little-children, because the sins have-been-forgiven<sup>p</sup><sup>f</sup> to-you through the name of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I-am-writing to-you, Fathers, because you-have-known the-One from (the) beginning. I-am-writing to-you, young-men, because you-have-overcome the evil-one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I-wrote to-you, children, because you-have-known the Father. I-wrote to-you, Fathers, because you-have-known the-One from (the) beginning. I-wrote to-you, young-men, because you-are strong, and the word of-[the] God resides in you, and you-have-overcome the evil-one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Do┘not└love the world neither the-things in the world.  If anybody loves the world, the love of-the Father is not in him.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Because everything [the] in the world—the lust of-the flesh and the lust of-the eyes and the pride/arrogance of-[the] life—is not from the Father but is from the world.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And the world is-passing-away/passes-away and the lust of-it, but the-one doing the will of-[the] God remains forever<sup>3</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Children, it-is (the) last hour, and even-as you-heard that antichrist is-coming, and now have-come-to-be many antichrist, whence we-know that it-is (the) last hour.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>They-went-out from us but they were not of us; for if they had-been of us, they-would-have remained with us—but (they went out) in-order-that they-might-be-manifested that they┘all└were not of-us.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And you have (an) anointing from the Holy-One, and know all-things.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I-did┘not└write to-you because you-do┘not└know the truth, but because you-know it, and because every lie is not of the truth.  <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Who is the/a liar except<sup>2</sup> the-one denying that Jesus is [not] the Christ?  This-one is the antichrist:  the-one denying the Father and the Son.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Every the-one denying the Son neither has the Father; the-one confessing the Son also has the Father.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Let┘what <u>you</u> heard from (the) beginning └remain in you.  If what you-heard from the beginning remains in you, <u>you</u> also will-remain in the Son and in the Father.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And this is the promise that he promised you:  [the] eternal [the] life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And in this we-will-know that because we-are of the truth, and before him we-will-persuade the heart of-us, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>with-respect-to whatever<sup>2</sup> the heart of-us might-condemn (us), because [the] God is greater than-the heart of-us and knows all-things.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Beloved, if the heart of-us does┘not└condemn (us), we-have boldness toward/with [the] God, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and whatever we-ask-for, we-receive from him, because we-keep the commandments of-him, and we-do the-things pleasing before him.  <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And this is the commandment of-him:  [in-order]-that we-believe in-the name of-the Son of-him Jesus Christ and (that) we-love one-another even-as he-gave commandment to-us.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And the-one keeping the commandments of-him resides in him, and he in him, and in this we-know that he-resides in us—by the Spirit/spirit whom/that he-gave to-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I-wrote these-things to-you about the-ones deceiving you.  <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And the anointing that <u>you</u> received from him remains in you, and you-do┘not└have (a) need in-order-that anybody should teach you, but as the anointing of-him teaches you about all-things and is true and is not (a) lie and even-as he-taught you, remain in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And now, little-children, remain in him, in-order-that if he-is-manifested, we-have boldness and are┘not└ashamed of him at the coming of-him.  <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>If you know that he-is righteous, you-know also that every the-one doing [the] righteousness has-been-begotten by him.  <strong>3</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>You-know what-kind-of love the Father has-given to-us in-order-that we-may-be-called children of-God, and we-are.  On-account-of this, the world does┘not└know us because it-did┘not└know him.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Beloved, now we-are children of-God, and not-yet did-it-appear what we-will-be.  We-know that if he-appears, we-will-be like him, because we-will-see him even-as he-is.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And every the-one having [the] this truth on him purifies himself even-as that-One is pure.</span>
