## 1 John Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> My little-children, I-am-writing these-things to-you in-order-that you-may┘not└keep-sinning.  And if anybody does-sin, we-have (an) Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.  2And he┘himself└is (the) propitiation for the sins of-us, and not only for [the] our (sins), but also for the whole world.  3And in this we-know that we-have-known him:  if we-are-keeping the commandments of-him.  4The-one saying [that], "I-have-known him," and is┘not└keeping the commandments of-him, is (a) liar, and in this-one the truth is not.  5And whoever2 keeps the word of-him—truly in this-one the love of-[the] God has-been-completed/perfected.  By this we-know that we-are in him.  6The-one saying to-reside in him—he himself ought to-walk thus, even-as that-One walked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Beloved, I-am┘not└writing (a) new commandment to-you, but (an) old commandment that you-were-having from (the) beginning.  The old [the] commandment is the word that you-heard.  8Again, I-am-writing (a) new commandmentfem to-you thatneut is true in him and in you, because darkness is-passing-away, and the true [the] light is┘already└shining.  9The-one saying to-be in the light and hating the brother of-him is in [the] darkness until now.  10The-one loving the brother of-him remains in the light, and (a) cause-of-stumbling is not in him.  11But the-one hating the brother of-him is in [the] darkness and walks in [the] darkness, and does┘not└know where he-is-going, because the darkness blinded the eyes of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I-am-writing to-you, little-children,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I-am-writing to-you, Fathers,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> I-wrote to-you, children,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Do┘not└love the world neither the-things in the world.  If anybody loves the world, the love of-the Father is not in him.  16Because everything [the] in the world—the lust of-the flesh and the lust of-the eyes and the pride/arrogance of-[the] life—is not from the Father but is from the world.  17And the world is-passing-away/passes-away and the lust of-it, but the-one doing the will of-[the] God remains forever3.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Children, it-is (the) last hour, and even-as you-heard that antichrist is-coming, and now have-come-to-be many antichrist, whence we-know that it-is (the) last hour.  19They-went-out from us but they were not of us; for if they had-been of us, they-would-have remained with us—but (they went out) in-order-that they-might-be-manifested that they┘all└were not of-us.  20And you have (an) anointing from the Holy-One, and know all-things.  21I-did┘not└write to-you because you-do┘not└know the truth, but because you-know it, and because every lie is not of the truth.  22Who is the/a liar except2 the-one denying that Jesus is [not] the Christ?  This-one is the antichrist:  the-one denying the Father and the Son.  23Every the-one denying the Son neither has the Father; the-one confessing the Son also has the Father.  24Let┘what you heard from (the) beginning └remain in you.  If what you-heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will-remain in the Son and in the Father.  25And this is the promise that he promised you:  [the] eternal [the] life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> I-wrote these-things to-you about the-ones deceiving you.  27And the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you-do┘not└have (a) need in-order-that anybody should teach you, but as the anointing of-him teaches you about all-things and is true and is not (a) lie and even-as he-taught you, remain in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And now, little-children, remain in him, in-order-that if he-is-manifested, we-have boldness and are┘not└ashamed of him at the coming of-him.  29If you know that he-is righteous, you-know also that every the-one doing [the] righteousness has-been-begotten by him.</span>
