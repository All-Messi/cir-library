## 1 John Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>What was from (the) beginning, what we-have-heard, what we-have-seen with-the eyes of-us, what we-have-observed and the hands of-us have-handled about the word of-[the] life—<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and the life was-manifested, and we-have-seen and we-testify and proclaim to-you [the] eternal [the] life that was with the Father and was-manifested to us—<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>what we-have-seen and have-heard, we-proclaim also to-you in-order-that <u>you</u> also may-have fellowship with us, and [the] our [the] fellowship (is) also with the Father and with the Son of-him Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And we write these-things in-order-that the joy of-us may-be full<sup>p</sup><sup>f</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And this is the message that we-have-heard from him and we-pass-on to-you that [the] God is light, and darkness is [not] in him—none.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If we-say that we-have fellowship with him and walk in-[the] darkness, we-are-lying, and we-are┘not└doing the truth.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>If we-walk the light as <u>he</u> is in the light, we-have fellowship with one-another; and the blood of-Jesus the Son of-him keeps-cleansing us from every sin.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If we-say that we-do┘not└have sin, we-deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>If we-confess the sins of-us, he-is-faithful and just in-order-that he-might-forgive us the sins and might-cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>If we-say that we-have┘not└sinned, we-make him (a) liar and the word of-him is not in us.</span>
