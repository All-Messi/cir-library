## 1 John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What was from (the) beginning, what we-have-heard, what we-have-seen with-the eyes of-us, what we-have-observed and the hands of-us have-handled about the word of-[the] life—2and the life was-manifested, and we-have-seen and we-testify and proclaim to-you [the] eternal [the] life that was with the Father and was-manifested to us—3what we-have-seen and have-heard, we-proclaim also to-you in-order-that you also may-have fellowship with us, and [the] our [the] fellowship (is) also with the Father and with the Son of-him Jesus Christ.  4And we write these-things in-order-that the joy of-us may-be fullpf.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And this is the message that we-have-heard from him and we-pass-on to-you that [the] God is light, and darkness is [not] in him—none.  6If we-say that we-have fellowship with him and walk in-[the] darkness, we-are-lying, and we-are┘not└doing the truth.  7If we-walk the light as he is in the light, we-have fellowship with one-another; and the blood of-Jesus the Son of-him keeps-cleansing us from every sin.  8If we-say that we-do┘not└have sin, we-deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  9If we-confess the sins of-us, he-is-faithful and just in-order-that he-might-forgive us the sins and might-cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  10If we-say that we-have┘not└sinned, we-make him (a) liar and the word of-him is not in us.</span>
