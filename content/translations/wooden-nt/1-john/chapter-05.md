## 1 John Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Every the-one believing that Jesus is the Christ has-been-begotten by [the] God, and every the-one loving the-One having-begotten loves also the-One having-been-begotten by him.  2By this we-know that we-love the children of-[the] God:  when we-love [the] God and do the commandments of-him.  3For this is the love of-[the] God:  [in-order]-that we-keep the commandments of-him, and the commandments of-him are not heavy/hard.  4Because every the-one having-been-begotten by [the] God overcomes the world, and this is the victory [the] having-overcome the world:  the faith of-us.  5And who is the-one overcoming the world unless2 the-one believing that Jesus is the Son of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> This is the-one having-come by water and blood—Jesus Christ, not by [the] water only, but by [the] water and by [the] blood; and the Spirit is the-One testifying because the Spirit is the truth.  7Because three are the-ones testifying:  8the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are for the one-thing.  9If we-receive the testimony of-[the] men, the testimony of-[the] God is greater, because this is the testimony of-[the] God that he-has-testified about the Son of-himself.  10The-one believing in [the] Son of-[the] God has the testimony in him; the-one not believing [the] God has-made him (a) liar, because he-has┘not└believed in the testimony that [the] God has-testified about the Son of-him.  11And this is the testimony:  that [the] God gave to-us eternal life, and this [the] life is in the Son of-him.  12The-one having the Son has [the] life; the-one not having the Son of-[the] God does┘not└have [the] life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> I-wrote these-things to-you, in-order-that you-may-know that you-have eternal life, the-ones believing in the name of-the Son of-[the] God.  14And this is the boldness that we-have toward him:  that if we-ask anything according-to the will of-him, he-hears us.  15And if we know that he-hears us with-respect-to whatever2 we-ask, we-know that because we-have the requests that we-have-asked from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Whoever2 sees the brother of-him sinning (a) sin not unto death, he-will-ask and he-will-give life to-him, to-the-ones sinning not unto death.  (A) sin unto death exists; I-am┘not└speaking about that (sin) [in-order]-that he-should-ask.  17Every injustice is sin, and (a) sin not unto death exists.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> We-know that every the-one having-been-begotten by [the] God does┘not└sin; but the-one begotten by [the] God keeps himself, and the evil-one does┘not└touch him.  19We-know that we-are of/from [the] God, and the whole world lies in the evil-one.  20But we-know that the Son of-[the] God has-come, and he-has-given us understanding, in-order-that we-may-know the true-One, and we-are in the true-(One).  In the Son of-him Jesus Christ—this is the true God and eternal life.  21Little-children, guard/keep yourselves from [the] idols.</span>
