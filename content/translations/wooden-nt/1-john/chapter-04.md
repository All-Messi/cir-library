## 1 John Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Beloved, do┘not└believe every spirit, but test the spirits if/whether they-are from [the] God, because many false-prophets have-gone-out into the world.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By this you-know the Spirit of-[the] God:  every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has-come in (the) flesh is from [the] God.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And every spirit that does┘not└confess [the] Jesus is not of/from [the] God.  And this is the (spirit) of-the antichrist that you-have-heard that he-is-coming, and now is already in the world.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><u>You</u> are of/from [the] God, little-children; and you-have-overcome them, because greater is the-One in you than the-One in the world.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><u>They</u> are of/from the world; because-of this they-speak of/from the world, and the world listens-to them.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><u>We</u> are of/from [the] God.  The-one knowing [the] God listens-to us.  Who is not of/from [the] God, does┘not└listen-to us.  By this we-know the Spirit of-[the] truth and the spirit of-[the deception.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Beloved, let-us-love one-another, because [the] love is of/from [the] God, and every the-one loving has-been-begotten by [the] God and knows [the] God.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The-one not loving does┘not└know [the] God, because [the] God is love.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>In this the love of-[the] God was manifested among/in us, because [the] God has-sent the only [the] Son of-him into the world in-order-that we-might-live through him.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>In this is [the] love:  not that <u>we</u> have-loved [the] God, but that <u>he</u> loved us, and sent the Son of-him as-(a)-propitiation for the sins of-us.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Beloved, if [the] God so loved us, <u>we</u> also ought to-love one-another.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Nobody at-any-time has-seen God.  If we-love one-another, [the] God resides in us, and the love of-him is fulfilled<sup>p</sup><sup>f</sup> in us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>By this we-know that we-are-resid-ng in him and he in us:  because he-has-given us of the Spirit of-him.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And <u>we</u> have-seen and testify that the Father has-sent the son (as-a/the)-Savior of-the world.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Whoever<sup>2</sup> confesses that Jesus is the Son of-[the] God—[the] God resides in him and he in [the] God.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And <u>we</u> have-known and have-believed the love that [the] God has in us. [The] God is love, and the-one residing in [the] love resides in [the] God, and [the] God resides in him.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>In this [the] love has-been-perfected with us, in-order-that we-might-have boldness in the day of-[the] judgment, because even-as that-One is, <u>we</u> also are in [the] this world.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Fear is not in [the] love, because [the] perfect love casts out [the] fear, because [the] fear has punishment, and the-one fearing has┘not└been-perfected in [the] love.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><u>We</u> love because <u>he</u> first loved us.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>If anybody says [that], “I-love [the] God,” and hates the brother of-him, he-is (a) liar.  For the-one not loving the brother of-him, whom he-has-seen, is┘not└able to-love [the] God, whom he-has┘not└seen.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And we-have this [the] commandment from him:  [in-order]-that the-one loving [the] God love also the brother of-him.</span>
