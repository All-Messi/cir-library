## Luke Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his being in-(a)-certain place praying, when he-stopped, (a)-certain-one of-the disciples of-him said to him, <em>“Lord, teach us to-pray, even-as also John taught the disciples of-him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And he-said to-them,<strong><sup>	</sup></strong> <em>“When you-pray, say,</em> <em>	</em><em>	‘Father, let┘the name of-you└ -sanctified;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	let┘the kingdom of-you└</em><em>come.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And he-said to them, <em>“Who of you will-have (a) friend and will-go to-him in-the-middle-of-the-night, and say to-him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>because (a) friend of-me came off the road to me, and I-do┘not└have what-thing I-will-set-before him.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>And-that-one from-inside, having-answered, may-say, ‘Do┘not└be-a-bother to-me.</em><em> </em><em>Already the door is-shut and the kids of-me are in [the] bed with me.</em><em> </em><em>I-am┘not└able, having-gotten-up, to-give to-you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I-say to-you, although</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> he-will</em><em>┘not└</em><em>give to-him, having-gotten-up, on-account-of </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> being (a) friend of-him, on-accou</em><em>n</em><em>t-of shamelessness/persistence of-him, having-gotten-up, he-will-give him as-many-things-as he-needs.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And-I say to-you,</em><em> ask and it-will-be-given to-yo</em><em>u,</em><em> seek and you-will-find, knock and it-will-be-opened to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>For everybody the-one asking receives</em><em>,</em><em> and the-one seeking finds</em><em>,</em><em> and the-the-one knocking it-will-be-opened.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And the son will-ask┘└for (a) fish</em><em>,</em><em> and instead-of </em><em>(a)-fish he-will-give him (a) snake?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Or, also he-will-ask-for (an) egg, he-will-give him (a) scorpion?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>If then you, being evil, know to-give good gifts to-the children of-you, more by-much the Father [the] from heaven will-give (the) Holy Spirit to-the-ones asking him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And he-was casting-out (a) demon [and it-was]<sup>ms</sup> mute. And it-happened, the demon having-come-out, the mute spoke and the crowds were-amazed. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And some of-them said, <em>“By Beelzebub the ruler of-[the] demons, he-casts-out [the] demons.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And others, testing (him), were-seeking (a) sign from heaven/from (the) sky from him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And <u>he</u>, knowing the reasonings of-them, said to-them, <em>“Every kingdom, having-been-divided against itself, is-made-desolate, and (a) house (divided) against itself falls.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>And if also [the] Satan was-divided against himself, how will┘the kingdom of-him└stand?—because you-are-saying me to-cast-out [the] demons by Beelzebub.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And if by Beelzebub I-cast-out [the] demons, by what do┘the sons of-you└cast┘(them)└out?</em><em> </em><em>On-account-of this </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> will-be judges of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But if by (the) finger of-God [I]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> cast-out [the] demons, then the kingdom of-[the] God reached you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>When the/a strong-man</em><em>,</em><em> fully-armed</em><em>,</em><em> guards the courtyard of-himself, the possessions of-him are in peace.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But whenever one-stronger than he, having-attacked (him), overcomes him, he-picks-up the armor on which he-has-trusted and distributes the plunder of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>The-one not being with me is against me, and the-one not gathering with me scatters-out.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his saying these-things (a)-certain woman, having-lifted-up (her) voice out-of the crowd, said to-him, <em>“Blessed (is) the womb [the] having-born you and the breasts that you nursed.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And <u>he</u> said, <em>“Much-more, blessed (are) the ones listening-to the word of-[the] God and keeping (it).</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the crowds increasing, he-began to-say, <em>“[The] this generation is evil.</em><em> </em><em>It-seeks (a) sign, and (a) sign will┘not└be-given to-it except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the sign of-Jonah.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>For even-as Jonah became (a) sign to-the </em><em>Ninevites, so also the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an will-be to-[the] this generation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>[The] queen of-(the)-south will-rise-up in the judgment with the men of-[the] this generation and will-condemn them, because she-came out-of the ends of-the earth to-hear the</em><em> wisdom of-Solomon, and</em><em> behold</em><em>,</em><em> one-greater than Solomon (is) here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>[The] men of-Nineveh will-stand-up in the judgment with [the] this generation and they-will-condemn it</em><em>,</em><em> because they-repented</em><em> at the preaching of-Jonah, and</em><em> behold, one-greater than Jonah is here.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And in [the] (his) having-spoken, (a) Pharisee asks him in-order-that he-might-eat-a-meal with him.

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And the Lord said to-him, <em>“Now you [the] Pharisees cleanse the outside of-the cup and the dish, but the inside of-you is-full of robbing and wickedness.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>Foolish-ones, did┘not└the-One having-made the outside also make the inside?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Except, give the-things being-inside (as) mercy/charity, and behold, all-things are clean to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>But woe to-you [the] Pharisees, because you-tithe [the] mint and [the] rue and every vegetable and by-pass [the] justice and the love of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><em>but it-is-necessary to-do these-things and┘not to-neglect└those.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>Woe to-you [the] Pharisees, because you-love the main-seat in the synagogue and the greetings in the market-places.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>Woe to-you, because you are like [the] unmarked [the] graves and [the] men [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> walking on (them) do┘not└know (it).”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And (a)-certain-one of-the lawyers, having-answered, says to-him, <em>“Teacher, saying these-things you┘also└insult us.”</em><em> </em> And the/he said, <em>“Woe to-you [the] lawyers too, because you-load┘[the] men└down with heavy loads, and you┘yourselves└do┘not└touch the loads with-one of-the fingers of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>Woe to-you, because you-build the tombs of-the prophets, but the fathers of-you killed them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>So you-are witnesses and approve the deeds of-the fathers of-you, because </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> killed them and </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> build (their tombs).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>On-account-of this also the wisdom of-[the] God said, ‘I-will-sent to them prophets </em><em>and apostles, and (some) of them they-will-kill and persecute, </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>in-order-that the blood of-all the prophets [the] poured-out from (the) foundation of-(the)-world may-be-required from [the] this generation, </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>from (the) blood of-Abel until (the) blood of-Zachariah, the-one perishing between the altar and the house (of God).</em><em> </em><em>Yes, I-say to-you, it-will-be-required from [the] this generation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>52</sup></strong><em>Woe to-you [the] lawyers, because you-take-away the key of-[the] knowledge; you</em><em>┘yourselves└</em><em>do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>enter</em><em>,</em><em> and you-hindered the-ones trying-to-enter.”</em><em> </em></span>
