## Luke Chapter **23**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And all the multitude of-them, having-risen-up, led him to [the] Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>And they-began to-accuse him, saying, <em>“We-found this-One misleading the nation of-us</em><em>,</em><em> and preventing to-pay tribute to-Caesar</em><em>,</em><em> and saying himself to-be Messiah, (a) king.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>And [the] Pilate asked him, saying, <em>“You are the king of-the Jews?”</em> And the/he, having-answered him, said, <em>“You say.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And [the] Pilate said to the chief-priests and the crowds, <em>“I-find no matter in [the] this man.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And the/they kept-insisting, saying [that], <em>“He-stirs-up the people, teaching </em><em>according-to the whole of-Israel/all over Judaea</em><em>, and having-begun from [the] Galilee unto here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And Pilate, having-heard, asked whether the man is/was (a) Galilean; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and having-come-to-know that he-is/was from the jurisdiction of-Herod, sent him to Herod, being also himself in Jerusalem in these [the] days. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And [the] Herod having-seen [the] Jesus was┘really└glad, for he-was wanting out-of (a) long time[s] to-see him on-account-of hearing about him, and was-hoping to-see some sign occurring by him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And he-kept-questioning him with lots-of words, but <u>he</u> answered him nothing. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And the chief-priests and the scribes had-stood, accusing him aggressively. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And [also]<sup>ms</sup> [the] Herod with the soldiers of-him, having-treated┘him└with-contempt and having-mocked (him), having-dressed (him) with-bright-clothes, sent┘him└back to-[the] Pilate. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And both [the] Herod and [the] Pilate became friends with one-another on the very day. For previously-they-were at enmity with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And Pilate, having-gathered the chief-priests and the rulers and the people, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>said to them, <em>“You-brought [the] this man to-me as one-stirring-up the people, and behold</em><em>,</em><em> I, before you having-examined (him), found no matter in [the] this man of-which-things you-accuse against him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>But neither [did] Herod, for he-sent┘him└back to us, and behold</em><em>,</em><em> nothing worthy of-death has-been done by-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>So, having-flogged him, I-will-release (him).</em><em>”</em> [<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And they-started-shouting together, saying, <em>“T</em><em>ake this-one; and release [the]</em><em> Barabbas to-us,”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>who, on-account-of some insurrection having-happened in the city, and murder, was-cast in [the] prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And again [the] Pilate addressed them, desiring to-release [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And the/they kept-calling-out, saying, <em>“Crucify (him)!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify him!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And the/he said to them (a)-third-(time), <em>“For what evil-thing did</em><em>┘this-one└</em><em>do?</em><em> </em><em>I-found no matter of-death in him.</em><em> </em><em>So, having-flogged him, I-will-release (</em><em>him).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And the/they were-adamant, with-loud voices, asking him to-be-crucified. And the voices of-them began-to-prevail.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>And Pilate determined the demand of-them to-happen. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And he-released the-one cast in prison on-account-of insurrection and murder, whom they-were-asking-for; but delivered [the] Jesus to-the will of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And as they-led┘him└away, having-conscripted (a)-certain Simon, (a) Cyrenian coming from (the) country, they-laid-on him the cross-to carry in-front-of [the] Jesus. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And (a) big crowd of-the people and of-women were-following him, who were-mourning and weeping-for him. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And having-turned to them, [the] Jesus said, <em>“Daughters of-Jerusalem, </em><em>do</em>┘<em>not</em>└<em>cry over me.</em><em> </em><em>Instead, cry over yourselves and over the children of-you, </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>because, behold, days are-coming in which they-wi</em><em>l</em><em>l-say, ‘Blessed (are) the sterile</em><em>,</em><em> and the wombs that did┘not└bear</em><em>,</em><em> and breasts that did┘not└nurse.</em><em>’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Then they-will-begin </em><strong><em>to-say</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	to-the mountains, </em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Fall on us,</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and to-the hills, </em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Cover us.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong> <em>Because if they-do these-things in the green wood, what will-happen in the dry?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And two others were┘also└being-led with him to-be-put-to-death. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And when they-came to the place [the] called ‘(The) Skull,’ there they-crucified him and the evil-doers, one on (the) right[s] and one on (the) left[s]. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>[[And [the] Jesus was-saying/kept-saying, <em>“Father, forgive them, for they-do</em>┘not└<em>know what they-are-doing.”</em>]] And dividing-up the clothes of-him, they cast lots.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the people stood-by, watching. But the rulers were┘also└mocking, saying, <em>“He-saved others; let-him-sa</em><em>ve himself if this-o</em><em>ne is the Messiah, the chosen-One of-[the] God.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming-up and offering sour-wine to-him, <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>and saying, <em>“If </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are the king of-the Jews, save yourself.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>And (a) superscription was also over him, <em>“This is the king of-the Jews.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And one of-the criminals hung (with him), started insulting him, saying, <em>“Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> not the Messiah?</em><em> </em><em>Save yourself and us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>But the other, having-answered, rebuking him, said, <em>“Do┘you not-even└fear [the] God, because you-are in the same condemnation?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Indeed for we are┘justly└receiving things-worthy of-what-things we-did.</em><em> </em><em>But this-One did┘nothing└wrong.”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And he-continued-saying, <em>“Jesus, remember me when you-come into the kingdom of-you.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>And he-said to-him, <em>“Truly I-say to-you, today you-will-be with me in [the] Paradise.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>And it-was already (the) sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land/earth until (the) ninth hour, <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>the sun having-failed. And the curtain of-the sanctuary was-torn in-the-middle. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And having-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, [the] Jesus said, <em>“Father, I-am-entrusting the spirit of-me into (the) hands of you.”</em><em> </em>And having-said this, he quit-breathing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>Now the centurion, having-seen the-thing happened, started-glorifying [the] God, saying, <em>“</em><em>[</em><em>The] this man really </em><em><u>was</u></em><em> righteous.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>And all the crowds, having-gathered-together over [the] this spectacle, having-watched the-things having-happened, started-beating the/their chests. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>And all the-ones known to-him and (the) women [the] following him from [the] Galilee had-been-standing from afar watching these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>And behold, (a) man, Joseph by name, being (a) Council-member [and]<sup>ms</sup>, (a) good and righteous man<strong><sup>51</sup></strong>—this-one had not been-in-agreement-with the plan and the practice of-them—from Arimathea, (a) town of-the Jews, who was-waiting-for the kingdom of-[the] God—<strong><sup>52</sup></strong>this-one, having-gone-to [the] Pilate, asked-for the body of-[the] Jesus; and, <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>having-taken┘(it)└down, wrapped it<sup>neut</sup> with-(a)-linen-cloth, and put him<sup>mas</sup> in (a) rock-hewn tomb, where nobody was┘[not] not-yet└laid. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>And (the) day was Preparation, and (the) Sabbath was-coming-on. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>And the women, having-followed-along—who were following-with (him) out-of [the] Galilee, saw the tomb and how the body of-him was laid;<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>56</sup></strong>and, having-returned, prepared spices and ointment-oils. And they-rested for-the Sabbath according-to the commandment.</span>
