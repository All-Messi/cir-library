## Luke Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-looked-up, he-saw the rich casting the gifts of-them into the Treasury. 2And he-saw (a)-certain poor widow casting there two leptons, 3and said, "Truly I-say to-you that [the] this [the] poor widow cast more than-all. 4For all these cast in the/their gifts out-of the-things abounding to-them, but this-one out-of the poverty of-her she-cast all the livelihood that she-was-having."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And some talking about the temple that it-has/had-been-adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he-said, 6"These-things that you-see (the) days will-come in which (a) stone will┘not└be-left on (a) stone that will┘not└be-torn-down."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And they-asked him, saying, "Teacher, so when will these-things be and what (is) the sign when these-things will occur?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the/he said, "Beware lest you-be-deceived; for many will-come in the name of-me, saying, 'I am (the One),' and 'The time came-near.' Do┘not└go after them. 9But when you-hear-about wars and insurrections, do┘not└be-terrified. For it-is-necessary for-these-things to-occur first, but the end (is) not immediate."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then he-continued-to-say to-them, "Nation will-rise-up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, 11and great earthquakes and according-to places/many places plagues and famines, and terrors and great signs from heaven/(the)-sky will-be. 12But before all these-things they-will-put the hands of-them on you and persecute (you), delivering (you) to [the] synagogues and prisons, being-brought to kings and governors for-the-sake of-the name of-me. 13It-will-lead-to-an-opportunity for-you unto testimony. 14So put (it) in the hearts of-you not to-prepare-beforehand to-defend-yourselves. 15For I will-give you (a) mouth and wisdom that all the-ones against you will┘not└be-able to-withstand or to-speak-against. 16And you-will-be-betrayed by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they-will-put┘(some) of you└to-death, 17and you-will-be hated by all on-account-of the name of-me. 18And (a) hair of the head of-you will┘certainly not└perish. 19By the perseverance of-you, gain the souls of-you. 20"And when you-see Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, then you-know that the desolation of-it came-near. 21Then let┘the-ones in [the] Judaea└flee to the hill-country, and let┘the-ones in (the) midst of-it└depart, and let┘the-ones in the country[s] not└enter into it, 22because these are days of-revenge [the] to-fulfill all the-things written. 23Woe to-the-ones having in (the) womb/pregnant3 and to-the-ones nursing in those [the] days, for great necessity on the earth will-be and wrath for-[the] this people. 24And they-will-fall by-(the)-mouth/edge of-(the)-sword, and they-will-be-taken-captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will-be walked-on by Gentiles, until2 (the) times of-(the)-Gentiles will-be-fulfilled. 25"And signs will-be in (the) sun and moon and stars, and on [the] earth distress of-nations in despair of-(the)-roaring and wave(s) of-(the)-sea, 26men fainting from fear and foreboding of-the-things coming-on the world, for the powers of-the sky will-be-shaken. 27And then they-will-see the Son of-[the] Man coming on (a) cloud with much power and glory. 28But those-things beginning to-occur, stand and lift-up the heads of-you, because the redemption of-you is-drawing-near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And he-told them (a) parable, "Look-at the/a fig-tree and all the trees. 30When as-soon-as they-put-out (leaves) you-know that [the] summer is already near. 31Thus also you, when you-see these-things happening, know that the kingdom of-[the] God is near. 32Truly I-tell-you that [the] this generation will┘certainly not└pass-away until2 all-things happen. 33[The] sky and [the] earth will-pass-away, but the words of-me will┘certainly not└pass-away. 34"And be-on-guard lest-at-any-time the hearts of-you be-weighed-down with pleasures, and drunkenness, and life's cares; and [the] that day comes on you unexpectedly 35like (a) trap; for it-will-come upon all the-ones dwelling on (the) face of-all the earth/land. 36And stay-alert in every time, praying in-order-that you-may-be-strong to-escape all these [the] things-going to-happen and to-stand before the Son of-[the] Man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And he-was in the temple teaching [the] days; and, going-out, he-would-spend [the] nights on the Mount [the] called (the Mount) of-Olives. 38And all the people would-come-early to him in the temple to-hear him.</span>
