<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the feast of-[the] Unleavened (Loaves/Bread) [the] called Passover was-drawing-near. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the chief-priests and the scribes were-trying [the] how they-might destroy him, for they-were-afraid-of the people. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And Satan entered into Judas [the] called Iscariot, being of the number of-the twelve. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And having-gone-away, he-talked to-the chief-priests and temple-guard how he-might-deliver/betray him to-them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And they-were-glad and offered to-pay him silver-money. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And he-agreed, and he-started-looking-for (a) good-time [the] to-deliver/betray him to-them away-from (the/a) crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the day of-[the] Unleavened (Loaves/Bread) came. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And he-sent Peter and John, saying, <em>“Having-gone, prepare the Passover for-us in-order-that we-may-eat (it).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the/they said to-him, <em>“Where do-you-want (that) we-prepare (it)?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the/he said to-them, <em>“Behold, you entering into the city, (a) man will-meet you, carrying (a) pot of-water.</em><em> </em><em>Follow him to the house into which he-goes, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>and you-sha</em><em>ll-say to-the master of-the house, ‘The Teacher says to-you, “Where is the guest-room where I-may-eat the </em><em>Passover with the disciples of-me?”’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And-that-one will-show you (a) large, furnished, upstairs-room.</em><em> </em><em>There make-preparations.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-gone-away, they-found (it) even-as he-had-said to-them, and they-prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And when the hour came, he-reclined-at-table and the apostles with him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And he-said to them, <em>“With-desire I-desired to-eat this [the] Passover with you before [the] my suffering.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>For I-tell you that I-will┘certainly not└eat-it until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> it-is-fulfilled in the kingdom of-[the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-received (a) cup, having-given-thanks, he-said, <em>“Take this and </em><em>circulate</em><em> (it) to teach-other.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>For I-tell you [that]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> I-will┘certainly not└drink from the fruit of-the vine </em><em>from the now </em><em>until the kingdom of-[the] God comes.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And having-taken (a) loaf, having-given-thanks, he-broke it and gave (it) to-them, saying, <em>“This is the body of-me [the] given on-behalf-of you.</em><em> </em><em>Do this in </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> my memory.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the cup likewise after the eating, saying, <em>“This [the] cup (is) the new covenant in the blood of-me</em><em>,</em><em> [the] poured-out on-behalf-of you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But behold</em><em>,</em><em> the hand of-the-one betraying me (is) with me on the table, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>because the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an is-going according-to the-thing predetermined, but woe to-[the] that man by-whom he-is-betrayed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And <u>they</u> began to-seek with themselves [the] who of them might-be the-one intending to-do this.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And (a) dispute arose among them [the] who of-them seems-seemed to-be greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the/he said to-them, <em>“The kings of-the Gentiles lord-it-over them and the-ones having-authority-over them are-called benefactors.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But you (will) not (be) thus, but let┘</em><em>the greatest</em><em> among you└become like the youngest</em><em>, and let┘the</em><em>-one leading</em><em> └</em><em>(become) like the/a servant/minister.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>For who is greater, the-one reclining-at-table or the-one serving/ministering?</em><em> </em><em>Is-it┘not└the-one reclining-at-table?</em><em> </em><em>But </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am in (the) midst of-you as the-one serving/ministering.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are the-ones continuing with me in the trials of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>And-I am-passing-on to-you even-as the Father of-m</em><em>e passed-on (the/a) kingdom, </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>in-order-that you-may-eat and drink at the table of-me in the kingdom of-me, and you-may-sit on throne</em><em>s</em><em> judging the twelve tribes of-[the] Israel.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <em>“Simon, Simon, behold</em><em>,</em><em> [the] Satan asked [the] to-sift you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> like [the] wheat.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ut </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> prayed for you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> in-order-that the faith of-you would┘not└fail; and you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>, when having-got-turned-around</em><em>, strengthen the brothers of-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the/he said to-him, <em>“Lord, I-am ready to-go with you both to prison and to death.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> But the/he said, <em>“I-tell you, Peter, today (a) rooster will┘not└</em><em>crow till you-deny three </em><em>times (that) (you) know me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And he-said to-them, <em>“When I-sent you without money and knapsack and shoes, you-did┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└lack anything, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>did-you?”</em> And the/they said, <em>“Nothing.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And he-said to-them, <em>“But now let┘the-one having (a) cloak└take (it), likewise also (a) knapsack, and let┘the-one not having (a) sword└sell the cloak of-him, and let-him-buy (one).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>For I-tell you that this [the] written-thing is-necessary to-be-finished in me:</em><em> </em><strong><em>‘And he-was-considered with lawless-ones,</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>for also </em><em>the-thing about me has (an) end/it-has the/an application about me</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/they said, <em>“Lord, behold, here (are) two swords.”</em><em> </em> And [the] Jesus said, <em>“It-is enough.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And having-gone-out, he-went according-to [the] custom to the Mount of-[the] Olives, and the disciples also followed him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And having-arrived at the place, he-said to-them, <em>“Pray not to-enter into temptation.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And <u>he</u> went-off from them about (the) throw of-(a)-stone; and, having-put the knees/knelt<sup>3</sup>, he-began-to-pray, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Father, if you-are-willing, take this [the] cup from me.</em><em> </em><em>Except let┘not the will of-me└happen, but [the] your (will).”</em><em> </em> [[<strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And (an) angel from heaven appeared to-him, strengthening him. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And being in agony, he-prayed more-intently; and the sweat of-him became like/as-it-were drops of-blood dripping-down on the ground.]]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And having-stood-up from the prayer, having-gone to the disciples, he-found them sleeping from [the] grief; <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>and he-said to-them, <em>“Why are-you-sleeping?</em><em> </em><em>Having-stood-up, pray, in-order-that you-may┘not└enter into temptation.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> He yet speaking, behold, (a) crowd, and the-one called Judas, one of-the twelve, was-going-ahead-of them, and he-came-near to-[the] Jesus to-kiss him.</span>
