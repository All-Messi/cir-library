## Luke Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the feast of-[the] Unleavened (Loaves/Bread) [the] called Passover was-drawing-near. 2And the chief-priests and the scribes were-trying [the] how they-might destroy him, for they-were-afraid-of the people. 3And Satan entered into Judas [the] called Iscariot, being of the number of-the twelve. 4And having-gone-away, he-talked to-the chief-priests and temple-guard how he-might-deliver/betray him to-them. 5And they-were-glad and offered to-pay him silver-money. 6And he-agreed, and he-started-looking-for (a) good-time [the] to-deliver/betray him to-them away-from (the/a) crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And the day of-[the] Unleavened (Loaves/Bread) came. 8And he-sent Peter and John, saying, "Having-gone, prepare the Passover for-us in-order-that we-may-eat (it)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the/they said to-him, "Where do-you-want (that) we-prepare (it)?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the/he said to-them, "Behold, you entering into the city, (a) man will-meet you, carrying (a) pot of-water. Follow him to the house into which he-goes, 11and you-shall-say to-the master of-the house, 'The Teacher says to-you, "Where is the guest-room where I-may-eat the Passover with the disciples of-me?"' 12And-that-one will-show you (a) large, furnished, upstairs-room. There make-preparations."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-gone-away, they-found (it) even-as he-had-said to-them, and they-prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And when the hour came, he-reclined-at-table and the apostles with him. 15And he-said to them, "With-desire I-desired to-eat this [the] Passover with you before [the] my suffering. 16For I-tell you that I-will┘certainly not└eat-it until2 it-is-fulfilled in the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-received (a) cup, having-given-thanks, he-said, "Take this and circulate (it) to teach-other. 18For I-tell you [that]ms I-will┘certainly not└drink from the fruit of-the vine from the now until the kingdom of-[the] God comes."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And having-taken (a) loaf, having-given-thanks, he-broke it and gave (it) to-them, saying, "This is the body of-me [the] given on-behalf-of you. Do this in [the] my memory."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the cup likewise after the eating, saying, "This [the] cup (is) the new covenant in the blood of-me, [the] poured-out on-behalf-of you. 21But behold, the hand of-the-one betraying me (is) with me on the table, 22because the Son of-[the] Man is-going according-to the-thing predetermined, but woe to-[the] that man by-whom he-is-betrayed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And they began to-seek with themselves [the] who of them might-be the-one intending to-do this.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And (a) dispute arose among them [the] who of-them seems-seemed to-be greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the/he said to-them, "The kings of-the Gentiles lord-it-over them and the-ones having-authority-over them are-called benefactors. 26But you (will) not (be) thus, but let┘the greatest among you└become like the youngest, and let┘the-one leading └(become) like the/a servant/minister. 27For who is greater, the-one reclining-at-table or the-one serving/ministering? Is-it┘not└the-one reclining-at-table? But I am in (the) midst of-you as the-one serving/ministering. 28And you are the-ones continuing with me in the trials of-me. 29And-I am-passing-on to-you even-as the Father of-me passed-on (the/a) kingdom, 30in-order-that you-may-eat and drink at the table of-me in the kingdom of-me, and you-may-sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of-[the] Israel. 31"Simon, Simon, behold, [the] Satan asked [the] to-sift youpl like [the] wheat. 32But I prayed for yousg in-order-that the faith of-you would┘not└fail; and yousg, when having-got-turned-around, strengthen the brothers of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the/he said to-him, "Lord, I-am ready to-go with you both to prison and to death."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> But the/he said, "I-tell you, Peter, today (a) rooster will┘not└crow till you-deny three times (that) (you) know me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And he-said to-them, "When I-sent you without money and knapsack and shoes, you-did┘not┘┘└lack anything, └└did-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And he-said to-them, "But now let┘the-one having (a) cloak└take (it), likewise also (a) knapsack, and let┘the-one not having (a) sword└sell the cloak of-him, and let-him-buy (one). 37For I-tell you that this [the] written-thing is-necessary to-be-finished in me: 'And he-was-considered with lawless-ones,' for also the-thing about me has (an) end/it-has the/an application about me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/they said, "Lord, behold, here (are) two swords."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And having-gone-out, he-went according-to [the] custom to the Mount of-[the] Olives, and the disciples also followed him. 40And having-arrived at the place, he-said to-them, "Pray not to-enter into temptation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And he went-off from them about (the) throw of-(a)-stone; and, having-put the knees/knelt3, he-began-to-pray, 42saying, "Father, if you-are-willing, take this [the] cup from me. Except let┘not the will of-me└happen, but [the] your (will)." [[43And (an) angel from heaven appeared to-him, strengthening him. 44And being in agony, he-prayed more-intently; and the sweat of-him became like/as-it-were drops of-blood dripping-down on the ground.]]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And having-stood-up from the prayer, having-gone to the disciples, he-found them sleeping from [the] grief; 46and he-said to-them, "Why are-you-sleeping? Having-stood-up, pray, in-order-that you-may┘not└enter into temptation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> He yet speaking, behold, (a) crowd, and the-one called Judas, one of-the twelve, was-going-ahead-of them, and he-came-near to-[the] Jesus to-kiss him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> And Jesus said to-him, "Judas, with-(a)-kiss you-are-betraying the Son of-[the] Man?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And the-ones around him, having-seen the-thing going-to-be, said, "Lord, [whether] shall-we strike with (a) sword?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And (a)-certain one of them struck the servant of-the high-priest and cut-off the right [the] ear of-him. 51And having-answered, [the] Jesus said, "Let┘until this└go/Enough of this!" And having-touched the/his ear, he-healed him. 52And Jesus said to-the chief-priests and soldiers of-the temple and elders having-come to him, "As against (an) insurrectionist you-came-out with swords and clubs? 53According-to (the) day/Every day2 I being with you in the temple, and you-did┘not└lay [the] hands on me, but this is the hour of-you and the authority of-darkness." 54And having-arrested him, they-led (him) away and led (him) into the residence of-the high-priest. And [the] Peter was-following far-away. 55(They) having-built (a) fire in (the) middle of-the courtyard and having-sat-together, [the] Peter was-sitting in the-midst-of/among them. 56And (a)-certain servant-girl, having-seen him sitting toward the light, and having-looked-closely-at him, said, "This-one was also with him." 57And the/he denied (it), saying, "I-do┘not└know him, woman." 58And after a-little-while, anothermas, having-seen him, said, "You are also of them." 59And about one hour having-passed-by, (a)-certain other began-to-insist, saying, "Truly2 this-one was also with him, for he-is also (a) Galilean." 60And [the] Peter said, "Man, I-do┘not└know what you-are-saying." 61And the Lord having-turned, look-at [the] Peter, and [the] Peter remembered the word of-the Lord when he-said to-him [that], "Before (a) rooster crows today, you-will-deny me three-times." 62And having-gone outside, he-sobbed bitterly. 63And the men [the] holding him, began-to-mock him, hitting (him), 64and having-blindfolded him, they-wer-asking (him), "Prophesy/Proclaim; who is the-one having-hit you?" 65And blaspheming/insulting (him), they-were-saying many other-things to/at him. 66And when day came, the presbytery/eldership of-the people gathered-together, both chief-priests and scribes, and let┘him└away to the Sanhedrin of-them, 67saying, "If you are the Messiah, tell us." And he-said to-them, "If I-tell you, you-will┘not└believe (me). 68And if I-ask you, you-will┘not└answer (me). 69But from the now 'The Son of-[the] Man' will-be 'sitting on (the) right[s] of-the Power of-[the] God.'" 70And all said, "Then you are the Son of-[the] God?" 71And the/they said, "Why do-we┘yet└have need-of witness? For we┘ourselves└heard from the mouth of-him."</span>
