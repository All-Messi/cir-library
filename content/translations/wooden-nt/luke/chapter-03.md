## Luke Chapter 3

### John the Baptist's Ministry

<p class="verse"><sup>1</sup>Now in (the) fifteenth year of-the reign of-Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate governing [the] Judaea, and Herod being-tetrarch of-[the] Galilee, and Philip the brother of-him being-tetrarch of-[the] Ituraea and Trachonitis territory, and Lysanias being-tetrarch of-[the] Abilene, <sup>2</sup>at-the-time-of (the) priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—(the) word of-God came to John, the son of-Zachariah, in the desert. <sup>3</sup>And he-came into all the surrounding-territory of-the Jordan, preaching (a) baptism of-repentance for remission of-sins, <sup>4</sup>as it-is-written in (the) book of-(the)-words of-Isaiah the prophet,</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">
"(The) voice of-one crying in the desert,<br>
'Prepare the way of-(the)-Lord,<br>
be-making the paths of-him straight.<br>
<sup>5</sup>Every low-place will-be-filled,<br>
and every mountain and hill will-be-brought-down,<br>
and the crooked-things will-be into straight,<br>
and the rough ways into smooth;<br>
<sup>6</sup>And all flesh will-see the salvation of-[the] God'" [Is 40:3-5].
</blockquote>

<p class="verse"><sup>7</sup>So he-was-saying to-the crowds traveling-out to-be-baptized by him, "Generations of-snakes! Who warned you to-flee from the upcoming wrath? <sup>8</sup>So produce fruit[s] worthy of-[the] repentance; and do˥not˩begin to-say in yourselves, 'We-have [the] Abraham (as a) father.' For I-say to-you that [the] God is-able to-raise-up children for-[the] Abraham from [the] these stones. <sup>9</sup>Now indeed the ax also lies at the root of-the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit is-being-cut-down and being-thrown into (the) fire."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>10</sup>And the crowds were-asking him, saying, "What then shall-we-do?" <sup>11</sup>And having-answered, he-was-saying to-them, "Let˥the-one having two tunics˩give to-one not having (any), and let˥the-one having food[s]˩do likewise."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>12</sup>And also tax-collectors came to-be-baptized, and they-said to him, "Teacher, what shall-we-do?" <sup>13</sup>And he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the thing-ordered to-you."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>14</sup>And soldiering-ones were˥also˩asking him, saying, "And what shall˥we˩do?" And he-said to-them, "Do˥not˩take-money-by-force or extort-money-by-false-charges, and be-satisfied with the wages of-you."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>15</sup>Now the people waiting and all wondering in the hearts of-them about [the] John, whether-perhaps he might-be the Messiah, <sup>16</sup>[the] John answered, saying to-all, "I am baptizing you with-water; but the-One stronger than I is-coming, whose [the] strap of-the sandals of-him I-am not worthy to-undo; he will-baptize you with (the) Holy Spirit and fire, <sup>17</sup>whose [the] winnowing-shovel (is) in the hand of-him to-thoroughly clean-up the threshing-floor of-him, and to-gather the wheat into the granary of-him, and the chaff he-will-burn-up with-unquenchable fire."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>18</sup>Therefore encouraging them with-respect-to-many and other-things, he-preached-good-news to the people. <sup>19</sup>But [the] Herod the tetrarch, being-rebuked by him about Herodias the wife of-the brother of-him and about all (the) evil-things that [the] Herod did, <sup>20</sup>added also this on all-things: he-locked [the] John in prison.</p>

### Jesus' Baptism

<p class="verse"><sup>21</sup>And it-happened in all the people's [the] being baptized and Jesus's having-been-baptized and praying, the sky's having-opened-up <sup>22</sup>and the Holy [the] Spirit's having-come-down onto him in-visible˥bodily˩form, and/that (a) voice came out-of heaven, "You are the beloved [the] Son of-me; in you I-delight."</p>

### The Genealogy of Jesus

<p class="verse"><sup>23</sup>And Jesus himself was starting (his ministry), being about thirty years old, (the) Son—as was-supposed—</p>
