## Luke Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now in (the) fifteenth year of-the reign of-Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate governing [the] Judaea, and Herod being-tetrarch of-[the] Galilee, and Philip the brother of-him being-tetrarch of-[the] Abilene, 2at-the-time-of (the) priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—(the) word of-God came to John, the son of-Zachariah, in the desert. 3And he-came into all the surrounding-territory of-the Jordan, preaching (a) baptism of-repentance for remission of-sins, 4as it-is-written in (the) book of-(the)-words of-Isaiah the prophet,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Every low-place will-be-filled,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And all flesh will-see the salvation of-[the God.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So he-was-saying to-the crowds traveling-out to-be-baptized by him, "Generations of-snakes! Who warned you to-flee from the upcoming wrath? 8So produce fruit[s] worthy of-[the] repentance; and do┘not└begin to-say in yourselves, 'We-have [the] Abraham (as a) father.' For I-say to-you that [the] God is-able to-raise-up children for-[the] Abraham from [the] these stones. 9Now indeed the ax also lies at the root of-the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit is-being-cut-down and being-thrown into (the) fire."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the crowds were-asking him, saying, "What then shall-we-do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And having-answered, he-was-saying to-them, "Let┘the-one having two tunics└give to-one not having (any), and let┘the-one having food[s]└do likewise."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And also tax-collectors came to-be-baptized, and they-said to him, "Teacher, what shall-we-do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the/he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the thing-ordered to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And soldiering-ones were┘also└asking him, saying, "And what shall┘we└do?" And he-said to-them, "Do┘not└take-money-by force or extort-money-by-false-charges, and be-satisfied with the wages of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Now the people waiting and all wondering in the hearts of-them about [the] John, whether-perhaps he might-be the Messiah, 16[the] John answered, saying to-all, "I am baptizing you with-water; but the-One stronger than I is-coming, whose [the] strap of-the sandals of-him I-am not worthy to-undo; he will-baptize you with (the) Holy Spirit and fire, 17whose [the] winnowing-shovel (is) in the hand of-him to-thoroughly clean-up the threshing-flour of-him, and to-gather the wheat into the granary of-him, and the chaff he-will-burn-up with-unquenchable fire."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Therefore encouraging them with-respect-to-many and other-things, he-preached-good-news to the people. 19But [the] Herod the tetrarch, being-rebuked by him about Herodias the wife of-the brother of-him and about all (the) evil-things that [the] Herod did, 20added also this on all-things: [and]ms he-locked [the] John in prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And it-happened in all the people's [the] being baptized and Jesus's having-been-baptized and praying, the sky's having-opened-up 22and the Holy [the] Spirit's having-come-down onto him in-visible┘bodily└form, and/that (a) voice came out-of heaven, "You are the beloved [the] Son of-me; in you I-delight."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And Jesus himself was starting (his ministry), being about thirty years old, (the) Son—as was-supposed—</span>
