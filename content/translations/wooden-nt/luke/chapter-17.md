## Luke Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-said-to the disciples of-him, "It-is impossible [the] [the] offending-things not to-come, except woe through whom they-come. 2It-would-better for-him if (a) large millstone is-being around the neck of-him, and he-is-cast into the sea or in-order-that one of-[the] these little-one be-offended. 3Watch yourselves. If the brother of-you sins, show him his fault; and if he repents, forgive him. 4And if seven-times in-the/a day sins against you, and seven-times returns to you and says, 'I repent,' you-shall-forgive him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And the apostles said to-the Lord, "Increase faith for-us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the Lord said, "If you-have faith like (a) seed of-mustard, you┘would└say to-[the] this mulberry-tree, 'Be-uprooted and be-planted in the sea, and it┘would└obey you.' 7"Who of you having (a) servant plowing or tending-sheep, who will-say to-him, coming-in from the field, 'Immediately coming, recline-and-eat.' 8Instead, will-he┘not└say to-him, 'Prepare something I-will-eat; and having-changed-clothes, serve me until I-eat and drink; and after these-things you will-eat and drink'? 9He does┘not┘┘└thank the servant, └└does he, because he-did the-things having-been-appointed? 10So also you, when you-do all the-things having-been-appointed to-you, say [that], 'We-are unprofitable servants; we-have-done what we-ought to-do.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And it-happened in [the] traveling to Jerusalem, and/that he was-going according-to through (the) midst of-Samaria and Galilee; 12and he entering in (a)-certain village, ten lepers men met him, who stood afar-off 13and the lifted-up (the) voice, saying, "Jesus, Master; have-mercy-on us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And having-seen (them), he-said to-them, "Having-gone, show yourselves to-the priests." And it-happened in [the] their going, they-were-cleansed. 15And one of them, having-seen that he-was-cleansed, returned with (a) loud voice, glorifying [the] God. 16And he-fell on (his) face at the feet of-him, thanking him; and he was (a) Samaritan. 17And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said, "Were┘not the ten└cleansed? And where are the nine? 18Were┘not└they-found, having-returned, to-give glory to-[the] God except2 [the] this foreigner?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And he-said to-him, "Getting-up, go; the faith of-you has-saved you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-been-asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of-[the] God comes, he-answered them and said, "The kingdom of-[the] God does┘not└come with observation, 21neither will-they-say, 'Behold here,' or 'there,' for behold, the kingdom of-[the] God is between you/interpersonal." 22And he-said to the disciples, "Days will-come when you-will-long to-see one of-the days of-the Son of-[the] Man, and you-will┘not└see (it). 23And they-will-say to-you, 'Behold, there,' or, 'Behold, here.' Do┘not└go-out neither follow (them). 24For as [the] lightning, flashing from the (end) under the sky, shines to the (end) under (the) sky, thus will-be the Son of-[the] Man [in the day of-him]ms. 25But first it-is-necessary for-him to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by [the] this generation. 26And even-as it-was in the days of-Noah, so also it-will-be in the days of-the Son of-[the] Man. 27They-were-eatiing, drinking, marrying, being-given-in-marriage, until which day Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed all. 28Likewise even-as it-was in the days of-Lot, they-were-eating, drinking, buying, selling, plating, building. 29And on-which day Lot went-out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them. 30According-to the same-things it-will-be on-which day the Son of-[the] man will-be-revealed. 31And in-that [the] day who will-be on the house-top and the vessels of-him in the house—let-him┘not└go-down to-pick-up things; and likewise let┘the-one in (the) field not└go-back to the-things behind. 32Remember the wife of-Lot. 33Whoever2 seeks to-preserve the life of-him will-destroy it, and whoever2 loses (his life) will-stay-alive. 34I-say to-you, this [the] night two will-be on one bed, the one will-be-taken and the other will-be-left. [36]ms 35Twofem will-be at the same (place); the one will-be-taken and the other will-be-left."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And having-answered, they-say to-him, "Where, Lord?" And the/he said to-them, "Where the body (is), there also the buzzards will-be-gathered-together."</span>
