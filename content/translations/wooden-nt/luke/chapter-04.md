<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And Jesus, full of-(the)-Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was-being-led by the Spirit in the desert, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>being-tempted by the devil for-forty days. And he-did┘not└eat nothing/anything in [the] those days; and they having-been-finished, he-hungered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>And the devil said to-him, <em>“If you-are (the) Son of-[the] God, say to-[the] this stone [in-order]-that it-become (a) loaf.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus answered [to] him, <em>“</em><em>It-is-written [that]</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘[The] man shall</em></strong><strong><em>┘not└</em></strong><strong><em>live on bread only.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And having-led┘him└up, he-showed him all the kingdoms of-the world in (a) moment of-time. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the devil said to-him, <em>“I-will-give you all [the] this authority and the glory of-them, because it-has-been-given to-me and to-whomever I-desire to-give it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>So if you bow-down before me, all will-be of-you.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>And having-answered, the Jesus said to-him, <em>“It-is-written,</em> <strong><em>‘You-shall-worship (the) Lord the God of-you,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd you-shall-serve him </em></strong>only.’”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And he-led him to Jerusalem and stood (him) on the pinnacle of-the temple, and said to-him, <em>“If you-are (the) Son of-[the] God, throw yourself down from-here, </em><strong><em><sup>10</sup></em></strong><em>for it-is-written,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘He-will-command the angels of-him about you [the] to-guard you.’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>and [that]</em> <strong><em>‘They-will-carry you on (the) hands (of-them),</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>l</em></strong><strong><em>est-at-any-time you strike the foot of-you against (a) rock.’</em></strong><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And all were-testifying to-him and were-marveling at the words of-[the] grace [the] coming-out of the mouth of-him, and they-began to-say, <em>“Is this-One not (the) son of-Joseph?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And having-finished every temptation, the devil went-away from him until (an) opportunity (would come).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And he-came to Nazareth, where he-was raised, and according-to the custom of-him, he-went into the synagogue on the day of-the Sabbath[s] and stood up to-read. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And (a) book of-the prophet Isaiah was-given to-him; and having-unrolled the book, he-found the place where it-was written, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong><em>“(The) Spirit of-(the)-Lord (is) on me,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	for-the-sake-of which he-anointed me</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	to-preach to-(the)-poor.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	He-has-sent me to-preach release to-captives</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and sigh</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em> to-(the)-blind</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	to-send-away in freedom </em></strong><strong><em>(the) downtrodden,</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong><em>to-preach (the) acceptable year of-(the)-Lord.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And having-rolled-up the scroll, having-given (it) to-the attendant, he-sat-down; and the eyes of-all in the synagogue were looking-at him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And he-began-by-saying to them [that], <em>“Today [the] this scripture has-been-fulfilled in the ears of-you.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And he-said to-them, <em>“No doubt you-will-say to-me, ‘Doctor, heal yourself.</em><em> </em><em>As-many-things-as we-heard done in (the) Capernaum, do also here in the homeland of-you.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And he-said, <em>“Truly I-tell you that no prophet is </em><em>welcomed</em><em> in the homeland of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>And in truth I-say to-you, many widows were in [the] Israel in the days of-Elijah, when [the] sky was-shut-up for three years and six months</em><em>,</em><em> when (a) severe f</em><em>amine was on all the land/earth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>A</em><em>nd Elijah was-sent to-none of-them except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> to (a) widow woman in Zarephath of-Sidon.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And many lepers were in [the] Israel at-the time-of Elisha the prophet, and none of-them was</em><em>/were</em><em> cleansed except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> Naaman the Syrian.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And they┘all└were-filled-with anger in the synagogue, hearing these-things. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And having-risen-up, they-threw him out of-the town, and led him to (a) brow of-the hill on which their town was-built so-as-to throw┘him└over-the-cliff. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But <u>he</u>, having-passed through (the) midst of-them, left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And he-went-down to Capernaum, (a) city of-[the] Galilee, and he-was teaching on the Sabbath[s]. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And they-were-being-astonished at the teaching of-him, because the word of-him was with authority. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And in the synagogue was (a) man having (a) spirit of-(an)-unclean demon, and it-cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>“Ha, what to-us and to-you, Jesus Nazarene?</em><em> </em><em>Did-you-come to-destroy us?</em><em> </em><em>I-know who </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are, the Holy-One of-[the] God.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus rebuked it, saying, <em>“</em><em>Be-quiet and come-out from him</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> And having-convulsed him, the demon came-out from him in the midst, having-harmed him nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>And wonder came on all, and they-began to-talk to one-another, saying, <em>“What (is) [the] this word that with authority and power he-orders </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> unclean spirits and they-come-out.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And the news about him went-out into every place in the surrounding [the] countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And having-arisen from the synagogue, he-went into the house of-Simon. And (the) mother-in-law of-[the] Simon was sick with-(a) ┘high└fever, and they-asked him about her. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And having-stood over her, he-rebuked (the) fever, and it-left her. And immediately having-gotten-up, she-started ministering to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And the sun setting, all as-many-as had ones-being-sick with various diseases brought them to him. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And demons also were-coming-out from many, crying-out and saying [that], <em>“You are the Son of-[the] God</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> And rebuking (them), he-would┘not└allow them to-speak, because they-knew him to-be the Messiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And day having-come, having-gone-out into (an) unpopulated place [and] the crowd[s] were/was-looking-for him, and/that they-came to him and tried-to-keep him [the] (that) he not go-away from them. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And the/he said to them [that] and to-[the] other cities it-is-necessary for-me to-preach the kingdom of-[the] God, because for this I-was sent. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And he-was preaching in the synagogues of-[the] Judaea.</span>
