<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And Jesus, full of-(the)-Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was-being-led by the Spirit in the desert, 2being-tempted by the devil for-forty days. And he-did┘not└eat nothing/anything in [the] those days; and they having-been-finished, he-hungered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the devil said to-him, "If you-are (the) Son of-[the] God, say to-[the] this stone [in-order]-that it-become (a) loaf."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus answered [to] him, "It-is-written [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-led┘him└up, he-showed him all the kingdoms of-the world in (a) moment of-time. 6And the devil said to-him, "I-will-give you all [the] this authority and the glory of-them, because it-has-been-given to-me and to-whomever I-desire to-give it. 7So if you bow-down before me, all will-be of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-answered, the Jesus said to-him, "It-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he-led him to Jerusalem and stood (him) on the pinnacle of-the temple, and said to-him, "If you-are (the) Son of-[the] God, throw yourself down from-here, 10for it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And all were-testifying to-him and were-marveling at the words of-[the] grace [the] coming-out of the mouth of-him, and they-began to-say, "Is this-One not (the) son of-Joseph?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-finished every temptation, the devil went-away from him until (an) opportunity (would come).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And he-came to Nazareth, where he-was raised, and according-to the custom of-him, he-went into the synagogue on the day of-the Sabbath[s] and stood up to-read. 17And (a) book of-the prophet Isaiah was-given to-him; and having-unrolled the book, he-found the place where it-was written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-rolled-up the scroll, having-given (it) to-the attendant, he-sat-down; and the eyes of-all in the synagogue were looking-at him. 21And he-began-by-saying to them [that], "Today [the] this scripture has-been-fulfilled in the ears of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-said to-them, "No doubt you-will-say to-me, 'Doctor, heal yourself. As-many-things-as we-heard done in (the) Capernaum, do also here in the homeland of-you.'" 24And he-said, "Truly I-tell you that no prophet is welcomed in the homeland of-him. 25And in truth I-say to-you, many widows were in [the] Israel in the days of-Elijah, when [the] sky was-shut-up for three years and six months, when (a) severe famine was on all the land/earth. 26And Elijah was-sent to-none of-them except2 to (a) widow woman in Zarephath of-Sidon. 27And many lepers were in [the] Israel at-the time-of Elisha the prophet, and none of-them was/were cleansed except2 Naaman the Syrian."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And they┘all└were-filled-with anger in the synagogue, hearing these-things. 29And having-risen-up, they-threw him out of-the town, and led him to (a) brow of-the hill on which their town was-built so-as-to throw┘him└over-the-cliff. 30But he, having-passed through (the) midst of-them, left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And he-went-down to Capernaum, (a) city of-[the] Galilee, and he-was teaching on the Sabbath[s]. 32And they-were-being-astonished at the teaching of-him, because the word of-him was with authority. 33And in the synagogue was (a) man having (a) spirit of-(an)-unclean demon, and it-cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, 34"Ha, what to-us and to-you, Jesus Nazarene? Did-you-come to-destroy us? I-know who you are, the Holy-One of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And [the] Jesus rebuked it, saying, "Be-quiet and come-out from him." And having-convulsed him, the demon came-out from him in the midst, having-harmed him nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And wonder came on all, and they-began to-talk to one-another, saying, "What (is) [the] this word that with authority and power he-orders [the] unclean spirits and they-come-out." 37And the news about him went-out into every place in the surrounding [the] countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And having-arisen from the synagogue, he-went into the house of-Simon. And (the) mother-in-law of-[the] Simon was sick with-(a) ┘high└fever, and they-asked him about her. 39And having-stood over her, he-rebuked (the) fever, and it-left her. And immediately having-gotten-up, she-started ministering to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And the sun setting, all as-many-as had ones-being-sick with various diseases brought them to him. 41And demons also were-coming-out from many, crying-out and saying [that], "You are the Son of-[the] God." And rebuking (them), he-would┘not└allow them to-speak, because they-knew him to-be the Messiah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And day having-come, having-gone-out into (an) unpopulated place [and] the crowd[s] were/was-looking-for him, and/that they-came to him and tried-to-keep him [the] (that) he not go-away from them. 43And the/he said to them [that] and to-[the] other cities it-is-necessary for-me to-preach the kingdom of-[the] God, because for this I-was sent. 44And he-was preaching in the synagogues of-[the] Judaea.</span>
