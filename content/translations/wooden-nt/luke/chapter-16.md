## Luke Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-continued-by-saying also to the disciples, "(A)-certain man was rich, who had (a) property-manager; and this-one was-reported to-him as wasting the possessions of-him. 2And having-called him, he-said to-him, 'What (is) this I-hear about you? Give the/an account of-the stewardship of-you, for you-are┘not└able to-continue-as-property-manager.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the property-manager said in himself, 'What will-I-do, because the lord of-me is-taking┘the stewardship└away from me? I-am┘not└strong-enough to-labor; I-am-ashamed to-beg. 4I-knew what I-will-do, in-order-that when I-am-dismissed from the stewardship, they-will welcome me into the houses of-them.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-called-to-(him) each one of-the debtors of-the lord of-him, he-started-out-by-saying to-the first, 'How-much do-you-owe the lord of-me?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the/he said, '(A) hundred measures of-oil.' And the/he said to-him, 'Take the bill of-you, having-sat-down quickly, write, "Fifty."'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then he-said to-another, 'And how-much do┘you└owe?'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And the lord complimented the property-manager of-[the] unrighteousness because he-acted wisely. Because the sons of-[the] this age are wiser than the children of-[the] light in [the] generation [the] of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And I say to-you, make for-yourselves friends by the mammon/wealth of-[the] unrighteousness, in-order-that when it-runs-out they-will-welcome you into [the] permanent tents. 10The-one faithful in least is also faithful in much, and the-one unjust in least is also unjust in much. 11If then you-were not faithful in unjust mammon/wealth, who will-entrust the true to-you? 12And if you-were not faithful in the other-person's-thing, who will-give you [the] your-own? 13No household-servant is-able to-serve two masters, for either he-will-hate the one and love the other, or he-will-be-attentive-to one and disregard the other. You-are┘not└able to-serve God and wealth/mammon."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the Pharisees were-listening-to all these-things, being lovers-of-money, and they-started-making-fun-of him. 15And he-said to-them, "You are the ones justifying yourselves before [the] men, but [the] God knows the hearts of-you, because the exalted thing among men (is) (an) abomination of-[the] God. 16The Law and the prophets (were) until John. From then the kingdom of-[the] God is-being-preached, and everybody is-trying-to-get in it by force. 17It-is easier for the sky and the earth to-pass-away than for-one serif of-the Law to-fail, 18Everybody [the] divorcing the wife of him commits adultery, and the-one marrying one-divorced from (a) man commits adultery. 19"(A)-certain man was rich, and he-would-be-dressed in-purple and fine-linen, celebrating splendidly according-to-(the) day/every day. 20And (a) certain poor (man), Lazarus by-name, had-been-put at the gate of-him, covered with sores 21and longing to-be-fed from the-things falling from the table of-the rich (man). But the dogs even, coming, would-lick the sores of-him. 22And it-happened the poor-(man)'s dying and his being carried-away by the angels to-the bosom of-Abraham. And the rich (man) also died and was-buried. 23And in [the] Hades, having-lifted-up the eyes of-him, being in torments, he-sees Abraham from afar and Lazarus in the bosom[s] of-him. 24And he, having-called-out, said, 'Father Abraham, have-mercy-on me and send Lazarus in-order-that he-may-dip the tip of-the finger of him of-water and cool the tongue of-me, because I-am-in-agony in [the] this flame.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you-received [the] good-things of-you in the life of-you, and Lazarus likewise [the] bad-things. But now he-is-being-comforted here, and you are-suffering. 26And in all these-things/besides2, between us and you (a) large chasm has-been-fixed, in-order-that the-ones wanting to-pass-over hence to-you are┘not└able, nor thence to-us they-may┘not└pass.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Then he-said, 'I-ask you then, Father, [in-order]-that you-send him to the house of-the father of-me, 28for I-have five brothers, in-order-that he-may-testify to-them in-order-that they may┘not└come to [the] this place of-[the] torment.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But Abraham says, 'They-have Moses and the prophets, let-them-listen-to them.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the/he said, 'No, Father Abraham; but if somebody went to them from the dead, the-would-repent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And he-said to-him, 'If they-do┘not└listen-to Moses and the prophets, neither if somebody arose from (the) dead will-they-be-persuaded.'"</span>
