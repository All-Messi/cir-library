## Luke Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Inasmuch-as many took-in-hand to-draw-up (an) account about the-things fulfilled among us, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>even-as the-ones being eyewitnesses from (the) beginning and minsters of-the word, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>it-seemed-good to-me-also, having-traced all-things from the-beginning, to-write to-you in-orderly-fashion, most-excellent Theophilus, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>in-order-that you-may-know the accuracy about what words you-were-orally instructed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It-happened in the days of-Herod, king of-[the] Judaea, (that there was) (a) certain priest, Zachariah by-name, from (the) course of-Abijah, and (the) wife to-him (was) from the daughters of-Aaron, and the name of-her (was) Elizabeth. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And they-were both just before [the] God, going in all the commandments and just-requirements of-the Lord, blameless. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And (a) child was not to-them, because [the] Elizabeth was sterile, and both were advanced in the years of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his carrying-out-the priesthood-duties in the order of-the course of-him before [the] God—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>according-to the custom of-the priestly-office, he-was-chosen-by-lot [the] to-offer-incense, having-entered into the sanctuary of-the Lord—<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and/that all the multitude of-the people was praying outside at-the hour of-[the] incense-offering. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord appeared to-him, standing of (the) right[s] of-the altar of-[the] incense. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And Zachariah was-troubled, having seen (him); and fear fell on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And the angel said to him, “<em>Do┘not└fear, Zachariah, because the prayer of-you was-heard, and the wife of</em><em>-you, Elizabeth, will-bear (a)s</em><em>on to-you</em><em>,</em><em> and you-will-call the name of-him John.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And he-will-be (a) joy to-you and gladness, and many will-rejoice at the birth of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>For he-will-be-great before [the]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> Lord, and he-will┘certainly</em><em> not└drink wine and strong-beer;</em><em> and he-will-be-full of-(the)-Holy Spirit even from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-him, </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and he-will-turn many of-the sons of-Israel to (the) Lord the God of-them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> will-go before him in (the) spirit and power of-Elijah, to-turn (the) hearts of-fathers to-(their)-children and (the) disobedient-ones to (the) attitude of-(the)-righteous, to-ready (a) people prepared for-(the)-Lord.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Zachariah said to the angel, <em>“According-to what will-I-know this?</em><em> </em><em>For I am (an) old-man, and the wife of-me (is) advanced in the days of-her.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the angel, having-answered, said to-him, <em>“I am Gabriel</em><em>,</em><em> the-one standing before the God and I-was-sent to-speak to you and to-tell-you these-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And behold, you-will-be silent and not able to-speak until which day these-things happen, instead-of-which things you-did┘not└believe the words of-me, which will-be-fulfilled in the time of-them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the people were waiting-for [the] Zachariah, and they-were-being-amazed in [the] his spending-time in the sanctuary. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And having-come-out, he-was┘not└able to-speak to-them; and they-surmised that he-has/had-seen (a) vision in the sanctuary, and he was signaling to-them and remained mute. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And it-happened when the days of-the service of-him were-fulfilled, (that) he-went-away to the house of-him. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And after these [the] days Elizabeth the wife of-him became-pregnant, and she-hid herself for-five months, saying <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>[that], <em>“Thus (the) Lord has-done to-me in-which he-looked-on (me) to-take-away (the) disgrace of-me among men.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And in the sixth [the] month, the angel Gabriel was-sent from [the] God to (a) town of-[the] Galilee to-which (was) (the) name Nazareth, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>to (a) virgin engaged to-(a)-man (the) name to-whom (was) Joseph, of (the) house of-David; and the name of-the virgin (was) Mary. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And having-come-inside to her, he-said, <em>“</em><em>Mary, h</em><em>ail, favored-one;</em><em> the Lord (is) with you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And she-was-startled at the word and, was-wondering what-sort this [the] salutation would-be.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>And the angel said to-her, <em>“Do┘not└be-afraid, Mary; for you-found favor with [the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>And behold, you-wi</em><em>ll-conceive in (the) womb and b</em><em>ear (a) son, and you-will-call the name of-him Jesus.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>This-one will-be great and will-be-called (the) Son of-(the)-Highest, and [the] God will-give to-him the throne of-David the father of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>And he-will-rule over the house of-Jacob unto the ages/forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>, and (an) end of-the kingdom of-him will┘not└be.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And Mary said to the angel, <em>“How will┘this└be, because I-do┘not└know (a) husband?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the angel, having-answered, said to-her, <em>“(The) Holy Spirit will-come over you, and (the) power of-(the)-Highest will-overshadow you.</em><em> </em><em>Wherefore also the holy (child)</em><em> begotten will-be-called (the) S</em><em>on of-God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>And behold, Eli</em><em>zabeth the kinsman of-you—</em><em>even</em><em>/</em><em>also she-conceiv</em><em>ed (a) son in (the) womb of-her;</em><em> and this is (the) sixth month for-her the-one </em><em>called </em><em>sterile, </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>because any thing will┘not└be-impossible with [the] God.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And Mary said<em>, “Behold, the servant of-(the)-Lord.</em><em> </em><em>May-it-become to-me according-to the word of-you.”</em><em> </em> And the angel went-away from her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And Mary, having-arisen in [the] these days, traveled to the hill-country with haste to (a) city of-Judah, <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>and she-entered into the house of-Zachariah and greeted [the] Elizabeth. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And it-happened when [the] Elizabeth heard the salutation of-[the] Mary, (that) the baby kicked in the womb of-her, and [the] Elizabeth was-filled-with (the) Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And she shouted with-(a)-loud voice and said, <em>“Blessed (are) you among women and blessed (is) the fruit of-the womb of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>And whence to-me (is) this [in-order]-that the mother of-the Lord of-me should-come to me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>For behold, when the sound of-the sal</em><em>u</em><em>tation of-you came</em><em> into the ears of-me, the baby kicked in the womb of-me with joy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>And blessed is the-one having-believed that (an) end will-be to-the-things spoken to-her from (the) Lord.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And Mary said, <em>“The soul of-me holds┘the Lord└in-high-honor,</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup><em>	</em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>and the spirit of-me rejoiced over [the] God the Savior of-me,</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>because he-had-regard for the humble-cir</em><em>cumstance of-the servant of-him;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	f</em><em>or behold, from the now all </em><em>[the] generations will-bless me;</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>because the Mighty-One did great-things for-me;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	a</em><em>nd the name of-him (is) holy.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>And the mercy of-him (is) unto generations and generations</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>to-the-ones fearing him.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>He-did (a) mighty-thing with (the) arm of-him;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>he-scattered (the) proud in (the</em><em>) vanity of-(the)-heart of-them.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><strong><sup>52</sup></strong><em>He-brought-down powerful-ones from (their) thrones,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>and he-exalted the humble-ones.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v56"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to the house of-her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the-time was-fulfilled to-[the] Elizabeth [the] for-her to-give-birth, and she-bore (a) son. <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>And the neighbors and the kinsmen of-her heard that (the) Lord was-magnifying the mercy of-him with her, and they-were-rejoicing-with her. <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>And it-happened on the eighth [the] day, they-came to-circumcise the little-child, and they-were-calling him by the name of-the father of-him Zachariah. <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>And having-responded, the mother of-him said, <em>“No, but he-will-be-called John.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup><strong>61</strong></sup>And they-said to her [that], <em>“Nobody is out-of the kinsmen of-you who is-called by-[the] this name.”</em><em> </em></span>
