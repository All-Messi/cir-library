## Luke Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-called–together the twelve, he-gave them power and authority over all the demons and to-heal diseases; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and he-sent┘them└out to-preach the kingdom of-[the] God and to-heal [the] sicknesses, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and he-said to-them, <em>“Take nothing for the road, neither rod </em><em>n</em><em>or </em><em>knapsack</em><em>, nor bread nor money nor </em><em>have two tunics; </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>and into whatever house you-enter, stay there and go-out from-there.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And as-many-as</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> do┘not└welcome you, going-out from [the] that city, shake the dust off the feet of-you for (a) testimony to them.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And going-out, they-began-to-go-through according-to the villages<sup>3</sup>/every village<sup>3</sup>, evangelizing and healing everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And Herod the tetrarch heard-about all the-things happening, and he-was-perplexed on-account-of the saying by some that John was-resurrected from the dead, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and by some that Elijah appeared, and (by) others that (a) certain prophet of-the old arose. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And Herod said, <em>“I beheaded John.</em><em> </em><em>And who is this concerning whom I-hear such-things?”</em><em> </em>And he-was-trying to-see him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the apostles, having-returned, related to-him as-many-things-as they-did. And taking┘them└along, he-withdrew privately<sup>2</sup> into (a) city called Bethsaida. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But the crowds, having-found-out, followed him; and, having-welcomed them, he-began-to-speak to-them about the kingdom of-[the] God, and he-was-healing the-ones having need of healing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the day began to-draw-to-a-close. And the twelve, having-come, said to-him, <em>“Dismiss the crowd, in-order-that, having-gone into the surrounding villages and coun</em><em>tryside, they-might-find-</em><em>lodging and </em><em>might-</em><em>find something-to-eat, because we-are here in (an) unpopulated place.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-said to them, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> give to-them (something) to-eat.”</em> And the/they said, <em>“Not more than five loaves and two fish are to-us, unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>, having-gone, we-buy food[s] for all this [the] people.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For about five thousand men were. And he-said to the disciples of-him, <em>“Seat them in-groups of┘about</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>└fifty.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And they-did so, and they-sat-(them) ┘all└down. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And having-taken the five loaves and the two fish, having-looked-up into the sky, he-blessed them and broke┘them└up and started-giving (them) to-the disciples to-pass-around to-the crowd. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And they-ate and all were-satisfied, and the leftover to-them of-(the)-pieces was-picked-up, twelve baskets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And it-happened in [the] him to-be praying alone<sup>2</sup> (that) the disciples were-with him, and he-asked them, saying, <em>“Whom do┘the crowds└say me to-be?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And they/they, having-answered, said, <em>“John the Baptist; and other</em><em>s</em><em>, Elijah; and others</em><em>,</em><em> that (a)-certain prophet of-the old-ones arose.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-said to-them, <em>“But whom do┘</em><em><u>you</u></em><em>└say me to-be?”</em> And Peter, having-answered, said, <em>“The Messiah of-[the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-strictly-charged them, commanded (them) to-say this to nobody/anybody, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>having-said [that], <em>“</em><em>It-is-necessary for-the S</em><em>on of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by the elders and chief-priests and scribes and to-be-put-to-death and on-the third day to-be-resurrected.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-was-saying to all, <em>“If anybody wants to-come after me, let-him-deny himself and pick-up the cross of-him </em><em>according-to (the) day/daily</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> and let-him-follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>For whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> wants to-save the life of-him will-lose it; but whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me—this-one will-save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>For what is┘(a) men└profited having-gained the whole world and having-lost or forfeited himself?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>For whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> is-ashamed-of me and [the] my words—this-one the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an will-be-ashamed-of when he-comes in the glory of-him and the Father and the holy angels.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And I-say to-you truly, some of-the-ones standing here are who will┘certainly not└taste of-death until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> they-see the kingdom of-[the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And it-happened after [the] these words about eight days [and/that]<sup>ms</sup>, having-taken-along Peter and John and James, he-went-up on the/a mountain to-pray. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his praying the appearance of-the face of-him (became) different, and the clothes of-him (became) brilliant white. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And behold, two men were-talking-with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>who having-appeared in glory were-talking-about the exodus of-him, which was-about to-fulfill in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And [the] Peter and the-ones with him were weighed-down with-sleep, but, having-been-fully-awake, they-saw the glory of-him and the two men [the] standing-with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And it-happened in [the] their departing from him (that) [the] Peter said to [the] Jesus, <em>“Master, our being here is good, and let-us-make three tents, one for-you, and one for-Moses and one for-Elijah,</em><em>”</em><em> </em>not having-known what he-is/was-saying. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And he saying these-things, (a) cloud came and engulfed them; and they-were-afraid in [the] their entering into the cloud. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And (a) voice came out-of the cloud, saying, <em>“This is [the] my [the] chosen Son; listen-to him.</em> <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And [the] in the voice having-come, Jesus was-found alone and they were-silent and reported to-nobody in those [the] days nothing/anything of-what-things they-have/had-seen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And it-happened on-the next day, they having-descended from the mountain, (a) big crowd met him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And behold, (a) man from the crowd, called-out, saying, <em>“Teacher, I-beg of-you to-look-at the son of-me, because he-is my only (son); </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> behold, (a) spirit seizes him and suddenly he-screams and it-convulses him with foaming, and hardly departs from him, bruising him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>And I-begged the disciples of-you </em><em>[</em><em>in-order</em><em>]</em><em>-that they-might-cast┘it└out, and they-were┘[not]└unable.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to the disciples of-him, <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>“[O] faithless and perverse generation, until when will-I be with you and deal-with you?</em><em> </em><em>Bring the son of-you here.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And he yet coming, the demon attacked him and convulsed (him). And [the] Jesus rebuked the unclean [the] spirit and healed the child and gave┘him└back to-the father of-him. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And all were-marveling at the greatness of-[the] God. And all marveling at all-things that he-was-doing, he-said to-the disciples of-him, <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>“You put [the] these words into the ears of-you.</em><em> </em><em>For </em><em>the S</em><em>on of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an </em><em>will </em><em>be-betrayed into (the) hands of-men.”</em> <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>But the/they were-not–understanding [the] this word, and it-was hidden from them in-order-that they-might┘not└understand it, and they-were-afraid to-ask him about the word of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And (a) discussion came-up among them [the] who would be greatest of-them. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus, knowing the reasoning of-the heart of-them, having-taken (a) child, he-stood him beside himself, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>and said to-them, <em>“Whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> receive this [the] child in the name of-me, receives me; and whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> receives me, receives the-One having-sent me.</em><em> </em><em>For the-one being least among you all—this-one is great.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And having-responded, John said, <em>“Master we-saw somebody casting-out demons in the name of-you, and we-forbid him, because he-is┘not└following with us.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> But [the] Jesus said to him, <em>“Do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>forbid (him), for who is not against us is for us.”</em></span>
