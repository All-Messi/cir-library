## Luke Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-called–together the twelve, he-gave them power and authority over all the demons and to-heal diseases; 2and he-sent┘them└out to-preach the kingdom of-[the] God and to-heal [the] sicknesses, 3and he-said to-them, "Take nothing for the road, neither rod nor knapsack, nor bread nor money nor have two tunics; 4and into whatever house you-enter, stay there and go-out from-there. 5And as-many-as2 do┘not└welcome you, going-out from [the] that city, shake the dust off the feet of-you for (a) testimony to them." 6And going-out, they-began-to-go-through according-to the villages3/every village3, evangelizing and healing everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And Herod the tetrarch heard-about all the-things happening, and he-was-perplexed on-account-of the saying by some that John was-resurrected from the dead, 8and by some that Elijah appeared, and (by) others that (a) certain prophet of-the old arose. 9And Herod said, "I beheaded John. And who is this concerning whom I-hear such-things?" And he-was-trying to-see him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the apostles, having-returned, related to-him as-many-things-as they-did. And taking┘them└along, he-withdrew privately2 into (a) city called Bethsaida. 11But the crowds, having-found-out, followed him; and, having-welcomed them, he-began-to-speak to-them about the kingdom of-[the] God, and he-was-healing the-ones having need of healing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the day began to-draw-to-a-close. And the twelve, having-come, said to-him, "Dismiss the crowd, in-order-that, having-gone into the surrounding villages and countryside, they-might-find-lodging and might-find something-to-eat, because we-are here in (an) unpopulated place."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-said to them, "You give to-them (something) to-eat." And the/they said, "Not more than five loaves and two fish are to-us, unless2, having-gone, we-buy food[s] for all this [the] people." 14For about five thousand men were.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And they-did so, and they-sat-(them) ┘all└down. 16And having-taken the five loaves and the two fish, having-looked-up into the sky, he-blessed them and broke┘them└up and started-giving (them) to-the disciples to-pass-around to-the crowd. 17And they-ate and all were-satisfied, and the leftover to-them of-(the)-pieces was-picked-up, twelve baskets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And it-happened in [the] him to-be praying alone2 (that) the disciples were-with him, and he-asked them, saying, "Whom do┘the crowds└say me to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And they/they, having-answered, said, "John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that (a)-certain prophet of-the old-ones arose."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-said to-them, "But whom do┘you└say me to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-strictly-charged them, commanded (them) to-say this to nobody/anybody, 22having-said [that], "It-is-necessary for-the Son of-[the] Man to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by the elders and chief-priests and scribes and to-be-put-to-death and on-the third day to-be-resurrected."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-was-saying to all, "If anybody wants to-come after me, let-him-deny himself and pick-up the cross of-him according-to (the) day/daily2 and let-him-follow me. 24For whoever2 wants to-save the life of-him will-lose it; but whoever2 loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me—this-one will-save it. 25For what is┘(a) men└profited having-gained the whole world and having-lost or forfeited himself? 26For whoever2 is-ashamed-of me and [the] my words—this-one the Son of-[the] Man will-be-ashamed-of when he-comes in the glory of-him and the Father and the holy angels. 27And I-say to-you truly, some of-the-ones standing here are who will┘certainly not└taste of-death until2 they-see the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And it-happened after [the] these words about eight days [and/that]ms, having-taken-along Peter and John and James, he-went-up on the/a mountain to-pray. 29And it-happened in [the] his praying the appearance of-the face of-him (became) different, and the clothes of-him (became) brilliant white. 30And behold, two men were-talking-with him, who were Moses and Elijah, 31who having-appeared in glory were-talking-about the exodus of-him, which was-about to-fulfill in Jerusalem. 32And [the] Peter and the-ones with him were weighed-down with-sleep, but, having-been-fully-awake, they-saw the glory of-him and the two men [the] standing-with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And it-happened in [the] their departing from him (that) [the] Peter said to [the] Jesus, "Master, our being here is good, and let-us-make three tents, one for-you, and one for-Moses and one for-Elijah," not having-known what he-is/was-saying. 34And he saying these-things, (a) cloud came and engulfed them; and they-were-afraid in [the] their entering into the cloud. 35And (a) voice came out-of the cloud, saying, "This is [the] my [the] chosen Son; listen-to him. 36And [the] in the voice having-come, Jesus was-found alone and they were-silent and reported to-nobody in those [the] days nothing/anything of-what-things they-have/had-seen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And it-happened on-the next day, they having-descended from the mountain, (a) big crowd met him. 38And behold, (a) man from the crowd, called-out, saying, "Teacher, I-beg of-you to-look-at the son of-me, because he-is my only (son); 39and behold, (a) spirit seizes him and suddenly he-screams and it-convulses him with foaming, and hardly departs from him, bruising him. 40And I-begged the disciples of-you [in-order]-that they-might-cast┘it└out, and they-were┘[not]└unable."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, said to the disciples of-him, 44"[O] faithless and perverse generation, until when will-I be with you and deal-with you? Bring the son of-you here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And he yet coming, the demon attacked him and convulsed (him). And [the] Jesus rebuked the unclean [the] spirit and healed the child and gave┘him└back to-the father of-him. 43And all were-marveling at the greatness of-[the] God. And all marveling at all-things that he-was-doing, he-said to-the disciples of-him, 44"You put [the] these words into the ears of-you. For the Son of-[the] Man will be-betrayed into (the) hands of-men." 45But the/they were-not–understanding [the] this word, and it-was hidden from them in-order-that they-might┘not└understand it, and they-were-afraid to-ask him about the word of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And (a) discussion came-up among them [the] who would be greatest of-them. 47And [the] Jesus, knowing the reasoning of-the heart of-them, having-taken (a) child, he-stood him beside himself, 48and said to-them, "Whoever2 receive this [the] child in the name of-me, receives me; and whoever2 receives me, receives the-One having-sent me. For the-one being least among you all—this-one is great."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And having-responded, John said, "Master we-saw somebody casting-out demons in the name of-you, and we-forbid him, because he-is┘not└following with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> But [the] Jesus said to him, "Do┘not└forbid (him), for who is not against us is for us." 51And it-happened in [the] the days of-the ascension of-him being-fulfilled, and/that he set the/his face [the] to-go to Jerusalem. 52And he-sent messengers before (the) face of-him, and having-gonepl, they-entered into (a) village of-Samaritans as to-prepare for-him. 53And they-did┘not└receive him because the face of-him was heading toward Jerusalem. 54And having-seen, the disciples James and John said, "Lord, do-you-want (that) we-should call fire to-come-down from the sky and destroy them?" 55And having-turned, he-rebuked them. 56And they-went to another village. 57And they going on the way, (a)-certain-one said, 58And [the] Jesus said to-him, "[The] foxes have dens and [the] birds have nests, but the Son of-[the Man does┘not└have where he-may-lay the/his head." 59And he-said to another, "Follow me." And the/he said, "[Lord]ms, allow me first, having-gone, to-bury the father of-me." 60And he-said to-him, "Let the dead to-bury [the] their dead. But you, having-gone, proclaim the kingdom of-[the] God." 61And another said, "I-will-follow you, Lord, but first let me bid-farewell to the-ones in the house of–me." 62And [the] Jesus said [to him]ms, "Nobody having-put the/his hand on (a) plow and looking into the-things behind is fit for-the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>
