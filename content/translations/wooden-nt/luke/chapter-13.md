## Luke Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And some were-present at the very time reporting to-him about the Galileans the blood of-whom Pilate mixed with the sacrifices of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And, having-answered, he-said to-them, "Do-you-suppose that [the] these Galileans were sinners from all the Galileans because they-suffered these-things? 3No, I-tell you, but if you-do┘not└repent, you┘all└will┘likewise└perish. 4And those [the] eighteen on whom the tower at [the] Siloam fell and killed them, do-you-suppose they were sinners from all the men [the] dwelling-in Jerusalem? 5No, I-tell you, but if you-do┘not└repent, you┘all└will┘likweise└perish."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And he-continued-by-telling this [the] parable, "(A) certain-(man) had (a) fig-tree planted in the vineyard of-him, and he-came looking-for fruit on it and did┘not└find (any). 7And he-said to-the vineyard-keeper, 'Behold, for-three years from which I-come looking-for fruit on [the] this fig-tree, and I-am┘not└finding (any). So cut┘it└down; why is-it┘even└using-up the ground?' 8But the/he, having-answered, says to-him, 'Lord, leave it also for-this [the] year, until when I-dig around it and put manure (around it), 9and-if it-bears fruit unto the coming (year). And if not, you-will-cut┘it└down.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And he-was teaching in one of-the synagogues on the Sabbath[s]. 11And behold, (a) woman having (a) spirit of-sickness for-eighteen years and she-was being-bent down and not able to-straighten-up at-all2. 12And having-seen him, [the] Jesus, he-called┘(her)└to-(him), and he-said to-her, "Woman, be-released-from the malady of-you." 13And he-put the/his hands-on her, and immediately she-was-straightened and she-glorified [the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And having-responded, the synagogue-ruler, being-indignant that on-the Sabbath [the] Jesus healed, was-saying to-the crowd. "Six days exist in which it-is-necessary to-work. In them therefore, coming, be-healed and not on-the day of-the Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites, does┘not each of-you└untie the ox or the donkey of-him from the stall and, leading-(it)-away, water (it)? 16This-one being (a) daughter of-Abraham, whom [the] Satan bound, behold, for-ten and eight years, was-it┘not└necessary to-release from [the] bond on-the day of-the Sabbath?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And he saying these-things, all the-ones opposing him were-being-put-to-shame, and all the crowd was-rejoicing over all the glorious-things [the] becoming by him. 18Therefore he-continued-by-saying, "To-what is the kingdom of-[the] God like and to-what will-I-liken it? 19It-is-like (a) mustard seed, which, having-taken, (a) man put (it) in the garden (of him), and it-grew and became into (a) tree, and the birds of-the sky nested in the branches of-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And again he-said, "To-what shall-I-liken the kingdom of-[the] God? 21It-is like yeast that (a) woman, having-taken, hid in three pecks of-meal until when (the) whole was-leavened."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And he-was-passing-through according-to cities and villages/all cities and villages, teaching and making (his) to Jerusalem. 23And somebody said to-him, "Lord, [whether] few are the-ones being-saved?" 24"Strive to-enter through the narrow gate, because many, I-say to-you, will-seek to-enter and they-will┘not└be-able. 25From whenever2 the lord-of-the-house rises-up and shuts the door, and you-begin to-stand outside and to-knock-on the door, saying, 'Lord, open to-us,' and, having-answered, he-will-say to-you, 'I-do┘not└know whence you are.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then you-will-begin to-say, 'We-ate before you and drank and you-taught in the streets of-us.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And he-will-say, saying to-you, 'I-do┘not└know whence [you]ms are. Depart from me, all workers of-injustice.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> There [the] crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be, when you-see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of-[the] God, but you being-cast outside. 29And they-will-come from the east and west and north and south, and they-will-recline-(at-table) in the kingdom of-[the] God. 30And behold, last-ones (are) who will-be first, and first-ones are who will-be last."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> In the very hour some Pharisees approached, saying to-him, "Leave and go thence, because Herod wants to-kill you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And he-said to-them, "Having-gone, say to-[the] this fox, 'Behold, I-cast-out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow and on-the third (day) I-will-be-finished.' 33Except, it-is-necessary for-me today and tomorrow and the next (day) to-go, because it-is┘not└imaginable for-(a)-prophet to-perish outside Jerusalem! 34Jerusalem! Jerusalem! the-one killing the prophets and stoning the-ones having-been-sent to it, how-many-times did-I-want to-gather-together the children of-you like2 (a) hen (gathers) the brood of-her under the/her wings, and you-were┘not└willing. 35Behold, the house of-you is-left. [And]ms I-say to-you, you-will┘not└see me until [then he-will-come] you-say,</span>
