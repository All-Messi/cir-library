## Luke Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And some were-present at the very time reporting to-him about the Galileans the blood of-whom Pilate mixed with the sacrifices of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>And, having-answered, he-said to-them, <em>“Do-you-suppose that [the] these Galileans were sinners from all the Galileans because they-suffered these-things?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>No, I-tell you, but if you-do┘not└repent</em><em>,</em><em> you┘all└will┘likewise└perish.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>And those [the] eighteen on whom the tower at [the] Siloam fell and killed them, do-you-suppose </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> were sinners from all the men [the] dwelling-in Jerusalem?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>No, I-tell you, but if you-do┘not└repent</em><em>,</em><em> you┘all└will┘likweise└perish.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And he-continued-by-telling this [the] parable, <em>“(A) certain-(man)</em><em> </em><em>had</em><em> (a) fig-tree planted in the vineyard of-him, and he-came looking-for fruit on it and did┘not└find (any).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>And he-said to-the vineyard-keeper, ‘Behold, for-three years from which I-come looking-for fruit on [the] this fig-tree, and I-am┘not└finding (any).</em><em> </em><em>So cut</em><em>┘it└</em><em>down; why </em><em>is-it┘even└using-up the ground?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>But the/he,</em><em> having-answered, says to-him, ‘</em><em>Lord, leave it also for-this [the] year, until when I-dig around it and put manure (around it), </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>and-if it-bears fruit unto the coming (year).</em><em> </em><em>And if not, you-will-cut┘it└down.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And he-was teaching in one of-the synagogues on the Sabbath[s]. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And behold, (a) woman having (a) spirit of-sickness for-eighteen years and she-was being-bent down and not able to-straighten-up at-all2. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And having-seen him, [the] Jesus, he-called┘(her)└to-(him), and he-said to-her, <em>“Woman, be-released-from the malady of-you.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And he-put the/his hands-on her, and immediately she-was-straightened and she-glorified [the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>And having-responded, the synagogue-ruler, being-indignant that on-the Sabbath [the] Jesus healed, was-saying to-the crowd. <em>“Six days </em><em>exist</em><em> in which it-is-necessary to-work.</em><em> </em><em>In them therefore, coming, be-healed and not on-the day of-the Sabbath.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And the Lord answered him and said, <em>“Hypocrites, does</em><em>┘not</em><em> each of-you</em><em>└</em><em>untie the ox or the donkey of-him from the stall and, leading-(it)-away, water (it)?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>This-one being (a) daughter of-Abraham, whom [the] Satan bound</em><em>,</em><em> behold</em><em>,</em><em> for-ten and eight years, was-it┘not└necessary to-release from [the] bond on-the day of-the Sabbath?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>And he saying these-things, all the-ones opposing him were-being-put-to-shame, and all the crowd was-rejoicing over all the glorious-things [the] becoming by him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Therefore he-continued-by-saying, <em>“To-what is the kingdom of-[the] God like and to-what will-I-liken it?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>It-is-like (a) mustard seed, which, having-taken, (a) man put (it) in the garden (of him), and it-grew and became into (a) tree, and the birds of-the sky nested in the branches of-it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And again he-said, <em>“To-what shall-I-liken the kingdom of-[the] God?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>It-is like yeast that (a) woman, having-taken, hid in three pecks of-meal until when (the) whole was-leavened.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And he-was-passing-through according-to cities and villages/all cities and villages, teaching and making (his) to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And somebody said to-him, <em>“Lord, </em><em>[whether] </em><em>few are the-ones being-saved?” </em> And the/he said to them, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Strive to-enter through the narrow gate, because many, I-say to-you, will-seek to-enter and they-will┘not└be-able.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>From whenever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the lord-of-the-house rises</em><em>-up and shuts the door, and you-begin to-stand outside and to-knock-on the door, saying, </em><em>‘</em><em>Lord, open to-us,</em><em>’</em><em> and, having-answered, he-will-say to-you, ‘I-do┘not└know whence you are</em><em>.</em><em>’ </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Then you-will-begin to-say, ‘We-ate before you and drank and you-taught in the streets of-us.’</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup><em>And he-will-say, saying to-you, ‘I-do┘not└know whence [you]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> are.</em><em> </em><em>Depart from me, all workers of-injustice.</em><em>’</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>There [the] crying and [the] gnashing of-[the] teeth will-be, when you-see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of-[the] God, but you being-cast outside.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>And they-will-come from the east and west and north and south</em><em>,</em><em> and they-will-reclin</em><em>e</em><em>-(at-table) in the kingdom of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>And behold, last-ones (are) who will-be first</em><em>,</em><em> and first-ones are who will-be last.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>In the very hour some Pharisees approached, saying to-him, <em>“Leave and go thence, because Herod wants to-kill you.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>And he-said to-them, <em>“Having-gone, say to-[the] this fox, ‘Behold, I-cast-out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow and on-the third (day) I-will-be-finished.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Except, it-is-necessary for-me today and tomorrow and the next (day) to-go, because it-is┘not└imaginable for-(a)-prophet to-</em><em>perish outside Jerusalem!</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>Jerusalem! Jerusalem!</em><em> the-one killing the prophets and stoning the-ones having-been-sent to it, how-many-times did-I-want to-gather-together the children of-you like</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> (a) hen (gathers) the brood of-her under the/her wings, and you-were┘not└willing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>Behold, the house of-you is-left.</em><em> </em><em>[And]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> I-say to-you, you-will┘not└see me until [then he-will-come] you-say,</em><em> </em> <strong><em>‘Blessed (is) the-One coming in (the) name of-(the)-Lord.’</em></strong><em>”</em></span>
