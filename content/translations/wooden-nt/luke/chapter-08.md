## Luke Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened on the next (day)<sup>2</sup>/soon afterward<sup>2</sup> and/that <u>he</u> was-traveling according-to (the) city<sup>2</sup>/from one city to another<sup>2</sup>, preaching and announcing-the-good-news-about the kingdom of-[the] God; and the twelve (were) with him, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and some women who were healed from evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary, the-one called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had-come-out; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and Joanna, (the) wife of-Chuza, (the) manager of-Herod; and Susanna, and many others, who were-ministering to-them out-of the-things being to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And (a) large crowd coming-together, and the-ones from every city traveling to him, he-spoke through parables.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And the disciples of-him were asking him what this [the] parable would-be. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And the/he said, <em>“To-you it-has-been-given to-know the mysteries of-the kingdom of-[the] God, but to-the rest (it comes) in parables in-order-that,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘Seeing</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> they-may┘not└see;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and hearing, they-may┘not└hear.’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the/his mother came to him and the brothers of-him, and they-were┘not└able to-get-to him on-account-of the crowd. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And it-was-reported to-him, <em>“The mother of-you and the brothers o</em><em>f-you are-standing outside want</em><em>ing to-see you.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said to them, <em>“(The) mother of-me and brothers of-me—these </em><em>are the</em><em>–ones hearing the word of-[the] God and doing (it).</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And it-happened on one of-the days and/that <u>he</u> got in (a) boat and the disciples of-him, and he-said to them, <em>“Let-us-go-through to the other-side of-the lake,”</em> and they-set-off. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And they sailing, he-went-to-sleep, and (a) storm of-wind came-down onto the lake, and they-were-taking-on water and were-in-danger.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-come, they-woke┘him└up, saying, <em>“Master</em><em>, Master, we-are-perishing!</em><em>”</em> And the/he, having-gotten-up, rebuked the wind and the waves of-[the] water, and they-ceased and (a) great calm became.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And he-said to-them, <em>“Where (is) the faith of-you?”</em><em> </em> And having-feared, they-marveled, saying to one-another, <em>“Who then is this that he-commands even the winds and the water, and they-obey him?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they-sailed to the region of-the Gerasenes, which is across-from [the] Galilee. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And (a)-certain man out-of the city met him—getting out-of the boat onto [the] land, having demons and for-(a)-long time he-did┘not└wear (a) garment, and he-was┘not└staying in (a) house, but in [the] tombs. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And having-seen [the] Jesus, having-cried-out, he-fell-before him and said in-(a)-loud voice, <em>“What to-me and to-you, Jesus, Son of-[the] God [the] Most-High?</em><em> </em><em>I-beg you, do┘not└torment me.”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>For he-commanded the unclean [the] spirit to-come-out from the man; for it-would seize him many times, and he-was-bound with chains and shackles, being-under-guard; and breaking the bonds, he-would-be-driven by the demon into [the] unpopulated-places.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And [the] Jesus asked him, <em>“What is (the) name to-you?”</em> And the/he said, <em>“Legion,”</em> because many demons entered into him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And they-started-urging him [in-order]-that he-might┘not└order them to-go-away into the abyss. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And (a) sizable herd of-pigs was there feeding on the mountain; and they-were-urging him [in-order]-that he-might-let them enter into those, and he-let them. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And the demons, having-come-out from the man, entered into the pigs, and the herd stampeded down the steep-place into the lake and were-drowned. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And having-seen the-thing happened, the herdsmen fled and reported in the city and in the countryside. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And they went-out to-see the-thing happened, and they-came to [the] Jesus and found the man from whom the demons went-out, clothed and in-his-right-mind, sitting at the feet of-[the] Jesus; and they-were-afraid. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And the-ones having-seen how the-one having-been-demon-possessed was-saved, reported. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And all the multitude of-the area of-the Gerasenes asked him to-go-away from them, because they-were-seized with-(a)-great fear. And <u>he</u>, having-gotten in (the) boat, started-to-return. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And the man from whom he-had-cast-out the demons was-begging him to-be with him; but he-dismissed him, saying, <strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>“Return to the house of-you </em><em>and recount as-many-things-as [the] God did for-you.”</em><em> </em>And he-went-away according-to the whole city preaching as-many-things-as [the] Jesus did for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And in [the] Jesus’ [the] returning, the crowd welcomed him. For all were waiting-for him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And behold, (a) man. to-whom (the) name Jairus, came, and this-one was (a) ruler of-the synagogue. And having-fallen at the feet of-[the]<sup>ms</sup> Jesus, he-was-appealing-to him to-enter into the house of-him, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>because (an) only daughter was to-him of┘about└twelve years, and she was-dying. And in [the] his going, the crowds were-pressing him. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And (a) woman being with (a) flow/hemorrhage of-blood from twelve years, who, having-spent all the/her living-on doctors, was┘not└able to-be-healed by nobody/anybody; <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>having-come from-behind, touched the fringe of-the garment of-him and immediately the flow/hemorrhage of-[the] blood stopped.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And [the] Jesus said, <em>“Who (is) the-one having-touched me?”</em> And all denying (it), [the] Peter said, <em>“Master, the crowds are-pressing you and jostling (you).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> But [the] Jesus said, <em>“Who touched me</em><em>, for I-know power gone-out from me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> And the woman, having-seen that she-did┘not└escape-notice, trembling, came and having-fallen-down-to him, on-account-of which reason she-touched him she-admitted before all the people and as she-was┘immediately└healed. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>And the/he said to-her, <em>Daughter, the faith of-you has-saved you.</em><em> </em><em>Go in peace.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> He yet speaking, somebody comes from (the house) of-the synagogue-ruler, saying [that], <em>“The daughter of-you has-died; no-longer trouble the Teacher.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> But [the] Jesus, having-heard, replied to-him, <em>“Do┘not└fear, only believe, and she-will-be-saved.”</em><em> </em></span>
