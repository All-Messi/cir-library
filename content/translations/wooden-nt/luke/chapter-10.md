## Luke Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things, the Lord appointed seventy [two]ms other (men), and sent them by twos before (the) face of-him. 2And he-was-saying to them, "The harvest (is) much, and the laborers (are) few. So pray the Foreman of-the harvest [in-order]-that he-may-put laborers into the harvest of-him. 3Go; behold, I-am-sending┘you└out like lambs in (the) midst of-wolves. 4Do┘not└carry (a) money-bag, no knapsack, no shoes, and do┘not└visit-with/salute nobody/anybody along the road. 5And into whatever2 house you-enter, say first, "Peace (be) to-[the] this house. 6And if (a) son of-peace is there, the peace of-you will-rest on him; but it not, it-will-return to-you. 7And stay in the house itself, eating and drinking the-things with them, for the/a laborer is worthy of-the pay of-him. Do┘not└go from house to house. 8And into whatever2 city you-enter and they receive you, eat the-things being-set by you, 9and heal the sick-ones in it and say to-them, 'The kingdom of-[the] God has-come-near to you.' 10And into whatever2 city you-enter and they-do┘not└receive you, having-gone-out into the streets of-it, say, 11'Even the dust [the] sticking to-us from the city of-you on the/our feet we-wipe-off-against you; except know this: that the kingdom of-[the] God has-come-near.' 12I-say to-you that it-will-be more-bearable for Sodom in [the] that day than for-[the] that city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Woe to-you, Chorazin! Woe to-you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles [the] having-occurred in you had-been-done in Tyre and Sidon, long-ago they-would-have-repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14Except, for Tyre and Sidon it-will-be more bearable in the judgment than for-you. 15And you, Capernaum,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The-one hearing you, hears me, and the-one rejecting you rejects me, and the-one rejecting me rejects the-One having-sent me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the seventy [two]ms returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are-subject to-us in the name of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And he-said to-them, "I-was-watching [the] Satan like (a) star having-fallen out-of the sky. 19Behold, I-have-given to-you authority [the] to-step on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of-the enemy, nothing will-harm you. 20Except, do┘not└rejoice that the spirits are-subject to-you, but rejoice that the names of-you have-been-written in [the] heaven[s]."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> In the very hour he-was-glad in the Holy [the] Spirit, and said, "I-thank you, Father, Lord of-[the] heaven and [the] earth, that you-hid these-things from wise and intelligent-ones and revealed them to infants. Yes, [the] Father, because thus it-was (a) pleasure before you. 22"All-things were-given to-me by the Father of-me, and nobody knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and to-whomever2 the Son desires to-reveal (him)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And having-turned to the disciples privately2, he-said, "Blessed (are) the eyes [the- ones] seeing what-things you-are-seeing; 24for I-say to-you that many prophets and kings wanted to-see what-things you are-seeing and did┘not└see (them), and to-hear what-things you-are-hearing and did┘not└hear them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And behold, (a)-certain lawyer stood-up, testing him, saying, "Teacher, what having-done, shall-I-inherit eternal life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And [the] Jesus said to him, "What is-written in the Law? How do-you-read (it)? 27And the/he, having-answered, said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And he-said to-him, "You-answered correctly; do this and you-will-live."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> But the/he, desiring to-justify himself, said to [the] Jesus, "And who is (a) neighbor of-me." "(A)-certain man was-going-down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he-fell-into-the-hands-of robbers, who also stripped him and having-beat (him) blows, left, leaving (him) half-dead. 31And by chance (a)-certain priest was-going-down on [the] that road, and, having-seen (him), he-went-around (him). 32And Likewise also (a) Levite [having-come]ms along the place, having-come and having-seen, went-around (him). 33And (a)-certain Samaritan, being-on-(a)-business trip, came upon him and having-seen (him), felt-compassion (for him); 34and coming-to (him) bandaged-up the wounds of-him, pouring┘olive-oil and wine└on (them); and having-put him on [the] his-own animal, brought him to (an) inn and took-care of-him. 35And on the next-day, having-taken out two denarii, he-gave (them) to-the innkeeper and said, "Take-care of-him, and whatever2 you-spend-more, I in [the] my returning will-repay you.' 36Who of-these [the] three seems to-you to-have-become (a) neighbor of-the-one having-fallen among the thieves?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the/he said, "The-one having-done [the] mercy with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And in [the] their traveling, he entered into (a)-certain village, and (a)-certain woman, Martha by-name, welcomed him. 39And to-the/her was (a) sister called Mary, who also, having-sat-down at the feet of-the Lord, was-listening-to the word of-him. 40And [the] Martha was-worrying about much service; and having-come, she-said, "Lord, is-it┘not└a-concern to-you that the sister of-me left┘me└behind to-serve alone? So tell her [in-order]-that she-might-help me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And having-answered, the Lord said to-her, "Martha, Martha, you-are-worried and bothered about many-things. 42But necessity is of-one-thing, for Mary chose the good part, which will┘not└be-taken-away-from her."</span>
