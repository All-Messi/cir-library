<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>After these-things, the Lord appointed seventy [two]<sup>ms</sup> other (men), and sent them by twos before (the) face of-him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And he-was-saying to them, <em>“The harvest (is) much, and the laborers (are) few.</em><em> </em><em>So pray the Foreman of-the harvest </em><em>[</em><em>in-order</em><em>]</em><em>-that he-may-put laborers into the harvest of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Go; behold, I-am-sending┘you└out like lambs in (the) midst of-wolves.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Do┘not└carry (a) money-bag, no knapsack, no shoes, and do┘not└</em><em>visit-with/salute </em><em>nobody/anybody along the road.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And into whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> house you-enter, say first, “Peace (be) to-[the] this house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> if (a) </em><em>son of-peace is there, the peac</em><em>e of-you will-rest on him; but it not, it-will-return to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>And stay in the house itself, eating and drinking the-things with them, for the/a laborer is worthy of-the pay of-him.</em><em> </em><em>Do┘not└go from house to house.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>And into whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> city you-enter and they receive you, eat the-things being-set by you, </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>and heal the sick-ones in it and say to-them, ‘The kingdom of-[the] God has-come-near to you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And into whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> city you</em><em>-enter and they-do┘not└receive you, having-gone-out into the streets of-it,</em><em> say, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>‘</em><em>Even the dust [the] sticking to-us from the city of-you on the/our feet we-wipe-off-against you; except</em><em> know this:</em><em> </em><em>that the kingdom of</em><em>-[the] God has-come-near.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I-say to-you that it-will-be more-bearable for Sodom in [the] that day than for-[the] that city.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><em>Woe to-you, Chorazin!</em><em> </em><em>Woe to-you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles [</em><em>the] having-occurred in you had-been</em><em>-done in Tyre and Sidon, long-ago they-would-have-repented</em><em>,</em><em> sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>Except, for Tyre and Sidon it-will-be more bearable in the judgment than for-you.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>15</sup></em></strong><em>And you, Capernaum,</em> <em>	</em><em>	You-will┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└be exalted to heaven, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>will-you?</em> <em>	</em><em>	You-will-descent to [the] Hades</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup><em>The-one hearing you, hears me, and the-one rejecting yo</em><em>u rejects me, and the-one rejec</em><em>ting me rejects the-One having-sent me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the seventy [two]<sup>ms</sup> returned with joy, saying, <em>“</em><em>Lord, even the demons are-subject to-us in the name of-you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And he-said to-them, <em>“I-was-watching [the] Satan like (a) star having-fallen out-of the sky.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Behold, I-hav</em><em>e</em><em>-given to-you authority</em><em> [the] to-step on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of-the enemy, nothing will-harm you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>Except</em><em>,</em><em> do┘not└rejoice that the spirits are-subject to-you, but rejoice that the names of-you have-been-written in [the] heaven[s].</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>In the very hour he-was-glad in the Holy [the] Spirit, and said, <em>“I-thank you, Father, Lord of-[the] heaven and [the] earth, that you-hid these-things from wise and intelligent-ones and revealed them to infants.</em><em> </em><em>Yes, [the] Father, because thus it-was (a) pleasure before you.</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“All-things were-given to-me by the Father of-me, and nobody knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and to-whomever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the Son desires to-reveal (him).”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And having-turned to the disciples privately<sup>2</sup>, he-said, <em>“Blessed (are) the eyes [the- ones] se</em><em>eing what-things you-are-seeing; </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>f</em><em>or I-say to-you that many prophets and kings wanted to-see what-things </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> are-seeing and did┘not└see (them), and to-hear what-things you-are</em><em>-hearing and did┘not└hear them.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to him, <em>“What is-written in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw?</em><em> </em><em>How do-you-read (it)?</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And the/he, having-answered, said, <strong><em>“You-shall-love (the) Lord the God of-you </em></strong> <strong><em>with the whole heart of-you and </em></strong> <strong><em>with the whole soul of-you and</em></strong> <strong><em>with the whole strength of-you’ </em></strong><em>and</em> with the whole mind of-you,” and, <strong><em>“the neighbor of-you as yourself.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And he-said to-him, <em>“You-answered correctly; do this and you-will-live.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>But the/he, desiring to-justify himself, said to [the] Jesus, <em>“And who is (a) neighbor of-me.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>[The] Jesus, having-answered, said, <em>“(A)-certain man was-going-down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he-fell-into-the-hands-of robbers, who also stripped him and having-beat (him) blow</em><em>s</em><em>, left, leaving (him</em><em>)</em><em> half-dead.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>And by chance (a)-certain priest was-going-down on [the] that road, and, having-seen (him), </em><em>he-went-around (him).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>And Likewise also (a) Levite [having-come]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> along the place, having-come and having-seen</em><em>,</em><em> went-around (him).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>An</em><em>d</em><em> (a)-certain Samaritan, being-on-(a)-business trip, came upon him and having-seen (him), </em><em>felt-compassion (for him);</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> coming-to (him) bandaged-up the wounds of-him, pouri</em><em>ng┘olive-oil and wine└on (them);</em><em> and having-put him on [the] his-own animal, brought him to (an) inn and took-care of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>And on the next-day, having-taken out two denarii, he-gave (them) to-the innkeeper and said, “Take-care of-him, and whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-spend-more, </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> in [the] my returning will-repay you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Who of-these [the] three seems to-you to-have-become (a) neighbor of-the-one having-fallen among the thieves?”</em><em> </em></span>
