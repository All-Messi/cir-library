## Luke Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And it-happened in the crowd[s] pressing-on him and hearing the word of-[the] God and/that he-was standing beside [the] Lake Gennesaret, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and he-saw two boats moored at-the-edge the lake. And the fishermen, having-gotten-out from them, were-mending [the] nets. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-gotten into one of-the boats, which was of-Simon, he-asked him to-put out from the shore (a)-little; and having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach the crowds out-of the boat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And when he-stopped speaking, he-said to [the] Peter, <em>“Put-out into the deep</em><em>-(w</em><em>a</em><em>ter)</em><em>,</em><em> and let-down the nets of-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> for (a) catch.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And having-answered, Peter said, <em>“Ma</em><em>s</em><em>ter, through all night, having-worked, we-took nothing.</em><em> </em><em>But at the word of-you, I-will-let-down the nets.”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And having-done this, they-caught (a) great multitude of-fish, and the nets of-them were-starting-to-tear. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And they-signaled to-the/their partners in the other boat [the], having-come, to-help them; and they-came and filled both [the] boats so that they were-riding-low-in-the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>And having-seen, Simon Peter fell to-the knees of-Jesus, saying, <em>“Go-away from me, because I-am (a) sinful man, Lord.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For amazement gripped him, and all the-ones with him at the catch of-[the] fish that they-caught; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and likewise also James and John, sons of-Zebedee, who were partners to-[the] Simon. And [the] Jesus said to [the] Simon, <em>“Do┘not└be-afraid</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>From the now you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em>-will-be catching men.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And having-brought the boats to [the] land, having-left all-things, they-followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his being in one of-the towns, and/that, behold, (a) man full of-leprosy (was there). And having-seen [the] Jesus, having-fallen on (his) face, he-begged him, saying, <em>“Sir, if you-are willing, you-are-able to-cleanse me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And having-reached-out the/his hand, he-touched him, saying, <em>“I-am-willing; be-cleansed,” </em>and immediately the leprosy went-away from him. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And <u>he</u> charged him to-tell nobody; but, <em>“</em><em>H</em><em>aving-gone-away, show yourself to-the priest, and offer for the cleansing of-you even-as Moses commanded for (a) testimony to-them.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But instead, the word about him kept-spreading, and many crowds were-coming-together to-hear and to-be-healed from the sicknesses of-them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But <u>he</u> was going-away in the uninhabited-places and praying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And it-happened on one of-the days and/that <u>he</u> was teaching, and sitting were Pharisees and teachers-of-the-Law, who were come out-of every village of-[the] Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and (the) power of-(the)-Lord as unto [the] his healing.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And behold, men, carrying (a) man on (a) stretcher who was paralyzed, and they-were-trying to-bring┘him└in and to-put [him]<sup>ms</sup> before him. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And not finding what (ways) they-might-bring┘him└in on-account-of the crowd, having-gone-up on the roof, they-let┘him└down through the tiles with the stretcher into the midst in-front-of [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And having-seen the faith of-them, he-said, <em>“Man, the sins of-you are-forgiven to-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to-argue, saying, <em>“Who is this that speaks blasphemies?</em><em> </em><em>Who is able to-forgive sins except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> [the] God only?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-known the reasonings of-them, having-answered, said to them, <em>“Why are you reasoning in the hearts of-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Which is easier, to-say, ‘The </em><em>sins of-you are-forgiven to-you</em><em>’</em><em>;</em><em> or to-say, ‘Get-up and walk’?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>But in-order-that you-may-kno</em><em>w</em><em> that the Son of-</em><em>M</em><em>an has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins”</em>—he-said to-the paralyzed-(man), <em>“I-say to-you, get-up, and having-picked-up the stretcher of-you, go to the house of-you.”</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And immediately, having-stood-up in-front-of them, having-picked-up on what he-was-lying, he-went-away into the house of-him, glorifying [the] God. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And astonishment gripped all, and they-were-glorifying [the] God; and they-were-filled with-fear, saying [that], <em>“We-saw incredible-things today.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And after these-things, he-went-out and he-saw (a) tax-collector, Levi by-name, sitting at the tax-booth; and he-said to-him, <em>“Follow me.”</em> And having-left-behind all-things, having-stood-up, he-began-to-follow him. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And Levi made (a) big reception in the house of-him, and (a) large crowd of-[the] tax-collectors and others who were with him sitting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>And the Pharisees and the scribes of-them were-grumbling to the disciples of-him, saying, <em>“On-account-of what are-you-eating and drinking with [the] tax-collectors and sinners?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to them, <em>“The-ones being-healthy do┘not└have need of-(a)-doctor, but the-ones having diseases.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>I-have┘not└come to-call righteous-(people) but sinners to repentance.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the/they said to him, <em>“The disciples of-John fast often and offer-prayers, and likewise do the (disciples) of-the Pharisees, but the (disciples</em><em>)</em><em> to-you eat and drink.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to them, <em>“You-are┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└able, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>are-you, to-make the sons of-the groom fast </em><em>in-which/while </em><em>the groom is with them?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>But days will-come, also when the groom will-be-taken-away from them;</em><em> </em><em>then they-will-fast in those </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> days.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>And he-started-telling to them (a) parable [that]:<em> </em> <em>“</em><em>Nobody, having-torn (a) patch from (a) new garment, puts (it) on (an) old garment.</em><em> </em><em>And except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> (</em><em>he does), it</em><em>-will-tear also the new, and the patch [the] from the new will┘not└fit with-the old.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>And nobody puts new wine into old winesk</em><em>ins.</em><em> </em><em>And except (he d</em><em>oes), the new [the] wine will-burst the wineskins and it will-be-poured-out and the wineskins will-be-destroyed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>But new wine must-be-put into new wineskins.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup><em>And nobody, having-d</em><em>runk (the) old, wants (the) new;</em><em> for he-says, </em><em>‘</em><em>The old is better.</em><em>’”</em></span>
