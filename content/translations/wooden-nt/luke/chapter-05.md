## Luke Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in the crowd[s] pressing-on him and hearing the word of-[the] God and/that he-was standing beside [the] Lake Gennesaret, 2and he-saw two boats moored at-the-edge the lake. And the fishermen, having-gotten-out from them, were-mending [the] nets. 3And having-gotten into one of-the boats, which was of-Simon, he-asked him to-put out from the shore (a)-little; and having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach the crowds out-of the boat.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And when he-stopped speaking, he-said to [the] Peter, "Put-out into the deep-(water), and let-down the nets of-youpl for (a) catch."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And having-answered, Peter said, "Master, through all night, having-worked, we-took nothing. But at the word of-you, I-will-let-down the nets." 6And having-done this, they-caught (a) great multitude of-fish, and the nets of-them were-starting-to-tear. 7And they-signaled to-the/their partners in the other boat [the], having-come, to-help them; and they-came and filled both [the] boats so that they were-riding-low-in-the water.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-seen, Simon Peter fell to-the knees of-Jesus, saying, "Go-away from me, because I-am (a) sinful man, Lord." 9For amazement gripped him, and all the-ones with him at the catch of-[the] fish that they-caught; 10and likewise also James and John, sons of-Zebedee, who were partners to-[the] Simon. And [the] Jesus said to [the] Simon, "Do┘not└be-afraidsg. From the now yousg-will-be catching men." 11And having-brought the boats to [the] land, having-left all-things, they-followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And it-happened in [the] his being in one of-the towns, and/that, behold, (a) man full of-leprosy (was there). And having-seen [the] Jesus, having-fallen on (his) face, he-begged him, saying, "Sir, if you-are willing, you-are-able to-cleanse me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-reached-out the/his hand, he-touched him, saying, "I-am-willing; be-cleansed," and immediately the leprosy went-away from him. 14And he charged him to-tell nobody; but, "Having-gone-away, show yourself to-the priest, and offer for the cleansing of-you even-as Moses commanded for (a) testimony to-them." 15But instead, the word about him kept-spreading, and many crowds were-coming-together to-hear and to-be-healed from the sicknesses of-them. 16But he was going-away in the uninhabited-places and praying.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And it-happened on one of-the days and/that he was teaching, and sitting were Pharisees and teachers-of-the-Law, who were come out-of every village of-[the] Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and (the) power of-(the)-Lord as unto [the] his healing.  18And behold, men, carrying (a) man on (a) stretcher who was paralyzed, and they-were-trying to-bring┘him└in and to-put [him]ms before him. 19And not finding what (ways) they-might-bring┘him└in on-account-of the crowd, having-gone-up on the roof, they-let┘him└down through the tiles with the stretcher into the midst in-front-of [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-seen the faith of-them, he-said, "Man, the sins of-you are-forgiven to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to-argue, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who is able to-forgive sins except2 [the] God only?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-known the reasonings of-them, having-answered, said to them, "Why are you reasoning in the hearts of-you? 23Which is easier, to-say, 'The sins of-you are-forgiven to-you'; or to-say, 'Get-up and walk'? 24But in-order-that you-may-know that the Son of-Man has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins"—he-said to-the paralyzed-(man), "I-say to-you, get-up, and having-picked-up the stretcher of-you, go to the house of-you." 25And immediately, having-stood-up in-front-of them, having-picked-up on what he-was-lying, he-went-away into the house of-him, glorifying [the] God. 26And astonishment gripped all, and they-were-glorifying [the] God; and they-were-filled with-fear, saying [that], "We-saw incredible-things today."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And after these-things, he-went-out and he-saw (a) tax-collector, Levi by-name, sitting at the tax-booth; and he-said to-him, "Follow me." And having-left-behind all-things, having-stood-up, he-began-to-follow him. 29And Levi made (a) big reception in the house of-him, and (a) large crowd of-[the] tax-collectors and others who were with him sitting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes of-them were-grumbling to the disciples of-him, saying, "On-account-of what are-you-eating and drinking with [the] tax-collectors and sinners?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus said to them, "The-ones being-healthy do┘not└have need of-(a)-doctor, but the-ones having diseases. 32I-have┘not└come to-call righteous-(people) but sinners to repentance."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the/they said to him, "The disciples of-John fast often and offer-prayers, and likewise do the (disciples) of-the Pharisees, but the (disciples) to-you eat and drink."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And [the] Jesus said to them, "You-are┘not┘┘└able, └└are-you, to-make the sons of-the groom fast in-which/while the groom is with them? 35But days will-come, also when the groom will-be-taken-away from them; then they-will-fast in those [the] days."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And he-started-telling to them (a) parable [that]: "Nobody, having-torn (a) patch from (a) new garment, puts (it) on (an) old garment. And except2 (he does), it-will-tear also the new, and the patch [the] from the new will┘not└fit with-the old. 37And nobody puts new wine into old wineskins. And except (he does), the new [the] wine will-burst the wineskins and it will-be-poured-out and the wineskins will-be-destroyed. 38But new wine must-be-put into new wineskins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And nobody, having-drunk (the) old, wants (the) new; for he-says, 'The old is better.'"</span>
