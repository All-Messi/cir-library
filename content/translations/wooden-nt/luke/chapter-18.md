## Luke Chapter **18**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And he-spoke (a) parable to-them to [the] their needing always to-pray and not get-discouraged, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>saying, <em>“(A)-certain judge was in (a</em><em>)-certain town not fearing [the] God and not respecting man.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And (a) widow was in [the] this city, and s</em><em>he-kept-coming to him, saying, ‘</em><em>Prot</em><em>ect me from the opponent of-me.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>And he-was┘not└willing for (a) time, but after th</em><em>ese-things he-said to-himself, ‘</em><em>Although</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-do┘</em><em>not</em><em>└fear God nor respect man, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>on-account-of [the] this widow’s continually-offering me trouble, I-will-give┘her└protection in-order-that she┘not└wear┘me└out, coming continually</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>.’”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And the Lord said, <em>“Listen-to what the judge of-[the] justice is-saying.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>But will┘[the] God certainly not└provide justice of/for-the elect [the-ones] crying-out to-him day and night, and he-is-patient over them?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I-tell you that he-will-provide [the] justice of/for-them in quickness/quickly</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Except will th</em><em>e Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an, having-come, then, find [the] faith on the earth?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And he┘also└told [the] this parable to certain-ones [the] trusting in themselves that they are/were righteous and looking-down-on the rest/[the] others: <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Two men went-up to the temple to-pray, the one (a) Pharisee and the other (a) tax-collector.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>The Pharisee, having-stood, was-praying these-things with himself, ‘[The] God, I-thank you that I-am not like the rest of-[the] men, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even</em><em> </em><em>like this [the] tax-collector.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>I-fast twice during-the/a week; I-tithe all-things as-many-as I-get.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But the tax-collector, standing afar-off, was┘not└wanting even to-lift-up the/his eyes to [the] heaven, but kept-beating the chest of-him, saying, ‘[The] God, be-merciful to-me the/a sinner.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I-tell you, this-one went-down to the house of-him justified </em><em>from</em><em>/rather-than</em><em> that-one; because everyone [the] exalting himself will-be-humbled, and the-one humbling himself will-be-exalted.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And they-were┘also└bring┘the/their babies└to him in-order-that he-might-touch them. But the disciples, having-seen, started-rebuking them<sup>neut</sup>. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But [the] Jesus called┘them<sup>neut</sup>└to-(him), saying, <em>“Let the little-children [to-]come to me and do┘not└prevent them, for of-[the] such is the kingdom of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Truly I-tell you, whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> does┘not└welcome the kingdom of-[the] God like a little-child, will┘certainly└enter into it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And (a)-certain ruler asked him, saying, <em>“Good Teacher,</em><em> what, having-done, shall-I-inherit eternal life?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Why are-you-calling me good?</em><em> </em><em>Nobody is good except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> [the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>You-know the commandm</em><em>ents: ‘D</em><em>o┘not└commit-adultery, do┘not└murder, do┘not└steal, do┘not└lie, honor the father and the mother of-you.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And the/he said, <em>“</em><em>I-kept all these-things from (my) youth.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>But [the] Jesus, having-heard, said to-him, <em>“One-thing still remains to-you:</em><em> </em><em>sell all-things as-many-as you-have and give to-(the)-poor, and you-will-have treasure in [the] heaven[s], and come follow me.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>But the/he, having-heard these-things, became discouraged, for he-was very rich.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus having-seen him becoming sad, said, <em>“How with-difficulty the-ones having [the] possessions enter into the kingdom of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>For it-is easier for-(a)-camel to-go through (the) eye of-(a)-needle than for-(a)-rich-(man) to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And the-ones having-heard said, <em>“And who is-able to-be-saved?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>And the/he said, <em>“The-things impossible with him is/are possible with [the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And [the] Peter said, <em>“Behold, we, having-left [the] our-own-things, followed you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And the/he said to-them, <em>“Truly I-say to-you</em><em> that nobody is who left home or</em><em> wife or brothers or parents or children for-the-sake of-the kingdom of-[the] God, </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>who will not </em><em>not receive many-times-more in [the] this time and in the coming [the] age eternal life.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And having-taken┘the twelve└aside, he-said to them, <em>“Behold, we-are-going-up to Jerusalem, and all the-things will-be-accomplished writt</em><em>en through the prophets to-the S</em><em>on of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>For he-will-be-betrayed to-the Gentiles and will-be-ridiculed and will-be-spit-on.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>33</sup></em></strong><em>And they┘, having-scourged (him), └will-put┘him└to-death</em><em>;</em><em> and he-will-be-raised on-the third [the] day.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>And they understood nothing of-these-things, and [the] this matter (was) hidden from them, and they-were┘not└comprehending the-things spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his drawing-near to Jericho, (a)-certain blind-(man) was-sitting beside the road begging. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And having-heard (a) crowd passing-through, he-was-asking what this would-be. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And they-reported to-him that Jesus the Nazarene is/was-passing by. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And he-cried-out, saying, <em>“Jesus, Son of-David, have-mercy-on me.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>And the-ones going-in-front started-rebuking him in-order-that he-be-quiet, but he-began-to-cry-out more by-much, <em>“Son</em><em> of-David, have-mercy-on me!</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-stood-still, commanded him to-be-brought to him. And having-approached him, he-asked him, <strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> </em><em>do-you-want I-will-do for-you?”</em> And the/he said, <em>“Sir, [in-order]-that I-may-receive-sight.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Receive-sight.</em><em> </em><em>The faith of-you has-saved you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>And immediately he-received-sight, and he-started-following him, glorifying [the] God. And all the people, having-seen, gave praise to-[the] God.</span>
