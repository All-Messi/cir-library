<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the Lord said, "Listen-to what the judge of-[the] justice is-saying. 7But will┘[the] God certainly not└provide justice of/for-the elect [the-ones] crying-out to-him day and night, and he-is-patient over them? 8I-tell you that he-will-provide [the] justice of/for-them in quickness/quickly2. Except will the Son of-[the] Man, having-come, then, find [the] faith on the earth?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he┘also└told [the] this parable to certain-ones [the] trusting in themselves that they are/were righteous and looking-down-on the rest/[the] others: 10"Two men went-up to the temple to-pray, the one (a) Pharisee and the other (a) tax-collector. 11The Pharisee, having-stood, was-praying these-things with himself, '[The] God, I-thank you that I-am not like the rest of-[the] men, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this [the] tax-collector. 12I-fast twice during-the/a week; I-tithe all-things as-many-as I-get.' 13But the tax-collector, standing afar-off, was┘not└wanting even to-lift-up the/his eyes to [the] heaven, but kept-beating the chest of-him, saying, '[The] God, be-merciful to-me the/a sinner.' 14I-tell you, this-one went-down to the house of-him justified from/rather-than that-one; because everyone [the] exalting himself will-be-humbled, and the-one humbling himself will-be-exalted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And they-were┘also└bring┘the/their babies└to him in-order-that he-might-touch them. But the disciples, having-seen, started-rebuking themneut. 16But [the] Jesus called┘themneut└to-(him), saying, "Let the little-children [to-]come to me and do┘not└prevent them, for of-[the] such is the kingdom of-[the] God. 17Truly I-tell you, whoever2 does┘not└welcome the kingdom of-[the] God like a little-child, will┘certainly└enter into it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And (a)-certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what, having-done, shall-I-inherit eternal life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-him, "Why are-you-calling me good? Nobody is good except2 [the] God. 20You-know the commandments: 'Do┘not└commit-adultery, do┘not└murder, do┘not└steal, do┘not└lie, honor the father and the mother of-you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the/he said, "I-kept all these-things from (my) youth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But [the] Jesus, having-heard, said to-him, "One-thing still remains to-you: sell all-things as-many-as you-have and give to-(the)-poor, and you-will-have treasure in [the] heaven[s], and come follow me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But the/he, having-heard these-things, became discouraged, for he-was very rich.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And [the] Jesus having-seen him becoming sad, said, "How with-difficulty the-ones having [the] possessions enter into the kingdom of-[the] God. 25For it-is easier for-(a)-camel to-go through (the) eye of-(a)-needle than for-(a)-rich-(man) to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the-ones having-heard said, "And who is-able to-be-saved?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And the/he said, "The-things impossible with him is/are possible with [the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And having-taken┘the twelve└aside, he-said to them, "Behold, we-are-going-up to Jerusalem, and all the-things will-be-accomplished written through the prophets to-the Son of-[the] Man. 32For he-will-be-betrayed to-the Gentiles and will-be-ridiculed and will-be-spit-on. 33And they┘, having-scourged (him), └will-put┘him└to-death; and he-will-be-raised on-the third [the] day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And they understood nothing of-these-things, and [the] this matter (was) hidden from them, and they-were┘not└comprehending the-things spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And it-happened in [the] his drawing-near to Jericho, (a)-certain blind-(man) was-sitting beside the road begging. 36And having-heard (a) crowd passing-through, he-was-asking what this would-be. 37And they-reported to-him that Jesus the Nazarene is/was-passing by. 38And he-cried-out, saying, "Jesus, Son of-David, have-mercy-on me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And the-ones going-in-front started-rebuking him in-order-that he-be-quiet, but he-began-to-cry-out more by-much, "Son of-David, have-mercy-on me!</span>
