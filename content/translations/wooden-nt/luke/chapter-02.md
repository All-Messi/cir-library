<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] those days, (that) (a) decree went-out from Caesar Augustus to-take-a-census-of all the world. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>This (was) the first census, Quirinius governing [the] Syria. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And all were-traveling to-be-registered-in-the-census, each to [the] city of-himself. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And Joseph also went-up from [the] Galilee from (the) town of-Nazareth into [the] Judaea into (the) city of-David, which is-called Bethlehem, on-account-of [the] his being from (the) house and lineage of-David, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>to-be-registered with Mary the-one betrothed to-him, being-pregnant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] their being there, (that) the days of-[the] her giving-birth were-fulfilled, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and she-bore the firstborn [the] son of-her; and she-wrapped┘him└in-baby-clothes and laid him in (a) manger, because (a) place was not for-them in the inn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And in the same [the] region shepherds were living-outdoors and keeping watch[es] over their flock during-the night. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And (an) angel of-(the)-Lord stood-by them, and (the) glory of-(the)-Lord shined-around them, and they-feared (a) great fear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And the angel said to-them, <em>“Do┘not└be-afraid, for behold, I-am-bringing you great joy that will-be to-all the people, </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>because today (a) Savior was-born to-you that is the Lord Messiah in (the) city of-David.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And this is the sign for-you:</em><em> </em><em>you-will-find (a) baby wrapped</em><em>–in-</em><em>baby-clothes</em><em> and lying in (a) manger.</em><em>”</em></span>
