<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in [the] his coming into (the) house of-(a)-certain-one of-the rulers of-the Pharisees on-(a)-Sabbath to-eat bread, and/that <u>they</u> were watching┘him└closely. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And behold, (a)-certain man before him was endemic.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And having-responded, [the] Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <em>“Is-it-lawful on-the Sabbath to-heal or not?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the/they were-silent. And having-taken-hold-of (him), he-touched him and sent┘him└away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-said to them, <em>“(A) son or ox of-which of-you will-fall into (a) well, and immediately </em><em>he-</em><em>will-┘not└pull┘him└out on (the) day of-the Sabbath?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And they-were┘not└able to-answer-back to these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-began-to-tell (a) parable to the-ones seated-at-table, noticing how they-were-selecting the prominent-seats, saying to them, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>‘When you-are-invited by somebody to (a) marriage-feast, do┘not└recline in the prominent-place, lest one-more-honorable than-you has-been invited by him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And having-come</em><em>,</em><em> the-one having-invited you and him will-say to-you, ‘Give place to-this-one,’ and then you-will-begin with embarrassment to-go-down-to</em><em>-occupy the last place.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>But when you-are-invited, having-gone, recline in the last place in-order-that when the-one having-invited you </em><em>(comes) he-</em><em>will-say to-you, ‘Friend, go-up higher.’</em><em> </em><em>Then glory will-be to-you before all the-ones reclining-at-table-with you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Because everybody </em><em>[</em><em>the-one</em><em>]</em><em> exalting himself will-be-humbled</em><em>,</em><em> and the-one humbling himself will-be-exalted.”</em><em> </em></span>

Then glory will-be to-you before all the-ones reclining-at-table-with you. 11Because everybody [the-one] exalting himself will-be-humbled, and the-one humbling himself will-be-exalted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And he-was-saying also to-the-one having-invited him, <em>“When you make (a) luncheon or dinner, do┘not└call the friends of-you nor the brothers of-you nor the relatives of-you nor rich neighbors, lest </em><em><u>they</u></em><em> also invite</em><em>┘you└in-return and pay-back will-be to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But when you-make (a) ban</em><em>quet, call</em><em> poor (people)</em><em>,</em><em> disabled, lame, blind; </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and you-will-be blessed, </em><em>because they-do┘not└have to-pay┘you└back, for it-will-be-paid-back to-you in the resurrection of-the just.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And somebody of-the-one reclining-at-table-with-(him), having-heard said to-him,<em> “Blessed (is) whoever will-eat bread in the kingdom of-[the] God.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>
