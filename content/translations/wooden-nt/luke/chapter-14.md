## Luke Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened in [the] his coming into (the) house of-(a)-certain-one of-the rulers of-the Pharisees on-(a)-Sabbath to-eat bread, and/that they were watching┘him└closely. 2And behold, (a)-certain man before him was endemic.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And having-responded, [the] Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is-it-lawful on-the Sabbath to-heal or not?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the/they were-silent. And having-taken-hold-of (him), he-touched him and sent┘him└away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-said to them, "(A) son or ox of-which of-you will-fall into (a) well, and immediately he-will-┘not└pull┘him└out on (the) day of-the Sabbath?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And they-were┘not└able to-answer-back to these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-began-to-tell (a) parable to the-ones seated-at-table, noticing how they-were-selecting the prominent-seats, saying to them, 8'When you-are-invited by somebody to (a) marriage-feast, do┘not└recline in the prominent-place, lest one-more-honorable than-you has-been invited by him. 9And having-come, the-one having-invited you and him will-say to-you, 'Give place to-this-one,' and then you-will-begin with embarrassment to-go-down-to-occupy the last place. 10But when you-are-invited, having-gone, recline in the last place in-order-that when the-one having-invited you (comes) he-will-say to-you, 'Friend, go-up higher.' Then glory will-be to-you before all the-ones reclining-at-table-with you. 11Because everybody [the-one] exalting himself will-be-humbled, and the-one humbling himself will-be-exalted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And he-was-saying also to-the-one having-invited him, "When you make (a) luncheon or dinner, do┘not└call the friends of-you nor the brothers of-you nor the relatives of-you nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite┘you└in-return and pay-back will-be to-you. 13But when you-make (a) banquet, call poor (people), disabled, lame, blind; 14and you-will-be blessed, because they-do┘not└have to-pay┘you└back, for it-will-be-paid-back to-you in the resurrection of-the just."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And somebody of-the-one reclining-at-table-with-(him), having-heard said to-him, "Blessed (is) whoever will-eat bread in the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the/he said to-him, "(A)-certain man was-making (a) great feast, and he-invited many. 17And he-sent the servant of-him at-the hour of-the banquet to-say to-the-ones invited, 'Come, because (the) prepared-things are ready.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And they┘all from one└began to-make excuse. The first said to-him, 'I-bought (a) field and I-have necessity, having-gone, to-see it. I-ask you, have me excused.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And another said, 'I-bought five yokes of-oxen, and I-am-going to-try┘them└out. I-ask you, have me excused.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And another said, 'I-married (a) wife, and on-account-of this I-am┘└notable to-come.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And the servant, being-present, reported these-things to-the lord of-him. Then the master-of-the-house, having-become-angry, said to-the servant of-him, 'Go-out quickly into the streets and alleys of-the city, and bring-in here the poor and disabled and blind and lame.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And the servant said, 'Lord, what-you-commanded has-happened and yet room is.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And the lord said to the servant, 'Go-out into the roads and pathways and pressure (them) to-come, in-order-that the house of-me may-be-filled. 24For I-say to-you that nobody of-[the] those men [the] called will-taste the feast of-me.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And many crowd were-traveling with, and, having-turned, he-said to them, 26"If anybody comes to-me and does┘not└hate the father and the mother of-him and the wife and the children and the brothers and the sisters and yet even [the] his-own life, he-is┘not└able to-be (a) disciple of-me. 27Whoever does┘not└bear the cross of-himself and come after me, is┘not└able to-be (a) disciple of-me. 28For who of-you, desiring to-build (a) tower, does┘not first, having-sat-down, calculate the cost, whether he-has for completion? 29In-order-that lest, having-laid (a) foundation of-it and not being-able to-finish, all the-ones watching begin to-mock him, 30saying [that], 'This [the] man began to-build and was┘not└able to-finish.' 31Or, what king, going to-meet another king for war will┘not, having-sat-down first└take-counsel whether he-is able with ten thousand to-meet the-one coming at him with twenty thousand? 32And if not, he being-yet afar, having-sent (a) delegation, he-asks the-things for peace. 33Thus then everybody of you who does┘not└give-up all the possessions of-him, is┘not└able to-be (a) disciple of-me. 34"So [the] salt is good, but if even [the] salt becomes-tasteless, by what will-it-be-made-salty? 35Neither for [the] ground nor for [the] manure-pile is-it useful; they-throw it outside. The-one having ears, let-him-hear."</span>
