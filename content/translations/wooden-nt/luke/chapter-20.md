## Luke Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened on one of-the days, he teaching the people in the temple and preaching (that) the chief-priests and the scribes with the elders confronted (him), 2and they-said, saying to him, "Tell us, by what authority you-are-doing these-things, or who is the-one having-given you [the] this authority?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And having-answered, he-said to them, "I-also will-ask you (a) matter, and tell me: 4Was the baptism of-John from heaven or from men?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And the/they reasoned with one-another, saying [that], "If we-say, 'From heaven,' he-will-say, 'On-account-of what did-you┘not└believe him?' 6But if we-say, 'From men,' all the multitude will-stone us," for it/they-were persuaded John to-be (a) prophet. 7And they-answered not to-know whence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "Neither will┘I└tell you by what authority I-am-doing these-things."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he-began to-say [the] this parable to-the crowd: "(A)-certain man planted (a) vineyard and he-rented it to-tenants, and went-away-on-a-journey for-(a)-long time[s]. 10And at-the time-(of harvest), he-sent to the tenants (a) servant in-order-that they-might-give him from the fruit of-the vineyard. But the tenants, having-beat-(him)-up, sent┘him└away empty. 11And he-proceeded to-sent another servant, but the-ones having-beat┘that-one┘┘└up └└also and having-treated (him) shamefully, sent┘him└away empty. 12And he-proceeded to-sent (a) third, and this-one also the/they, having-wounded, cast-out. 13and the lord of-the vineyard said, 'What shall-I-do? I-will-sent the beloved [the] son of-me. Perhaps they-will-respect this-one.' 14And having-seen him, the tenants reasoned to one-another, saying, 'This is the heir. Let-us-kill him, in-order-that the inheritance may-be of-us.' 15And having-thrown him outside the vineyard, they-killed (him). What then will┘the lord of-the vineyard└do to-them? 16He-will-come and destroy [the] these tenants, and he-will-give the vineyard to-others."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And the/he, having-heard, said to-them, "What then is [the] this-thing written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Every one having-fallen on that [the] stone will-be-bruised, and on whom it┘should└fall, it-will-crush him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the scribes and the chief-priests sought to-put the/their hands on him in the very hour, and they-feared the people, for they-knew that he-spoke [the] this parable to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-watched┘(him)└closely, they-sent spies pretending themselves to-be righteous, in-order-that they-might-take-hold of-(the)-word of-him, so-as to-deliver him to-the rule and the authority of-the governor. 21And they-asked him, saying, "Teacher, we-know that you-speak and teach forthrightly, and do┘not└receive face, but you-teach in truth/truthfully the way of-[the] God. 22Is-it-lawful for-us to-pay tribute to-Caesar or not?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Having-detected the trickery of-them, he-said to them, 24"Show me (a) denarius. Whose image and inscription does-it-have?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the/he said to them, "So pay the-things of-Caesar to-Caesar and the-things of-[the] God to-God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they-were┘not└able to-latch-on (the) word of-him before the people; and having-marveled at the answer of-him, they-became-silent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And some of-the Sadducees having-come—the-ones denying resurrection [not] to-be—asked him, 28saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> So seven brothers were. And the first, having-taken (a) wife, died childless. 30And the second 31and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did┘not└leave-behind children, and they-died. 32Last the woman also died. 33So the woman is the wife of-which of-them in the resurrection? For the seven had her as-a-wife."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "The sons of-[the] this age marry and are-given-in-marriage, 35and the-ones having-been-considered-worthy to-obtain [the] that age and of-the resurrection [the] of (the) dead neither marry nor are-given-in-marriage. 36For neither are-they-able still to-die, for they-are like-angels and are sons of-God, being sons of-the resurrection.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But that the dead rise, Moses also showed at the bush (passage) when he-says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But he-is not (a) God of-(the)-dead but of-(the)-living, for all live to-him." 39And having-answered, some of-the scribes said, "Teacher, you-spoke well."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> For no-longer were-they-daring to-ask him nothing/anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And he-said to them, "How do-they-say the Messiah to-be/is (the) son of-David?" 42For David himself says in (the) Book of-Psalms,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> So David calls him Lord, and how is-he Son of-him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And all the people having-heard, he-said to-the disciples [of-him]ms, 46"Beware of the scribes the-ones desiring to-walk-around in robes and loving greetings in the market-place and main-seats in the synagogues and chief-seats at [the] feasts, 47who devour the houses of-[the] widows and for-show offer┘long└prayers. These will-receive more-severe condemnation."</span>
