<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But having-stood, Zaccheus said to the Lord, "Behold, I-am-giving [the] half[s] of-the possessions of-me to-the poor, and if I-defrauded anybody of-anything I-am-repaying (it) fourfold."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And [the] Jesus said to him [that], "Today salvation came to-[the] this house, because he also is (a) son of-Abraham. 10For the Son of-[the] Man came to-seek and to-save the lost-(ones)."</span>

You-knew, (did you), that I am (an) austere man, picking-up what I-did┘not└lay-down and reaping what I-did┘not└sow? 23On-account-of what did-you┘not└give the money of-me in (a) bank? And-I, having-come, would-have-collected it with interest.' 24And to-the-ones standing-by he-said, 'Take from him the mina and give to-the-one having the ten minas,' 25—and they-said to-him, 'Sir, he-has ten minas'—26'I-tell you that to-everybody [the] having it-will-be-given, and from the-one not having even what he-does-have will-be-taken away. 27Except bring here these [the] enemies of-me [the] not wanting me to-rule over them and put┘them└to-death before me.'"</span>
