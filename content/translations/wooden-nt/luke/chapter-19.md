<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And having-entered, he-is-going-through [the] Jericho; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and, behold, (there was) (a) man called Zaccheus by-name, and he was (a) chief-tax-collector, and he (was) rich. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And he-was-trying to see [the] Jesus who he-is/was, and he-was┘not└able from the crowd, because he-was small in-[the] stature. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And having-run into the front, he-climbed-up on (a) sycamore in-order-that he-might-see him because he-was-going to-go-through that (way). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And when he-came to the place, [the] Jesus, having-looked-up, said to him, <em>“Zaccheus, </em><em>having-hurried, get-down;</em><em> for t</em><em>oday it-is-necessary for-me to-stay in the house of-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And having-hurried, he-got-down and welcomed him rejoicing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>And all, having-seen, began-to-grumble, saying [that], <em>“With (a) sinner man he-went-in to-lodge.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>But having-stood, Zaccheus said to the Lord, <em>“Behold, I-am-giving [the] half[s] of-the possessions of-me to-the poor, and if I-defrauded anybody of-anything I-am-repaying (it) fourfold.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to him [that], <em>“Today salvation came to-[the] this house, because </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> also is (a) son of-Abraham.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>For th</em><em>e Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an ca</em><em>me to-seek and to-save the lost-(ones).</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And they hearing these-things, having-added, he-spoke (a) parable on-account-of [the] his being near Jerusalem and their thinking that immediately the kingdom of-[the] God to-be-appearing. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>He-said therefore, <em>“(A)-certain noble man traveled into (a) far country to-receive for-himself (a) kingdom and to-return.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>And having-called ten servants of-him, he-gave to-them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do-business in which I-am-coming.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> the citizens of-him hated him and sent (a) delegation after him, saying, ‘We-do┘not└want this-one to-rule over us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And it-happened in [the] his coming-back, having-received the kingdom</em><em>,</em><em> and/that he-said to-call to-him [the] these </em><em>servants to-whom he-gave the money, in-order-that he-might-know what business-they-conducted.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And the first come-up, saying, ‘Sir, the mina of-you earned ten minas.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And he-said to-him, ‘Well, good servant, because you-were faithful in very-little, be having authority over ten cities.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>And the second came, saying, ‘The mina of-you, sir, made five minas.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>And he-said to-this-one, ‘You also be over five cities.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And the other came, saying, ‘Sir, behold, the mina of-you that </em><em>I-have hidden in (a) handkerchief.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>For I-was-afraid-of you because you-are (an) austere man; you-pic</em><em>k</em><em>-up what you-did┘not└lay-down, and you reap what you-did┘not└sow.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>He-says to-him, ‘Out-of the mouth of-you I-will-judge you, evil servant.</em><em> </em><em>You-knew</em><em>, (did you),</em><em> that I am (an) austere man, picking-up what I-did┘not└lay-down</em><em> and reaping what I-did┘not└sow?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>On-account-of what did-you┘not└give the money of-me in (a) bank?</em><em> </em><em>And-I, having-come, would-have-collected it with interest.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>And to-the-ones standing-by he-said, ‘Take from him the mina and give to-the-one having the ten minas,</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>—and they-said to-him, ‘Sir, he-has ten minas</em><em>’</em><em>—</em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>‘I-tell you that to-everybody [the] having it-will-be-given, and from the-one not having even what he-</em><em>does-have</em><em> will-be-taken away.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Except bring here these [the] enemies of-me [the] not wanting me to-rule over them and put┘them└to-death before me.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And having-said these-things, he-begins-to-travel in-front going-up to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And it-happened as he-neared to Bethphage and Bethany to the mountain [the] called [the Mount] of-Olives, (that) he-sent two of-the disciples, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>saying, <em>“Go into the </em><em>village </em><em>opposite, in which, entering, you-will-find (a) colt tied, on which nobody of-men ever sat; and, having-untied it, bring (it).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>And if anybody asks you, ‘On</em><em>-account-of what are-you-untying (it)?’</em><em> you</em><em>-shall-say thus, ‘</em><em>Because</em><em>/</em><em>[t</em><em>hat] </em><em>t</em><em>he Lord has need of it.’</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>And having-gone-away, the-ones sent found even-as he-said to-them. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And they untying the colt, the owners of-it said to them, <em>“Why are-you-untying the colt?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>And the/they said [that], <em>“The Lord has need of-it.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>And they-led it to [the] Jesus, and, having-laid the cloaks of-them on the colt, they-set┘[the] Jesus└on (it). <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And he going, they-started-spreading the cloaks of-them on the road.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>And he coming near already to the descent of-the Mount of-[the] Olives, all the multitude of-the disciples began to-sing, praising [the] God with-(a)-loud voice about how-many miracles that they-saw, <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>saying, <strong><em>“Blessed (is) the-One coming</em></strong><strong><em>— </em></strong> <em>t</em><em>he king</em><em>—</em><strong><em>in (the) name of-(the)-Lord</em></strong>; <em>p</em><em>eace in heaven</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd glory in (the) highest.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>And some of-the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, <em>“Teacher, rebuke the disciples of-you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>And having-answered, he-said, <em>“I-tell you, if these will-be-silent</em><em>, the stones will-cry-out.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And as he-came-near, having-seen the city, he-cried over it, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>saying [that], <em>“If you-knew in [the] this day, even/yes you, the-things belong-to (your) peace, but now it-was/is-hid from (the) eyes of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>Because days will-come on you and the enemies of-you (a) si</em><em>ege-wall they-will-put-by (you)</em><em> to-you</em><em>,</em><em> and they-will-encircle you and hem┘you└in on-all-sides.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>And they-will-completely-destroy you and the children of-you in you, and they-will┘not└leave stone on stone in you,</em><em> </em><em>instead-of which-things/because</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-did┘not└know the time of-the visitation of-you.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And having-entered into the temple, he-began to-cast-out the-ones selling, <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>saying to-them, <em>“It-is-written,</em> <strong><em>‘And the house of-me will-be (a) house of-prayer,’</em></strong> <em>b</em><em>ut </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> made-it (a) den </em><em>of thieves.</em><em>”</em></span>
