## Luke Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And all the tax-collectors and the sinners were-coming-near to-him to-hear him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And both the Pharisees and the scribes were-grumbling, saying [that], <em>“This (man) receives sinners and eats-with them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>But he-told to them [the] this parable, saying, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“What man of you, having (a) hundred sheep and having-lost one of them, does┘not└leave the ninety nine in the desert/open-country</em><em>,</em><em> and go to the lost-one until he-finds it?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And having-found (it), he-puts (it) on </em><em>the shoulders of-him, rejoicing;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>and having-come to the house, calls-together the/his friends and neighbors, saying to-them, </em><em>‘Rejoice</em><em>-with me, </em><em>because I-found the lost [the] sheep of-me.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I-tell you that thus joy will-be in [the] heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety nine righteous-ones who do┘not└have need of-repentance.</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“Or, what woman, having ten drachmas, if she-loses one drachma, does┘not└light (a) lamp and sweep the house and look-for (it) carefully till</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> she finds (it)?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And having-found (it), she-calls-together the/her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice-with me, because I-found the drachma that I-lost.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Thus, I-tell you, rejoicing is before the angels of-[the] God over one sinner repenting.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And he-said, <em>“(A)-certain man had two sons.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And the younger of-them said to-the/his father, ‘Father</em><em>, give me the falling-to-(me) par</em><em>t of-the assets,’ and the/he divided to-them the livelihood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>And after not many days, gathering-togeth</em><em>er</em><em> all-things the younger son went-on-a-trip into (a) far country, and there he-wasted the assets living immorally.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And he-having-spent all-things, (a) severe famine arose in [the] that country, and </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> began to-be-in-need.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And having-gone, he-joined-himself to-one of-the citizens of-[the] that country, and he-sent him into the fields of-him to-feed pigs; </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and wanted to-be-fed by the carob-pods that the pigs were-eating, and nobody would-give him (anything).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And having-come to himself, he-said, ‘</em><em>How-many hired-servan</em><em>ts of-the father of-me have-more-than-enough loaves, and </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am perishing here in-(a)-famine/hunger.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Having-arisen, I-will-go </em><em>to the father of-me and I-will-say to-him, “Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Make me like one of-the hired-servants of-you.’</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And having-arisen, he-went to-the father of-him.</em><em> </em><em>But he yet being-distant afar, the father of-him saw him and was-moved-with-compassion and, having-run, he-fell on the neck of-him and kissed him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And the son said to-him, ‘Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But the/his father said to the servants of-him, ‘Quickly, bring (a) robe, the best-one, and put-(it)-on him, and give (a) ring on the hand of-him and sandals for the/his feet, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>and bring the grain-fed [the] calf, butcher (it), and having-eaten, let-us-celebrate, </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>becaus</em><em>e this [the] son of-me was dead</em><em> and came-to-life-again; he-was lost and was-found,’ and they-began to-celebrate.</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“A</em><em>nd the older [the] son of-him was in (the) field, and when, coming, he-got-close to-the house, he-heard music and dancing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>And having-called-to-him one of-the servants, he-inquired what these-things would-be.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And the/he said to-him [that], ‘The brother of-you has-come, and the father of-you butchered the grain-fed [the] </em><em>calf</em><em>, because he-rec</em><em>eived-(him)-back in-good-health.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>And he-was-angry and did</em><em>┘not└</em><em>want to-go-in; but the father of-him, having-come-out, was-urging him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>But the/he, having-answered, said to-the father of-him, ‘Behold, for-so-many years I-serve you, and never transgressed (a) commandment of-you, and you</em><em>┘never└</em><em>gave me (a) </em><em><u>kid</u></em><em> in-order-that I-might-celebrate with the friends of-me;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>but when [the] this son of-you came, the-one having-wasted the livelihood of-the you with prostitutes, you-butchered for-him the grain-fed </em><em><u>calf</u></em><em>.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>And the/he said to-him, </em><em>‘</em><em>Son, you-are always with me, and all [the] my-things are yours.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>But it-was-necessary to-celebrate and to-rejoice, because [the] this brother of-you was dead and lived, and (was) lost and was-found</em><em>.’”</em></span>
