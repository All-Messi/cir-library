## Luke Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And all the tax-collectors and the sinners were-coming-near to-him to-hear him. 2And both the Pharisees and the scribes were-grumbling, saying [that], "This (man) receives sinners and eats-with them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But he-told to them [the] this parable, saying, 4"What man of you, having (a) hundred sheep and having-lost one of them, does┘not└leave the ninety nine in the desert/open-country, and go to the lost-one until he-finds it? 5And having-found (it), he-puts (it) on the shoulders of-him, rejoicing; 6and having-come to the house, calls-together the/his friends and neighbors, saying to-them, 'Rejoice-with me, because I-found the lost [the] sheep of-me.' 7I-tell you that thus joy will-be in [the] heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety nine righteous-ones who do┘not└have need of-repentance. 8"Or, what woman, having ten drachmas, if she-loses one drachma, does┘not└light (a) lamp and sweep the house and look-for (it) carefully till2 she finds (it)? 9And having-found (it), she-calls-together the/her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice-with me, because I-found the drachma that I-lost.' 10Thus, I-tell you, rejoicing is before the angels of-[the] God over one sinner repenting."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-said, "(A)-certain man had two sons. 12And the younger of-them said to-the/his father, 'Father, give me the falling-to-(me) part of-the assets,' and the/he divided to-them the livelihood. 13And after not many days, gathering-together all-things the younger son went-on-a-trip into (a) far country, and there he-wasted the assets living immorally. 14And he-having-spent all-things, (a) severe famine arose in [the] that country, and he began to-be-in-need. 15And having-gone, he-joined-himself to-one of-the citizens of-[the] that country, and he-sent him into the fields of-him to-feed pigs; 16and wanted to-be-fed by the carob-pods that the pigs were-eating, and nobody would-give him (anything). 17And having-come to himself, he-said, 'How-many hired-servants of-the father of-me have-more-than-enough loaves, and I am perishing here in-(a)-famine/hunger. 18Having-arisen, I-will-go to the father of-me and I-will-say to-him, "Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; 19I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you. Make me like one of-the hired-servants of-you.'" 20And having-arisen, he-went to-the father of-him. But he yet being-distant afar, the father of-him saw him and was-moved-with-compassion and, having-run, he-fell on the neck of-him and kissed him. 21And the son said to-him, 'Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you.' 22But the/his father said to the servants of-him, 'Quickly, bring (a) robe, the best-one, and put-(it)-on him, and give (a) ring on the hand of-him and sandals for the/his feet, 23and bring the grain-fed [the] calf, butcher (it), and having-eaten, let-us-celebrate, 24because this [the] son of-me was dead and came-to-life-again; he-was lost and was-found,' and they-began to-celebrate. 25"And the older [the] son of-him was in (the) field, and when, coming, he-got-close to-the house, he-heard music and dancing. 26And having-called-to-him one of-the servants, he-inquired what these-things would-be. 27And the/he said to-him [that], 'The brother of-you has-come, and the father of-you butchered the grain-fed [the] calf, because he-received-(him)-back in-good-health. 28And he-was-angry and did┘not└want to-go-in; but the father of-him, having-come-out, was-urging him. 29But the/he, having-answered, said to-the father of-him, 'Behold, for-so-many years I-serve you, and never transgressed (a) commandment of-you, and you┘never└gave me (a) kid in-order-that I-might-celebrate with the friends of-me; 30but when [the] this son of-you came, the-one having-wasted the livelihood of-the you with prostitutes, you-butchered for-him the grain-fed calf.' 31And the/he said to-him, 'Son, you-are always with me, and all [the] my-things are yours. 32But it-was-necessary to-celebrate and to-rejoice, because [the] this brother of-you was dead and lived, and (was) lost and was-found.'"</span>
