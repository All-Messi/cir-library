## Luke Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And all the tax-collectors and the sinners were-coming-near to-him to-hear him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And both the Pharisees and the scribes were-grumbling, saying [that], <em>“This (man) receives sinners and eats-with them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> But he-told to them [the] this parable, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-said, <em>“(A)-certain man had two sons.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>And the younger of-them said to-the/his father, ‘Father</em><em>, give me the falling-to-(me) par</em><em>t of-the assets,’ and the/he divided to-them the livelihood.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>And after not many days, gathering-togeth</em><em>er</em><em> all-things the younger son went-on-a-trip into (a) far country, and there he-wasted the assets living immorally.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>And he-having-spent all-things, (a) severe famine arose in [the] that country, and </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> began to-be-in-need.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And having-gone, he-joined-himself to-one of-the citizens of-[the] that country, and he-sent him into the fields of-him to-feed pigs; </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>and wanted to-be-fed by the carob-pods that the pigs were-eating, and nobody would-give him (anything).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And having-come to himself, he-said, ‘</em><em>How-many hired-servan</em><em>ts of-the father of-me have-more-than-enough loaves, and </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> am perishing here in-(a)-famine/hunger.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Having-arisen, I-will-go </em><em>to the father of-me and I-will-say to-him, “Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Make me like one of-the hired-servants of-you.’</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And having-arisen, he-went to-the father of-him.</em><em> </em><em>But he yet being-distant afar, the father of-him saw him and was-moved-with-compassion and, having-run, he-fell on the neck of-him and kissed him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>And the son said to-him, ‘Father, I-sinned against [the] heaven and before you; I-am no-longer worthy to-be-called (a) son of-you.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But the/his father said to the servants of-him, ‘Quickly, bring (a) robe, the best-one, and put-(it)-on him, and give (a) ring on the hand of-him and sandals for the/his feet, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>and bring the grain-fed [the] calf, butcher (it), and having-eaten, let-us-celebrate, </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>becaus</em><em>e this [the] son of-me was dead</em><em> and came-to-life-again; he-was lost and was-found,’ and they-began to-celebrate.</em></span>
