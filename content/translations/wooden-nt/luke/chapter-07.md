## Luke Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When he-finished all the words of-him in the hearings of-the people, he-entered into Capernaum. sAnd (a) servant of-(a)-certain centurion having sickness was-about to-die, who was valuable to-him. 3And having-heard about [the] Jesus, he-sent to him elders of-the Jews, askingsg him [in-order]-that, having-come, he-might-save the servant of-him. And the-ones having-come to [the] Jesus were-urging him earnestly, saying [that], "He-is worthy to-whom you-would-do this, 5for he-loves the nation of-us, and he built for-us the synagogue."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And [the] Jesus started-to-go with them. But already he, being-distant not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, to-him, "Sir, do┘not└trouble yourself, for I-am┘not└sufficient [in-order]-that you-might enter under the roof of-me. 7Wherefore I-did┘not└consider┘myself└worthy to-come to you. But speak with-(a)-word and let┘the servant of-me└be-healed. 8For I am also (a) man directed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I-say to-this-one, 'Go,' and he-goes; and to-another, 'Come,' he-comes; and to-the servant of-me. 'Do this,' and he-does (it)." 9[The] Jesus, having-heard these-things, marveled-at him, and having-turned to-the crowd following him, he-said, "I-say to-you, not-even in Israel did-I-find such faith."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And having-returned to the house, the-ones having-been-sent found the servant being-healthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And it-happened on the next (day)/soon afterward3, (that) he-traveled to (a) town called Nain; and the disciples of-him and (a) big crowd were-traveling-with him. 12Now when they-neared the gate of-the city [and], behold, (the) only son to-the mother of-him was-being-carried-out-for-burial, and she was (a) widow; and (a) significant crowd of-the city was with her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And having-seen her, the Lord was-felt-compassion over her and said to-her, "Do┘not└cry."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And having-gone-to (it), he-touched the bier, and the-ones bearing (it) stood-still, and he-said, "Young-man, I-say to-you, 'Get-up.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the dead-(one) sat-up, and he-began to-talk; and he-gave him to-the mother of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And fear took all and they-began-to-glorify [the] God, saying [that], "(A) great prophet arose among us," and [that], "[The] God visited the people of-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] this word about him went-out in the whole Judaea and all the region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And the disciples of-him reported to-[the] John about all these-things, and having-summoned (a) certain two of-the disciples of-him, [the] John 19sent (them) to the Lord, saying, "Are you the-one coming or do-we-wait-for another?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And having-arrived to him, the men said, "John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the-one coming or do-we-wait-for another.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And in that [the] hour he-healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and he-granted to-many blind-ones to-see. 22And having-answered, he-said to-them. "Having-gone, report to-John what-things you-saw and heard. Blind-(people) see, lame-(people) hear, dead-(people) are-being-raised, poor-(people) are-being-evangelized. 23And blessed is-he who is┘not└offended in me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And the messengers of-John having-gone-away, he-began to-say to the crowds about John, "What did-you-do-out into the desert to-see? (a) reed shaken by (the) wind?" 25But what did-you-go-out to-see? (A) man dressed in soft clothes? Behold the-ones being in expensive clothes and in luxury are in [the] palaces. 26But what did-you-go-out to-see? (A) prophet? Yes, I-say to-you, and more than-(a)-prophet. 27This is concerning whom it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> I-say to-you, among ones-born of-women nobody is greater than-John, but the least in the kingdom of-the God is greater than-he."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And all the crowd having-heard and the tax-collectors justified [the] God, having-been-baptized with-respect-to-the baptism of-John. 30And the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the plan of-[the] God for themselves, not having-been-baptized by him. 31"Therefore to-whom will-I-liken the men of-[the] this generation and what it-is like. 32They-are like kids [the] in the market-place, sitting and calling-out to-one-another what-things, who-say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> For John the Baptist has-come, not eating bread nor drinking wine, and you-say, 'He-has (a) demon.'  34The Son of-[the] Man has-come eating and drinking, and you-say, 'Behold, (a) glutton man and (a) drunk, (a) friend of-tax-collectors and sinners.' 35And [the] wisdom was-justified by all the children of-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And (a) certain-one of-the Pharisees was-asking him [in-order]-that he-might-eat with him; and, having-entered into the house of-the Pharisee, he-reclined-(at table). 37And behold, (a) woman who was (a) sinner in the city; and having-found-out that he-was-reclining-(at table) in the house of-the Pharisee, having-brought (an) alabaster-cruise of-ointment 38and having-stood behind (him) at the feet of-him, crying, she-began to-wet the feet of-him will-the/her tears, and was-drying (them) with-the hair[s] of-the head of-her, and was-kissing the feet of-him and anointing (them) with-the ointment. 39And having-seen, the Pharisee the-one having-called him said in himself, saying, "If this-(man) were (a) prophet, he-would-know who and what-kind-of [the] woman who is-touching him, because she-is (a) sinner."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And having-responded, [the] Jesus said to-him, "Simon, I-have something to-say to-you." 41"Two clients were to-(a)-certain money-lender. The one owed five-hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42They not having to-repay, he-forgave both. Which then of-them will-love him more?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And having-answered, Simon said, "I-suppose that to-whom he-forgave [the] more."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> And having-turned to the woman, he-said to-[the] Simon, "Do-you-see this [the] woman? I-entered into the house of-you; you-did┘not└give water to-me for (my) feet; but this-one wetted the feet of-me with the/her tears and dried (them) with the hair[s] of-her. 45You-did┘not└give me (a) kiss; but this-one, from which (hour) I-entered, did┘not└leave-off kissing the feet of-me. 46You-did┘not└anoint the head of-me with-olive-oil, but this-one anointed the feet of-me. 47For-the-sake-of which I-say to-you, the many [the] sins of-her are-forgiven, because she-loved much; but to-whom little is-forgiven, loves little."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> And said to-her, "The sins of-you are-forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And the-ones reclining-at-table-with (him) began to-say in themselves. "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And he-said to the woman, "The faith of-you has-saved you. Go in peace."</span>
