## Luke Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>When he-finished all the words of-him in the hearings of-the people, he-entered into Capernaum. <strong><sup>s</sup></strong>And (a) servant of-(a)-certain centurion having sickness was-about to-die, who was valuable to-him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And having-heard about [the] Jesus, he-sent to him elders of-the Jews, asking<sup>sg</sup> him [in-order]-that, having-come, he-might-save the servant of-him. And the-ones having-come to [the] Jesus were-urging him earnestly, saying [that], <em>“He-is worthy to-whom you-would-do this, </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>for he-loves the nation of-us</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> built for-us the synagogue.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus started-to-go with them. But already he, being-distant not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, to-him, <em>“Sir, do┘not└trouble</em><em> yourself, for I-am┘not└sufficient [in-order]-that you-might enter under the roof of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Wherefore I-did┘not└consider┘myself└worthy to-come to you.</em><em> </em><em>But speak with-(a)-word and let┘the servant of-me└be-healed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>For I am also (a) man directed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I-say to-this-one, ‘Go,’ and he-goes; and to-another, ‘Come,’ he-comes; and to-the servant of-me.</em><em> </em><em>‘Do this,’ and he-does (it).”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>[The] Jesus, having-heard these-things, marveled-at him, and having-turned to-the crowd following him, he-said,<em> “I-say to-you, not-even in Israel did-I-find such faith.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And having-returned to the house, the-ones having-been-sent found the servant being-healthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And it-happened on the next (day)/soon afterward<sup>3</sup>, (that) he-traveled to (a) town called Nain; and the disciples of-him and (a) big crowd were-traveling-with him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Now when they-neared the gate of-the city [and], behold, (the) only son to-the mother of-him was-being-carried-out-for-burial, and she was (a) widow; and (a) significant crowd of-the city was with her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And having-seen her, the Lord was-felt-compassion over her and said to-her,<em> “Do┘not└cry.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>And having-gone-to (it), he-touched the bier, and the-ones bearing (it) stood-still, and he-said, <em>“Young-man, I-say to-you, ‘Get-up.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And the dead-(one) sat-up, and he-began to-talk; and he-gave him to-the mother of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And fear took all and they-began-to-glorify [the] God, saying [that], <em>“(A) great prophet arose among us,”</em> and [that], <em>“[The] God visit</em><em>ed</em><em> the people of-him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>And [the] this word about him went-out in the whole Judaea and all the region.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And the disciples of-him reported to-[the] John about all these-things, and having-summoned (a) certain two of-the disciples of-him, [the] John <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>sent (them) to the Lord, saying, <em>“Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> the-one coming or do-we-wait-for another?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And having-arrived to him, the men said, <em>“John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, ‘Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> the-one coming or do-we-wait-for another.’”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And in that [the] hour he-healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and he-granted to-many blind-ones to-see. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And having-answered, he-said to-them. <em>“Having-gone, report to-John what-things you-saw and heard.</em><em> </em><em>Blind-(people) see, lame-(people) hear, dead-(people) are-being-raised, poor-(people) are-being-evangelized.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>And blessed is-he who is</em><em>┘not└</em><em>offended in me.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>And the messengers of-John having-gone-away, he-began to-say to the crowds about John, <em>“What did-you-do-out into the desert to-see?</em><em> </em><em>(a) </em><em>reed </em><em>shaken by (the) wind?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>But what </em><em><u>did</u></em><em>-you-go-out to-see?</em><em> </em><em>(A) man dressed in soft clothes?</em><em> </em><em>Behold the-ones being in expensive clothes and in luxury are in [the] palaces.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But what </em><em><u>did</u></em><em>-you-go-out to-see?</em><em> </em><em>(A) prophet?</em><em> </em><em>Yes, I-say to-</em><em>you, and more than-(a)-pr</em><em>ophet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>This is concerning whom it-is-written,</em> <em>	</em><strong><em>‘Behold, I-will-send the messenger of-me before (the) face of-me,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>who will-prepare the road </em></strong><em>of-you</em><strong><em> before </em></strong><em>you</em><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>I-say to-you, among ones-born of-women nobody is greater than-John, but the least in the kingdom of-the God is greater than-he.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And all the crowd having-heard and the tax-collectors justified [the] God, having-been-baptized with-respect-to-the baptism of-John. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the plan of-[the] God for themselves, not having-been-baptized by him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>“<em>Therefore to-whom will-I-liken the men of-[the] this generation and what it-is like.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>They-are like kids [the] in the market-place, sitting and calling-out to-one-another what-things</em><em>, who-say</em><em>,</em> <em>	‘We-played-a-flute for-you, and you-did┘not└dance;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>w</em><em>e-sang-a-funeral-song, and you-did</em><em>┘not└</em><em>cry.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup><em>For John the Baptist has-come, not eating bread nor drinking wine, a</em><em>nd you-say, ‘He-has (a) demon.’</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>The Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an has-come eat</em><em>ing and drinking, and you-say, ‘</em><em>Behold</em><em>,</em><em> (a) glutto</em><em>n man and (a) drunk, (a) friend of-tax-collectors and sinners.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>And [the] wisdom was-justified by all the children of-it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>And (a) certain-one of-the Pharisees was-asking him [in-order]-that he-might-eat with him; and, having-entered into the house of-the Pharisee, he-reclined-(at table). <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And behold, (a) woman who was (a) sinner in the city; and having-found-out that he-was-reclining-(at table) in the house of-the Pharisee, having-brought (an) alabaster-cruise of-ointment <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>and having-stood behind (him) at the feet of-him, crying, she-began to-wet the feet of-him will-the/her tears, and was-drying (them) with-the hair[s] of-the head of-her, and was-kissing the feet of-him and anointing (them) with-the ointment. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And having-seen, the Pharisee the-one having-called him said in himself, saying, <em>“If this-(man) were (a) prophet, he-would-know who and what-kind-of [the] woman who is-touching him, because she-is (a) sinner.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>And having-responded, [the] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Simon, I-have something to-say to-you.”</em><em> </em> And the/he says, <em>“Teacher, say.”</em> <strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Two clients were to-(a</em><em>)-certain money-lender.</em><em> </em><em>The one owed five-hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>They not h</em><em>aving to-repay, he-forgave both.</em><em> </em><em>W</em><em>hich then of-them will-love him more?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>And having-answered, Simon said, <em>“I-suppose that to-whom he-forgave </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> more.”</em> And he-said to-him, <em>“You-judged correctly.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>And having-turned to the woman, he-said to-[the] Simon,<em> </em> <em>“</em><em>Do-you-see this [the] woman?</em><em> </em><em>I-entered into the house of-you;</em><em> you-did┘not└give</em><em> water to-me for (my) feet; but </em><em>this-one wetted the feet of-me with the/her tears and dried (them) with the hair[s] of-her.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>You-did┘not└give me (a) kiss; b</em><em>ut</em><em> this-one, from which</em><em> (hour)</em><em> I-entered, did┘not└leave-off kissing the feet of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>You-did┘not└anoint the head of-me with-olive-oil, but this-one anointed the feet of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>For-the-sake-of which I-say to-you, the many [the] sins of-her are-</em><em>forgiven, because she-loved much;</em><em> but to-whom little is-forgiven, loves little.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>And said to-her, <em>“The sins of-you are-forgiven.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>And the-ones reclining-at-table-with (him) began to-say in themselves. <em>“Who</em><em> is this who even forgives sins?</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>And he-said to the woman, <em>“The faith of-you has-saved you.</em><em> </em><em>Go in peace.”</em></span>
