<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And on [the] (day) one of-the week during-early morning, they-went to the tomb, carrying what spices they-prepared. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they-found the stone rolled-away from the tomb, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and having-entered, they-did┘not└find the body of-the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] their being-perplexed about this, and/that two men stood-by them in dazzling clothes. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And they, having-become fearful and bowing<sup>f</sup> the/their faces to the ground, they-said to them<sup>f</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Why are-you-looki</em><em>ng-for the living with the dead?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He-is not here, but he-arose.</em><em> </em><em>Remember when he-said </em><em>to-you, being still in [the] Galilee, </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>saying </em><em>that it-is/was-necessary for-the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an to-be-betrayed into (the) hands of-sinner</em><em>[s] men</em><em>,</em><em> and to-be-crucified</em><em>,</em><em> and to-resurrect on-the third day.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And they-remembered the words of-him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And having-returned from the tomb, they-reported all these-things to-the eleven and to-all the rest. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And they-were Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the (mother/wife) of-James and the others with them. They-were-telling these-things to the apostles, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and [the] these words appeared before them like idle-talk, and they-did┘not└believe them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And [the] Peter, getting-up, ran to the tomb, and, having-stooped-down, sees only the linen wrappings; and he-went-away, marveling┘to himself└at the-thing taken-place.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And behold, two of them on the very day were traveling to (a) village being-away from Jerusalem sixty stades, (the) name to-which (was) Emmaus. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And they were-talking to one-another about all [the] these-things come-about. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] their talking and discussing, and/that Jesus himself, having-come-near, was-traveling-with them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But the eyes of-them were-being-held [the] to-recognizing him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>And he-said to them, <em>“What (are) [the] these words that you-are-exchanging with one-another, walking?”</em><em> </em><em>	</em> And they-stood-still, sad. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And having-answered, one, Cleopas by-name, said to-him, <em>“Are┘you└living-as-a-stranger-in Jerusalem and did┘not└know the-thing having-happened in it in [the] these days?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>And he-said to-them, <em>“What-kind-of-things?”</em> And the/they said to-him, <em>“The-things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was (a) prophet man, able in work and word before [the] God and all the people, </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>how the chief-priests and the rulers of-us both delivered him to condemnation of-death and crucified him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> were-hoping that </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> is/was the-one going to-redeem [the] Israel.</em><em> </em><em>But also with all these-things, it-brings the third day from which these-things happened.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But also some women of us amazed us, having-arrived early at the tomb, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>and not having-found the body of-him, they-came saying to-have-seen (a) </em><em>vision of-angels who say him to-be-alive.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>And some of-the-ones with us went to the tomb and found (it) thus even-as the women said, but they-did┘not└see him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>And <u>he</u> said to them, <em>“O foolish and slow with-the heart [the] to-believe on all that the prophets said.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Was-it┘not└necessary for-the Messiah to-suffer these-things and to-enter into the glory of-him?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And having-begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he-interpreted to-them in all the scriptures the-things about himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And they-drew-near to the village where they-were-going, and <u>he</u> made to-go farther. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And they-persuaded him, saying, <em>“Stay with us because it-is toward evening and the day has┘already└drawn-to-a-close”</em>; and he-went-in [the] to-stay with them. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his reclining-at-table with them, (that) having-taken the/a loaf, he-blessed (it) and having-broken (it), he-was-handing (it) to-them. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And the eyes of-them were-opened-up, and they-recognized him, and <u>he</u> became invisible from them. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And they-said to one-another, <em>“Was not the heart of-us burning [in us]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> as he-was-speaking to-u</em><em>s</em><em> on the road, as he-was-opening-up the scriptures to-us?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And getting-up, at-the very hour, they-returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven<sup>acc</sup> gathered and the-ones with them, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>saying<sup>acc</sup> that the Lord really did-rise and appeared to-Simon. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And they-were-recounting the-things on the road, how he-was-made-known to-them in the breaking of-[the] bread.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>And they saying these-things, <u>he</u> stood in (the) midst of-them, and says to-them, <em>“Peace to-you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>And</em> having-been-startled and having become fearful, they-were-supposing (the) to-be-seeing (a) spirit. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And he-said to-them, <em>“Why are-you unsettled and on-a</em><em>ccount-of what are┘reasonings└ar</em><em>ising in the heart of-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>See the hands of-me and the feet of-me that I am he.</em><em> </em><em>Feel me and see, because (a) spir</em><em>it does┘not└have flesh and bones</em><em> even-as you-see me having.”</em> <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And having-said this, he-showed them the/his hands and the/his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>And still they unbelieving from [the] joy and marveling, he-said to-them, <em>“Do-you-have any food here?”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And the/they gave him (a) piece of-baked fish. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And having-taken (it) in-front-of them, he-ate (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup>And he-said to-them<em>, “These (are) the words that I-spoke to-you, still being with you, that it-is-necessary for-all-the-things written in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-Moses and the prophets and the Psalms to-be-fulfilled.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Then he-opened-up the mind of-them to-understand the scriptures.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>And he-said to-them [that], <em>“Thus it-is-written (that) the Messiah died and arose from (the) dead on-the third day.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>And repentance unto remission of-sins be-preached in the name of-him to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>You (are) witnesses of-these-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>And [behold]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>,</em><em> I am-sending the promise of-the Father of-me upon you, but you stay in the city until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-are-clothed-with power from on-high.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>And he-led them outside as-far-as to Bethany and, having-lifted-up the hands of-him, be-blessed them. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And it-happened in [the] his blessing them, (that) he-was-separated from them and was-being-carried-up into the sky. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>And they, having-worshipped him, returned into Jerusalem with great joy; <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>and they-were through all/continually<sup>2</sup> in the temple blessing [the] God.
