<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And it-happened on (a) Sabbath, his passing through grain-fields, and/that the disciples of-him were-plucking and were-eating the grain-heads, rubbing (them) with the/their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And some of-the Pharisees said, "Why are-youpl-doing what is┘not└lawful on-the Sabbath[s]?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And having-responded to them, [the] Jesus said, "Did-you┘not └read what David did when he hungered and the-ones [being]ms with him; 4[when]ms he-entered into the house of-the God and, having-taken the loaves of-[the] Presentation, he-ate and gave to-the-ones with him, which is┘not└lawful to-eat except2 the priests alone?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, "The Son of-[the] Man is Lord of-the Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And it-happened on another Sabbath, his entering into the/a synagogue and teaching, and/that (a) man was there and the right [the] hand of-him was paralyzed. 7And the scribes and the Pharisees were-watching closely whether he-heals/would-heal on the Sabbath, in-order-that they-might-find (something) to-accuse him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And he knew the reasonings of-them, and said to-the man [the] having the paralyzed hand, "Get-up and stand in the midst." And having-got-up, he-stood. 9And [the] Jesus said to them, "I-ask you whether it-is-lawful to-do-good on-the Sabbath or to-do-evil, to-save life or destroy (it)." 10And having-looked-around-at them all, he-said to-him, "Hold-out the hand of-you." And the/he did (so), and the hand of-him was-restored. 11And they were-filled-with rage, and they-began-to-talk to one-another what2 they-might-do to-[the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And it-happened in [the] these days his going-away onto the/a mountain to-pray, and/that was spending-the-night in [the] prayer of-[the] God. 13And when day came, he-called-to-(him) the disciples of-him, and having-chosen twelve from them, whom also he-named apostles: 14Simon, whom also he-named Peter; and Andrew the brother of-him, and James, and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James (son) of-Alphaeus, and Simon [the] called Zelotes, 16and Judas (son) of-James, and Judas Iscariot, who became (a) betrayer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-come-down with them, he-stood on (a) level place, and (a) large crowd of-disciples of-him, and (a) large multitude of-[the] people from all [the] Judaea and Jerusalem and the coastal-district of-Tyre and Sidon; 18who came to-hear him and to-be-healed from the diseases of-them, and the-ones being-troubled by unclean spirits were-healed; 19and all the crowd was-trying to-touch him, because power would-go-out from him and heal all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he, having-lifted-up the eyes of-him on the disciples of-him, began-by-saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Blessed (are) the/you-hungering now,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Blessed are-you when [the] men hate you and when they-shun you and insult-(you) and throw-out the name of-you as evil for-the-sake of-the son of-[the] Man. 23Rejoice in that [the] day and jump-up-and-down-for-joy, for, behold, the reward of-you in [the] heaven (is) much. The fathers of-you used-to-treat the prophets according-to the same-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Except woe to-you [the] rich-ones,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Woe to-you, the-ones filled now,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Woe when all [the] men speak well of-you; the fathers of-you used-to-treat the false-prophets according-to the same-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> But I-say to-you the-ones listening, love the enemies of-you, do well to-the-ones hating you. 28Bless the-ones cursing you, pray about the-ones mistreating you. 29To-the-one slapping yousg on the cheek, offer the other, and from the-one taking the coat of-yousg, do┘not└withhold the/your tunic. 30To-everybody asking yousg, give; and from the-one taking [the] your-things do┘not└demand-(it)-back. 31And even-as youpl-want [in-order]-that [the] men do to-you, do likewise to-them. 32And if youpl-love the-ones loving you, what grace is to-you? For even [the] sinners love the-ones loving them. 33[For]ms even if youpl-treat-well the-ones treating┘you└well, what grace [is]ms to-you? Even sinners do the same-things. 34And if youpl-lend from whom you-hope to-receive, what grace [is]ms to-you? Even sinners lend to-sinners [in-order]-that they-may-receive-back the equal-things. 35Except, lovepl the enemies of-you and treat-(them)-well and lend expecting┘nothing└back, and the reward of-you-will-be much; and you-will-be sons of-(the)-Highest, because he is gracious to-the ungracious and evil. 36Bepl merciful even-as [also]ms the Father of-you is merciful.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And do┘not└criticize, and you-will┘certainly not└be-criticized; and do┘not└condemn, and you-will┘certainly not└be-condemned; pardon, and you-will-be pardoned. 38Give and it-will-be-given to-you; good measure, pressed-down, shaken-together, running-over they-will-give into the lap of-you. For by-what measure you-measure it-will-be-measured-back to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Now also he-told them (a) parable, "(A) blind-(man) is┘not┘┘└able to-lead (a) blind-(man), └└is-he? Will-they┘both not└fall into (the/a) ditch? 40(A) disciple/student is not above the/a teacher, and everybody fully-taught will-be like the teacher of-him. 41And why will-you look-at the/a speck-of-sawdust [the] in the eye of-the brother of-you, and not notice the log [the] in your-own eye? 42How are-you-able to-say to-the brother of-you, 'Brother, let (me) to-take-out the speck-of-sawdust [the] in the eye of-you,' yourself not seeing the log in the eye of-you? Hypocrite! Take-out first the log from the eye of-you, and then you-will-see-clearly to-take-out the speck-of-sawdust [the] in the eye of-the brother of-you. 43"For (a) good tree does not bear bad fruit; neither again (does) (a) bad tree bear good fruit. 44For each tree is-known by [the] its-own fruit; for they-do┘not└gather figs from thistles, nor do-they-harvest (a) bunch-of-grapes from (a) thorn-bush. 45The/A good man out-of the good treasure of-the/his heart brings-forth the good, and the evil-(man) out-of the evil-(treasure) brings-forth the evil. For out-of (the) abundance of-(the)-heart the mouth of-him speaks. 46"And why do-you-call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do┘not└do what-things I-say? 47Everybody [the] coming to me and listening-to the words of-me and doing them—I-will-show to-you who he-is like. 48He-is like (a) man building (a) house, who dug and was-going-deep and put (the) foundation on the bedrock. And (a) flood having-happened, the river swept-against [the] that house, and it-was┘not└strong-enough to-shake it on-account-of [the] its being-built well. 49And the-one having-heard and not having-done is like (a) man building (a) house on the dirt without (a) foundation, against┘which the river└swept, and immediately it-fell, and the ruin of-[the] that house was great."</span>
