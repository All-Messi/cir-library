<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The] masters, give the/your slaves the just-thing and [the] fairness, knowing that you also have (a) Master in heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Devote-yourselves to-[the] prayer, being-vigilant in it in thanksgiving, 3praying at-the-same-time/together also about us, in-order-that [the] God may-open for-us (a) door of-the word to-speak the mystery of-[the] Christ, on-account-lf which also I-have-been-put-in-prison. 4(Pray) in-order-that I-will-make┘it└manifest as it-is-necessary for-me to-speak. 5Walk in wisdom toward the-ones outside, making-good-use-of the opportunity. 6(Let) the word of-you always (be) in grace, seasoned with-salt, to-know-how it-is-necessary for-us to-answer each one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> All the-things according-to me Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in (the) Lord, will-make-known to-you, 8whom I-sent to you for this very-thing, in-order-that you-may-know the-things about us and he-may-comfort the hearts of-you, 9with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you. They-will-make-known to-you all the-things here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Aristarchus, the fellow-prisoner of-me, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of-Barnabas (about whom you-received commandments, (that) if he-comes to-you, receive him), 11and Jesus the-one called Justus, the-ones being of (the) circumcision; these (are the) only fellow-workers for the kingdom of-[the] God, who became (an) encouragement to-me. 12Epaphras greets you, the-one of you, (a) servant of-Christ [Jesus]ms, always striving on-behalf-of you in [the] prayers, in-order-that you-may-stand perfect and full-confident in all the will of-[the] God. 13For I-bear-witness to-him that he-has much pain on-behalf-of you and the-ones in Laodicea and the-ones in Hierapolis. 14Luke the beloved [the] doctor greets you, and Demas (does too). 15Greet the brothers in Laodicea and Nympha and the church according-to (the) house of-her. 16And when the letter is-read with you, make (it) in-order-that also it-is-read in the church of-(the) Laodiceans and the letter from Laodicea in-order-that you also read (it). 17And say to-Archippus, "See-to the ministry that you-received in (the) Lord in-order-that you-fulfill it."</span>
