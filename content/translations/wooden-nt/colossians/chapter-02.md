## Colossians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For I-want you to-know how-great (a) struggle I-have on-behalf-of you and the–ones in Laodicea, even as-many-as have┘not└seen the face of-me in (the) flesh, 2in-order-that the hearts of-them might-be-comforted, being-held-together in love even unto all (the) wealth of-the full-assurance of-[the] understanding unto (the) knowledge of-the mystery of-[the] God, (which is) Christ, 3in whom are all the treasures of-[the] wisdom and knowledge hidden. 4I-say this in-order-that nobody may lead┘you└astray with attractive-argument. 5For even if I-am-absent with-the flesh, I-am nevertheless with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing the orderliness of-you and the steadfastness of-the faith of-you in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then as you received [the] Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him, 7rooted/founded and built-up in him and established in-[the] faith even-as you-were-taught, abounding in thanksgiving. 8See-to-it lest anybody will-be [the-one] taking┘you└captive through [the] philosophy and empty deception according-to the traditions of-[the] men, according-to the basic-principles of-the world, and not according-to Christ; 9because in him resides all the fullness of-deity bodily; 10and you-are completed in him, who is the head of-all rule and authority, 11in-whom also you-were-circumcised with-(a)-circumcision not-hand-made in the removal of-the body of-[the] flesh, in the circumcision of-[the] Christ, 12having-been-buried-with him in [the] baptism, in which also you-were-raised-with (him) through [the] faith in-the working of-[the] God, the-One having-raised him from (the) dead; 13and you, being dead in [the] trespasses and the uncircumcision of-the flesh of-you, he-made-alive with him, having-pardoned for-you all the trespasses, 14having-canceled the certificate/record-of-debt (made up) with-[the] decrees that was against us, and he-took it from the midst, having-nailed it to-the cross. 15Having disarmed [the] rulers and [the] authorities, he-showed (them) in boldness/openly2, having-triumphed-over them in it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Therefore let┘anybody not└judge you in-regard-to food or in-regard-to drink or in-regard-to (a)-part of-(a)-festival or new-moon or Sabbath[s], 17which are shadows of-[the] things-to-come, but the body (is) of-[the] Christ. 18Let┘nobody└condemn you by-desiring self-abasement and worship of-[the] angels, -(a)-stand-on what he-has-seen, puffed-up in-vanity by the mind of-the flesh of-him, 19and not holding-onto the Head from whom all the body, being supported and being-held-together by the ligaments and tendons grows the growth of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> If you-died with Christ from the basic-principles of-the world, why as living in the world do-you-subject-yourselves-to-rules-and-regulations—21"Do┘not└handle; do┘not└taste; do┘not└touch" (, 22which are all unto perishing with-the using)—according-to the rules and teachings of-[the] men, 23which are (a) matter having wisdoms in self-imposed piety and self-abasement and severity to-(the)-body, not with any value in-regard-to satisfaction of-the flesh.</span>
