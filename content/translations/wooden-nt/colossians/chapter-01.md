## Colossians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus through (the) will of-God, and Timothy the brother, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>to-the saints in Colossae and faithful brothers in Christ. Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> We-thak [the] God (the) Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, praying always about you, <sup>4</sup>having-heard-about the faith of-you in Christ Jesus and the love that you-have unto all the saints <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>through the hope [the] stored-up for-you in [the] heaven[s], which you-previously-heard-about in the word of-the truth of-the gospel, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>the-One being-present in you even-as also in all the world it-is bearing-fruit and growing even-as also in you from which day you-heard (it) and came-to-know the grace of-[the God in truth. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Even-as you-learned from Epaphras, the beloved fellow-servant of-us, who is (a) faithful minister of-[the] Christ on-behalf-of you, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>the-one also having-made-evident to-us the love of-you in (the) Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> On-accoount-of this we also, from which day we-heard (it), do┘not└cease praying and making-request on-behalf-of you in-order-that you-may-be-filled-with the knowledge of-the will of-him in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>to-walk worthily of-the Lord in every desire-to-please (the Lord), in every good work, bearing-fruit and growing in the knowledge of-[the] God, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>being┘greatly/in-allᴖpower └enabled according-to the might of-the glory of-him in all perseverance and patience with joy, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>giving-thanks to the Father, the-One having-made┘us└sufficient into the share/part of-the inheritance of-the saints in [the] light; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>who delivered us out-of the power of-[the] darkness and transferred (us) into the kingdom of-the Son of-the love of-him; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>in whom we-have [the] redemption, the forgiveness of-[the] sins; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>who is (the) image of-the invisible [the] God, (the) firstborn of-all creation, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>because in him [the] all-things were-created in [the] heaven[s] and on [the] earth, [the] visible-thins and [the] invisible-things, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. He has created [the] all-things through him and to him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And <u>he</u> is before all-things, and in him [the] all-things hold-together/have-their-proper-place, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and <u>he</u> is the head of-the body the church, who is (the) beginning, (the) firstborn from the dead, in-order-that <u>he</u> might-be having-first-place in all-things, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>because in him it-seemed-good for-all the fullness to-dwell, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and through him to-reconcile [the] all-things to himself, having-made-peace through the blood of the cross of-him, [through him]<sup>ms</sup>, whether the-things on [the] earth or the-things in [the] heaven[s].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And you, being at-one-time alienated and enemies in [the] mind in [the] evil [the] deeds, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>now [but] he-reconciled in the body of-the flesh of-him through [the] death to-present you holy and blameless and without-fault before him, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>if indeed you-remain in-[the] faith established and firm and not moved-away from the hope of-the gospel that you-heard, the-one preached in all creation [the] under [the] the sky, of-which I, Paul, became (a) minister.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Now I-rejoice in [the] suffering on-behalf-of you, and I-complete in the flesh of-me the-things lacking of-the sufferings of-[the] Christ on-behalf-of the body of-him, that is, the church, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>of-which <u>I</u> became (a) minister according-to the stewardship of-[the] God, the-one given to-me unto you to-fulfill the word of-[the] God, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>the mystery [the] hidden from [the] ages and from [the] generations—but now it-was-revealed to-the saints of-him, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>to-whom [the] God wanted to-make-known what (is) the wealth of-the glory of-[the] this mystery among the Gentiles, that is, Christ in you, the hope of-[the] glory, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>whom we proclaim, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, in-order-that we-might-present every man complete in Christ. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Unto this also I-labor, striving according-to the working of-him [the] working powerfully in me. <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>For I-want you to-know how-great (a) struggle I-have on-behalf-of you and the–ones in Laodicea, even as-many-as have┘not└seen the face of-me in (the) flesh, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>in-order-that the hearts of-them might-be-comforted, being-held-together in love even unto all (the) wealth of-the full-assurance of-[the] understanding unto (the) knowledge of-the mystery of-[the] God, (which is) Christ, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>in whom are all the treasures of-[the] wisdom and knowledge hidden. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I-say this in-order-that nobody may lead┘you└astray with attractive-argument. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For even if I-am-absent with-the flesh, I-am nevertheless with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing the orderliness of-you and the steadfastness of-the faith of-you in Christ.</span>
