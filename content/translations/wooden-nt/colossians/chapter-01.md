He has created [the] all-things through him and to him. 17And he is before all-things, and in him [the] all-things hold-together/have-their-proper-place, 18and he is the head of-the body the church, who is (the) beginning, (the) firstborn from the dead, in-order-that he might-be having-first-place in all-things, 19because in him it-seemed-good for-all the fullness to-dwell, 20and through him to-reconcile [the] all-things to himself, having-made-peace through the blood of the cross of-him, [through him]ms, whether the-things on [the] earth or the-things in [the] heaven[s].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Now I-rejoice in [the] suffering on-behalf-of you, and I-complete in the flesh of-me the-things lacking of-the sufferings of-[the] Christ on-behalf-of the body of-him, that is, the church, 25of-which I became (a) minister according-to the stewardship of-[the] God, the-one given to-me unto you to-fulfill the word of-[the] God, 26the mystery [the] hidden from [the] ages and from [the] generations—but now it-was-revealed to-the saints of-him, 27to-whom [the] God wanted to-make-known what (is) the wealth of-the glory of-[the] this mystery among the Gentiles, that is, Christ in you, the hope of-[the] glory, 28whom we proclaim, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, in-order-that we-might-present every man complete in Christ. 29Unto this also I-labor, striving according-to the working of-him [the] working powerfully in me.</span>
