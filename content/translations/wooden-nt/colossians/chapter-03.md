## Colossians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>If then you-were-raised-with [the] Christ, seek the-things above, where [the] Christ is-seated on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Set-your-mind-on the-things above, not the-things on [the] earth. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For you-died and the life of-you has-been-hidden with Christ in [the] God. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When [the] Christ, the life of-you, appears, then you also will-be-manifested with him in glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Devote-yourselves to-[the] prayer, being-vigilant in it in thanksgiving, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>praying at-the-same-time/together also about us, in-order-that [the] God may-open for-us (a) door of-the word to-speak the mystery of-[the] Christ, on-account-lf which also I-have-been-put-in-prison. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>(Pray) in-order-that I-will-make┘it└manifest as it-is-necessary for-me to-speak. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Walk in wisdom toward the-ones outside, making-good-use-of the opportunity. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>(Let) the word of-you always (be) in grace, seasoned with-salt, to-know-how it-is-necessary for-us to-answer each one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Therefore put-to-death the members [the] on the earth: sexual-immorality, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and [the] greed, which is idolatry. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>On-account-of which-things the wrath of-[the] God comes [on the sons of-[the] disobedience]<sup>ms</sup>, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>in which-things you also once walked, when you were-living in these-things, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and/but now <u>you</u> also put┘all the-things└aside<sup>imparative</sup>: anger, rage, hateful feelings, slander, shameful talk from your mouth. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Do┘not└lie to one-another, having-taken-off the old man with the practices of-it, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and having-put-on the new (man), the-one being-made-new to knowledge according-to (the) image of-the-One having-created him, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>where there-is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ (is) [the]<sup>ms</sup> all-things and in all (things).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>All the-things according-to me Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in (the) Lord, will-make-known to-you, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>whom I-sent to you for this very-thing, in-order-that you-may-know the-things about us and he-may-comfort the hearts of-you, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you. They-will-make-known to-you all the-things here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Aristarchus, the fellow-prisoner of-me, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of-Barnabas (about whom you-received commandments, (that) if he-comes to-you, receive him), <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and Jesus the-one called Justus, the-ones being of (the) circumcision; these (are the) only fellow-workers for the kingdom of-[the] God, who became (an) encouragement to-me. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Epaphras greets you, the-one of you, (a) servant of-Christ [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup>, always striving on-behalf-of you in [the] prayers, in-order-that you-may-stand perfect and full-confident in all the will of-[the] God. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For I-bear-witness to-him that he-has much pain on-behalf-of you and the-ones in Laodicea and the-ones in Hierapolis. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Luke the beloved [the] doctor greets you, and Demas (does too). <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Greet the brothers in Laodicea and Nympha and the church according-to (the) house of-her. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And when the letter is-read with you, make (it) in-order-that also it-is-read in the church of-(the) Laodiceans and the letter from Laodicea in-order-that you also read (it). <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And say to-Archippus, <em>“See-to the ministry that you-received in (the) Lord in-order-that you-fulfill it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So put-on, as chosen-ones of-[the] God, holy and beloved, bowels of-compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, humility, longsuffering, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>being-patient-with one-another and being-gracious to-each-other. If anybody has (a) complaint toward anybody, even-as the Lord was┘also└gracious to-you, so also you (be to one another). <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And above all these-things, (put on) love, which is (the) bond of-[the] perfection, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and let┘the peace of-[the] Christ└be-in-control in the hearts of-you, unto which also you-were-called in one body; and be thankful. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Let┘the word of-[the] Christ└live in you<sup>pl</sup> richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each-other with-psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with-[the]<sup>ms</sup> gratitude in the hearts of-you to-[the] God. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And anything whatever<sup>2</sup> you-do in word or in deed, (do) all-things in (the) name of-(the) Lord Jesus, being-thankful to-[the] God (the) Father through him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>[The] wives, defer to-the/your husbands as is-fitting in (the) Lord. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>[The] husbands, love the/your wives, and do┘not└be-bitter towards them. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>[The] children, obey theyour parents according-to all-things, for this is pleasing in (the) Lord. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>[The] fathers, do┘make└make┘the children of-you└resentful, in-order-that they-may┘not└be-discouraged. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[The] slaves, obey the/your masters according-to (the) flesh according-to all-things, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of-heart, fearing the Lord. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Whatever<sup>2</sup> you-do, from (the) soul work as to-the Lord and not men, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>knowing that from (the) Lord you-will-receive the reward of-the inheritance. Serve the Lord Christ; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>for the-one doing-unjustly will-receive-back what he-unjustly-did, and respect-of-persons is not. <strong>4</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>[The] masters, give the/your slaves the just-thing and [the] fairness, knowing that you also have (a) Master in heaven.</span>
