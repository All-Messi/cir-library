## 2 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And working-together (with him), we┘also└urge you not to-have-received the grace of-[the] God in vain. 2For he-says, Behold, now (is the) 'acceptable time'; now is '(the) day of-salvation'; 3giving no cause-of-offence in anything, in-order-that the ministry may┘not└be-found-fault-with, 4but in everything try-to-commend ourselves as minsters, in all endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings, in imprisonments, in mob-violences, in labors, in sleeplessnesses, in hungers, 6in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in (the/a) holy spirit/Holy Spirit, in love unhypocritical, 7in (the) word of-truth, in (the) power of-God, through the weapons of-[the] righteousness for/in/of-the right (hand) and left (hand), 8through glory and disrespect, through evil-report and good-report, as deceitful and true, 9as known and well-known, as dying and, behold, we-are-alive, as punished and not put-to-death, 10as grieved but always rejoicing, as poor but enriching many, as having nothing and owning all-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The mouth of-us opened to you, Corinthians; the heart of-us has-been-opened-wide. 12You-are┘not└restrained by us, but you-are-restrained by the bowels of-you. 13Now with-respect-to the same response—I-am-speaking as to children—you also open-wide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Do┘not└become unequally-yoked with-disbelievers. For what partnership (is there) to-righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship (is there) to-light with darkness? 15And what harmony (is there) of-Christ with Belial, or what part (is there) to-(a)-believer with (an) disbeliever? 16And what agreement (is) to-(the)-sanctuary of-God with idols? For we are God's living sanctuary, even-as [the] God said [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Wherefore, come-out from (the) midst of-them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And I-will-be to-you [for] (a) Father,</span>
