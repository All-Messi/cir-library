## 2 Corinthians Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And working-together (with him), we<strong>┘</strong>also└urge you not to-have-received the grace of-[the] God in vain. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For he-says, <strong>“At (the/</strong><strong>an( acceptable</strong><strong> time I-listened-to you,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd in/on (the/a) day of-salvation I-helped you.”</strong> Behold, now (is the) ‘acceptable time’; now is ‘(the) day of-salvation’; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>giving no cause-of-offence in anything, in-order-that the ministry may<strong>┘</strong>not└be-found-fault-with, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>but in everything try-to-commend ourselves as minsters, in all endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>in beatings, in imprisonments, in mob-violences, in labors, in sleeplessnesses, in hungers, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in (the/a) holy spirit/Holy Spirit, in love unhypocritical, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>in (the) word of-truth, in (the) power of-God, through the weapons of-[the] righteousness for/in/of-the right (hand) and left (hand), <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>through glory and disrespect, through evil-report and good-report, as deceitful and true, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>as known and well-known, as dying and, behold, we-are-alive, as punished and not put-to-death, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>as grieved but always rejoicing, as poor but enriching many, as having nothing and owning all-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The mouth of-us opened to you, Corinthians; the heart of-us has-been-opened-wide. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>You-are┘not└restrained by us, but you-are-restrained by the bowels of-you. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Now with-respect-to the same response—I-am-speaking as to children—you also open-wide.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Do<strong>┘</strong>not└become unequally-yoked with-disbelievers. For what partnership (is there) to-righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship (is there) to-light with darkness? <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And what harmony (is there) of-Christ with Belial, or what part (is there) to-(a)-believer with (an) disbeliever? <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And what agreement (is) to-(the)-sanctuary of-God with idols? For we are God’s living sanctuary, even-as [the] God said [that], <strong>“</strong><strong>‘</strong><strong>I-will-live among them and walk-among (them),</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd I-will-be (the) God of-them,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd they will-be (the) people of-me.</strong> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	Wherefore, come-out from (the) midst of-them, </strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd be separate,’ </strong>says (the) Lord, <strong>	</strong><strong>	‘A</strong><strong>nd </strong><strong>do┘not└touch</strong><strong> (the) </strong><strong>unclean-thing</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd-I will-welcome you,</strong> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd I-will-be </strong>to-you<strong> [for] (a) Father</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd </strong>you will-be<strong> to me [for] sons </strong>and daughters<strong>,</strong><strong>’</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong>Says (the) Lord Almighty.”</span>
