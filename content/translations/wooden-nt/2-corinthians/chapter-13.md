## 2 Corinthians Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>This (is the) third (time) I-am-coming to you. <strong>“At (the) mouth of-two witnesses and three</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> every matter will-be-</strong> <strong>established.”</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup>I-have-said-before and I-say-in advance as-if being-present the second (time) and being-absent now, to-the-ones having-sinned-previously and to all the others, that if I-come [into the] again, I-will<strong>┘</strong>not└refrain/spare, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>since you-are-looking-for proof of-[the] Christ speaking in me, who is<strong>┘</strong>not└weak toward you, but is-strong in you. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For indeed he-was-crucified out-of weakness, but he-lives by (the) power of-God. For we also are-weak in him, but we-will-live with him by (the) power of-God (directed) at you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Test yourselves whether you-are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do-you<strong>┘</strong>not└know yourselves that Jesus Christ (is) among you? Unless<sup>2</sup><sup> </sup>you-are-failing-to-meet-the-test. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But I hope that you-will-know that we are not failing-to-meet-the-test. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And we-pray to [the] God you not to-do anything evil, not in-order-that we may-appear approved, but in-order-that you may-do the good-thing, [and] even-if we may-be failing-to-meet-the-test. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For we-are-<strong>┘</strong>not└able (to do) anything against the truth, but according-to the truth. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For we-rejoice when we are-weak, and you are strong. We-pray this-thing too: eh perfection of-you. <sup>10</sup>On-account-of this these-things I-write, being-absent, in-order-that, being-present, I-may<strong>┘</strong>not└use severity according-to the authority that the Lord gave me for building-(you)-up and not for tearing-(you)-down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Finally, brothers, rejoice, strive-for-perfection, be-comforted, be-of<strong>┘</strong>the same└mind, be-at-peace, and the God of-[the] love and peace will-be with you. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Greet one-another with (a) holy kiss. All the saints greet you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The grace of-the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of-[the] God and the fellowship of-the Holy Spirit (be) with you all. Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
