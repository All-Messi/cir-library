## 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This (is the) third (time) I-am-coming to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I-have-said-before and I-say-in advance as-if being-present the second (time) and being-absent now, to-the-ones having-sinned-previously and to all the others, that if I-come [into the] again, I-will┘not└refrain/spare, 3since you-are-looking-for proof of-[the] Christ speaking in me, who is┘not└weak toward you, but is-strong in you. 4For indeed he-was-crucified out-of weakness, but he-lives by (the) power of-God. For we also are-weak in him, but we-will-live with him by (the) power of-God (directed) at you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Test yourselves whether you-are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do-you┘not└know yourselves that Jesus Christ (is) among you? Unless2 you-are-failing-to-meet-the-test. 6But I hope that you-will-know that we are not failing-to-meet-the-test. 7And we-pray to [the] God you not to-do anything evil, not in-order-that we may-appear approved, but in-order-that you may-do the good-thing, [and] even-if we may-be failing-to-meet-the-test. 8For we-are-┘not└able (to do) anything against the truth, but according-to the truth. 9For we-rejoice when we are-weak, and you are strong. We-pray this-thing too: eh perfection of-you. 10On-account-of this these-things I-write, being-absent, in-order-that, being-present, I-may┘not└use severity according-to the authority that the Lord gave me for building-(you)-up and not for tearing-(you)-down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Finally, brothers, rejoice, strive-for-perfection, be-comforted, be-of┘the same└mind, be-at-peace, and the God of-[the] love and peace will-be with you. 12Greet one-another with (a) holy kiss. All the saints greet you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> The grace of-the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of-[the] God and the fellowship of-the Holy Spirit (be) with you all.</span>
