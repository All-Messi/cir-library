## 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Are-we-beginning to-commend ourselves again? Or do-we-need, as some, recommending letters to you or from you? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You are the letter of-us, written on the hearts of-us, known and read by all men, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>being-manifested that you-are (a) letter of-Christ, taken-care-of by us, written not with ink, but with-(the)-Spirit of-(the)-living God; not on stone tablets, but on tablets of fleshly hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And such confidence we-have through Christ toward [the] God, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not that we-are sufficient of ourselves to-regard anything as from ourselves, but the sufficiency (is) from [the] God, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>who also made-us sufficient (as) ministers of-(a)-new covenant, not of-(the)-letter, but of-(the)-spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit enlivens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But if the ministry of-[the] death engraved in letters on stones came with glory, so-that the sons of-Israel were<strong>┘</strong>not└able to-look-straight into the face of-Moses on-account-of the glory/brightness of-the face of-him, [the] fading-away, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>how will<strong>┘</strong>the ministry of-the spirit not└be more in glory? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For if glory (is) to-the ministry of-[the]condemnation, more by-much does<strong>┘</strong>the ministry of-righteousness└abound with-glory. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For indeed the-thing having-glory has<strong>┘</strong>not└been-glorified in this [the] case on-account-of the glory surpassing (it). <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For if the fading-away-thing (was) with glory, more by-much the remaining-thing (is) with glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Therefore, having such hope, we use great boldness, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and not as Moses put (a) veil on the face of-him unto the sons of-Israel not looking at the end of-the fading-away-thing. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But the minds of-them were-hardened. For until the present day, at the reading of-the Old Covenant, the same veil remains not lifted, because it-is-removed in Christ. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But until today whenever<sup>2</sup> Moses is-read, (a) veil lies on the heart of-them. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But whenever<sup>2</sup> it-turns to (the) Lord, the veil is-removed. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Now the Lord is the spirit, and where the spirit of-(the)-Lord is, (there is) freedom. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And we all with-unveiled face, seeing-in-(a)-mirror the glory of-(the)-Lord, are-transformed-into the same image from glory to glory as from (the) Lord, (the) spirit.</span>
