## 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Are-we-beginning to-commend ourselves again? Or do-we-need, as some, recommending letters to you or from you? 2You are the letter of-us, written on the hearts of-us, known and read by all men, 3being-manifested that you-are (a) letter of-Christ, taken-care-of by us, written not with ink, but with-(the)-Spirit of-(the)-living God; not on stone tablets, but on tablets of fleshly hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And such confidence we-have through Christ toward [the] God, 5not that we-are sufficient of ourselves to-regard anything as from ourselves, but the sufficiency (is) from [the] God, 6who also made-us sufficient (as) ministers of-(a)-new covenant, not of-(the)-letter, but of-(the)-spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit enlivens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> But if the ministry of-[the] death engraved in letters on stones came with glory, so-that the sons of-Israel were┘not└able to-look-straight into the face of-Moses on-account-of the glory/brightness of-the face of-him, [the] fading-away, 8how will┘the ministry of-the spirit not└be more in glory? 9For if glory (is) to-the ministry of-[the]condemnation, more by-much does┘the ministry of-righteousness└abound with-glory. 10For indeed the-thing having-glory has┘not└been-glorified in this [the] case on-account-of the glory surpassing (it). 11For if the fading-away-thing (was) with glory, more by-much the remaining-thing (is) with glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Therefore, having such hope, we use great boldness, 13and not as Moses put (a) veil on the face of-him unto the sons of-Israel not looking at the end of-the fading-away-thing. 14But the minds of-them were-hardened. For until the present day, at the reading of-the Old Covenant, the same veil remains not lifted, because it-is-removed in Christ. 15But until today whenever2 Moses is-read, (a) veil lies on the heart of-them. 16But whenever2 it-turns to (the) Lord, the veil is-removed. 17Now the Lord is the spirit, and where the spirit of-(the)-Lord is, (there is) freedom. 18And we all with-unveiled face, seeing-in-(a)-mirror the glory of-(the)-Lord, are-transformed-into the same image from glory to glory as from (the) Lord, (the) spirit.</span>
