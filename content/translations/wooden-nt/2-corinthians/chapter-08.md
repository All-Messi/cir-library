## 2 Corinthians Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now I-make-known to-you, brothers, the gracious-gift of-[the] God [the] given in the churches of-[the] Macedonia,<strong><sup> 2</sup></strong> that in (a) great abundance of-affliction the abundance of-the joy of-them and the according-to death poverty of-them abounded to the wealth of-the liberality of-them, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I-testify that according-to ability/power, even beyond (their) ability/power (they gave) of-their-own-accord <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>with much urging begging<strong>┘</strong>us└for the favor and the fellowship of-the ministry [the] to the saints, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and (this) not as we-hoped/expected, but they-gave themselves first to-the Lord and to-us by (the) will of-God <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>unto [the] our urging Titus, [in-order]-that as he-made-(an)-earlier-beginning, so also he-would-complete in you this [the] gracious-gift also. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But as in everything you abound both in word and knowledge and all diligence and the love from us in you [in-order]-that also in this [the] gracious-gift you-might-abound.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I-am<strong>┘</strong>not└speaking according-to command, but proving through the zeal of-others also the sincerity of-[the] your love. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For you-know the grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, that, being rich, he-became-poor on-account-of you in-order-that you might-become-rich by-the poverty of-him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And I-give (an) opinion. For this is-(an)-advantage for-you, who made-(a)-beginning from (a) year ago, not only [the] doing/to-do, but also [the] desiring/to-desire (to do it). <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But now finish also the doing/to-do in-order-that as (there was a) readiness [the] to-desire (it), so also (three may be) the completing out-of [the] having. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For if the readiness is-present, (it is) acceptable as<sup>2</sup> (a) person-has, not as he-does<strong>┘</strong>not└have. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For not in-order-that ease (may be) to-others, affliction to you, but of (an) equality. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>In the present time the abundance of-you (may be) unto the lack of-them, in-order-that also the abundance of-them may-be unto the lack of-you, in-order-that (an) equality may-become. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Just-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“The-one (gathering) much </strong><strong>did</strong><strong>┘not└</strong><strong>have</strong><strong> more,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	A</strong><strong>nd the-one (gathering) the little </strong><strong>did┘not└lack</strong><strong>.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But thanks (be) to-[the] God, the-one having-given the same earnestness for you in the heart of-Titus, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>because he-accepted the appeal, and, being very-earnest, went-out to-you of-his-own-accord. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And we-sent with the/a brother the praise of-whom in the gospel (has spread/is) through all the churches, <sup>19</sup>and not only (that), but also having-been-hand-picked by the churches (as a) traveling-companion of-us with this [the] gracious-gift [the] administered by us to the glory of-the Lord [himself]<sup>ms</sup> and (to show the) eagerness of-us, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>avoiding this-thing: lest anybody should-find-fault-with us in this [the] gracious gift [the] administered by us. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For we-are-taking-care-for good-things, not only before (the) Lord, but also before men. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And we-sent-with them the brother of-us whom we-tested often in many-things to-be/being diligent/earnest, and now much more-diligent/earnest by great confidence [the] in you. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>As/whether for Titus, (he is) my partner and fellow-worker toward/for you; whether/as our brothers, (they are) messengers of-(the)-churches, (they are the/a) glory to/of-Christ. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So show to them, in (the) face of-the churches the proof of-the love of-you and of-(the)- boasting of-us.</span>
