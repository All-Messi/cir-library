## 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I-make-known to-you, brothers, the gracious-gift of-[the] God [the] given in the churches of-[the] Macedonia, 2 that in (a) great abundance of-affliction the abundance of-the joy of-them and the according-to death poverty of-them abounded to the wealth of-the liberality of-them, 3I-testify that according-to ability/power, even beyond (their) ability/power (they gave) of-their-own-accord 4with much urging begging┘us└for the favor and the fellowship of-the ministry [the] to the saints, 5and (this) not as we-hoped/expected, but they-gave themselves first to-the Lord and to-us by (the) will of-God 6unto [the] our urging Titus, [in-order]-that as he-made-(an)-earlier-beginning, so also he-would-complete in you this [the] gracious-gift also. 7But as in everything you abound both in word and knowledge and all diligence and the love from us in you [in-order]-that also in this [the] gracious-gift you-might-abound.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I-am┘not└speaking according-to command, but proving through the zeal of-others also the sincerity of-[the] your love. 9For you-know the grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, that, being rich, he-became-poor on-account-of you in-order-that you might-become-rich by-the poverty of-him. 10And I-give (an) opinion. For this is-(an)-advantage for-you, who made-(a)-beginning from (a) year ago, not only [the] doing/to-do, but also [the] desiring/to-desire (to do it). 11But now finish also the doing/to-do in-order-that as (there was a) readiness [the] to-desire (it), so also (three may be) the completing out-of [the] having. 12For if the readiness is-present, (it is) acceptable as2 (a) person-has, not as he-does┘not└have. 13For not in-order-that ease (may be) to-others, affliction to you, but of (an) equality. 14In the present time the abundance of-you (may be) unto the lack of-them, in-order-that also the abundance of-them may-be unto the lack of-you, in-order-that (an) equality may-become. 15Just-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> But thanks (be) to-[the] God, the-one having-given the same earnestness for you in the heart of-Titus, 17because he-accepted the appeal, and, being very-earnest, went-out to-you of-his-own-accord. 18And we-sent with the/a brother the praise of-whom in the gospel (has spread/is) through all the churches, 19and not only (that), but also having-been-hand-picked by the churches (as a) traveling-companion of-us with this [the] gracious-gift [the] administered by us to the glory of-the Lord [himself]ms and (to show the) eagerness of-us, 20avoiding this-thing: lest anybody should-find-fault-with us in this [the] gracious gift [the] administered by us. 21For we-are-taking-care-for good-things, not only before (the) Lord, but also before men. 22And we-sent-with them the brother of-us whom we-tested often in many-things to-be/being diligent/earnest, and now much more-diligent/earnest by great confidence [the] in you. 23As/whether for Titus, (he is) my partner and fellow-worker toward/for you; whether/as our brothers, (they are) messengers of-(the)-churches, (they are the/a) glory to/of-Christ. 24So show to them, in (the) face of-the churches the proof of-the love of-you and of-(the)- boasting of-us.</span>
