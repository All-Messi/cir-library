## 2 Corinthians Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>On-account-of this, having this [the] ministry even-as we-received-mercy, we-do<strong>┘</strong><strong> </strong>not└become-discouraged; <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>but we-have-renounced the hidden-things of-[the] shame, not walking in trickery or perverting the word of-[the] God, but by-the manifestation of-the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of-men before [the] God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And even if the gospel of-us is veiled, it-is veiled in the-ones perishing, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>in whom the god of-this [the] world blinded the minds of-the disbelieving-ones unto [the] the light of-the gospel of-the glory of-[the] Christ, who is (the) image of-God, not enlightening them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>We do<strong>┘</strong>not└preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and (ourselves) as your servants on-account-of Jesus, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>because [the] God the-One having-said, “Out-of darkness light will-shine,” (is) who will-shine in the hearts of-us to (the) enlightenment of-the knowledge of-the glory of-[the] God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So (we are) always being-courageous and knowing that, being-at-home in the body, we-are-away-from-home from the Lord. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For we walk by faith, not by sight; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and we-are-confident and prefer/pleased instead to-be-absent from the body and present with the Lord. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Wherefore also we-aim, whether present or absent, to-be pleasing to-him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For it-is-necessary for-us [the] all to-appear before the judgment-seat of-[the] Christ in-order-that each may-be-paid for the-things that he-did through the body, whether good or bad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now we-have this [the] treasure in clay pots, in-order-that the surpassing-nature/quality of-the power may-be of-[the] God and not from us. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>In every (way we are) afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, <sup>9</sup>persecuted but not abandoned/forsaken, struck-down but not destroyed, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>always carrying-around in the body the death/deathness of-[the] Jesus, in-order-that the life also of-[the] Jesus might-be-made-manifest in the body of us. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For the living-ones are<strong>┘</strong>always└being-delivered to death on-account-of Jesus in-order-that the life also of-[the] Jesus might-be-made-manifest in the mortal flesh of-us. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So [the] death is-at-work in us, but [the] life (is at work) in you. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But having the same spirit of-[the] faith according-to the written-thing, <strong>“I-believed; therefore I-spoke”</strong>; and we ‘believe’ therefore we<strong>┘</strong>also└‘speak,’ <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>knowing that the-One having-raised the Lord Jesus will<strong>┘</strong>also└raise us with Jesus and will-present us with you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For [the] all-things (are) account-of you, in-order-that [the] grace, having-spread through [the] more-(people), will-increase [the] thanksgiving to the glory of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So knowing the fear of-the Lord, we-persuade men; but we-have-been-made-manifest to-God, and I-hope (us) to-be-made-manifest in the consciences of-you also. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>We-are<strong>┘</strong><strong> </strong>not└commending ourselves again to-you, but giving you (an) occasion of-pride for us, in-order-that you-may-have (a response) to the-ones taking-pride in face and not in heart. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For whether we-are-beside-ourselves, (it is) to-God; whether we-are-of-sound-mind, (it is) to-you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For the love of-[the] Christ controls us, having-concluded this, that one died for all, so the all died. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And for all he-died in-order-that the living might┘no-longer└live to-themselves, but to-the-One having-died for them and resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So from the now we know nobody according-to (the) flesh. And if we-have-known Christ according-to (the) flesh, [but] we<strong>┘</strong>now└know (him) no-longer. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So if anybody (is) in Christ, he (is a) new creation/creature. The old-things passed-away; behold, they-have-become new. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And all-[the] things (are) from [the] God the-One having-reconciled us to-himself through Christ and having-given us the ministry of-[the] reconciliation; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>namely/as, that in Christ, God was-reconciling (the) world to-himself, not counting the trespasses of-them to/against-them and having-placed in us the message/word of-[the] reconciliation. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>So on-behalf-of Christ we-are-ambassadors, as-if [the] God entreating through us. We-beg (you) on-behalf-of Christ, be-reconciled to-[the] God. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He-made the-One not knowing sin (to be) sin on-behalf-of us, in-order-that we might-become (the) righteousness of-God in him.</span>
