## 2 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On-account-of this, having this [the] ministry even-as we-received-mercy, we-do┘ not└become-discouraged; 2but we-have-renounced the hidden-things of-[the] shame, not walking in trickery or perverting the word of-[the] God, but by-the manifestation of-the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of-men before [the] God. 3And even if the gospel of-us is veiled, it-is veiled in the-ones perishing, 4in whom the god of-this [the] world blinded the minds of-the disbelieving-ones unto [the] the light of-the gospel of-the glory of-[the] Christ, who is (the) image of-God, not enlightening them. 5We do┘not└preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and (ourselves) as your servants on-account-of Jesus, 6because [the] God the-One having-said, "Out-of darkness light will-shine," (is) who will-shine in the hearts of-us to (the) enlightenment of-the knowledge of-the glory of-[the] God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Now we-have this [the] treasure in clay pots, in-order-that the surpassing-nature/quality of-the power may-be of-[the] God and not from us. 8In every (way we are) afflicted but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, 9persecuted but not abandoned/forsaken, struck-down but not destroyed, 10always carrying-around in the body the death/deathness of-[the] Jesus, in-order-that the life also of-[the] Jesus might-be-made-manifest in the body of us. 11For the living-ones are┘always└being-delivered to death on-account-of Jesus in-order-that the life also of-[the] Jesus might-be-made-manifest in the mortal flesh of-us. 12So [the] death is-at-work in us, but [the] life (is at work) in you. 13But having the same spirit of-[the] faith according-to the written-thing, "I-believed; therefore I-spoke"; and we 'believe' therefore we┘also└'speak,' 14knowing that the-One having-raised the Lord Jesus will┘also└raise us with Jesus and will-present us with you. 15For [the] all-things (are) account-of you, in-order-that [the] grace, having-spread through [the] more-(people), will-increase [the] thanksgiving to the glory of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Wherefore we-do┘not└get-discouraged. Though the outward man of-us wears-out, [but] the inner man of-us is-being-renewed day-by-day3. 17For the temporary insignificance of-the affliction of-us is-producing for-us (an) eternal weight/fullness of-glory according-to (the) surpassing-quality to-surpassing-quality, 18we not looking-at the seen-things, but the not seen-things, for the seen-things (are) temporary, but the not seen-things (are) eternal.</span>
