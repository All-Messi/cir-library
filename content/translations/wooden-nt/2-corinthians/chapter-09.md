## 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For about the ministry [the] to the saints it-is unnecessary for-me to-write to-you. 2For I-know the commitment/eagerness/willingness of-you which I-boast to-(the)-Macedonia about you, that Achaia has-been-prepared from (a) year-ago and the zeal of-you aroused/stirred-up the very-many (of then). 3But I-sent the brothers, in-order-that the boasting of-us [the] about you would┘note└be-empty in this matter, in-order-that, as I-was-saying, you may be prepared/ready, 4lest somehow if Macedonia come with me and find you not-ready/unprepared, we would-be-embarrassed/ashamed, (in-order-that I-may┘not└say) by thie [the] confidence. 5So I-considered (it) necessary to-urge the brothers in-order-that they-would-go-on-ahead to you and prepare-in-advance-of-time the previously-promised blessing of-you, this to-be ready thus as (a) blessing and not as something-pressured-to-be done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now this, the-one sowing sparingly will┘also└reap sparingly, and the-one sowing with with blessings will┘also└reap with blessings. 7(Let) each (do) even-as he-has-decided with-the heart, not out-of sorrow/reluctantly or out-of necessity, for [the] God loves (a) cheerful giver. 8But [the] God is-able to-make-abound all grace to you, in-order-that you-may-abound unto every good work having always in everything all what-is-necessary/sufficiency, 9even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Now the-One supplying seed to-the sower and bread for food will-supply and multiply the seed of-you and will-increase the harvest of-the righteousness of-you, 11being-enriched in everything to all generosity, which is-producing through us thanksgiving to-[the] God; 12because the ministry of-this [the] service, not only fully-supplies the needs of-the saints, but also overflows through many thanksgivings to-[the] God. 13Through the proof of-this [the] ministry glorifying [the] God over the obedience of-the confession of-you to/for the gospel of-[the] Christ and (the) generosity of-the contribution/fellowship to them and to all, 14also they, by-prayer for you, yearning-for you on-account-of the surpassing grace of-[the] God on you. 15Thank God for the indescribable gift of-him!</span>
