## 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now I, Paul myself urge you by/through the meekness and gentleness of-[the] Christ, who according-to face (was) meek among you, but bold toward you, being-absent, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I-ask (that) [the] not, being-present, to be-bold with-the confidence by-which I-reckon to-be-brave against some the-ones reckoning us as walking according-to (the) flesh. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For walking in (the) flesh, we-do<strong>┘</strong>not└do-war/battle according-to (the) flesh. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For the weapons of-the warfare of-us (are) not fleshly, but powerful before/to-[the] God unto (the) destruction of-strongholds/fortresses destroying speculations <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and every stronghold/fortress raised-up against the knowledge of-[the] God and taking<strong>┘</strong>every thought└captive to the obedience of [the] Christ, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and having in readiness to-punish every disobedience, when the obedience of-you is-fulfilled/complete.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>You-are-looking-at the-thing according-to face/appearance. If anybody is-confident in-himself (that) him to-be of-Christ, let-him-consider this again in/about himself that as he-himself (is) of-Christ, so also (are) we. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For even if I-should-boast something more-abundant about the authority of-us, which the Lord gave unto edification and not unto tearing-down of-you, I-will <strong>┘</strong>not└be-put-to-shame/disregarded, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>in-order-that I-might<strong>┘</strong>not└seem as-if<sup>2</sup> to-terrify you by [the] letters, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>because, “The letters,” they-say, “(are) heavy and strong, but the presence of-the body (of him is) weak and the speech (of him is) looked-down-on.” <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Let<strong>┘</strong>[the] such-a-person<strong> </strong>└reckon this that what-sort we-are by-[the] word through letters, being-absent, such also (we are/can be) in deed, being present.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For we-are<strong>┘</strong>not└bold to-classify or compare ourselves to-some of-the-ones commending themselves, but themselves measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with/to-themselves do<strong>┘</strong>not└understand. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But we will<strong>┘</strong>not└boast to/about [the] immeasurable-things, but according-to the measure/sphere/limits that [the] God appointed to-us as-a-measure to-reach even to you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For we are<strong>┘</strong>not└overextending to you as-if not extending to, for we-reached even unto you in the gospel of-[the] Christ. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>We don’t boast into the beyond-measure things labors, but, having hope of-the growing faith of-you to-be-held-in-high-honor by you unto more, according-to the sphere/area of-us, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>to-preach-the gospel in the places-beyond you, not to boast in the prepared-thing in another-person’s sphere/area. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But, <strong>“</strong><strong>Let┘the-one</strong><strong> </strong><strong>boasting└boast</strong><strong> in (the) Lord.”</strong> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For not the-one commending himself—that-one is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span>
