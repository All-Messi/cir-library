## 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I, Paul myself urge you by/through the meekness and gentleness of-[the] Christ, who according-to face (was) meek among you, but bold toward you, being-absent, 2I-ask (that) [the] not, being-present, to be-bold with-the confidence by-which I-reckon to-be-brave against some the-ones reckoning us as walking according-to (the) flesh. 3For walking in (the) flesh, we-do┘not└do-war/battle according-to (the) flesh. 4For the weapons of-the warfare of-us (are) not fleshly, but powerful before/to-[the] God unto (the) destruction of-strongholds/fortresses destroying speculations 5and every stronghold/fortress raised-up against the knowledge of-[the] God and taking┘every thought└captive to the obedience of [the] Christ, 6and having in readiness to-punish every disobedience, when the obedience of-you is-fulfilled/complete.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You-are-looking-at the-thing according-to face/appearance. If anybody is-confident in-himself (that) him to-be of-Christ, let-him-consider this again in/about himself that as he-himself (is) of-Christ, so also (are) we. 8For even if I-should-boast something more-abundant about the authority of-us, which the Lord gave unto edification and not unto tearing-down of-you, I-will ┘not└be-put-to-shame/disregarded, 9in-order-that I-might┘not└seem as-if2 to-terrify you by [the] letters, 10because, "The letters," they-say, "(are) heavy and strong, but the presence of-the body (of him is) weak and the speech (of him is) looked-down-on." 11Let┘[the] such-a-person └reckon this that what-sort we-are by-[the] word through letters, being-absent, such also (we are/can be) in deed, being present.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> For we-are┘not└bold to-classify or compare ourselves to-some of-the-ones commending themselves, but themselves measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with/to-themselves do┘not└understand. 13But we will┘not└boast to/about [the] immeasurable-things, but according-to the measure/sphere/limits that [the] God appointed to-us as-a-measure to-reach even to you. 14For we are┘not└overextending to you as-if not extending to, for we-reached even unto you in the gospel of-[the] Christ. 15We don't boast into the beyond-measure things labors, but, having hope of-the growing faith of-you to-be-held-in-high-honor by you unto more, according-to the sphere/area of-us, 16to-preach-the gospel in the places-beyond you, not to boast in the prepared-thing in another-person's sphere/area. 17But, "Let┘the-one boasting└boast in (the) Lord." 18For not the-one commending himself—that-one is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span>
