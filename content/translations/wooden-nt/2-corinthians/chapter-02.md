## 2 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For I-determined this for-myself: [the] not to come to you again in sorrow. 2For if I make┘you└sorrowful, then who (is) the-one cheering ┘me└up except2 the-ones made-sorrowful by me? 3And I-wrote this very-thing in-order-that, having come, I-might┘not└have sorrow from whom it-is-necessary to-make┘me└rejoice, confident in you all that [the] my joy would-be (the joy) of-all of-you. 4For out-of much affliction and anxiety of-heart, I-wrote to-you through many tears, not in-order-that you-might-be-made-sorrowful, but in-order-that you-might-know the love that I-have abundantly for you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And if anybody has-caused-sorrow, he-has┘not└made┘me└sorrowful, but in part—in-order-that I-might┘not└exaggerate—all of-you. 6Sufficient for-[the] such-(a one is) this [the] punishment [the] by the more/majority; 7so-that on-the contrary rather, you should-forgive and comfort (him), lest in-some-way [the] such-(a-one) be swallowed-up with/by [the] excessive sorrow. 8Wherefore I-urge you to-prove (your) love for him. 9For this too I-wrote, in-order-that I-may-know the proof of-you, whether you-are obedient in all-things. 10Now to-whom you-forgive anything, I-also (forgive); for what I have┘also└forgiven—if I-have-forgiven anything—(I did it) on-account-of you in the presence of Christ, 11in-order-that we-might┘not└be-taken-advantage-of by [the] Satan, for we-are┘not└ignorant-of the schemes of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Now having-come to [the] Troas for the gospel of [the] Christ and (a) door having-been-opened-up to-me in (the) Lord, 13I-have┘not└had rest for-the spirit of-me, in [the] not finding Titus, the brother of-me; but, leaving them, I-went-away into Macedonia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> But thanks (be) to-[the] God the-One always causing ┘us└to-triumph in [the] Christ and manifesting through us the sweet aroma of-the knowledge of-him in every place 15because we-are [the]/(a) fragrant-aroma of-Christ to-[the] God among the-ones being-saved and among the-ones perishing, 16to-one (set we are an) smell of-death to death, and to-the-other (set we are an) aroma of-life to life. And for these-things who (is) sufficient? 17For we-are not like the many, peddling┘ the word of [the] God└for profit, but as out-of sincerity, [but] as from God we-speak in Christ in-the-sight-of God.</span>
