## 2 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God, and Timothy the brother, to-the church of-[the]-God [the] being in Corinth with all the saints [the] being in all Achaia. 2Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed (be) the God and Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, the Father of-[the] mercies and God of-all comfort, 4the-One comforting us over every [the] trouble of-us unto our being-able to comfort the-ones in every trouble through the comfort that we ourselves are-comforted-with by [the] God. 5Because just-as the sufferings of-[the] Christ abound to us, so through Christ also the comfort of-us abounds. 6And if we-are-afflicted, (it is) on-behalf-of the comfort and salvation of-you. And if we-are-comforted (it is) on-behalf-of the comfort [the] of-you the-one working in endurance of-the same sufferings that we also suffer. 7And the hope of-us (is) firm on-behalf-of you, knowing that as you-are sharers of-the suffering (of us), so also (you are sharers) of-the comfort (of us).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> For we-do┘not└want you to-be-unaware, brothers, on-behalf-of the tribulation of-us [the-one] having happened in [the] Asia, that according-to excess we-were-burdened beyond (our) power/ability so-that we despaired even of-[the] living. 9Indeed, we┘ourselves└have-had the sentence of-[the] death in ourselves, in-order-that we-might┘not└be boasting over ourselves, but over [the] God the-One raising the dead, 10who delivered us out-of such great (danger of) death and will-deliver (us), on whom we-have-placed-our-hope that he-will ┘also still└keep-delivering us, 11you also joining-work for us with [the] prayer, in-order-that thanks-may-be-given on-behalf-of us by many persons for-the grace (shown) to us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> For the pride of-us is this, the testimony of-the conscience of-us, that in holiness and sincerity of-[the] God [and]ms, not in fleshly wisdom, but in (the) grace of-God, we-have-conducted-ourselves in the world, especially toward you. 13For indeed we-do┘not└write other things to-you than what you-read and2 understand. And I-hope that you-will-understand to (the) end/completely. 14Even-as also you understood us in part, that we-are (the) pride of-you even-as also you (are the pride) of-us in the day of-the Lord [of-us]ms Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And with-this [the] confidence I-intended/planned at-first to-come to you, in-order-that you-might-have (a) second grace, 16and to-pass through you into Macedonia and to-come back from Macedonia to you and to-be-sent-forward by you into [the] Judaea. 17So, intending this, I-did┘not┘┘ └use [the] vacillation, └└did-I? Or what-things I-intend/purpose/plan do-I purpose according-to (the) flesh, in-order-that with me (is) [the] "Yes, yes" and [the] "No, no"? 18But [the] God (is) faithful, because the word of-us [the] to you is not "No" and "Yes." 19For the Son of-[the] God, Christ Jesus, the-One preached by us among you—through me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not "Yes" and "No"; but "Yes" has-been in him. 20For as-many┘promises of-God└as (may be), in him (is) [the] "Yes." Wherefore also through him (is) the Amen to-[the] God unto glory through us. 21But God (is) the-One establishing┘us└firm and having-anointed us along-with you in Christ, 22the-One also having-sealed us and given the pledge of-the Spirit in the hearts of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But I-call [the] God (as my) witness to [the] my soul, that sparing you I┘no-longer└came to Corinth. 24Not that we-lord-(it)-over the faith of-you, but we-are fellow-workers of-the joy of-you; for in-respect-to [the] faith (of you), you-stand-firm.</span>
