## 2 Corinthians Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul, apostle of-Christ Jesus by (the) will of-God, and Timothy the brother, to-the church of-[the]-God [the] being in Corinth with all the saints [the] being in all Achaia. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Blessed (be) the God and Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, the Father of-[the] mercies and God of-all comfort, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>the-One comforting us over every [the] trouble of-us unto our being-able to comfort the-ones in every trouble through the comfort that we ourselves are-comforted-with by [the] God. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Because just-as the sufferings of-[the] Christ abound to us, so through Christ also the comfort of-us abounds. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And if we-are-afflicted, (it is) on-behalf-of the comfort and salvation of-you. And if we-are-comforted (it is) on-behalf-of the comfort [the] of-you the-one working in endurance of-the same sufferings that we also suffer. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the hope of-us (is) firm on-behalf-of you, knowing that as you-are sharers of-the suffering (of us), so also (you are sharers) of-the comfort (of us).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And if anybody has-caused-sorrow, he-has<strong>┘</strong>not└made<strong>┘</strong>me└sorrowful, but in part—in-order-that I-might<strong>┘</strong>not└exaggerate—all of-you. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Sufficient for-[the] such-(a one is) this [the] punishment [the] by the more/majority; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>so-that on-the contrary rather, you should-forgive and comfort (him), lest in-some-way [the] such-(a-one) be swallowed-up with/by [the] excessive sorrow. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Wherefore I-urge you to-prove (your) love for him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For this too I-wrote, in-order-that I-may-know the proof of-you, whether you-are obedient in all-things. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Now to-whom you-forgive anything, I-also (forgive); for what I have<strong>┘</strong>also└forgiven—if I-have-forgiven anything—(I did it) on-account-of you in the presence of Christ, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>in-order-that we-might<strong>┘</strong>not└be-taken-advantage-of by [the] Satan, for we-are<strong>┘</strong>not└ignorant-of the schemes of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For we-do<strong>┘</strong>not└want you to-be-unaware, brothers, on-behalf-of the tribulation of-us [the-one] having happened in [the] Asia, that according-to excess we-were-burdened beyond (our) power/ability so-that we despaired even of-[the] living. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Indeed, we┘ourselves└have-had the sentence of-[the] death in ourselves, in-order-that we-might┘not└be boasting over ourselves, but over [the] God the-One raising the dead, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>who delivered us out-of such great (danger of) death and will-deliver (us), on whom we-have-placed-our-hope that he-will <strong>┘</strong>also still└keep-delivering us, <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>you also joining-work for us with [the] prayer, in-order-that thanks-may-be-given on-behalf-of us by many persons for-the grace (shown) to us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Now having-come to [the] Troas for the gospel of [the] Christ and (a) door having-been-opened-up to-me in (the) Lord, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I-have<strong>┘</strong>not└had rest for-the spirit of-me, in [the] not finding Titus, the brother of-me; but, leaving them, I-went-away into Macedonia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But thanks (be) to-[the] God the-One always causing <strong>┘</strong>us└to-triumph in [the] Christ and manifesting through us the sweet aroma of-the knowledge of-him in every place <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>because we-are [the]/(a) fragrant-aroma of-Christ to-[the] God among the-ones being-saved and among the-ones perishing, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>to-one (set we are an) smell of-death to death, and to-the-other (set we are an) aroma of-life to life. And for these-things who (is) sufficient? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For we-are not like the many, peddling<strong>┘</strong><strong> </strong>the word of [the] God└for profit, but as out-of sincerity, [but] as from God we-speak in Christ in-the-sight-of God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And with-this [the] confidence I-intended/planned at-first to-come to you, in-order-that you-might-have (a) second grace, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and to-pass through you into Macedonia and to-come back from Macedonia to you and to-be-sent-forward by you into [the] Judaea. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So, intending this, I-did<strong>┘</strong>not<sup>┘┘</sup><strong> </strong>└use [the] vacillation, <sup>└└</sup>did-I?<strong> </strong>Or what-things I-intend/purpose/plan do-I purpose according-to (the) flesh, in-order-that with me (is) [the] “Yes, yes” and [the] “No, no”? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But [the] God (is) faithful, because the word of-us [the] to you is not “No” and “Yes.” <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For the Son of-[the] God, Christ Jesus, the-One preached by us among you—through me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No”; but “Yes” has-been in him. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For as-many<strong>┘</strong>promises of-God└as (may be), in him (is) [the] “Yes.” Wherefore also through him (is) the Amen to-[the] God unto glory through us. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But God (is) the-One establishing<strong>┘</strong>us└firm and having-anointed us along-with you in Christ, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>the-One also having-sealed us and given the pledge of-the Spirit in the hearts of-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But I-call [the] God (as my) witness to [the] my soul, that sparing you I<strong>┘</strong>no-longer└came to Corinth. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Not that we-lord-(it)-over the faith of-you, but we-are fellow-workers of-the joy of-you; for in-respect-to [the] faith (of you), you-stand-firm. <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>For I-determined this for-myself: [the] not to come to you again in sorrow. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For if I make<strong>┘</strong>you└sorrowful, then who (is) the-one cheering <strong>┘</strong>me└up except<sup>2</sup> the-ones made-sorrowful by me? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And I-wrote this very-thing in-order-that, having come, I-might<strong>┘</strong>not└have sorrow from whom it-is-necessary to-make<strong>┘</strong>me└rejoice, confident in you all that [the] my joy would-be (the joy) of-all of-you. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For out-of much affliction and anxiety of-heart, I-wrote to-you through many tears, not in-order-that you-might-be-made-sorrowful, but in-order-that you-might-know the love that I-have abundantly for you.</span>
