## 2 Corinthians Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So having these [the] promises, beloved, let-us-cleanse ourselves from all defilement of-flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in (the) fear of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Make-room-for us; we-wronged nobody; we-corrupted nobody; we-took-advantage-of nobody. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I-do<strong>┘</strong>not└speak to (you) condemnation; for I-said-before that you-are in the hearts of-us unto [the] dying-together and living-together. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Great to-me (is the) confidence/boldness in/toward you; great to-me (is) my boasting on-behalf-of you; I-have-been-filled with-[the] comfort; I-am-overflowing with-[the] joy in all the affliction of us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For even we coming into Macedonia, the flesh of-us had no rest, but (we were) being-afflicted on every (side)—conflicts outside and fears inside. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But [the] God, the-One comforting the downhearted, comforted us by/in the coming of-Titus, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and not only by the coming of-him, but also by the comfort with-which he-was-comforted over you, reporting to-us the longing of-you, the grieving of-you, the zeal of-you for me so-that I rejoiced more, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>because even if/though<sup>2</sup> I-grieved you in the epistle, I-do<strong>┘</strong>not└regret (it), even if/though<sup>2</sup> I-was-regretting—[for]<sup>ms</sup> I-see that that [the] epistle even if/though<sup>2</sup> for (a) while it-grieved you—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>now I-rejoice, not because you-were-grieved, but because you-were-grieved to repentance. For you-were-grieved according-to God, in-order-that in nothing did-you-suffer-loss out-of us. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For [the] grief according-to God produces repentance unto salvation without-regret. But the grief of-the world produces death. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For behold, what/all earnestness this very-thing, [the] grieving according-to God, has-produced in you, what/but defense, what/but indignation, what/but fear, what/but longing, what/but zeal, what/but avenging-of-wrong. In everything you-showed yourselves to-be innocent in-the matter. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So even if/though<sup>2</sup> I-wrote to-you (it was) not for-the-sake of-the offending-one neither for-the sake of-the offended, but for-the-sake-of the earnestness of-you [the] on-behalf-of us [the] to-be-made-manifest to you before [the] God. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>On-account-of this we-have-been-comforted. And besides the comfort of-us, we-rejoiced more exceedingly over the joy of-Titus, because the spirit of-him has-been-refreshed by all of-you; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>because if in-respect-to-anything I-have-boasted to-him in you, I-was<strong>┘</strong>not└embarrassed/ashamed, but as we-spoke all-things to-you in truth, so also the boasting of-us [the] to Titus proved-to-be true. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And the afflictions of-him are more-greatly abundant toward you, as (his) remembering the obedience of-you all, as you-received him with fear and trembling. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I-rejoice that in everything I-have-confidence in you.</span>
