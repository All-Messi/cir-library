## 2 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For we-know that if the earthly house of-us, the tent/tabernacle, is-destroyed, we-have (a) building from God, (a) house not-made-with-hands, eternal in the heavens. 2For in this building we-groan, desiring to-be-dressed-with the building of-us [the] from heaven, 3if indeed also, having-been-dressed, we-will┘not└be-found naked. 4For also we┘the-ones being in the tabernacle/tent└do–groan, being-burdened because we-do┘not└desire to-be-undressed, but to-be-fully-dressed in-order-that the mortal may-be-swallowed-up by [the] life. 5And the-One having-prepared us for this very-thing (is) God, the-One having given us the pledge of-the Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So (we are) always being-courageous and knowing that, being-at-home in the body, we-are-away-from-home from the Lord. 7For we walk by faith, not by sight; 8and we-are-confident and prefer/pleased instead to-be-absent from the body and present with the Lord. 9Wherefore also we-aim, whether present or absent, to-be pleasing to-him. 10For it-is-necessary for-us [the] all to-appear before the judgment-seat of-[the] Christ in-order-that each may-be-paid for the-things that he-did through the body, whether good or bad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So knowing the fear of-the Lord, we-persuade men; but we-have-been-made-manifest to-God, and I-hope (us) to-be-made-manifest in the consciences of-you also. 12We-are┘ not└commending ourselves again to-you, but giving you (an) occasion of-pride for us, in-order-that you-may-have (a response) to the-ones taking-pride in face and not in heart. 13For whether we-are-beside-ourselves, (it is) to-God; whether we-are-of-sound-mind, (it is) to-you. 14For the love of-[the] Christ controls us, having-concluded this, that one died for all, so the all died. 15And for all he-died in-order-that the living might┘no-longer└live to-themselves, but to-the-One having-died for them and resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So from the now we know nobody according-to (the) flesh. And if we-have-known Christ according-to (the) flesh, [but] we┘now└know (him) no-longer. 17So if anybody (is) in Christ, he (is a) new creation/creature. The old-things passed-away; behold, they-have-become new. 18And all-[the] things (are) from [the] God the-One having-reconciled us to-himself through Christ and having-given us the ministry of-[the] reconciliation; 19namely/as, that in Christ, God was-reconciling (the) world to-himself, not counting the trespasses of-them to/against-them and having-placed in us the message/word of-[the] reconciliation. 20So on-behalf-of Christ we-are-ambassadors, as-if [the] God entreating through us. We-beg (you) on-behalf-of Christ, be-reconciled to-[the] God. 21He-made the-One not knowing sin (to be) sin on-behalf-of us, in-order-that we might-become (the) righteousness of-God in him.</span>
