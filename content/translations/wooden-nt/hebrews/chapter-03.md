## Hebrews Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wherefore, holy brothers, partakes of-(a)-heavenly calling, consider-carefully the Apostles and High Priest of-the confession of-us-Jesus, 2being faithful to-the-One having-appointed him as also Moses (was) in the whole house of-him.  3This-One was-made-worthy of-more glory than Moses, according as the-one having-prepared the/a house has more honor than the house.  4For every house is-built by somebody, but the-One having-built all-things is God.  5And Moses (was) faithful in the whole house of-him as (a) servant for (a) witness of-the-things going-to-be spoken; 6but Christ (was) (faithful) as (a) Son over the house of-him, whose house we are if we-hold-fast the boldness and the pride of-[the] hope.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Wherefore, even-as the Holy [the] Spirit says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As I-swore in the wrath of-me,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Beware, brothers, lest-at-any-time (an) evil heart of-disbelief will-be in any of-you in [the] falling-away from (the/a) living God.  13But encourage each-other according-to each day, as-long-as2 it-is-called 'Today,' in-order-that not anybody of you be-hardened by-(the)-deceitfulness of-[the] sin—14for we-have-become partakers of-[the] Christ, if we-hold-fast the beginning of-confidence firm until (the) end—15in the being-said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> For who, having-heard, provoked (him)?  [But] (was it) not all the-ones coming-out from Egypt through Moses?  17And with-whom was-he-'displeased for-forty-years'?  (Was  it) not with-the-ones the corpses of-whom fell in the desert?  18And to-whom did-he-'swear (them) not to-enter into the rest of-him' except2 with they-were┘not└able to-enter on-account-of disbelief/distrust.</span>
