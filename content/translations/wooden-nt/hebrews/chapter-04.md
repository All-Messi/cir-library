## Hebrews Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So let-us-fear, lest-at-any-time (a) promise being-left-behind to-enter into the rest of-him, anybody of you would-seem to-fall-short-(of it).  2For we┘also└have-been-given-good-news even-as those-also.  But the word of-[the] hearing did┘not└profit those not having/been/heard.  3For we┘also└do-enter into [the]ms rest, even-as he-has-said, —although the works having-been-brought-into-being from (the) foundation of-(the)-world.  4For he-has-said in-a-certain-place concerning the seventh (day) thus,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then when it-is-being-left-behind for-some to-enter into it, and the-ones formerly evangelized did┘not└enter on-account-of disbelief, 7again-he-designates another day, 'Today,' in David speaking after such-a-long time, as it-has-been-said-before,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> For if Joshua gave┘them└rest, he-would not be-speaking concerning another day after these-things.  9Therefore (a) rest remains for-the people of-[the] God.  10For the-one having-entered into the rest of-him also himself rested from the works of-him even-as [the] God (did) from his-own (works).  11Therefore let-us-be-diligent to-enter into that [the] rest, in-order-that anybody might┘not└fall in the same example of-[the] disbelief.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> For the word of-[the] God (is) living and active and sharper than every two-edged sword and going-all-the-way-through to (the) separation of-soul and spirit, both of-joints and marrow, and able-to-judge (the) innermost-thoughts and intents of-the heart.  13And no created-being is unmanifest before him, but all-things (are) naked and laid-bare to-the eyes of-him with whom the word/matter (is) to-us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Therefore having (a) great high-priests having-passed-through the heavens, Jesus the son of-[the] God, let-us-hold-onto the confession.  15For we-do┘not└have (a) high-priest unable to-sympathize-with the infirmities of-us, but One-tried according-to likeness/likewise according-to all-things without sin.  16So let-us-come┘with boldnesses└to the throne of-[the] grace in-order-that we-may-receive mercy and may-find grace unto timely help.</span>
