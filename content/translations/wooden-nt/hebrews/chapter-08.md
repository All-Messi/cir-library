## Hebrews Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now (the) chief-thing in the-things being-said:  we-have such (a) high-priest that sat-down on (the) right-(hand) of-the throne of-the Majesty in the heavens, 2(a) minister of-the saints/holy-things and of the true [the] tabernacle that the Lord pitched, not man.  3For every high-priest is-appointed for [the] offering both gifts and sacrifices.  Wherefore (it was) necessary also for-this-One to-have something to-offer.  4So if he-were on earth, he┘would not-even└be (a) priest, ones-being [the] offering [the] gifts according-to (the) Law; 5who serve (an) imitation/copy and shadow of-[the] heavenly-things.  for he-says, "See (that) you-will-make all-things according-to the form [the] shown to-you on the mountain."  6But now he-has-obtained (a) ministry more-superior by-so-much-as he-is also (the) mediator of-(a)-better covenant, that has-been-enacted on better promises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> For if [the] that first (covenant) were faultless, (a) place would not have-been-sought-for (a) second (covenant).  8For finding fault, he-tells them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And they-will┘certainly not└teach each the fellow-citizen of-him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> In [the] saying 'New' he-has-made┘the first (covenant)└old.  And the-thing getting-old and aging (is) near disappearing.</span>
