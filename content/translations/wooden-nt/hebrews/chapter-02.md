## Hebrews Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On-account-of this it-is-necessary for-us to-heed more-earnestly the-things heard, lest-at-any-time we-drift-away (from them).  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For if the word spoken through angels became firm and every transgressions and refusal-to-listen received (a) deserved recompense, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>how will┘we└escape having-neglected such-a-great salvation that at-the first, having-received to-be-spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by the-ones having-heard,<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>God bearing-witness-with (them) both by-signs and by-wonders and mighty powers and dispensations of-(the) Holy Spirit according-to the will of-him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> For not to-angels did-he-subject the intended [the] world, concerning which we-are-speaking.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But (a) certain-one in-a-certain-place testified, saying, 	<strong><em>“What is man that you-remember him,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>o</em></strong><strong><em>r the son of-man that you-visit him?</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> <strong><em>You-made</em></strong><strong><em>┘him</em></strong><strong><em> for-a-little </em></strong><strong><em>while└lower</em></strong><strong><em> than </em></strong><strong><em>angels;</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>y</em></strong><strong><em>ou-crowned him with-glory and with-honor,</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> <strong><em>and subjected all-things under the feet of-him.”</em></strong> For in the ‘subjecting [the] all things,’ he-left nothing ‘unsubjected’ to-him.  But now we-do┘not-yet└see [the] all-things subjected to-him.’  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But ‘for-the little while made-lower than angels’ we-do-see Jesus on-account-of the suffering of-[the] death ‘crowned with-glory and with-honor’ in-order-that he-might-taste of-death on-behalf-of every-(man).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> For it-was-fitting for-him, on-account-of whom (are) all-the-things and through whom (are) all the-things, having-brought many sons into glory, to-make┘the author/leader of-the salvation of-them└perfect through sufferings.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For both the Sanctifier and the sanctified (are) all of one (nature).  On-account-of which reason, he-is┘not└ashamed to-call them brothers, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>saying, 	<strong><em>“I-will-report the na</em></strong><strong><em>me of-you to-the brothers of-</em></strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>i</em></strong><strong><em>n-the-report of-(the)-congregation I-will-sing-praise-to you</em></strong><strong><em>”;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> and again, 	<strong><em>“I will certainly-trust in him</em></strong><strong><em>”;</em></strong> and 	<strong><em>“Behold, I and the children that [the] God gave me.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sinice then ‘the children’ have-shared blood and flesh, he also likewise partook of-the same-things, in-order-that through [the] death he-might-render-powerless the-one having the power of-[the] death, that is, the devil, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and might-free these as-many-as by-fear of-death through all the living were ones-liable to-bondage.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For it-is-clear he-is┘not└helping angels, but he-is-helping seed of-Abraham.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Wherefore it-behooved-him to-be-made-like the/his brothers according-to all-things, in-order-that he-might-be (a) merciful and faithful high-priest with-respect-to-things with [the] God unto [the] making-propitiation-for the sins of-the people.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For in what<sup>sg</sup> <u>he</u> has-suffered, having-been-part-to-trial, he-is-able to-help the-ones being-part-to-trial.</span>
