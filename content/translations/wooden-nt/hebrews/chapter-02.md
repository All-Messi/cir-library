## Hebrews Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On-account-of this it-is-necessary for-us to-heed more-earnestly the-things heard, lest-at-any-time we-drift-away (from them).  2For if the word spoken through angels became firm and every transgressions and refusal-to-listen received (a) deserved recompense, 3how will┘we└escape having-neglected such-a-great salvation that at-the first, having-received to-be-spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by the-ones having-heard,4God bearing-witness-with (them) both by-signs and by-wonders and mighty powers and dispensations of-(the) Holy Spirit according-to the will of-him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> For not to-angels did-he-subject the intended [the] world, concerning which we-are-speaking.  6But (a) certain-one in-a-certain-place testified, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You-made┘him for-a-little while└lower than angels; For in the 'subjecting [the] all things,' he-left nothing 'unsubjected' to-him.  But now we-do┘not-yet└see [the] all-things subjected to-him.'  9But 'for-the little while made-lower than angels' we-do-see Jesus on-account-of the suffering of-[the] death 'crowned with-glory and with-honor' in-order-that he-might-taste of-death on-behalf-of every-(man).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> For it-was-fitting for-him, on-account-of whom (are) all-the-things and through whom (are) all the-things, having-brought many sons into glory, to-make┘the author/leader of-the salvation of-them└perfect through sufferings.  11For both the Sanctifier and the sanctified (are) all of one (nature).  On-account-of which reason, he-is┘not└ashamed to-call them brothers, 12saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Sinice then 'the children' have-shared blood and flesh, he also likewise partook of-the same-things, in-order-that through [the] death he-might-render-powerless the-one having the power of-[the] death, that is, the devil, 15and might-free these as-many-as by-fear of-death through all the living were ones-liable to-bondage.  16For it-is-clear he-is┘not└helping angels, but he-is-helping seed of-Abraham.  17Wherefore it-behooved-him to-be-made-like the/his brothers according-to all-things, in-order-that he-might-be (a) merciful and faithful high-priest with-respect-to-things with [the] God unto [the] making-propitiation-for the sins of-the people.  18For in whatsg he has-suffered, having-been-part-to-trial, he-is-able to-help the-ones being-part-to-trial.</span>
