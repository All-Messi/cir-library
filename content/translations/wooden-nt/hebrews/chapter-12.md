## Hebrews Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So also having such (a) great cloud of-witnesses, having laid-aside every weight and the easily-besetting sin, through perseverance, let-us-run the set-before us race, 2looking-away to the leader and perfecter of-the/our faith, Jesus, who, for the set-before him joy, endured (the) cross, having-disregarded (the) shame, and has-sat-down on (the) right-(hand) of-the throne of-[the] God.  3for consider the-One having-endured such verbal-hostility against himself by [the] sinners, in-order-that you┘not└get-discouraged, fainting in the souls of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You-have┘not└resisted until blood, striving against [the] sin, 5and you-have-forgotten the exhortation that reasons with-you as with-sons,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Unto 'discipline' you-endure; [the] God is-dealing-with you as with-'sons.'  For who (is a) son that (a) father does┘not└discipline?  8But if you are without discipline of-which all have-become partakers, then you-are illegitimate-children, not sons.  9Furthermore, we-used-to-have the fathers of-the flesh of-us as-discipliners, and we-would-respect (them).  [Now]ms will-we┘not└submit to-the Father of-[the] spirits and live?  10For they were-disciplining (us) for (a) few days according-to the-thing seeming-good to-them, but the/he (disciplines) for the benefiting (of us) unto the partaking of-the holiness of-him.  11Now all discipline does┘not└seem for the present to-be of-joy but of-sorrow, but afterwards it-yields peaceful fruit of-righteousness for-the-ones having-been-exercised by it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Wherefore straighten-uppl the thrown-down hands and the paralyzed knees, 13and make for-the feet of-you straight paths in-order-that the lame-thing may┘not└wander-off, but rather be-healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Pursue peace with all (people) and [the] sanctification without which nobody will-see the Lord, 15looking-out lest (there be) anyone falling-short of the grace of-[the] God, lest any root of-bitterness, springing up, trouble (you) and through it many may-be-defiled, 16lest (there be) any fornicator or profane (person) like Esau, who in-place-of one meal sold the birthright[s] of-him.  17For –you-know that even afterward, desiring to-inherit the blessing, he-was-rejected, because he-did┘not└find (a) place of-repentance although having-sought it with tears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For you-have┘not└come-to (a mountain) felt and burned with-fire and darkness and gloom and (a) whirlwind, 19and (the) blast of-(a)-trumpet and (the) sound of-words, which the-ones having-heard asked (a) word not to-be-continued to-them; 20for they-were┘not└bearing the-thing strictly-being-ordered, "Even-if (an) animal touches the mountain, it-shall-be-stoned"; 21and the so fearful was the appearing-thing, Moses said, "I-am really-fearful and full-of-trembling."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But you-have-come-to Mount Zion and to-(the)-city of-[the] living God, to-(the)-heavenly Jerusalem and myriads/hosts of-angels, to-(the) general-assembly 23and church of-(the)-firstborn registered in heaven[s], and to-God (the) Judge of-all, and to-(the)-spirits of-just-men made-perfect, 24and to-Jesus the mediator of-(a)-new covenant, and to-blood of-sprinkling speaking better than [the] Abel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Beware lest you-refuse the-One speaking.  For is those did┘not└escape, having-refused the-One warning on earth, much more we the-ones turning-away (will not escape)  the-One speaking from heaven[s}, 26the voice of-whom then shook the earth, but now he-has-promised, saying, "Yet once I will-shake, not only the earth, but also the heaven/sky."  27But the 'yet once' makes-evident the removal of-the-things being-'shaken' as of-things-made, in-order-that the-things not being-shaken might-remain.  28Wherefore let-us-have grace, receiving (an) unshakable kingdom, through which we-may-serve [the] God well-pleasingly with reverence and godly-fear.</span>
