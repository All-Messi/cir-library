## Hebrews Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So also having such (a) great cloud of-witnesses, having laid-aside every weight and the easily-besetting sin, through perseverance, let-us-run the set-before us race, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>looking-away to the leader and perfecter of-the/our faith, Jesus, who, for the set-before him joy, endured (the) cross, having-disregarded (the) shame, and has-sat-down on (the) right-(hand) of-the throne of-[the] God.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>for consider the-One having-endured such verbal-hostility against himself by [the] sinners, in-order-that you┘not└get-discouraged, fainting in the souls of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You-have┘not└resisted until blood, striving against [the] sin, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and you-have-forgotten the exhortation that reasons with-you as with-sons, <strong><em>“Son of-me, </em></strong><strong><em>do┘nto└regard-lightly</em></strong><strong><em> of-(the) discipline of-(the)-Lord,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	nor </em></strong><strong><em>give-up</em></strong><strong><em> being-reproved by </em></strong><strong><em>him;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong><em>for whom (the) Lord loves </em></strong><strong><em>he</em></strong><strong><em>-disciplines,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	but punishes every son whom he-receives.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Unto ‘discipline’ you-endure; [the] God is-dealing-with you as with-‘sons.’  For who (is a) son that (a) father does┘not└discipline?  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But if you are without discipline of-which all have-become partakers, then you-are illegitimate-children, not sons.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Furthermore, we-used-to-have the fathers of-the flesh of-us as-discipliners, and we-would-respect (them).  [Now]<sup>ms</sup> will-we┘not└submit to-the Father of-[the] spirits and live?  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For they were-disciplining (us) for (a) few days according-to the-thing seeming-good to-them, but the/he (disciplines) for the benefiting (of us) unto the partaking of-the holiness of-him.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Now all discipline does┘not└seem for the present to-be of-joy but of-sorrow, but afterwards it-yields peaceful fruit of-righteousness for-the-ones having-been-exercised by it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Wherefore straighten-up<sup>pl</sup> the thrown-down hands and the paralyzed knees, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and make for-the feet of-you straight paths in-order-that the lame-thing may┘not└wander-off, but rather be-healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Pursue peace with all (people) and [the] sanctification without which nobody will-see the Lord, <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>looking-out lest (there be) anyone falling-short of the grace of-[the] God, lest any root of-bitterness, springing up, trouble (you) and through it many may-be-defiled, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>lest (there be) any fornicator or profane (person) like Esau, who in-place-of one meal sold the birthright[s] of-him.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For –you-know that even afterward, desiring to-inherit the blessing, he-was-rejected, because he-did┘not└find (a) place of-repentance although having-sought it with tears.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For you-have┘not└come-to (a mountain) felt and burned with-fire and darkness and gloom and (a) whirlwind, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and (the) blast of-(a)-trumpet and (the) sound of-words, which the-ones having-heard asked (a) word not to-be-continued to-them; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>for they-were┘not└bearing the-thing strictly-being-ordered, <strong><em>“Even-if (an</em></strong><strong><em>) animal touches the mountain, it-shall-be-stoned”</em></strong>;<em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>and the so fearful was the appearing-thing, Moses said, <strong><em>“I-am really-fearful</em></strong><em> and full-of-trembling.”  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But you-have-come-to Mount Zion and to-(the)-city of-[the] living God, to-(the)-heavenly Jerusalem and myriads/hosts of-angels, to-(the) general-assembly <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and church of-(the)-firstborn registered in heaven[s], and to-God (the) Judge of-all, and to-(the)-spirits of-just-men made-perfect, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and to-Jesus the mediator of-(a)-new covenant, and to-blood of-sprinkling speaking better than [the] Abel.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Beware lest you-refuse the-One speaking.  For is <u>those</u> did┘not└escape, having-refused the-One warning on earth, much more <u>we</u> the-ones turning-away (will not escape)  the-One speaking from heaven[s}, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>the voice of-whom then shook the earth, but now he-has-promised, saying, <strong><em>“Yet once I will-shake,</em></strong><em> not only </em><strong><em>the earth,</em></strong><em> but also </em><strong><em>the heaven/sky</em></strong><strong>.”</strong>  <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But the ‘yet once’ makes-evident the removal of-the-things being-‘shaken’ as of-things-made, in-order-that the-things not being-shaken might-remain.  <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Wherefore let-us-have grace, receiving (an) unshakable kingdom, through which we-may-serve [the] God well-pleasingly with reverence and godly-fear.</span>
