## Hebrews Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For the Law, having (a) shadow of-the future good-things, not the very image of-the things, is┘never└able, by the same sacrifices that they-offer year-in-and-year-out2 continually, to-make-perfect the-ones drawing-near; 2otherwise would they┘not└have-ceased to-be-offered, on-account-of the worshipers having-been┘once-and-for-all└cleansed would-have-had no-longer (a) consciousness of-sins?  3But in them (is) remembrance of-sins yearly2.  4For (it is) impossible for-(the)-blood of-bulls and goats to-take-away sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Wherefore, coming into the world, he-says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You-did┘not└delight-in whole-burnt-offerings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then I-said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Saying above [that] 'sacrifice and offering' and 'whole-burnt-offering and (sacrifices) for sin you-did┘not└desire neither did-you-delight-in,' which are-offered according-to (the) Law, 9'then' he-has-said, 'Behold, I-have-come [the] to-do the will of-you'; he-takes away the first in-order-that he-might-establish the second, 10by which will we-have-been-sanctified2 through the 'body' of-Jesus Christ once-and-for-all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And every priest has-stood according-to (the) day2/daily2, serving and offering the same sacrifices repeatedly, which are┘never└able to-take-away-sins, 12but this-One, having-offered one sacrifice for sins for-all-time3, sat-down on (the) right-(hand) of-[the] God, 13henceforth2 waiting until the enemies of-him are-made (a) footstool of-the feet of-him.  14For by-one offering he-has-perfected for-all-time the-ones being sanctified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the Holy [the] Spirit also bears-witness to-us, for after [the] saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now where forgiveness of-these (is), no-longer (is) offering for sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Therefore, brothers, having boldness for [the] entrance of-the (Holy) of-Holies by the blood of-Jesus, 20which he-opened for-us (as a) new and living way through the veil, that is, the flesh of-him; 21and having (a) great high-priest over the house of-God, 22let-us-draw-near with (a) true heart in fullness of-faith, sprinkled with-respect-to-the hearts from (an) evil conscience and washed with-respect-to-the body with-clean water; 23let-us-hold-fast the confession of-the/a-firm hope, for the-One having-promised (is) faithful; 24and let-us-consider one-another unto encouragement of-love and of-good works, 25not forsaking the assembling of-ourselves, as (is the) practice/custom/habit to-some, but exhorting (one another), and more by-such as you-see the day drawing-near.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> For we deliberately sinning after [the] having-received the/a knowledge of-the truth, no-longer does┘(a) sacrifice concerning sins└remain, 27but some fearful expectation of-judgment and (a) fierceness of-fire going to-consume the adversaries.  28Anyone, having-set-aside (the) Law of-Moses died without compassions at two or three witnesses; 29pufishment worse by-how-much do-you-suppose will-be-made-appropriate the-one having-trodden-underfoot the Son of-[the] God and having-considered common/unholy the blood of-the covenant by which he-was-sanctified, and having-insulted/outraged the Spirit of-[the] grace?  30For we-know the One-having-said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And recall the former days in which, having-been-enlightened, you-endured (a) great conflict of-sufferings, 33on-the-one-hand being-exposed-to-public-shame both by-insults and difficulties, and on-the-other-hand, having-become fellows of-the-ones thus being-abused.  34For you-had-compassion on-[the] prisoners, and you-accepted with joy the seizure of-the possessions of-you, knowing yourselves to-have (a) better and permanent possession.  35So do┘not└throw-away the boldness of-you, which has great reward.  36For you-have need of-perseverance in-order-that, having-done the will of-[the] God, you-may-receive the promise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> But the righteous-one of-me will-have-life by-faith,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> But we are not 'of-turning/shrink-back' to perdition, but 'of-faith' unto (the) saving of-(the)-soul.</span>
