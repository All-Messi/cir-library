## Hebrews Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Let brotherly-love continue.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Do┘not└forget the love-of-strangers, for through this some were-unaware, having-entertained angels.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Remember the-ones bound as bound-with (them), the-ones being-mistreated as also yourselves being in (the) body.  <strong><sup>4(</sup></strong>Let) [the] marriage (be) honorable in all-people and the bed (be) undefiled, for [the] God will-judge fornicators and adulterers.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>(Let) the way-(of life of you be) without-love-of-silver, being-satisfied with-the-things being-present, for <u>he</u> has said, <em>“I </em><em>will┘not└abandon</em><em> you; neither certainly will-I-leave┘[not] </em><em>you└behind</em><em>,”</em>  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>so-that, being-confident, we say, <strong><em>“[The] Lord (is the) helper to-me,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	[and]</em></strong><strong><em><sup>ms</sup></em></strong><strong><em> I-will be-afraid.</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	What </em></strong><strong><em>will┘man└do</em></strong><strong><em> to-me?”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Remember the leaders of-you, who spoke to-you the word of-[the] God; considering the outcome of-the way-of-life of-whom, imitate the/their faith.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus Christ (is) the same yesterday and today and unto the ages<sup>3</sup>/forever<sup>3</sup>.  <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Do┘not└be-carried-away by-various and new (doctrines), for (it is) good for the heart to-be-established by-grace, not by-foods in-which the-ones walking/conducting-themselves were┘not└profited.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>We-have (an) altar of-which the-ones serving the tabernacle do┘not└have (a) right to-eat; 1<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>for the blood of-which animals is-carried concerning sin into the (Holy of-) Holies by the high-priest; the bodies of-these are-burned-up outside the camp.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Wherefore also Jesus, in-order-that he-might-sanctify the people through [the] his-own blood, suffered outside the gate.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For-that-very-reason-then, let-us-go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach of-him; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For we-do┘not└have here (a) remaining city, but we-look-for the coming (city).  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Through him [therefore]<sup>ms</sup> let-us-offer-up (a) sacrifice of-praise to-[the] God through everything, that is, (the) fruit of-(the)-lips, confessing<sup>pl</sup> the name of-him.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And do┘not└forget [the] doing-good and sharing, for by such “sacrifices” [the] God is-well-pleased.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Obey the leaders of-you and submit (to them), for <u>they</u> watch over the souls of-you as ones-going-to-give account, in-order-that they-may-do this with joy and not grieving, for this (would be) unprofitable for-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Pray concerning us, for we-are-persuaded that we-have (a) clear conscience, desiring in all-things to conduct (ourselves) well.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And I-encourage (you) to-do this more-exceedingly, in-order-that I-may-be-restored to-you more-quickly/sooner.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now may┘the God of-[the] peace—the-One having-resurrected from (the) dead the Great [the] Shepherd of-the sheep by (the) blood of-(the) eternal covenant, the Lord of-us, Jesus—<strong><sup>21</sup></strong>└supply you with every good-thing unto [the] doing the will of-him, working in-us the well-pleasing-thing before him through Jesus Christ, to-whom (be) glory unto the ages [of the ages]<sup>ms5</sup>/forever[more]<sup>5</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Now I-encourage you, brothers, to-bear-with the word of-exhortation, for I-sent/wrote to-you even through brief-things2/briefly2.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Know (that) the brother of us, Timothy has-been-released, with whom, if he-comes soon, I-will-see you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Greet all the leaders of-you and all the saints; the-ones from [the] Italy greet you. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>[The] grace (be) with you all. Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
