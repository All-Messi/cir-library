## Hebrews Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let brotherly-love continue.  2Do┘not└forget the love-of-strangers, for through this some were-unaware, having-entertained angels.  3Remember the-ones bound as bound-with (them), the-ones being-mistreated as also yourselves being in (the) body.  4(Let) [the] marriage (be) honorable in all-people and the bed (be) undefiled, for [the] God will-judge fornicators and adulterers.  5(Let) the way-(of life of you be) without-love-of-silver, being-satisfied with-the-things being-present, for he has said, "I will┘not└abandon you; neither certainly will-I-leave┘[not] you└behind,"  6so-that, being-confident, we say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Remember the leaders of-you, who spoke to-you the word of-[the] God; considering the outcome of-the way-of-life of-whom, imitate the/their faith.  8Jesus Christ (is) the same yesterday and today and unto the ages3/forever3.  9Do┘not└be-carried-away by-various and new (doctrines), for (it is) good for the heart to-be-established by-grace, not by-foods in-which the-ones walking/conducting-themselves were┘not└profited.  10We-have (an) altar of-which the-ones serving the tabernacle do┘not└have (a) right to-eat; 11for the blood of-which animals is-carried concerning sin into the (Holy of-) Holies by the high-priest; the bodies of-these are-burned-up outside the camp.  12Wherefore also Jesus, in-order-that he-might-sanctify the people through [the] his-own blood, suffered outside the gate.  13For-that-very-reason-then, let-us-go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach of-him; 14For we-do┘not└have here (a) remaining city, but we-look-for the coming (city).  15Through him [therefore]ms let-us-offer-up (a) sacrifice of-praise to-[the] God through everything, that is, (the) fruit of-(the)-lips, confessingpl the name of-him.  16And do┘not└forget [the] doing-good and sharing, for by such "sacrifices" [the] God is-well-pleased.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Obey the leaders of-you and submit (to them), for they watch over the souls of-you as ones-going-to-give account, in-order-that they-may-do this with joy and not grieving, for this (would be) unprofitable for-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Pray concerning us, for we-are-persuaded that we-have (a) clear conscience, desiring in all-things to conduct (ourselves) well.  19And I-encourage (you) to-do this more-exceedingly, in-order-that I-may-be-restored to-you more-quickly/sooner.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now may┘the God of-[the] peace—the-One having-resurrected from (the) dead the Great [the] Shepherd of-the sheep by (the) blood of-(the) eternal covenant, the Lord of-us, Jesus—21└supply you with every good-thing unto [the] doing the will of-him, working in-us the well-pleasing-thing before him through Jesus Christ, to-whom (be) glory unto the ages [of the ages]ms5/forever[more]5.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Now I-encourage you, brothers, to-bear-with the word of-exhortation, for I-sent/wrote to-you even through brief-things2/briefly2.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Know (that) the brother of us, Timothy has-been-released, with whom, if he-comes soon, I-will-see you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Greet all the leaders of-you and all the saints; the-ones from [the] Italy greet you.</span>
