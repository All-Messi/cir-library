## Hebrews Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>For every high-priest being-taking from men is-appointed on-behalf-of men with-respect-to-things toward [the] God, in-order-that he-might-offer both gifts and sacrifices on-behalf-of sins, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>able to-deal-gently-with ignorant and erring-ones, because he also lies-surrounded-with weakness, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>and on-account-of it he-is-obliged, even-as for the people, thus also for himself to-make-offering for sins.  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And not to-himself does┘anybody└take the honor, but one-called by [the] God even-as also Aaron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So also the Christ did┘not└glorify himself to-become (a) high-priest, but the-one having-spoken to him, <strong><em>“You are Son of-</em></strong><strong><em>me;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	today I have begotten you</em></strong><strong><em>”;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>even-as also he-says in another (place), <strong><em>“You (are a) priest </em></strong><strong><em>unto the age/</em></strong><strong><em>forever</em></strong><strong><em><sup>3</sup></em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>ccording-to the order of-Melchizedek,”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>who in the days of the flesh of-him having-offered-up both prayers and pleas with strong crying and tears to the-one being-able to-save him from death, and having-been-heard from the/his reverence, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>though being (a) Son, he-learned [the] obedience from which-things he-suffered; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and having-been-perfected, he-became for-all the-ones obeying him (the) source of-eternal salvation, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>having-been-designated by [the] God (a) high-priest according-to the order of-Melchizedek.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Concerning whom the word to-us (is) much, and to-say hard-to-understand, since you-have-become dull with-respect-to-[the] heard-things.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For also on-account-of time “oughting” to-be teachers, you still/again have heed for-someone to-teach you the first-principles of-the beginning of-the words of-[the] God, and you-have-become ones-having need of-milk and not solid food,  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For every the-one partaking of-milk (is) inexperienced of-(the)-word of-righteousness, for he-is (a) infant.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But [the] solid food is of-mature-ones, the-ones having┘on-account-of use└the/their senses-of-perception exercised to-[the] discernment of┘both└good and bad.</span>
