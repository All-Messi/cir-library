## Hebrews Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For every high-priest being-taking from men is-appointed on-behalf-of men with-respect-to-things toward [the] God, in-order-that he-might-offer both gifts and sacrifices on-behalf-of sins, 2able to-deal-gently-with ignorant and erring-ones, because he also lies-surrounded-with weakness, 3and on-account-of it he-is-obliged, even-as for the people, thus also for himself to-make-offering for sins.  4And not to-himself does┘anybody└take the honor, but one-called by [the] God even-as also Aaron.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So also the Christ did┘not└glorify himself to-become (a) high-priest, but the-one having-spoken to him, 7who in the days of the flesh of-him having-offered-up both prayers and pleas with strong crying and tears to the-one being-able to-save him from death, and having-been-heard from the/his reverence, 8though being (a) Son, he-learned [the] obedience from which-things he-suffered; 9and having-been-perfected, he-became for-all the-ones obeying him (the) source of-eternal salvation, 10having-been-designated by [the] God (a) high-priest according-to the order of-Melchizedek.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Concerning whom the word to-us (is) much, and to-say hard-to-understand, since you-have-become dull with-respect-to-[the] heard-things.  12For also on-account-of time "oughting" to-be teachers, you still/again have heed for-someone to-teach you the first-principles of-the beginning of-the words of-[the] God, and you-have-become ones-having need of-milk and not solid food,  13For every the-one partaking of-milk (is) inexperienced of-(the)-word of-righteousness, for he-is (a) infant.  14But [the] solid food is of-mature-ones, the-ones having┘on-account-of use└the/their senses-of-perception exercised to-[the] discernment of┘both└good and bad.</span>
