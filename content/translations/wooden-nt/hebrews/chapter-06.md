## Hebrews Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wherefore having-left the word of-the beginning of-[the] Christ, let-us-press on-to maturity, not laying-down again (a) foundation of-repentance from dead works and faith toward God, 2teaching of-baptisms and (the) imposition of-hands, and resurrection of-(the)-death and of-eternal judgment.  3And we-will-do this, if [the] God permits.  4For (it is) impossible for-the-ones having-been-enlightened and having-tasted of-the heavenly [the] gift and having-become partakers of-(the)-Holy Spirit 5and having-tasted the good word of-God and (the) powers of-(the)-coming age 6and having-fallen away to-renew again to repentance, re-crucifying to-themselves and openly-shaming the Son of-[the] God.  7For ground, [the] soaking-up the rain coming frequently on it and bearing (a) crop useful to-those on-account-of whom it-is-farmed, receives blessing from [the] God; 8but bearing thorns and thistles, (it is) unprofitable and near (a) curse, the end of-which (is) for burning.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But we-have-been-persuaded concerning you, beloved, [the] greater-things and things-accompanying salvation, even if we-speak this-way.  10For [the] God (is) not unjust to-forget the work and the love of-you that you-showed to the name of-him, having-served the saints and continuing-to-serve (them).  11Now we-want each of-you to-keep-showing the same diligence unto the full-assurance of-[the] hope to (the) end, 12in-order-that you-may┘not└become sluggish, but (become) imitators of-the-ones inheriting the promises through faith and perseverance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> For [the] God having-promised to-Abraham, since he-had by nobody greater to-swear, "Swore by himself," 14saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And so having-endured, he-obtained the promise.  16For men swear by the greater, and the/an oath (is) final for confirmation of-every dispute to-them, 17in which [the] God, willing to-show more-abundantly to-the heirs of-the promise the unchangeableness of-the will/plan of-him, interposed with-(an)-oath, 18in-order-that through two unchangeable things, in whichpl (it is) impossible for-[the] God to-lie, we┘the-ones having-fled to-seize the set-before-(us) hope└may-have (a) strong confidence, 19which we-have (as an) anchor of-the soul both safe and firm and entering into the-thing inside the veil, 20where Jesus entered (as a) forerunner on-behalf-of us, having-become (a) high-priest unto the age/forever3 according-to the order of-Melchizedek.</span>
