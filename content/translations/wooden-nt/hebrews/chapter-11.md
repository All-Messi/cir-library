## Hebrews Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now faith is (the) assurance of-things hoped-for, (the) certainty of-things┘not└seen.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For by this the ancients had-witness-borne-to-(them).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>By faith we-understand the worlds/ages to-have-been-prepared by-(the)-word of-God, unto the-thing being-seen [the] to-have-come-to-be not from things-having-phenomenal-existence.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>By-faith Abel offered to-[the] God (a) better sacrifice than Cain, through which he-was-testified to-be righteous, [the] God testifying to the gifts of-him; and through it, having-died, he┘still└speaks.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>By-faith Enoch was-translated, [the] not to-see death; and <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>he-was┘not└being-found</em></strong><strong><em> because [the] God translated him.”</em></strong>  For before the translation <strong><em>“being-well-pleasing to-[the] God</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> has-been-testified.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now without faith ‘to-be-well-pleasing’ (is) impossible.  For to-believe that he-is and he-is (a) rewarder to-the-ones seeking him is-necessary for-the-ones coming to-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>By-faith Noah, having-been-warned concerning things not-yet being-seen, having-taken-heed, prepared (an) ark unto (the) salvation of-the house of-him, by-which he-condemned the world and became heir of-the righteousness according-to faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>By-faith Abraham, being-called, obeyed to-go-out into (a) place he-would-receive2 for (an) inheritance.  And he-went-out, not knowing where he-is/was-going.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>By-faith he-sojourned in (the) land of-[the] promise as (a land) belonging-to-someone-else, having-dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, [the] fellow-heirs of-the same [the] promise, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>for he-was-looking-forward-to the city having [the] foundations whose architect and builder (is) God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>By-faith also Sarah herself, sterile, received power unto (the) conception of-seed, even beyond (the) time of-(child-bearing)-age because she-considered faithful the-One having-promised.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Wherefore also from one were-born, and these of-one-(as good as)-dead, even-as the stars of-the sky in-[the] multitude and as the sand [the] beside the shore of-the sea [the] without-number.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>According-to faith these all died, not having-received the promises, but from-afar having-seen them and having-greeted (them) and having-confessed that they-were foreigners and temporary-residents on the earth.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For the-ones saying such-things make-manifest that they-are-looking-for (a) homeland.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And if they-were-mindful of-that (land) from which they-went-out, they-would-have opportunity to-return.  <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And now they-desire (a) better, that is, heavenly (country).  Wherefore [the] God is┘not└ashamed-of them to-be-called (the) God of-them, for he-prepared (a) city for-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>By-faith Abraham offered-up [the] Isaac, being-tried, and he-was-offering-up the/his only-(son), the-one having-welcomed the promises, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>to-whom it-was-said [that], <strong><em>“In Isaac (the) seed to-you will-be-called,” </em></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>supposing that even from (the) dead [the] God (was) able to-raise (him), whence in (a) figure he┘also└did-receive┘him└back.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>By-faith also concerning coming-things, Isaac blessed [the] Jacob and [the] Esau.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>By-faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of-the sons of Joseph, and <strong><em>“worshiped on the top of-the rod of-him.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By-faith Joseph, coming-to-(his)-end, made-mention about the exodus of-the sons of-Israel, and he-gave-commandment concerning the bones of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>By-faith Moses, having-been-born, was-hid for-three-months by the fathers/parents of-him, because they-saw (that) the child (was) handsome; and they-did┘not└fear the edict of-the king.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>By-faith Moses, becoming full-grown, refused to-be-called (the) son of-(the)-daughter of-Pharaoh, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>choosing instead to-share-ill-treatment-with the people of-[the] God than to-have (the) enjoyment of-sin for a-time, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>having-considered the reproach of-[the] Christ greater wealth than-the treasures of-Egypt, for he-looked-away to-the rewarding-payback.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>By-faith he-left Egypt, not having-feared the wrath of-the king, for he-endured as one-seeing the invisible-(One).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>By-faith he-has-kept the Passover and the smearing of-[the] blood, in-order-that the-One destroying the firstborn might┘not└touch them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>By-faith they-went-through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians, having-taken (an) attempt were-drowned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>By-faith the walls of-Jericho fell, having-been-encircled for seven days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>By-faith Rahab the harlot was┘not└destroyed-with the disbelievers, having-welcomed the spies with peace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And what yet do-I-say?  For [the] time will-run-out me relating concerning Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and David and Samuel and the prophets, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, shut (the) mouths of-lions, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>put-out (the) power of-fire, escaped (the) edge of-(the)-sword, were-made-strong from weakness, became strong in war, routed armies of-aliens.  <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Women received the dead of-them by resurrection, but others<sup>mas</sup> were-tortured-on-a-tympanum, not having-accepted [the] deliverance, in-order-that they-might-obtain (a) better resurrection. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And others received trial of-mockings and scourgings, and still of-bonds and imprisonments.  <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They-were-stoned, they-were-sawn-asunder, they-died by murder of-(the)-sword, they-went-around in sheep-skins, in goat skins, being-destitute, being-oppressed, being-mistreated, <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>of-whom the world was not worthy, wandering to-uninhabited-places and mountains and caves and [the] holes of-the-earth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And these all, having-been-witnessed-to through faith, did┘not└obtain the promise, <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>[the] God having-provided something better concerning us, in-order-that without us they-would┘not└be-made-complete.</span>
