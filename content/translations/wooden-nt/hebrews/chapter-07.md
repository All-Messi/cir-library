## Hebrews Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For this [the] "Melchizedek, king of-Salem, priest of-[the] God [the] Most-High, the-one having-met Abraham returning from the slaughter of-the kings" and "having-blessed him," 2to-whom also "Abraham" divided "(a) tenth from all-things," first translated "King of-Righteousness," but then also "King of-Salem," that is, "King of-Peace"; 3without-father, without-mother, without-genealogy, having neither beginning of-days nor end of-life, but having-been-likened to-the Son of-[the] God, he-remains (a) priest [unto the] continually.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Now consider how-great this-one (was) to-whom [also]ms Abraham the patriarch gave (a) tenth of-the spoils.  5And the-ones of the sons of-Levi, receiving the priesthood, have (a) commandment to-receive-a-tenth-from the people according-to the Law, that is, the brothers of-them, even-as ones-having-come from the loins of-Abraham.  6And the-one not counting-genealogy from them has-received-a-tithe-from Abraham and blessed the-one having the promises.  7Now without any dispute the lesser is-blessed by the greater.  8And here dying men receive tithes, but there being-witnessed that he-is-living.  9And as (a) word to-speak/so-to-speak, through Abraham Levi the-one receiving tithes has-paid-tithes.  10For he-was still in the loins of-the/his father/ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So if then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood—for by it the people have-received-the-Law, what need yet (was there for) another priest to-arise according-to the order of-Melchizedek and not to-be-called according-to the order of-Aaron?  12For the priesthood being-changed, out-of necessity also becomes (the) change of-(the)-Law, 13for over whom these-things are-being-said, was-(a)-member of-another tribe, from whom nobody has-attended-at the altar.  14For it-is-evident that the Lord of-us has-descended from Judah, to which tribe Moses said nothing about priests.  15and it-is yet more-abundantly evident, if another priest arises according-to the likeness of-Melchizedek, 16who has-come-to-be, not according-to (the) Law of-(a)-flesh-based commandment, but according-to (the) power of-(an)-indissoluble life.  17For it-is-being-witnessed [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For (there) is (an) annulment of-(a)-foregoing commandment on-account-of [the] weak(ness) and unprofitable(ness) of-it—19for the Law made┘nothing└perfect, but the bringing-in of-(a)-better hope (did), through which we-draw-near to-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And just-as (it is) not without (an) oath.  For they-are without (an) oath, having-become priests; 21but the-One/he has become priest with (an) oath through the-One saying to him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> By so-much [also]ms Jesus has-become guarantor of-(a)-better covenant.  23And the/they have become more┘priests└in-number on-account-of death, being-prevented to-continue.  24But the/he has the/his priesthood unchanged on-account-of [the] his remaining unto the age/forever3.  25Whence also he-is-able to-save to the uttermost the-ones drawing-hear to-[the] God through him, always living unto [the] interceding for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> For such (a) high-priest was┘also└appropriate to-us, holy, unveil, undefiled, separated from [the] sinners and having-become higher than-the heavens, 27who does┘not└have necessity according-to (the) day2/daily2 like the high-priests, first for [the] their-own sins to-offer sacrifices then for-the (sins) of-the people.  For this he-did once having-offered himself.  28For the Law appoints/constitutes men as-priests having weakness, but the word of-the oath [the] after the Law (appoints) (a) Son perfected unto the age/forever3.</span>
