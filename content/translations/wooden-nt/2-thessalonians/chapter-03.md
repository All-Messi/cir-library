## 2 Thessalonians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Finally<sup>2</sup>, brothers, pray for us in-order-that the word of-the Lord may-make-progress and be-glorified even-as also (it was) with you, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and in-order-that we-may-be-delivered from harmful and evil men, for [the] faith (is) not of-all.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But the Lord is faithful who will-strengthen you and keep (you) from the evil-(one).  <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And we-are-confident in (the) Lord over you, that what-things we-command you-are┘both└doing and will-do.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And may┘the Lord└direct the hearts of-you into the love of-[the] God and into the endurance of-[the] Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now we-command you, brothers, in (the) name of-the Lord [of-us]<sup>ms</sup> Jesus Christ (that) you stay-away from every brother walking disorderly and not according-to the tradition that they-received from us.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For you┘yourselves└know how it-is-necessary to-imitate us, because we-were┘not└idle among you, <sup>8</sup>neither did-we-eat bread from anyone without-paying-for-it; but in labor and toil night and day, working unto [the] not burdening any of-you, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>not that we-do┘not└have (the) right, but in-order-that we-might-give ourselves (as an) example to-you unto [the] your imitating (us).  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For even when we-were with you, we-were-commanding this to-you:  that if anybody is┘not└willing to-work, neither let-him-eat.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For we-hear that some (are) walking among you disorderly, not working but being-busy-bodies.  <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Now we-command and encourage [the] such-persons in (the) Lord Jesus Christ in-order-that working with quietness they-may-eat the bread of-themselves. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But, brothers, do┘not└become-discouraged doing-good.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And if anybody does┘not└obey the word of-us through the epistle, make-note-of this (person) not to-associate-with him in-order-that he-may-be ashamed.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And do┘not└consider (him) as (an) enemy, but warn (him) as (a) brother.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now may the Lord of-[the] peace himself give you [the] peace through everything in every circumstance.  The Lord (be) with you all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The salutation of-Paul by-[the] my-own hand, which is (the) sign in every letter.  Thus I-write.  <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>The grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ (be) with you all. Virgil Warren, PhD Translator christir.org</span>
