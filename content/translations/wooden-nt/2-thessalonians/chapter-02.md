<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now we-ask you, brothers, about the coming of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ and (the) gathering of-us to him <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>for [the] your not to-being-unsettled swiftly from the mind or being disturbed either by (a) spirit or by (a) message or by (a) letter as-if by us, as that the day of-the Lord has come.  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Let┘not anybody according-to any way└deceive you because unless<sup>2</sup> the/a falling-away first comes and the man of-[the] lawlessness is-revealed, the son of-[the] perdition, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>the-one opposing and exalting-himself above everything called God or (an) object–of-worship so-that him to-be-sitting in the temple of-(the) God presenting himself that he-is God.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Do-your┘not└emember that, yet being with you, I-was-telling you these-things?  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And you-know the restraining-thing now unto his [the] being-revealed in [the] his-own time.  <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For the mystery of-[the] lawlessness is┘already└at-work; only the-one restraining now (will restrain) until he-becomes out-of (the) midst.  <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And then the lawless-one will-be-revealed, whom the Lord [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> will-kill with-the breath of-the mouth of-him and will-destroy by-the appearance of-the coming of-him, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>whose [the] coming is according-to (the) working of-[the] Satan in all power and signs and lying wonders <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and in every deception of-wrapping for-the-ones perishing against whom they-did┘not└receive the love of-the truth unto [the] their being-saved.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And on-account-of this [the] God sends to-them (a) working of-deception unto [the] their believing [the] lie, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>in-order-that all the-ones not having-believed, but having-taken-delight in-[the] wrong-doing may-be-judging by-the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But <u>we</u> are-obliged to-thank [the] God always for you, brothers beloved by (the) Lord, because [the] God chose you (as) first fruits unto salvation by (the) sanctification of-(the)-spirit and belief of-(the) truth, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>unto which [also]<sup>ms</sup> he-called you by the gospel of-us unto obtaining of-(the)-glory of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So then, brothers, stand-firm, and hold-onto the traditions that you-were-taught either by word or by our letter.  <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And may┘the Lord of-us himself Jesus Christ and [the] God the Father of-us the-One having-loved us and having-given (us) eternal comfort and good hope in grace, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>└comfort the hearts of-you and strengthen (you) in every work and good word.</span>
