## 2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of-[the] Thessalonians in God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father [of-us]<sup>ms</sup> and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We-are-obliged to-give-thanks to-[the] God always about you, brothers, even-as is appropriate, because the faith of-you is-greatly-growing, and the love of-each one of-you all for one-another is-increasing, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>so-as-(a)-result we ourselves boast in you among the churches of-[the] God for the patience of-you and faith amidst all the persecutions of-you and the afflictions that you-are-enduring, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>evidence of-the righteous judgment of-[the] God unto your [the] being-considered-worthy of-the kingdom of-[the] God, for which also you-are-suffering, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>since (it is) just from God to-repay affliction to-the-ones afflicting you <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and (to repay) relief to-you the-ones troubled with us, at the revelation of-the Lord Jesus from heaven with (the) angels of-the power of-him <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>in (a) fire of-flame, giving revenge to-the-ones not knowing God and the-ones not obeying the gospel of-the Lord of-us Jesus, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>who will-undergo eternal destruction from (the) face of-the Lord and from the glory of-the strength of-him, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>when he-comes to be glorified on that [the] day in the saints of-him and to-be-marveled-at in all the believing-ones, because the witness of-us to you was-believed.  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Unto that we┘also└pray for you always in-order-that the God of-us will-make┘you└worthy of-the calling and may-fulfill every intention of-goodness and work of-faith with power, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>in-order-that the name of-the Lord of-us Jesus may-be-glorified in you, and you in him according-to the grace of-the God of-us and Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
