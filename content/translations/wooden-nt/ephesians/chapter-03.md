## Ephesians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> For-the-sake-of this, I, Paul, (a) prisoner of-[the] Christ Jesus on-behalf-of you [the] Gentiles—2if indeed you-heard-about the stewardship of-the grace of-[the] God [the] given to-me for you, 3that/because according-to revelation the mystery was-made-known to-me, even-as I-wrote-earlier in brief, 4to which you-are-able, reading, to perceive the insight of-me in the mystery of-[the] Christ, 5which in-other generations was┘not└made-known to-the sons of-[the] men as now it-was-revealed to the holy apostles of-him and prophets by the spirit: 6(that) [the] Gentiles are joint-heirs and fellow-members-of-the-body, and fellow-partakers of-the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 7of-which I-became (a) minister according-to the gift of-[the] grace of-[the] God [the] having-been-given to-me according-to the working of-[the] power of-him, 8to-me the least of-all saints [the] this was-given, to-preach to-the Gentiles the unfathomable wealth of-[the] Christ, 9and to-bring-to-light what (is) the administration of-the mystery the-one hidden from the ages in [the] God, the-One having-created all [the]-things, 10in-order-that the multi-faceted wisdom of-[the] God might-be-made-known to-the rulers and the authorities in-regard-to the heavenly-(matters) through the church, 11according-to (the) purpose of-the ages that he-made in [the] Christ Jesus the Lord of-us, 12in whom we-have [the] boldness and access in confidence through the faith of-him. 13Wherefore I-ask you not to-become-discouraged in the difficulties of-me for you, which is your glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> For-the-sake-of this, I-bend the knees of-me to the Father, 15from whom every family in (the) heavens and on earth is named, 16in-order-that he-might-give you according-to the richness of-the Spirit of-him to-be-strengthened with-power through the Spirit of-him in the inner man, 17(that) [the] Christ may-reside in the hearts of-you through [the] faith, rooted and founded in love, 18in-order-that you-may-be-strong to-comprehend with all the saints what (is) the breadth and length, and height and depth, 19and to know the love of-Christ surpassing [the] knowledge, in-order-that you-may-be-filled to all the fullness of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Now to-the-One able to-do exceedingly above all that we-ask or think according-to the power [the] working in us—21to-him (be) [the] glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generations forever and ever/of-the ages of the ages. Amen.</span>
