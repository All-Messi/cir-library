## Ephesians Chapter **5**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So be imitators of-[the] God as beloved children, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and walk in love even-as also [the] Christ loved you and gave himself for you (as an) offering and sacrifice to-[the] God for (a) sweet fragrance. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Let┘sexaul-immorality and every impurity or greed not-even└be-named among you, even-as is-appropriate for-saints. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And(Let there be no) filthiness and foolish-talk or vulgar-talking, which-things are not fitting, but rather thanksgiving. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For know this for-sure that every sexually-immoral or impure or covetous (person), which is idolatry, does┘not└have (an) inheritance in the kingdom of-[the] Christ and God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Let┘nobody└deceive you with-empty words, for because-of these-things the wrath of-[the] God is-coming on the sons of-[the] disobedience. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So do┘not└be partakers of-them, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>for you-were once darkness, but now (you are) light in (the) Lord; walk as children of-light—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>for the fruit of-[the] light (is) in all goodness and righteousness and truth—<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>testing what is pleasing to-the Lord. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Do┘not└participate-in the unfruitful [the] works of-[the] darkness, but rather even exposed them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For it-is disgraceful even to-tell the-things done by them in-secret, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>but [the] all-things exposed by the light become-visible. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For everything [the] made-visible is light. Where it-says, <em>“Get up, the-one sleeping,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd arise from the dead,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd [the] Christ will-shine-on you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So watch carefully how you-walk, not as unwise but as wise, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>making-th-most-of the time because the days are evil. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>On-account-of this do┘not└be foolish, but know what the will of-the Lord (is). <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And do┘not└be-drunk with-wine, in which is reckless-living, but be-filled with (the) Spirit, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>speaking to-one-another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making-melody in-the heart of-you to-the Lord, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>always being-thankful for all-things in (the) name of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ to-[the] God and Father. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Submit yourselves to-one-another in (the) respect of-Christ, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[the] wives to-[the] their husbands as to-the Lord <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>because (a) husband is head of-the wife as also [the] Christ (is) head of-the church, himself (the) Savior of-the body. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But as the church submits to-[the] Christ, so also [the] wives to-[the] husbands in everything. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>[The] husbands love [the] wives even-as also [the] Christ loved the church and gave himself for it, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>in-order-that he-might-sanctify it, having-cleansed (it) by-the washing of-[the] water with (the) word, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>in-order-that <u>he</u> might-present the church to-himself glorious, not having (a) stain or wrinkle or any of-[the] such-things, but in-order-that it-might-be holy and blameless. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Thus [the] husbands [also]<sup>ms</sup> ought to-love [the] their wives as the bodies of-themselves. The-one loving the wife of-himself is-loving himself. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>For nobody ever hated the flesh of-himself, but feeds and takes-care-of it, even-as also [the] Christ (does) the church, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>because we-are members of-the body of-him: <strong><sup>31</sup></strong><strong>“for</strong><strong> this-reason (a) man will-leave-behind [the] father and [the] mother and be-united with the wife of-him, and the two will-be </strong><strong>[</strong><strong>for</strong><strong>]</strong><strong> one flesh.”</strong> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>[The] this mystery is great, but <u>I</u> am-speaking regarding Christ and regarding the church. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Nevertheless also you the-ones according-to one, let┘each└love the wife of-him as himself, and (let) the wife (see) in-order-that she-respect the/her husband.</span>
