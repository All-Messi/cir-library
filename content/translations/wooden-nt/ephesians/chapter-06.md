## Ephesians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>[The] children, obey the parents of-you in (the) Lord, for this is right. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Honor</strong><strong> the father of-you and the mothers,”</strong> which is (the) first commandment with promise, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong>“in-order-that it-may-be well with-you</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and you-will-be </strong><strong>(a) long-time on the earth.”</strong> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And [the] fathers, do┘not└make┘the children of-you└resentful, but raise them in (the) discipline and instruction of-(the)-Lord. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>[The] slaves, obey the/your masters according-to (the) flesh with fear and trembling with sincerity of-the heart of-you as to-[the[ Christ, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>not according-to eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of-Christ, doing the will of-[the] God from (the) soul, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>with good-will serving as [the] Lord and not men, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>knowing that if you┘each└do anything good, this will-be-received-back from (the) Lord whether slave or free. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] lords, do the same-things to them, ceasing [the] threatening, knowing that both the Lord of-them and of-you is in heaven[s], and respect-of-persons is not with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Finally<sup>2</sup>, be-strong in (the) Lord and in the power of-the strength of-him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Put-on the full-armor of-[the] God to [the] your being-able to-stand-firm against the schemes of-[the] devil; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>because the fight to-us is not with blood and flesh, but with [the] rulers, with [the] authorities, with [the] world-rulers of-[the] this darkness, with the spiritual-things of-[the] evil in [the] heavenly (matters). <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>On-account-of this, take-up the full-armor of-[the] God, in-order-that you-may-be-able to-withstand in the evil [the] day, and, having-overcome all-things to-stand-firm. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Stand-firm then, wrapping the waist of-you<sup>p</sup><sup>l</sup> with truth and having-put-on the breastplate of-righteousness, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and having-shod the/your feet with [the] preparation of-the gospel of-peace, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>in all-things having-taken-up the shield of-[the] faith, with which you-will-be-able to-extinguish all the flaming [the] arrows of-the evil-one; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and take the helmet of-[the] salvation and the sword of-the Spirit, which is (the) word of-God, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>through all prayer and petition praying at every opportunity in (the) Spirit, and unto this being-alert with all perseverance and petition about all the saints <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>and for me in-order-that (the) utterance may-be-given to-me in (the) opening of-the mouth of-me, to-make-known with boldness the mystery of-the gospel, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>on-behalf-of which I-am-an-ambassador in chains, in-order-that I-may-be-bold in him as it-is-necessary (that) I speak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But in-order-that you┘also└may-know the-things according-to me, what I-am-doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in Christ, will-make-known to you, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>whom I-sent to-you for this very-thing, in-order-that you-may-know the-things about us and he may-comfort the hearts of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Peace to-the brothers and love with faith from God (the) Father and (the) Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>[The] grace (be) with all the-ones loving the Lord of-us Jesus Christ with undyingness.
