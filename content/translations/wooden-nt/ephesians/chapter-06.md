## Ephesians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The] children, obey the parents of-you in (the) Lord, for this is right. 2"Honor the father of-you and the mothers," which is (the) first commandment with promise, 3"in-order-that it-may-be well with-you, and you-will-be (a) long-time on the earth." 4And [the] fathers, do┘not└make┘the children of-you└resentful, but raise them in (the) discipline and instruction of-(the)-Lord. 5[The] slaves, obey the/your masters according-to (the) flesh with fear and trembling with sincerity of-the heart of-you as to-[the[ Christ, 6not according-to eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of-Christ, doing the will of-[the] God from (the) soul, 7with good-will serving as [the] Lord and not men, 8knowing that if you┘each└do anything good, this will-be-received-back from (the) Lord whether slave or free. 9And [the] lords, do the same-things to them, ceasing [the] threatening, knowing that both the Lord of-them and of-you is in heaven[s], and respect-of-persons is not with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Finally2, be-strong in (the) Lord and in the power of-the strength of-him. 11Put-on the full-armor of-[the] God to [the] your being-able to-stand-firm against the schemes of-[the] devil; 12because the fight to-us is not with blood and flesh, but with [the] rulers, with [the] authorities, with [the] world-rulers of-[the] this darkness, with the spiritual-things of-[the] evil in [the] heavenly (matters). 13On-account-of this, take-up the full-armor of-[the] God, in-order-that you-may-be-able to-withstand in the evil [the] day, and, having-overcome all-things to-stand-firm. 14Stand-firm then, wrapping the waist of-youpl with truth and having-put-on the breastplate of-righteousness, 15and having-shod the/your feet with [the] preparation of-the gospel of-peace, 16in all-things having-taken-up the shield of-[the] faith, with which you-will-be-able to-extinguish all the flaming [the] arrows of-the evil-one; 17and take the helmet of-[the] salvation and the sword of-the Spirit, which is (the) word of-God, 18through all prayer and petition praying at every opportunity in (the) Spirit, and unto this being-alert with all perseverance and petition about all the saints 19and for me in-order-that (the) utterance may-be-given to-me in (the) opening of-the mouth of-me, to-make-known with boldness the mystery of-the gospel, 20on-behalf-of which I-am-an-ambassador in chains, in-order-that I-may-be-bold in him as it-is-necessary (that) I speak.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But in-order-that you┘also└may-know the-things according-to me, what I-am-doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in Christ, will-make-known to you, 22whom I-sent to-you for this very-thing, in-order-that you-may-know the-things about us and he may-comfort the hearts of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Peace to-the brothers and love with faith from God (the) Father and (the) Lord Jesus Christ. 24[The] grace (be) with all the-ones loving the Lord of-us Jesus Christ with undyingness.</span>
