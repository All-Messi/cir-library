## Ephesians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I, the/a prisoner in the Lord, urge you to walk worthily of-the calling which you-were called, 2with all humility and gentleness, with patience, being-patient-with one-another in love, 3being-diligent to-keep the unity of-the spirit in the bond of-[the] peace: 4one body and one Spirit, as you are-called in one hope of-[the] calling of-you; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6one God and Father of-all, the-One over all and through all and in all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And to-each one of-you [the] grace was-given according-to the measure of-Christ. 8Wherefore it-says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now what is the 'he-ascended' but2 that he┘also└descended into the lower [parts]ms of-the earth? 10The-One having-descended is himself also the-One having-ascended about all the heavens, in-order-that he might-fill [the] all-things. 11And he gave [the] apostles, and [the] prophets, and [the] evangelists, and [the] shepherds and teachers—12to the equipping of-the saints for (the) work of-ministry/service, for (the) building-up of-the body of-[the] Christ, 13until we┘[the] all└attain the unity of-[the] faith and the knowledge of-the Son of-[the] God unto (a) full-grown man, unto (the) stature of-the fullness of-[the] Christ, 14in-order-that we-may┘no-longer└be children tossed-around-by-waves-of-the-sea and blown around by every wind of-[the] doctrine—by the cunning of-[the] men, by (the) craftiness to [the] trickery of-[the] deception—15but speaking-the-truth in love, let-us-grow-up into him with-respect-to-all-things, who is the head, Christ, 16from whom all [the] body fit-together and held-together by every ligament of-[the] support according-to (the) working in proper-measure of-each one part makes the growth of-the body into the building-up of-itself in love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Therefore I-say this and testify in (the) Lord, (that) your no-longer walking even-as also the Gentiles walk in (the) futility of-the mind of-them, 18being darkened in-the understanding (of-them), excluded-from the life of-[the] God on-account-of the ignorance [the] being in them, on-account-of the hardness of-the heart of-them, 19who, having-become-insensitive, gave┘themselves└over to-[the] indecency for (the) doing of-every impurity in covetousness, 20but you did┘not so└learn [the] Christ, 21 if you-heard him and were taught by him as (the) truth is in [the] Jesus. 22(I am telling you this) so according-to the former way-of-life your-laying aside the old man [the] corrupted according-to the lusts of-[the] deceit, 23and being-made-new in-the spirit of-the mind of-you, 24and putting-on the new man [the] created according-to God in righteousness and holiness of-the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Wherefore, laying-aside [the] falsehood, "You┘each └speakimpr (the) truth with the neighbor of-him," because we-are members of-one-another. 26"Be angry and do┘not└sin." Do┘not└let┘the sun└set on the anger of-you, 27neither give place to-the devil. 28Let┘the-one stealing no-longer└steal, but instead let-him-labor working with [his]ms hands the good-thing, in-order-that he-may-have to-share-with the-one having need. 29Let┘every harmful word not└go-out from the mouth of-you, but if any (is) good (word) to edification of-[the] need, in-order-that it might give grace to the hearers. 30And do┘not└grieve the Holy [the] Spirit of-[the] God, with whom you-were-sealed to (the) day of-redemption. 31Let┘all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and blasphemy└be-put-away from you with all hateful-feelings. 32But be kind to one-another, tenderhearted, gracious to-each-other, as also [the] God in Christ was-gracious to you.</span>
