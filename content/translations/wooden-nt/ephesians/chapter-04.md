## Ephesians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I, the/a prisoner in the Lord, urge you to walk worthily of-the calling which you-were called, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>with all humility and gentleness, with patience, being-patient-with one-another in love, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>being-diligent to-keep the unity of-the spirit in the bond of-[the] peace: <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>one body and one Spirit, as you are-called in one hope of-[the] calling of-you; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>one Lord, one faith, one baptism, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>one God and Father of-all, the-One over all and through all and in all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And to-each one of-you [the] grace was-given according-to the measure of-Christ. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Wherefore it-says, <strong>“Having-ascended on high he captured captivity;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e-gave gifts to-[the] men.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Now what is the ‘he-ascended’ but<sup>2</sup> that he┘also└descended into the lower [parts]<sup>ms</sup> of-the earth? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The-One having-descended is himself also the-One having-ascended about all the heavens, in-order-that he might-fill [the] all-things. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And <u>he</u> gave [the] apostles, and [the] prophets, and [the] evangelists, and [the] shepherds and teachers—<strong><sup>12</sup></strong>to the equipping of-the saints for (the) work of-ministry/service, for (the) building-up of-the body of-[the] Christ, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>until we┘[the] all└attain the unity of-[the] faith and the knowledge of-the Son of-[the] God unto (a) full-grown man, unto (the) stature of-the fullness of-[the] Christ, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>in-order-that we-may┘no-longer└be children tossed-around-by-waves-of-the-sea and blown around by every wind of-[the] doctrine—by the cunning of-[the] men, by (the) craftiness to [the] trickery of-[the] deception—<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but speaking-the-truth in love, let-us-grow-up into him with-respect-to-all-things, who is the head, Christ, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>from whom all [the] body fit-together and held-together by every ligament of-[the] support according-to (the) working in proper-measure of-each one part makes the growth of-the body into the building-up of-itself in love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Therefore I-say this and testify in (the) Lord, (that) your no-longer walking even-as also the Gentiles walk in (the) futility of-the mind of-them, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>being darkened in-the understanding (of-them), excluded-from the life of-[the] God on-account-of the ignorance [the] being in them, on-account-of the hardness of-the heart of-them, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>who, having-become-insensitive, gave┘themselves└over to-[the] indecency for (the) doing of-every impurity in covetousness, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>but <u>you</u> did┘not so└learn [the] Christ, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong>if you-heard him and were taught by him as (the) truth is in [the] Jesus. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>(I am telling you this) so according-to the former way-of-life your-laying aside the old man [the] corrupted according-to the lusts of-[the] deceit, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and being-made-new in-the spirit of-the mind of-you, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and putting-on the new man [the] created according-to God in righteousness and holiness of-the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Wherefore, laying-aside [the] falsehood, “<strong>Y</strong><strong>ou</strong>┘<strong>each</strong><strong> </strong>└<strong>speak</strong><strong><sup>impr</sup></strong><strong> (the) truth with the neighbor of-him</strong>,” because we-are members of-one-another. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>“<strong>Be</strong><strong> angry and </strong><strong>do┘not└sin</strong>.” Do┘not└let┘the sun└set on the anger of-you, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>neither give place to-the devil. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Let┘the-one stealing no-longer└steal, but instead let-him-labor working with [his]<sup>ms</sup> hands the good-thing, in-order-that he-may-have to-share-with the-one having need. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Let┘every harmful word not└go-out from the mouth of-you, but if any (is) good (word) to edification of-[the] need, in-order-that it might give grace to the hearers. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And do┘not└grieve the Holy [the] Spirit of-[the] God, with whom you-were-sealed to (the) day of-redemption. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Let┘all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and blasphemy└be-put-away from you with all hateful-feelings. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>But be kind to one-another, tenderhearted, gracious to-each-other, as also [the] God in Christ was-gracious to you.</span>
