## Ephesians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And (he made) you (alive), being dead by-[the] trespasses and the sins of-you, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>in which once you-walked according-to the age of-[the] this world, according-to the ruling-one of-the power of-the air, of-the spirit [the] now working in the sons of-[the] disobedience; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>among whom also we all once lived in the lusts of-the flesh, doing the desires of-the flesh and the minds, and we-were children by-nature of-wrath like the rest. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But [the] God, being rich in mercy on-account-of the great love of-him which he-loved us, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and we, being dead because-of trespasses, he-made-alive-with Christ—by-grace you have-been-saved—<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>raised┘us└up-with (him) and seated┘(us)└with (him) in the heavenly (places) in Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>in-order-that he-might-show in the ages [the-ones] coming the unlimited wealth of-the grace of-him in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For by-[the] grace you-have-been-saved<sup>2</sup> through trust/faith, and that (salvation is) not from you; it’s the gift of-God, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>not from works, in-order-that not anybody should boast. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For we-are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared-ahead-of-time in-order-that we should walk in them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Wherefore remember that you [the] Gentiles in (the) flesh, the-ones called uncircumcision by the called circumcision hand-done in (the) flesh, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>(remember) that at-[the] that time you-were without Christ, alienated/excluded-from the commonwealth of-[the] Israel, and foreigners of the covenants of-the promise, having no hope, and without-God in the world. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>But now in Christ Jesus you, the-ones once being afar-off, have-become near by the blood of-[the] Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> For <u>he</u> is the peace of-us, the-one having-made [the] both (groups) one, and having-destroyed/abolished the dividing-wall of-the barrier, in-order-that he-might┘in himself└create the two into one new mankind, making peace, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and might-reconcile-from [the] both in one body to-[the] God through the cross, having-put-to-death the enmity in himself. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And having-come, he-preached peace to-you the-ones far-off and peace to-the-ones near, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>because through him we┘[the] both└have [the] access in one Spirit to the Father. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So then you-are no-longer foreigners and sojourners, but you-are fellow-citizens of-the saints and members of-the-household of-[the] God, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>having-been-built on the foundation of-the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being (the) cornerstone, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>in whom (the) whole building, fit-together, grows into a) holy sanctuary in (the) Lord, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>in which/whom you also are-being-built-together into (a) house of-[the] God in (the) spirit.</span>
