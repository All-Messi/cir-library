<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-entered again into the synagogue, and (a) man was there having the/a had withered. 2And they-were-watching him whether he-would-head him on-the Sabbath[s], in-order-that they-might-accuse him. 3And he-says to-the man [the] having the withered him, "Get-up in the midst." 4And he-says to-them, "Is-it-lawful on-the Sabbath[s] to-do good or to-do-evil, to-save life or to-kill?" and they-kept-quiet. 5And having-looked-around-at them with anger, being-grieved over the hardness of-the heart of-them, he-says to-the man, "Stretch-out/hold-out the/your hand." And he-stretched/held┘it└out, and the hand of-him was-restored. 6And the Pharisees, having-gone-out immediately with the Herodians, began-to-give counsel against him in-order-that they-might-destroy him</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And [the] Jesus with the disciples of-him withdrew to-the sea, and (a) large crowd [was-following]ms (him) from [the] Galilee and from [the] Judaea 8and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan/Trans-Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon, (a) large crowd hearing as-many-things-as he-was-doing, were-coming to him. 9And he-said to-the disciples of-him in-order-that (a) boat might-be-ready for-him on-account-of the crowd in-order-that they-might┘not└throng him. 10For he-healed many, so-that they-were-pressing him in-order-that they-might-touch him—as-many-as were-having diseases. 11And the unclean [the] spirits, when they-would-see-him, they-would-fall-down-to him and would-cry-out, saying [that], "You are the Son of-[the] God." 12And he-would-strictly-charge them in-order-that they might┘not└make him manifest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-goes-up into the/a mountain and summons whom he was-wanting, and they-came-away to him. 14And he-made twelve [whom he┘also└named apostles]ms in-order-that they-might-be with him and in-order-that to-cast-out [the] demons. 16[And he made/appointed the twelve]ms even to-[the] Simon on-whom-he-put (the) name Peter; 17and James the (son) of-[the] Zebedee and John the brother of-[the] James; he-also put-on [them] (the) name[s]ms Boanerges, that is, "Sons of-Thunder"; and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the (son) of-[the] Alpheus and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananaean 19and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-comes in (the) house/home2, and again the-crowd is-coming-along so-that they-were┘not└able even to-eat bread. 21And the-ones beside him, having-heard, came-out to-seize him, for they-were-saying that he-was-out-of-his mind. 22And the scribes [the] from Jerusalem, having-traveled-down, were-trying-to-say that he-has/had Beelzebub, and that he-is/was-casting-out [the] demons by the ruler of-[the] demons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And having-summoned them, he-began-to-speak to-them in parables/illustrations, "How is┘Satan└able to-cast-out Satan? 24And if (a) kingdom is-divided against itself, [the] that kingdom is┘not└able to-stand. 25And if (a) household is-divided against itself, [the] that household will┘not└be-able to-stand. 26And if [the] Satan stands-up against himself and is-divided, he-is┘not└able to-stand, but has (an) end. 27But nobody is┘not└able, having-entered into the house of-the/a-strong-(man), to-plunder the vessels of-him unless2 he┘first└binds the strong-(man), and then he-will-plunder the house of-him. 28Truly I-tell you that all [the] sins and [the] blasphemies will-be-forgiven to-the sons of-[the] men as-many-as2 they-blaspheme. 29But whoever2 blasphemes [at] the Holy [the] Spirit, he-does┘not└have forgiveness unto the age/forever3, but is guilty of-(an)-eternal/permanent sin." (30because they-were-trying-to say, "He-has (an) unclean spirit.")</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the mother of-him and the brothers of-him comes[s] and; standing outside, they-sent to-him, calling him. 32And (a) crowd was-sitting around him, and they-say to-him, "Behold, the mother of-you and the brothers of-you [and the sisters of-you]ms are-seeking you outside."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And having-answered, he-says to-them, "Who is the mother of-me and the brothers [of-me]ms?" 34And having-looked-around-at the-ones sitting in-a-circle around him, he-says, "Behold, the mother of-me and the brother of-me. 35[For]ms whoever2 does the will of-[the] God—this is (a) brother of-me and (a) sister and mother."</span>
