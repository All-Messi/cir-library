## Mark Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And again he-began to-teach beside the sea. And (a) very-large crowd is-gathering to-him, so-that him having-gotten into (a) boat to-sit-down on the sea, and all the crowd were/was by the sea on the ground. 2And he-was-teaching them many-things in parables, and he-was-saying to-them in the teaching of him, 4"Listen. Behold, the/a sower went-out to-sow, and it-happened in the sowing (that) some (seed) fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate┘it└up. 5And other (seed) sell on [the] rocky-ground where it-was┘not└having much soil, and immediately it-sprouted on-account-of [the] not to-have/having depth of-soil; 6and when the sun rose-up, it-was-scorched and on-account-of the not to-have/having root it-withered. 7And other (seed) fell in the thorns, and the thorns grew-up and choked┘it└out, and it-did┘not└give fruit. 8And others fell on [the] good ground, and it-was-giving fruit , growing-up and increasing, and it-was-bearing one third-fold and one sixty-fold and some (a) hundredfold." 9And he-was-saying, "Who has ears, let him to-hear, let-him hear."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And when he-became according-to only/alone2, the-ones around him with the disciples began-to-ask him the parables. 11And he-was-saying to-them, "To-you it-has-been-given the mystery of-the kingdom of-[the] God. But to-those [the] outside [the] all-things occur in parables, 12in-order-that</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-says to-them, "Do-you┘not└understand [the] this parable, and how will-you-understand any of the parables? 14The sower sows the word. 15And these-some-(people) are the-ones 'beside the road,' where the word is-being-sown; and when they-hear (it), immediately [the] Satan comes and takes the word [the] sown in them. 16And these/some-(people) are the-ones being-sown on the rocky-(place)s, who when they-hear the word immediately they-receive it with joy, 17and they-do┘not└have root in themselves, but are temporary. Then tribulation or persecution coming on-account-of the word, immediately they-give-up. 18And others are the-(people) being-sown in the thorns; these are the-ones having-heard the word, 19and the worries of-the world/age and the deceitfulness of-[the] wealth and the desires concerning [the] other-things entering-in choke-out the word and it-becomes unfruitful. 20And those-others are the-ones having-been-sown on the good [the] ground who have the word and welcome (it) and bear-fruit, one third-fold and sixty-fold and one (a) hundredfold."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, "The/A lamp does┘not┘┘└come in-order-that it-may-be-put under the/a basket, └└does it? (Does it) not (come) in-order-that it-may-be-put on the/a lampstand? 22For it-is not hidden unless3 it-may-be-manifested, neither did-it-become secret but in-order-that it-might-come into apparent. 23If anybody has ears to-hear, let-him-hear."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, "Watch-out what you-hear. In what measure you-measure it-will-be-measured to-you and it-will-be-added to-you. 25For who has, it-will-be-given to-him, and who does┘└have, even what he-has will-be-taken from him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And he-was-saying, "Thus is the kingdom of-[the] God like (a) man casts [the] seed on the ground, 27and he-goes-to-bed and gets-up night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows as he does┘not└know. 28The ground by-itself bears-fruit, first (the) blade, then (the) head-of-grain, then the full-grain in the head. 29And when the fruit/crop permits, he-immediately sends the scythe, because [the] harvest came."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And he-was-saying, "How shall-we-liken the kingdom of-[the] God or in what parable shall-we-set┘it└forth? 31(It is) like (a) mustard seed that when it-is-sown on the ground, being smaller than-all the seeds [the] on the ground, 32and when it-is-sown, it-comes-up and becomes bigger than-all the garden-plants and makes big branches so-that [the] birds of the sky are-able to-nest under the shade of-it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And with many such parables, he-was-speaking the word to-them even-as they-were-able to-hear. 34And without (a) parable he-was┘not└speaking to-them, but according-to one's own2/privately2 he-would-explain all-things to-[the] his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And he-says to-them in that [the] day, evening having-come, "Let-us-go to the other side." 36And having-left the crowd, they-were-taking┘him└along as he-was in the boat, and other boats were with him. 37And (a) severe storm of-wind comes and the waves were-splashing into the boat, so-that already the boat was-tending-to-sink.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And he was in the stern, sleeping on the/a cushion, and they-rouse him, and say to-him, "Teacher, is-it┘not└ (a)-concern to-you that we-are-perishing?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And having-been-roused, he-rebuked the wind and said to-the sea, "Be-calm; be-quiet." And wind died-down and (a) great calm came-to-be. 40And he-said to-them, "Why are-you timid? Do-you┘not-yet└have faith?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And they-feared (a) great fear, and they-began-to-say to one-another, "Who then is this-One that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</span>
