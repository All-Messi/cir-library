<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And they-came into the other-side of-the sea into the country of-the Gerasenes. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And he having-gotten-out of the boat, immediately (a) man will (an) unclean spirit met him out-of the tombs, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>who was-having the/his dwelling-among the tombs, and nobody any-longer was┘not└able to-bind him with-(a)-chain <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>on-account-of [the] him bound many-times with shackles and chains and the chain to-be-torn-apart by him and the shackles to-be-broken-in-pieces, and nobody was-strong to-subdue him. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And through every night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he-was crying-out and cutting himself with-stones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And having-seen [the] Jesus from a-long-ways-off, he-ran and fell-down-to him, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and having-cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, he-says, <em>“What to-me and to-you</em><em>, Jesus, Son of-[the]</em><em> God Most-High?</em><em> </em><em>I-adjure you with-respect-to-[the] God, </em><em>do┘not└torment</em><em> me.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For he-was-saying to-it, <em>“[The] unclean [the] spirit, come-out of the man.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And he-began-to-say to-him, <em>“What (is) (the) name to-you?”</em><em> </em> And it-says to-him, <em>“Legion (is) (the) name to-me, because we-are many.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And it-was appealing-to him many-things/much in-order-that he┘not└send them out-of the country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And (a) large herd of-pigs was there on the mountain feeding; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and they-appealed-to him, saying, <em>“Send us into the pigs in-order-that we-may-enter into them.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And allowed them; and the unclean [the] spirit, having-gone-out, entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep-place into the sea, about two-thousand and drowned in the sea. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the-ones tending them fled and reported (it) in the town and in the fields. And they-people-came to-see what is/was the-thing occurred. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And they-come to [the] Jesus and they-see the-one being-demon-possessed sitting clothed and being-in-his-right-mind, the-one having-had the legion, and they-were-afraid. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And the-ones having-seen related to-them how it-happened to-the-one being-demon-possessed and about the pigs. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And they-began to-appealed-to him to-go-away from the regions of-them. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And he getting into the boat, the-one being-demon-possessed began-to-appeal-to him in-order-that he-might-be with him. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And he-did┘not└let him, but says to-him, <em>“Go to the house of-you, to [the] your (people), and report to-them as-many-things-as the Lord has-done for-you and was-merciful-to you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And he-went-away and began to-preach in the Decapolis as-many-things-as [the] Jesus did for-him, and all were-being-amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus having-crossed-over [in the boat]<sup>ms</sup> again to the other-side, (a) big crowd gathered-together to-him, and he-was beside the sea. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And one of-the synagogue-rulers, Jairus by-name, comes and, having-seen him, falls to the feet of-him <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and appeals-to him many-things/much, saying [that], <em>“The little-daughter of-me has/is at-the-end, in-order-that having-come you-might-day</em><em>┘[the] </em><em>hands└</em><em>on</em><em> her in-order-that having-come you-might-be-saved and she-might-</em><em>live.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And she-went-away with him. And (a) big crowd was-following him and was-crowding-around him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And (a) woman—being in (a) hemorrhage of-blood for-twelve years <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and having-suffered many-things by many doctors and having-spent all the-things to her and having-profited nothing but rather having-come into the worse, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>having-heard concerning [the] Jesus, having-comer in the crowd behind—touched the garment of-him, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>for she-was-saying [that], <em>“If </em><em>I┘even└touch</em><em> the clothes of-him, I-will-be saved.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And immediately the plague of-the blood of-her was-dried-up, and she-knew with-the body that she-is/was-healed from the scourge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>And immediately [the] Jesus, having-known in himself (that) [the] power having-gone-out of him, having-turned-around in-the crowd, was-saying, <em>“Who touched the clothes of-me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>And the disciples of-him were-saying to-him, <em>“You-see the crowd crowding you, and you-say, ‘Who touched me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>And he-kept-looking-around to-see the-one having-done this. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And the woman, having-been-afraid and trembling, knowing what-thing has/had-happened to-her, came and fell-down-to him and told to-him all the truth. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And the/he said to-her, <em>“Daughter, the faith of-you has-saved you; go in peace and be healthy from the scourge.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>He yet talking, they-come from the synagogue-ruler, saying [that], <em>“The daughter of-you died.</em><em> </em><em>Why yet bother the Teacher?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>But [the] Jesus to-the synagogue-ruler, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not└be-afraid</em><em>; just believe.”</em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And he-did┘not└allow nobody/anybody to-follow except<sup>2</sup> [the] Peter and James and John the brother of-James. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And they-come into the house of-the synagogue-ruler, and he-sees (a) commotion and (people) crying and (people)-wailing many things/much, <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>and having-entered he-says to-them, <em>“Why are-you-making-a-commotion and crying?</em><em> </em><em>The young-child </em><em>did┘not└die</em><em> but is-sleeping.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>And they-started-laughing-at him. And <u>he</u>, having-put┘all└out, takes-along the father of-the child and the mother and the-ones with him and goes-in where the young-child was. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And having-taken-hold of the hand of-the young-child, he-says to-her, <em>“Talitha, qum,”</em> (that is, being-translated, <em>‘</em><em>[The] litt</em><em>le-girl, I-say to-you, get-up.’</em>)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>And immediately the young-girl got-up and began-to-walk; for she-was of-twelve years. And [immediately]<sup>ms</sup> they-were-amazed with-great amazement. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And he-ordered them many-things/much in-order-that nobody should-know this-thing, and he-said to-give her (something) to-eat.</span>
