<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And having-seen [the] Jesus from a-long-ways-off, he-ran and fell-down-to him, 7and having-cried-out with-(a)-loud voice, he-says, "What to-me and to-you, Jesus, Son of-[the] God Most-High? I-adjure you with-respect-to-[the] God, do┘not└torment me." 8For he-was-saying to-it, "[The] unclean [the] spirit, come-out of the man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he-began-to-say to-him, "What (is) (the) name to-you?" And it-says to-him, "Legion (is) (the) name to-me, because we-are many." 10And it-was appealing-to him many-things/much in-order-that he┘not└send them out-of the country.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And (a) large herd of-pigs was there on the mountain feeding; 12and they-appealed-to him, saying, "Send us into the pigs in-order-that we-may-enter into them." 13And allowed them; and the unclean [the] spirit, having-gone-out, entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep-place into the sea, about two-thousand and drowned in the sea. 14And the-ones tending them fled and reported (it) in the town and in the fields. And they-people-came to-see what is/was the-thing occurred. 15And they-come to [the] Jesus and they-see the-one being-demon-possessed sitting clothed and being-in-his-right-mind, the-one having-had the legion, and they-were-afraid. 16And the-ones having-seen related to-them how it-happened to-the-one being-demon-possessed and about the pigs. 17And they-began to-appealed-to him to-go-away from the regions of-them. 18And he getting into the boat, the-one being-demon-possessed began-to-appeal-to him in-order-that he-might-be with him. 19And he-did┘not└let him, but says to-him, "Go to the house of-you, to [the] your (people), and report to-them as-many-things-as the Lord has-done for-you and was-merciful-to you." 20And he-went-away and began to-preach in the Decapolis as-many-things-as [the] Jesus did for-him, and all were-being-amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And [the] Jesus having-crossed-over [in the boat]ms again to the other-side, (a) big crowd gathered-together to-him, and he-was beside the sea. 22And one of-the synagogue-rulers, Jairus by-name, comes and, having-seen him, falls to the feet of-him 23and appeals-to him many-things/much, saying [that], "The little-daughter of-me has/is at-the-end, in-order-that having-come you-might-day┘[the] hands└on her in-order-that having-come you-might-be-saved and she-might-live." 24And she-went-away with him. And (a) big crowd was-following him and was-crowding-around him. 25And (a) woman—being in (a) hemorrhage of-blood for-twelve years 26and having-suffered many-things by many doctors and having-spent all the-things to her and having-profited nothing but rather having-come into the worse, 27having-heard concerning [the] Jesus, having-comer in the crowd behind—touched the garment of-him, 28for she-was-saying [that], "If I┘even└touch the clothes of-him, I-will-be saved." 29And immediately the plague of-the blood of-her was-dried-up, and she-knew with-the body that she-is/was-healed from the scourge.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And immediately [the] Jesus, having-known in himself (that) [the] power having-gone-out of him, having-turned-around in-the crowd, was-saying, "Who touched the clothes of-me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the disciples of-him were-saying to-him, "You-see the crowd crowding you, and you-say, 'Who touched me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And he-kept-looking-around to-see the-one having-done this. 33And the woman, having-been-afraid and trembling, knowing what-thing has/had-happened to-her, came and fell-down-to him and told to-him all the truth. 34And the/he said to-her, "Daughter, the faith of-you has-saved you; go in peace and be healthy from the scourge."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He yet talking, they-come from the synagogue-ruler, saying [that], "The daughter of-you died. Why yet bother the Teacher?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> But [the] Jesus to-the synagogue-ruler, "Do┘not└be-afraid; just believe." 37And he-did┘not└allow nobody/anybody to-follow except2 [the] Peter and James and John the brother of-James. 38And they-come into the house of-the synagogue-ruler, and he-sees (a) commotion and (people) crying and (people)-wailing many things/much, 39and having-entered he-says to-them, "Why are-you-making-a-commotion and crying? The young-child did┘not└die but is-sleeping."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And they-started-laughing-at him. And he, having-put┘all└out, takes-along the father of-the child and the mother and the-ones with him and goes-in where the young-child was. 41And having-taken-hold of the hand of-the young-child, he-says to-her, "Talitha, qum," (that is, being-translated, '[The] little-girl, I-say to-you, get-up.')</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And immediately the young-girl got-up and began-to-walk; for she-was of-twelve years. And [immediately]ms they-were-amazed with-great amazement. 43And he-ordered them many-things/much in-order-that nobody should-know this-thing, and he-said to-give her (something) to-eat.</span>
