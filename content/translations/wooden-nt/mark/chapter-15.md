## Mark Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And immediately early-in-the-morning, the chief-priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin holding session, having-bound [the] Jesus, brought (him) out and delivered (him) to-Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate asked him, <em>“Are you the king of-the Jews?”</em> And the/he, having-answered, says to-him, <em>“You say/yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the chief-priests were-accusing┘him└of many-things. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And again [the] Pilate was-asking him, saying, <em>“</em><em>You-are┘not└answering</em><em> nothing/anything?</em><em> </em><em>Behold, how-many-things </em><em>they-are-accusing┘you└</em><em>of</em><em>!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But [the] Jesus no-longer answered nothing/anything, so-that [the] Pilate was-amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And according-to (the) feast/at-every-feast he-used-to-release to-them one prisoner that they-would-ask-for. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And the-one called Barabbas was imprisoned with [the] insurrectionists who<sup>pl</sup><sup> </sup>had-committed murder in the insurrection. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the crowd, having-gone-up, began to-ask even-as he-customarily-did for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate answered them, saying, <em>“Do-you-want (that) I-should-release to-you the king of-the Jews?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For he-knew that on-account-of jealousy the chief-priests had-delivered-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But the chief-priests stirred-up the crowd [in-order]-that rather he-should release [the] Barabbas to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate again having-answered, was-saying to-them, <em>“What then [do-you-want]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> (that) I-should-do</em><em>-with</em><em> [whom you-call]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> the king of-the Jews?</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the/they shouted again, <em>“Crucify him!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate kept-saying to-them, <em>“For what evil-thing did-he-do?”</em> But the/they shouted all-the-more, <em>“Crucify him!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate, willing to-do the sufficient-thing for-the crowd, released [the] Barabbas to-them, and delivered [the] Jesus, having-been-scourged, [in-order]-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the soldiers took┘him└away inside the palace, that is, (the) Praetorium, and called-together the whole band. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And they-dress┘him└in purple, and, having-weaved (a) thorn crown, put┘it└on him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And they-began to-acclaim him, <em>“Hail, king of-the Jews.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And they-kept-beating the head of-him with-(a)-reed and kept-spitting-on him and putting the knees/kneeling, they-were-bowing-to him. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And when they-mocked him, they-undressed┘him└in the purple and dressed┘him└in the garments of-him, and they-lead┘him└away in-order-that they-might-crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And they-conscript (a) certain passerby, Simon (the) Cyrenian, coming from the country, the father of-Alexander and Rufus in-order-that he-might-carry the cross of-him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And they-bring him to [the] Golgotha place, (that is, translated ‘Place of-(the)-Skull.’) <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And they-crucify him. And they-divide-up the clothes of-him, casting lot over them who would-take what.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And it-was (the) third hour and they-crucified him. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>And the superscription of-the cause of-him was written, <em>“The king of-the Jews.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And two insurrectionists they-crucify with him, one on (the) right and one on the left of-him. [[<strong><sup>28</sup></strong>]]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And the-ones going-past were-hurling-abuse-at him, shaking the heads of-them and saying, “<em>Ha, the-one tearing-down the sanctuary and building (it) in three days, </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>save</em><em> yourself, having-come-down from the cross.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the chief-priests likewise were-saying, <em>“He-saved others; </em><em>he-is┘not└able</em><em> to-save himself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> Messiah, the king of-Israel, let-him-come-down now from the cross, in-order-that we-may-see and believe.”</em><em> </em> And the-ones crucified with him kept-insulting him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And (the) sixth hour having-come darkness came on the whole [the] land until the ninth hour. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And at-the ninth hour [the] Jesus shouted with-(a)-loud voice, <strong><em>“Eloi, Eloi, </em></strong><strong><em>lema</em></strong><strong><em> sabachthani”</em></strong><em>;</em> (that is, translated, <strong><em>“[The] God of-me, [the] God of-me, unto what did-you-forsake me?”</em></strong>)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And some of-the-ones standing-by, having-heard, started-saying, <em>“Behold, he-is-calling Elijah.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And (a)-certain-one having-run [and]<sup>ms</sup>, having-filled (a) sponge with-sour-wine, having-put (it) on-a-reed, he-gave┘him└ (a) drink, saying, <em>“Let (that) we-see that if-Elijah comes </em><em>to-take┘him└down</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-let-out (a) loud voice, breathed-the last. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>And the curtain of-the-sanctuary was-split into two from top to bottom. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>Behold, and the centurion [the] standing out across-from him, having-seen that thus he-gave-up the breath, said, <em>“Truly this [the] man was (the) Son of God.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And women also were off afar, watching, among whom (were) Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of-James the Less and of-Joses, and Salome. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>The/they when he-was in Galilee, were-following him and they-were-ministering to-him, and many others, (women) [the] coming-up-with him to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And already evening having-come, because it-was Preparation, that is, for-(the)-Sabbath, <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>Joseph [the]<sup>ms</sup> from Arimathea, having-gone, (a) prominent Council member, who also was waiting-for the kingdom of-[the] God, having-gathered-courage, went-in to [the] Pilate and asked-for the body of-the Jesus. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate wondered whether already he-has/had-died; and, having-summoned the centurion, asked him whether he-died already. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>And having-known from the centurion, he-granted the corpse to-[the] Joseph. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And having-bought (a) linen-cloth, having-taken┘him└down, he-wrapped┘him└in the linen-cloth, and put him in (a) tomb that was hewn out-of (the) rock, and rolled (a) stone over the entrance of-the tomb. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>And [the] Mary the Magdalene and Mary the (mother) of-Joses were-watching where he-has/had-been laid.</span>
