## Mark Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And immediately early-in-the-morning, the chief-priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin holding session, having-bound [the] Jesus, brought (him) out and delivered (him) to-Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And [the] Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of-the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the chief-priests were-accusing┘him└of many-things. 4And again [the] Pilate was-asking him, saying, "You-are┘not└answering nothing/anything? Behold, how-many-things they-are-accusing┘you└of!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But [the] Jesus no-longer answered nothing/anything, so-that [the] Pilate was-amazed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And according-to (the) feast/at-every-feast he-used-to-release to-them one prisoner that they-would-ask-for. 7And the-one called Barabbas was imprisoned with [the] insurrectionists whopl had-committed murder in the insurrection. 8And the crowd, having-gone-up, began to-ask even-as he-customarily-did for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And [the] Pilate answered them, saying, "Do-you-want (that) I-should-release to-you the king of-the Jews?" 10For he-knew that on-account-of jealousy the chief-priests had-delivered-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But the chief-priests stirred-up the crowd [in-order]-that rather he-should release [the] Barabbas to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And [the] Pilate again having-answered, was-saying to-them, "What then [do-you-want]ms (that) I-should-do-with [whom you-call]ms the king of-the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the/they shouted again, "Crucify him!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Pilate kept-saying to-them, "For what evil-thing did-he-do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And [the] Pilate, willing to-do the sufficient-thing for-the crowd, released [the] Barabbas to-them, and delivered [the] Jesus, having-been-scourged, [in-order]-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the soldiers took┘him└away inside the palace, that is, (the) Praetorium, and called-together the whole band. 17And they-dress┘him└in purple, and, having-weaved (a) thorn crown, put┘it└on him. 18And they-began to-acclaim him, "Hail, king of-the Jews." 19And they-kept-beating the head of-him with-(a)-reed and kept-spitting-on him and putting the knees/kneeling, they-were-bowing-to him. 20And when they-mocked him, they-undressed┘him└in the purple and dressed┘him└in the garments of-him, and they-lead┘him└away in-order-that they-might-crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And they-conscript (a) certain passerby, Simon (the) Cyrenian, coming from the country, the father of-Alexander and Rufus in-order-that he-might-carry the cross of-him. 22And they-bring him to [the] Golgotha place, (that is, translated 'Place of-(the)-Skull.') 24And they-crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And it-was (the) third hour and they-crucified him. 26And the superscription of-the cause of-him was written, "The king of-the Jews." 27And two insurrectionists they-crucify with him, one on (the) right and one on the left of-him. [[28]]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And the-ones going-past were-hurling-abuse-at him, shaking the heads of-them and saying, "Ha, the-one tearing-down the sanctuary and building (it) in three days, 30save yourself, having-come-down from the cross.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And the chief-priests likewise were-saying, "He-saved others; he-is┘not└able to-save himself. 32The Messiah, the king of-Israel, let-him-come-down now from the cross, in-order-that we-may-see and believe."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And (the) sixth hour having-come darkness came on the whole [the] land until the ninth hour. 34And at-the ninth hour [the] Jesus shouted with-(a)-loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani"; (that is, translated, "[The] God of-me, [the] God of-me, unto what did-you-forsake me?")</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And some of-the-ones standing-by, having-heard, started-saying, "Behold, he-is-calling Elijah.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And (a)-certain-one having-run [and]ms, having-filled (a) sponge with-sour-wine, having-put (it) on-a-reed, he-gave┘him└ (a) drink, saying, "Let (that) we-see that if-Elijah comes to-take┘him└down."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-let-out (a) loud voice, breathed-the last. 38And the curtain of-the-sanctuary was-split into two from top to bottom. 39Behold, and the centurion [the] standing out across-from him, having-seen that thus he-gave-up the breath, said, "Truly this [the] man was (the) Son of God." 40And women also were off afar, watching, among whom (were) Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of-James the Less and of-Joses, and Salome. 41The/they when he-was in Galilee, were-following him and they-were-ministering to-him, and many others, (women) [the] coming-up-with him to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And already evening having-come, because it-was Preparation, that is, for-(the)-Sabbath, 43Joseph [the]ms from Arimathea, having-gone, (a) prominent Council member, who also was waiting-for the kingdom of-[the] God, having-gathered-courage, went-in to [the] Pilate and asked-for the body of-the Jesus. 44And [the] Pilate wondered whether already he-has/had-died; and, having-summoned the centurion, asked him whether he-died already. 45And having-known from the centurion, he-granted the corpse to-[the] Joseph. 46And having-bought (a) linen-cloth, having-taken┘him└down, he-wrapped┘him└in the linen-cloth, and put him in (a) tomb that was hewn out-of (the) rock, and rolled (a) stone over the entrance of-the tomb. 47And [the] Mary the Magdalene and Mary the (mother) of-Joses were-watching where he-has/had-been laid.</span>
