## Mark Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The beginning of-the gospel of-Jesus Messiah, (the) Son of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Even-as it-is-written in [the] Isaiah the prophet, <strong><em>“Behold, I-will-sent the messenger of-me before (the) face of-you,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>w</em></strong><strong><em>ho will-thoroughly-prepared the way of-you,</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <strong><em>(</em></strong><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>he) voice of-one-calling-out in the desert,</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	‘Prepare the way of-(the)-</em></strong><strong><em>Lord;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>m</em></strong><strong><em>ake the paths </em></strong><em>of-him</em><strong><em> straight.’”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> John came baptizing in the desert and preaching (a) baptism of-repentance for remission of-sins. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And all [the] Judaea country and all the Jerusalemites were-going-out to him, and were-being-baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing the sins of-them; <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and [the] John was dressed-in hair[s] of-(a)-camel, and (a) leather belt (was) around the waist of-him, and (he was) eating locusts and wild/field honey.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And he-was-preaching, saying, <em>“[The] One stronger than I is-coming after me, of-whom I-am not worthy, having-stooped-down, to-loosen the/a strap of</em><em>-the sandals of-him. </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em><u>I</u></em><em> baptized you with-water, but </em><em><u>he</u></em><em> will-baptize you with (the) Holy Spirit.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And it-happened in those [the] days (that) Jesus came from Nazareth of-[the] Galilee and was-baptized in the Jordan by John. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And immediately, coming-up out-of the water, he-saw the skies being-divided and the Spirit like (a) dove descending on him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And (a) voice came out-of the skies, “<em>You are the beloved [the] Son of-me; in you I-delighted.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And immediately the Spirit takes┘(him)└out into the desert. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And he-was in the desert for-forty days, being-tested by [the] Satan; and he-was with the wild-animals, and [the] angels were-ministering to-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And after [the] John’s [the] being-put-in-prison, [the] Jesus went into [the] Galilee, preaching the gospel of-[the] God, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>and saying, [that], <em>“The time is-fulfilled</em><em>,</em><em> and the kingdom of-[the] God has-come-near.</em><em> </em><em>Repent and believe in the gospel.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And passing along the Sea of-[the] Galilee, he-saw Simon and Andrew the brother of-Simon, casting-nets in the sea, for they-were fishermen. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“Come after me, and I-will-make you to-become fishermen of-men.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And immediately having-left the/their nets, they-followed him. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And having-gone-forward, he-saw James the (son) of-[the] Zebedee and John the brother of-him, and them mending [the] nets in the boat. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And immediately he-called them; and having-left the father of-them, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired-hands, they-went-away after him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And they-enter into Capernaum and immediately on-the Sabbath[s], having-entered into the synagogue, he-began-to-teach. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And they-were-being-amazed at the teaching of-him, for he-was teaching then as one-having authority, and not like the scribes. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And immediately in the synagogue of-them was (a) man with (an) unclean spirit; and it-shouted-out, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>saying, <em>“What to-us and to-you, Jesus Nazarene?</em><em> </em><em>Did-you-come</em><em> </em><em>to-destroy</em><em> us?</em><em> </em><em>I-know you who you-are—the </em><em>Holy One of-[the] God!</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And [the] Jesus rebuked it, saying,<em> “Be-quiet</em><em>,</em><em> and come-out of him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the unclean [the] spirit, having-convulsed him and having-cried-out with (a) loud noise, came out-of him. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And they┘all└were-shocked, so-that they-debated with each-other, saying, <em>“W</em><em>hat is this?</em><em> </em><em>A new teaching </em><em>a</em><em>ccording-to</em><em> authority</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>E</em><em>ven the unclean [the] spirits </em><em>he-commands</em><em>,</em><em> and they-obey him.”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And the report of-him went-out immediately everywhere in the whole region of-[the] Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And immediately, having-gone-out from the synagogue, they-went into the house of-Simon and Andrew with James and John. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And the mother-in-law of-Simon was-lying-down, having-(a)-fever, and immediately they-speak to-him concerning her. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And having-come-to (her), he-raised┘her└up, having-taken hold of-the/her hand; and the fever left her, and she-started serving them. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And evening having-come, when the sun set, they-were-bringing to him all the-ones having evilly and the-ones being-demon-possessed. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And the whole town was gathered to the door, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and he-healed all having evilly with-various diseases; and he-cast-out many demons, and he-would not allow the demons to-speak because they-knew him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And very early before dawn, he-went-out and he-went-away into (an) unpopulated place and-there he-was-praying. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And Simon and the-ones with him searched-for him; <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>and they-found him and said to-him [that], <em>“All are looking-for you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And he-says to-them, <em>“Let-us-go elsewhere into the surrounding towns in-order-that also there I-may-preach, for I-came-out unto this.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And he-went preaching in the synagogues of-them in the whole (of) Galilee and casting-out demons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And (a) leper comes to him, appealing-to him, [and kneeling]<sup>ms</sup> and saying to-him [that], <em>“If you-are-willing, you-are-able to-heal me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And having-been-moved-with-compassion, having-stretched/reached out the hand of-him, he-touched (him) and says to-him, <em>“I-am-wi</em><em>l</em><em>ling”; be-cleansed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And immediately the leprosy went-away from him, and he-was-cleansed. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And having-spoken-strictly to-him, he-sent┘him└out immediately. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And he-says to-him, <em>“See (that) you-say nothing to-nobody/anybody, but</em><em> go show yourself-to the priest</em><em> and offer concerning the cleansing of-you what-things Moses commanded unto (a) testimony to-them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> But the/he, having-gone-out, began to-tell all-things and to-spread┘the message└around, so-that him no-longer was-able openly to-enter into (a) town, but he-was outside in unpopulated places; and (people) would-come to him from everywhere.</span>
