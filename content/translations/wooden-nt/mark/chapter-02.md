## Mark Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-entered again into Capernaum through days, it-was-heard that he-is/was at home. 2And many came-together so-that no-longer the-things at the door [not] to-have-room, and he-began-to-speak to-them the word. 3And they/some-people come, bringing to him (a) paralytic, being-carried by four. 4And not being-able to-bring him (him) to-him on-account-of the crowd, they-unroofed the roof where he-was; and, having-dug-out, they-lower the bed-roll where the paralytic was-lying. 5And [the] Jesus, having-seen the faith of-them, says to-the paralytic, "Son, the sins of-you are-being-forgiven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And some of-the scribes were-sitting there and reasoning in the hearts of-them, 7"Why is┘this-One└speaking thus? He-is-blaspheming. Who is-able to-forgive sins except2 One, [the] God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And immediately [the] Jesus, having-known by-the spirit of-him that thus they-are/were-reasoning in themselves, says to-them, "Why are-you-reasoning these-things in the hearts of-you? 9Which is easier, to-say to-the paralytic, 'The sins of-you are-being-forgiven,' or to-say, 'Get-up and pick-up the bed-roll of-you and walk.'? 10But in-order-that you-may-know that the Son of-[the] Man has authority on [the] earth to-forgive sins"—he-says to-the paralytic, 11I-say to-you, get-up, pick-up the bed-roll of-you and go to the house of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And he-got-up and immediately, having-picked-up the/his bed-roll, went-out in-front-of all, so-that all are/were-amazed and were-glorifying the God, saying [that], "Thus not-at-any-time did-we see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-went-out again to the sea, and all the crowd was-coming to-him, and he-began-to-teach them. 14And passing-along, he-saw Levi the (son) of-[the] Alpheus, sitting at the tax-station, and he-says to-him, "Follow me." And, having-stood-up, he-followed him. 15And it-happens him to-be-reclining in the house of-him, and/that many tax-collectors and sinners were-reclining-with [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him, for they-were many and they-were-following him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the scribes of-the Pharisees, having-seen that he-is/was-eating with [the] sinners and publicans, began-to-say to-the disciples of-him [that], "Why is-he-eating with [the] tax-collectors and sinners?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-heard, says to-them [that]ms, "The-ones being-strong/healthy do┘not└have need of-(a)-doctor, but the-ones having badly. I-did┘not└come to-call righteous-ones but sinners."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And the disciples of-John and the Pharisees were accustomed-to-fasting, and they-come to-him and say, "On-account-of what do┘the disciples of-John and the disciples of-the Pharisees└fast, but the disciples to-you do┘not└fast?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "The sons of-the groom are┘not└able to-fast in which/while2 the groom is with them, are-they? For-such time-as they-have the groom with them, they-are┘not└able to-fast. 20But days will-come when the groom will-be-taken from them. And then they-will-fast in that [the] day." 21"Nobody sews on (an) old garment (a) patch of-unsanforized/unshrunk cloth. And if-not/otherwise2, the fullness takes-away from it, the new of-the old, and (a) worse (the) tear becomes, 22and nobody puts new wine in old wineskins. And if-not/otherwise2 the wine will-burst the wineskins, and the wine and the wineskins are-lost. But new wine (goes) into new wineskins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And it-happened, him on the Sabbath[s] to-be-going-along through the grain-fields, and/that the disciples of-him began to-make (their) way plucking-off the heads-of-grain.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And the Pharisees started-saying to-him, "Behold, why are-they-doing on-the Sabbath[s] what is┘not└lawful?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And he-says to-them, "Did-you┘at-any-time-not/never└read what David did when he-had need, and he and the-ones with him was/were-hungry, 26how he-entered into the house of-[the] God at-the-time-of Abiathar (the) priest and ate the bread of-[the] presentation, which to-eat is┘not└lawful except2 for-[the] priests, and he-gave (it) also to the-ones being with him?" 27And he-says to-them, "The Sabbath became on-account-of [the] man and not [the] man on-account-of the Sabbath. 28So-that they Son of-[the] Man is Lord also of-the Sabbath."</span>
