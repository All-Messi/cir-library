## Mark Chapter **16**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the Sabbath having passed, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the (mother) of-[the] James, and Salome bought spices in-order-that, having-come, they-might-anoint-him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And very early on-the one (day) of-the week[s], they-come to the tomb, the-sun having-risen. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And they-were-saying to each-other, <em>“Who will-roll-away the stone for-us from the entrance of-the tomb?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And having-looked-up, they-see that the stone has-been-been-rolled-away, for it-was exceedingly large. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And having-entered into the tomb, they-saw (a) young-man sitting on the right clothed-with (a) white robe, and they-were astonished.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>But the/he says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>be-astonished</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>You-are-looking-for Jesus the Nazarene, the-one crucified; he-arose; he is not here.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the place where </em><em>they-laid</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>B</em><em>ut</em><em> go tell the disciples of-him—</em><em>and [the] </em><em>Peter [that], ‘</em><em>He-is-going-ahead-of you in</em><em>to [the] Galilee.</em><em> </em><em>There you-will-see him, even-as he-said to-you.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>And having-gone out, they-fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had them, and they-said nothing to-nobody/anybody, for they-were afraid. [[<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And having-arisen early on-the first (day) of-(the)-week, he-appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom he-had-cast-out seven demons. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>That-one<sup>fem</sup>, having-gone, reported to-the-ones being with him, grieving<sup>pl</sup> and crying. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And-those, having-heard that he-was-alive and was-seen by her, disbelieved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And after these-things, he-appeared to-two of them in another form, walking, traveling in (the) country. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And-those going-away reported to-the rest; they-did┘not└believe those either.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And afterwards he-appeared to-the eleven themselves reclining-at-table, and he-reproached their disbelief and hardheartedness, because they-disbelieved the-ones having-seen him, having-been-raised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And he-said to-them, <em>“Having-gone into all the world, preach the gospel to-every [the] </em><em>creature</em><em>/</em><em>created-one.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>The</em><em>-one having-believed and having-been-baptized will-be</em><em>-saved, but the-one disbelievin</em><em>g will-be-condemned.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> these signs will-follow the-ones having-believed:</em><em> </em><em>in the name of-me they-will-cast-out demons, they-will-speak in new languages, </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>[and in the/</em><em>their </em><em>hands]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>;</em><em> they-will-pick-up snakes and-if they drink anything d</em><em>eadly, </em><em>it-will┘certainly</em><em> </em><em>not└</em><em>harm</em><em> them;</em><em> they-will-lay hands on (the) sick, and they-will-become well.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then the Lord Jesus, after [the] speaking to-them, was-taken-up into [the] heaven and sat-down on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And those, having-gone-out, preached everywhere, the Lord working-with (them) and confirming the word through the signs following.]] Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
