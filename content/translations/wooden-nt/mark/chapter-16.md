## Mark Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the Sabbath having passed, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the (mother) of-[the] James, and Salome bought spices in-order-that, having-come, they-might-anoint-him. 2And very early on-the one (day) of-the week[s], they-come to the tomb, the-sun having-risen. 3And they-were-saying to each-other, "Who will-roll-away the stone for-us from the entrance of-the tomb?" 4And having-looked-up, they-see that the stone has-been-been-rolled-away, for it-was exceedingly large. 5And having-entered into the tomb, they-saw (a) young-man sitting on the right clothed-with (a) white robe, and they-were astonished.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But the/he says to-them, "Do┘not└be-astonished. You-are-looking-for Jesus the Nazarene, the-one crucified; he-arose; he is not here. Behold, the place where they-laid him. 7But go tell the disciples of-him—and [the] Peter [that], 'He-is-going-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee. There you-will-see him, even-as he-said to-you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-gone out, they-fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had them, and they-said nothing to-nobody/anybody, for they-were afraid. [[9And having-arisen early on-the first (day) of-(the)-week, he-appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom he-had-cast-out seven demons. 10That-onefem, having-gone, reported to-the-ones being with him, grievingpl and crying. 11And-those, having-heard that he-was-alive and was-seen by her, disbelieved.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And after these-things, he-appeared to-two of them in another form, walking, traveling in (the) country. 13And-those going-away reported to-the rest; they-did┘not└believe those either.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And afterwards he-appeared to-the eleven themselves reclining-at-table, and he-reproached their disbelief and hardheartedness, because they-disbelieved the-ones having-seen him, having-been-raised.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And he-said to-them, "Having-gone into all the world, preach the gospel to-every [the] creature/created-one. 16The-one having-believed and having-been-baptized will-be-saved, but the-one disbelieving will-be-condemned. 17And these signs will-follow the-ones having-believed: in the name of-me they-will-cast-out demons, they-will-speak in new languages, 18[and in the/their hands]ms; they-will-pick-up snakes and-if they drink anything deadly, it-will┘certainly not└harm them; they-will-lay hands on (the) sick, and they-will-become well."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the Lord Jesus, after [the] speaking to-them, was-taken-up into [the] heaven and sat-down on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God. 20And those, having-gone-out, preached everywhere, the Lord working-with (them) and confirming the word through the signs following.]]</span>
