## Mark Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And having-arisen from-there, he-comes into the regions of-[the] Judaea [and]ms beyond the Jordan, crowd[s] were-traveling-together to him; and as he-was-eating, he-was-teaching them again. 2And Pharisees, having-approached, were-asking him if it-is/was-lawful for-a-husband to-divorce (a) wife, testing him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, "What did┘Moses└command you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the/they said, "Moses permitted to-write (a) certificate of-divorce and divorce (her)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> But [the] Jesus said to-them, "For the hardheartedness of-you he-wrote [the] this commandment to-you. 6But from (the) beginning of-creation, 'he-made them male and female. 7On-account-of this (a) man shall-leave the father and the mother of-him [and he-shall-be-joined-in-marriage to the wife of-him]ms, 8and the two will-be for/will become one flesh,' so-that they-are no-longer two but one flesh. 9What then [the] God joined, let┘man not└separate."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And into the house again the disciples were-asking him concerning this.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-says to-them, "Whoever2 divorces the wife of-him and marries another commits adultery against her. 12And if she, having-divorced the husband of-her, marries another, she commits adultery."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And they-were-trying-to-bring┘children└to him in-order-that he-might-touch them. But the disciples rebuked them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-seen, was-indignant and said to-them, "Let the little-children come to-me; do┘not└prevent them, for of-[the] such is the kingdom of-[the] God 15Truly I-tell you, whoever2 does┘not└receive the kingdom of-[the] God like (a) little-child, will-certainly not enter into it." 16And having-taken┘them└in-his-arms, he-blesses (them), laying the/his hands on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And he traveling-out onto (the) road, one, having-run-to (him) and having-knelt (to) him, began-by-asking him, "Good teacher, what shall-I-do in-order-that I-may-inherit eternal life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-him, "Why are-you-calling me good? Nobody (is) good except2 one—[the] God. 19You-know the commandments: 'Do┘not└murder, do┘not└commit-adultery, do┘not└steal, do┘not└lie,' do┘not└defraud, 'honor the father and the mother of-you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the/he said to-him, "Teacher, I-kept all these-things from (the) youth of-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-looked-at him, loved him and said to-him, "One-thing is-lacking with-respect-to-you. Go sell as-many-things-as you-have and give to-[the]ms poor, and you-will-have-treasure in heaven, and come follow me." 22But having-been-shocked/sad at the word, he-went-away sorrowing, for he-was one-having many possessions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-looked-around, says to-the disciples of-him, "How difficultly the-ones having wealth will-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But the disciples were-being-amazed at the words of-him. And [the] Jesus again, having-responded, says to-them, "Children, how difficult it-is to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God. 25I-is easier for-(a)-camel to-go-through [the]ms eye of-[the/a]ms needle than for-(a)-rich-(man) to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And the/they were┘all-the-more└surprised, saying to each-other, "And/then who is-able to-be-saved?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And having-looked-at them, [the] Jesus says, "With man (it is) impossible, but not with God, for all-things (are) possible with [the] God." 28[The] Peter began to-say to-him, "Behold, we left all-things and have-followed you." 29[The] Jesus said, "Truly I-say to-you, nobody is who left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for-the-sake-of me and for-the-sake-of the gospel, 30unless2 he-receives (a) hundredfold now in [the] this age houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields with persecutions, and in the coming [the] age eternal life. 31And many first will-be last and [the]ms many last (will be) first."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And they-were on the road going-up to Jerusalem, and [the] Jesus was going-in-front-of/leading them, and they-were-being-amazed; and the-ones following were-being-afraid. And having-taken┘the twelve└aside, he-began to-tell them the-things going to-come-on him 33[that], "Behold, we-are-going-up to Jerusalem, and the Son of-[the] Man will-be-betrayed to-the chief-priests and to-the scribes, and they-will-condemn him to-death, and they-will-deliver him to-the Gentiles, 34and they-will-mock him and spit-on him and scourge him and put-(him)-to-death, and after three days, he-will-resurrect."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And James and John, the sons of-Zebedee, come-to him, saying to-him, "Teacher, we-want [in-order]-that whatever2 we-ask you, you-will-do."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> And the/he said to-them, "What do-you-want [me]ms I-will-do for-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the/they said to-him, "Give to-us [in-order]-that one on (the) rightpl (hand) and one from (the) leftpl we-may-sit in the glory of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "You-do┘not└know what you-are-asking. Are-you-able to-drink the cup that I drink or to-be-baptized-with the baptism that I am-being-baptized-with?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And the/they said to-him, "We-are-able." And [the] Jesus said to-them, "The cup that I drink you-will-drink, and you-will-be-baptized-with the baptism that I am-being-baptized with; 40but [the] to-sit on (the) rightpl of-me or on (the) left is not mine to-give, but (it is) for-whom it-has-been-prepared."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> And having-heard, the ten began to-be-indignant concerning James and John.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And having-summoned them, [the] Jesus says to-them, "You-know that the-ones seeming to-rule the Gentiles lord-it over them, and the great-ones are-authoritarian-with them. 43And not thus is-it among you, but whoever2 wants to-become great among you will-be (a) minister of-you, 44and whoever2 wants to-be first among you will-be servant of-all. 45For even the Son of Man did┘not└come to-be-served but to-serve, and to-give the life of-him (as a) ransom in-place-of many."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And they-come to Jericho. And he going-out from Jericho and the disciples of-him and (a) considerable crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, (a) blind beggar, was-sitting beside the road. 47And having-heard that it-is/was Jesus the Nazarene, he-began to-shout and to-say, "Son of-David, Jesus; have-mercy-on me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> And many were-getting-after-at him [in-order]-that he-be-quiet, but the/he kept-shouting more by-much, "Son of-David, have-mercy-on me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> And having-stood-still, [the] Jesus said, "Call him." And they-call the blind-man, saying to-him, "Cheer-up; get-up. He-is-calling you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And throwing-aside the cloak of-him, having-jumped-up, he-came to [the] Jesus. 51And having-answered him, [the] Jesus said, "What do-you-want (that) I-should-do for-you?" And the blind (man) said to-him, "Rabboni, [in-order]-that I-may-regain-(my)-sight." 52And [the] Jesus said to-him, "Go, the faith of-you has-saved you."</span>
