<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-continued-by-saying to-them, "Truly I-say to-you that some of-the-ones standing here are who will┘certainly not└taste of-death until2 they-see the kingdom of-[the] God having-come with/in power."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And after six days [the] Jesus takes-along [the] Peter and [the] James and [the] John and brings┘them└up into (a) high mountain privately2 alone, and he-was-transformed in-front-of them, 3and the clothes of-him because dazzling, very white, such-as (a) fuller/bleacher on [the] earth is┘not└able so to-whiten (them). 4And Elijah appeared to-them with Moses, and they-were talking-with [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And [the] Peter, having-responded, says to-[the] Jesus, "Rabbi, it-is good for-us to-be here, and let-us-make three tents, one for-you and one for-Moses and one for-Elijah." 6For he-did┘not└know what he-might-respond, for he-became afraid.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And (a) cloud came overshadowing them, and (a) voice came out-of the cloud, "This is the Beloved [the] Son of-me; listen to-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And suddenly having-looked-around, they┘no-longer└saw anybody but [the] Jesus alone with them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And they coming-down out-of the mountain, he-strictly-ordered them [in-order]-that they-tell nobody what-things they-saw except2 when the Son of-[the] Man was-raised-up from (the) dead. 10And they-held-onto the matter, discussing with each-other what [the] raising from (the) dead is/was.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And they-continued-by-asking him, saying, "Why do┘the scribes└say that it-is-necessary for-Elijah first to-come?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the/he said to-them, "Elijah, having-come first, does-restored all-things; even how it-is-written regarding the Son of-[the] Man [in-order]-that he-suffer many-things and be-despised? 13But I-say to-you that Elijah has┘indeed└come, and they-did to-him as-many-things-as they-were-wanting, even-as it-is-written regarding him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And having come to the disciples, they-saw (a) big crowd around them, and scribes, arguing with them. 15And immediately all the crowd, having-seen him, was really-amazed and, having-run-to (him), began-to greet him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And he asked them, "Why are-you-arguing with them?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And one out-of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I-brought the son of-me to you, having (a) dumb spirit. 18And wherever2 it-seizes him, it-convulses him, and he-foams-at-the-mouth and gnashes the/his teeth and he-becomes rigid; and I-said to-the disciples of-you [in-order]-that they-might-cast┘it└out, and they-were┘not└able?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And the/he, having-answered them, says, "O faithless generation, until when/how long will-I-be with you?/until when/how long will-I-put-up-with you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And they-brought him to him. And the spirit having-seen him, immediately throws┘him└into convulsions; and having-fallen on the ground, he-began-to-roll-around, foaming-at-the-mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And he-asked the father of-him, "How-long is (the) when this has-happened to-him?" And the/he said, "[Out-of] from-(a)-child. 22And many-times it-cast both in (the) fire and into (the) water in-order-that it-might-destroy him. But if you-are-able, help us, having-had-compassion on us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-him, "[The] if you-are-able? All-things (are) possible for-the-one believing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Immediately the father of-the little-boy, having-cried-out, began-to-say, "I-believe! Help the unbelief of-me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And [the] Jesus, having seen that (a) crowd was-running together, he-rebuked the unclean [the] spirit, saying to-him, "[The] mute and deaf spirit, I-order you, come-out of him and do┘not└enter into him""</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And having-cried-out and having-thrown┘him└into-convulsions, it-came-out. And he-became as-if dead, so-that the many is/was-saying that he-died. 27But [the] Jesus, having-taken-hold of-the hand of-him, raised┘him└up, and he-stood-up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And he having-entered into (the) house, the disciples of-him privately2 began-to-ask him, "Why were┘we not└able to-cast┘him└out?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And he-said to-them, "This [the] kind is┘not└able to-come-out for-nobody/anybody except2 by prayer."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And-from-there having-gone-out, they-were-traveling throughout [the] Galilee, and he-was┘not└wanting [in-order]-that anybody should-know. 31For he-was-teaching the disciples of-him, and he-was-saying to-them [that], "The Son of-the Man is-being-betrayed into (the) hands of-men, and they-will-put┘him└to-death; and having-been-put to-death, after three days he-will-resurrect." 32And the/they were┘not└understanding the matter, and they-were-afraid to-ask him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And they-came into Capernaum. And have-become in the house, he-began to-ask them, "What were-you-discussing on the road?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And the/they kept-quiet, for they-debated with one-another on the road who (was) greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And having-sat-down, he-called the twelve and says to-them, "If anybody wants to-be first, he-will-be last of-all and minister of-all." 36And having-taken (a) little-child, he-stood him in the midst of-them: 37"Whoever2 welcomes one of-[the] such little-children in the name of-me, welcomes me; and whoever2 welcomes me, does┘not└welcome me but the the-One having-sent me." 38[The] John said to-him, "Teacher, we-saw somebody cast-out demons in the name of-you, and we-forbade him, because he-was┘not└following us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And [the] Jesus said, "Do┘not└prevent him, for nobody is who does (a) miracle in the name of-me and will-be-able soon/to-turn-around to-speak-evil of-me. 40For who is not against us is for us. 41For whoever2 gives (a) cup of-water in (my) name because you-are of-(the)-Messiah, truly I-tell you that he-will┘certainly not└lose the reward of-him. 42"And whoever2 offends one of-[the] these little-ones [the] believing [in me]ms, it-is-good for-him rather if (a) millstone of-(a)-donkey/of-(a) heavy millstone is-hanging-around the neck of-him, and he-has-been-thrown into the sea. 43And if the hand of-you offends you, cut┘it└off. It-is good for-you to-enter into [the] life deformed than, having [the] two hands, to-go-away into [the] Gehenna, into [the] unquenchable [the] fire. [[44]] 45And if the foot of-you offends you, cut-it off. It-is good for-you to-enter into [the] life lame than, having-[the] two feet, to-be-thrown into [the] Gehenna. [[46]] 47And if the eye of-you offends you, gouge┘it└out. It-is good for-you, one-eyed, to-enter into the kingdom of-[the] God that, having two eyes, to-be-thrown into [the] Gehenna, 48where the worm of-them does┘not└die and the fire is┘not└quenched. 49For everybody will-be-salted with-fire. 50[The] salt is good; if [the] salt becomes unsalty, with what will-you-make┘it└salty? Have saltiness in yourselves, and be-at-peace with one-another."</span>
