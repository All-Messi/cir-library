## Mark Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-went-out from there and comes into the hometown of-him, and the disciples of-him are-following him. 2And Sabbath becoming, he-began to-teach in the synagogue, and many, hearing, were-being-astonished, saying, "Whence (are) these-things to-this–One, and what (is) the wisdom [the] having-been-given to-this-One, and such [the] miracles occurring through the hands of-him? 3Is┘this-One└not the carpenter, the son of-[the] Mary and brother of-James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not the sisters of-him here with us?" And they-were-being-caused-to-stumble at him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus was-saying to-them [that], "(A) prophet is not┘┘without-honor, └└is he, except2 in the hometown of-him and among the relatives of-him and in the household of-him?" 5And he-was┘not└able to-do there no/any miracle; except2 having-put [the] hands-on (a) few sick-people, he-healed (them). 6And he-were-marveling on-account-of the disbelief of-them. And he-was-going-around the villages in-a-circle teaching. 7And he-summons the twelve and began to-sent┘them└away two-by-two2, and he-was-giving to-them authority of-the unclean [the] spirits. 8And he-instructed them in-order-that they-take nothing on (the) way "except2 (a) rod only, not bread, not (a) traveler's bag, not copper-money in the money-belt, 9but having-put-on sandals, and do┘not└put-on two inner-garments." 10And he-says to-them, "Wherever2 you-enter into (a) house, stay there until2 you-leave from-there. 11And whatever2 place does┘not└receive you nor listen-to-you, going-out from-there, shake the dust [the] on-the-bottom-of the feet of-you for (a) testimony/statement to-them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And having-gone-out, they-preached that (people)-should-repent; 13and they-were-casting-out many demons, and they-were-anointing with-olive-oil many sick-ones, and they-were-healing (them).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] King Herod heard, for the name of-him became apparent, and they-were-saying [that], "John the Baptist has-arisen from (the) dead, and on-account-of this the powers are-working in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And others were-saying [that], "He-is Elijah."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And [the] Herod, having-heard, was-saying, "John whom I beheaded—this-one arose." 17For [the] Herod himself, having-sent, arrested [the] John and bound him in prison on-account-of Herodias the wife of-Philip, the brother of-him, because he-married her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For [the] John kept-saying to-[the] Herod [that], "It-is┘not└lawful for-you to-have the wife of-the brother of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Herodias was-having-a-grudge-against him, and was-wanting to-put┘him└to-death and was┘not└able. 20For [the] Herod was-afraid-of [the] John, knowing him (to be) (a) righteous and holy man, and he-was-keeping┘him└safe. And having-heard him, he-was-perplexed many-things/much, and would-listen-to him gladly. 21And (a) suitable day having-come when Herod made (a) banquet on-the birthday of-him for-the persons-of-high-rank of-him and the tribunes/chiliarchs and first-ones of-[the] Galilee, 22and the daughter of-Herodias, having-come-in, having-danced, pleased [the] Herod and the-ones reclining-at-table-with (him). [The] Herod said to-the young-girl, "Ask┘me└for whatever2 you-want, and I-will-give (it) to-you." 23And he-swore to-her [many-things]ms [that], "Whatever2 you-ask me I-will-give you up-to half of-the kingdom of-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-gone-out, she-said to-the mother of-her, "What shall-I-ask-for?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And having-gone-in immediately with haste to the king, she-asked, saying, "I-want in-order-that right-now you-should-give me the head of-John the Baptist."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And having-become sorrowful, the king, on-account-of the oaths and the-ones reclining-at-table, did┘not└want to-refuse her. 27And immediately, having-sent, the king commanded (an) executioner to-bring the head of-him. And having-gone-away, he-beheaded him in the prison, 28and he-brought the head of-him on (a) platter and gave it to-the young-girl, and the young-girl gave it to-the mother of-her. 29And having-heard, the disciples of-him came and carried the corpse of-him and put it in (a) tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the apostles gathered-together to [the] Jesus and reported to-him all-things as-many-things-as they-did and as-many-things-as they-taught. 31And he-says to-them, "Come you yourselves into (an) unpopulated place privately2 and rest a-little." For the-ones coming and the-ones going were many, and they-were┘not-even└having-opportunity to-eat. 32And they-went-away in the boat into (an) unpopulated place privately2. 33And (people)-saw them going, and many recognized (them), and on-foot they-together-ran from all the towns there and got┘there└ahead (of-them). 34And coming-out, he-saw (a) big crowd and he-felt-compassion toward them, because they-were like sheep not having (a) shepherd, and he-began to-teach them many-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And already (the) hour having-become late, the disciples of-him, having-come-to him, were-saying [that], "The place is unpopulated and already (the) hour (is) late. 36Send┘them└away in-order-that, having-gone-away into the fields and villages in-a-circle/around, they-might-buy for-themselves something they-might-eat."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, "You give them to-eat." And they-say to-him, "Going-away, shall-we-buy bread of-two-hundred denarii, and give to-them to-eat?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/he says to-them, "How-many loaves do-you-have? Go see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And he-instructed them all to-sit on the green grass group-by-group2/in-groups2. 40And they-sat in-garden-plots2/in-groups2 according-to hundred and according-to fifty. 41And having-taken the five loaves and the two fish, having-looked-up into the sky, he-blessed and broke the loaves and began-to-give (them) to-the disciples [of-him]ms in-order-that they-might-distribute to-them, and he divided to-all the two fish. 42And all ate and were-satisfied. 43And they-picked-up fragments of-twelve baskets full and from the fish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And immediately he-made the disciples of him to-get in the boat and go-ahead to the other-side to Bethsaida, until he dismisses the crowd. 46And having-said-goodbye to-them, he-went-away into the mountain to-pray. 47And evening having-come, the boat was in (the0 midst of-the sea, and he (was) alone on [the] land. 48And having-seen them-struggling in the rowing—for the wind was contrary to-them, about the fourth watch of-the night he-comes-by them, walking on the sea and he-wanted to-come-by them. 49And the/they, having-seen him walking on the sea, they-were-afraid because he-is/was (a) ghost, and they-cried-out. 50For they┘all└saw him and were-scared. But the/he immediately spoke with them, and says to-them, "Do-not-be-afraid; I am; do┘not└be-frightened." 51And he-got-up to them in the boat, and the wind died-down, and they-were┘very└astonished [completely2]ms in themselves. 52For they-did┘not└understand about-the loaves, but the heart of-them was hardened. 53And having-crossed-over to [the] land, they-came into Gennesaret and moored. 54And they having-come-out of the boat, immediately having-recognized him, 55they-ran-around [the] that whole region where they-were-hearing that he-is/was. 56And wherever2 he-entered into (a) village or into (a) town or into open-fields, in the market-places they-would-put the-ones being-sick and were-appealing to him on-order-that they-might-touch even the fringe of-[the] garment of-him. And as-many-as touched him were-being saved.</span>
