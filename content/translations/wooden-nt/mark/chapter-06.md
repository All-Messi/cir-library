<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-went-out from there and comes into the hometown of-him, and the disciples of-him are-following him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And Sabbath becoming, he-began to-teach in the synagogue, and many, hearing, were-being-astonished, saying<em>, </em> <em>“W</em><em>hence (are) these-things to-this</em><em>–One, and what (is) the wisdom [the] having-been-given to-this-One, and such [the] miracles occ</em><em>urring through the hands of-him?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Is┘this-One└not</em><em> the carpenter, the son of-[the] Mary and brother of-James and Joses and Judas and Simon?</em><em> </em><em>And are not the sisters of-him here with us?”</em> And they-were-being-caused-to-stumble at him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus was-saying to-them [that], <em>“(A) prophet is not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>without-honor, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>is he, </em><em>except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> in the hometown of-him and among the relatives of-</em><em>him and in the household of-him?</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And he-was┘not└able to-do there no/any miracle; except<sup>2</sup> having-put [the] hands-on (a) few sick-people, he-healed (them). <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And he-were-marveling on-account-of the disbelief of-them. And he-was-going-around the villages in-a-circle teaching. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And he-summons the twelve and began to-sent┘them└away two-by-two<sup>2</sup>, and he-was-giving to-them authority of-the unclean [the] spirits. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And he-instructed them in-order-that they-take nothing on (the) way <em>“</em><em>except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em> <em>(a) rod only, not bread, not (a) traveler’s bag, not </em><em>copper-money in the money-belt,</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>b</em><em>ut</em><em> having-put-on sandals, and</em><em> </em><em>do┘not└</em><em>put-on</em><em> two inner-garments.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And he-says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Wherever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> </em><em>you-enter into</em><em> (a) house, stay there </em><em>until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-leave from-there.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> </em><em>whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> place </em><em>does┘not└receive</em><em> you nor listen-to-you, going-out from-there</em><em>,</em><em> shake the dust [the] on-the-bottom-of the feet of-you for (a) testimony/statement to-them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And having-gone-out, they-preached that (people)-should-repent; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and they-were-casting-out many demons, and they-were-anointing with-olive-oil many sick-ones, and they-were-healing (them).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] King Herod heard, for the name of-him became apparent, and they-were-saying [that], <em>“John the Baptist has-arisen from (the) dead</em><em>,</em><em> and on-account-of this the powers are-working in him.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And others were-saying [that], <em>“He-is Elijah.”</em> But others were-saying [that], <em>“He is) a prophet like on of-the prophets.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And [the] Herod, having-heard, was-saying, <em>“John whom </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> beheaded—this-one arose.</em><strong><em><sup>”</sup></em></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For [the] Herod himself, having-sent, arrested [the] John and bound him in prison on-account-of Herodias the wife of-Philip, the brother of-him, because he-married her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> For [the] John kept-saying to-[the] Herod [that], <em>“</em><em>It-is</em><em>┘not└</em><em>lawful</em><em> for-you </em><em>to-have the wife of-the brother of-you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And [the] Herodias was-having-a-grudge-against him, and was-wanting to-put┘him└to-death and was┘not└able. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For [the] Herod was-afraid-of [the] John, knowing him (to be) (a) righteous and holy man, and he-was-keeping┘him└safe. And having-heard him, he-was-perplexed many-things/much, and would-listen-to him gladly. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And (a) suitable day having-come when Herod made (a) banquet on-the birthday of-him for-the persons-of-high-rank of-him and the tribunes/chiliarchs and first-ones of-[the] Galilee, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and the daughter of-Herodias, having-come-in, having-danced, pleased [the] Herod and the-ones reclining-at-table-with (him).

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-gone-out, she-said to-the mother of-her, <em>“What shall-I-ask-for?”</em> And the/she said, <em>“The head of-John the Baptist.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And having-gone-in immediately with haste to the king, she-asked, saying, <em>“I-want in-order-that right-now you-should-give me the head of-John the Baptist.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And having-become sorrowful, the king, on-account-of the oaths and the-ones reclining-at-table, did┘not└want to-refuse her. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And immediately, having-sent, the king commanded (an) executioner to-bring the head of-him. And having-gone-away, he-beheaded him in the prison, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and he-brought the head of-him on (a) platter and gave it to-the young-girl, and the young-girl gave it to-the mother of-her. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And having-heard, the disciples of-him came and carried the corpse of-him and put it in (a) tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And the apostles gathered-together to [the] Jesus and reported to-him all-things as-many-things-as they-did and as-many-things-as they-taught. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And he-says to-them<em>, “Come you yourselves into (an) unpopulated place </em><em>privately</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> and rest a-little.”</em> For the-ones coming and the-ones going were many, and they-were┘not-even└having-opportunity to-eat. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And they-went-away in the boat into (an) unpopulated place privately<sup>2</sup>. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And (people)-saw them going, and many recognized (them), and on-foot they-together-ran from all the towns there and got┘there└ahead (of-them). <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>And coming-out, he-saw (a) big crowd and he-felt-compassion toward them, because they-were like sheep not having (a) shepherd, and he-began to-teach them many-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And already (the) hour having-become late, the disciples of-him, having-come-to him, were-saying [that], <em>“The place is unpopulated and already (the) hour (is) late.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Send┘them└away</em><em> in-order-that</em><em>,</em><em> h</em><em>aving-gone-away into the fields</em><em> and villages in-a-circle</em><em>/around</em><em>, they-might-buy for-themselves something they-might-eat.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the/he, having-answered, said to-them, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> give them to-eat.</em><em>” </em> And they-say to-him, <em>“Going-away, shall-we-buy bread of-two-hundred denarii</em><em>,</em><em> and give to-them to-eat?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/he says to-them, <em>“How-many loaves do-you-have?</em><em> </em><em>Go see.”</em> And having-found-out, they-say, <em>“Five, and two fish.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And he-instructed them all to-sit on the green grass group-by-group<sup>2</sup>/in-groups<sup>2</sup>. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And they-sat in-garden-plots<sup>2</sup>/in-groups<sup>2</sup> according-to hundred and according-to fifty. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And having-taken the five loaves and the two fish, having-looked-up into the sky, he-blessed and broke the loaves and began-to-give (them) to-the disciples [of-him]<sup>ms</sup> in-order-that they-might-distribute to-them, and he divided to-all the two fish. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And all ate and were-satisfied. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And they-picked-up fragments of-twelve baskets full and from the fish.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And immediately he-made the disciples of him to-get in the boat and go-ahead to the other-side to Bethsaida, until <u>he</u> dismisses the crowd. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And having-said-goodbye to-them, he-went-away into the mountain to-pray. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>And evening having-come, the boat was in (the0 midst of-the sea, and <u>he</u> (was) alone on [the] land. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>And having-seen them-struggling in the rowing—for the wind was contrary to-them, about the fourth watch of-the night he-comes-by them, walking on the sea and he-wanted to-come-by them. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>And the/they, having-seen him walking on the sea, they-were-afraid because he-is/was (a) ghost, and they-cried-out. <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>For they┘all└saw him and were-scared.
