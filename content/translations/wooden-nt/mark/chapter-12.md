## Mark Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he-began to-speak to-them in parables. "(A) man planted (a) vineyard, and put┘(a) hedge└around (it), and dug (a) winepress, and built (a) watchtower, and rented┘(it)└out to-farmers, and went-on-(a)-trip. 2And at-the season he-sent (a) servant to the farmers in-order-that he-might-receive from the fruit of-the vineyard. 3And taking him, they-beat (him) and sent┘(him)└away empty. 4And again he-sent to them another servant, and-that-one they-beat-over-the-head and treated┘(him)└shamefully. 5And he-sent another. And-that-one they killed, and (he sent) many others, (they) beating some and murdering some. 6He-had yet one beloved son. He-sent him last to them, saying [that], 'They-will-respect the son of-me.' 7But those [the] farmers said to each-other [that], 'This is the heir. Come-on, let-us-kill him, and the inheritance will-be of-us.' 8And taking (him), they-murdered him, and threw him outside the vineyard. 9What [then]ms will┘the Lord of-the vineyard└do? He-will-come and destroy the farmers and he-will-give the vineyard to-others. 10Did-you┘not-even└read [the] this scripture,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> This came from (the) Lord,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And they-were-trying to-arrest him, but they feared the crowd, for they-knew that he-said the parable against them. And having-left him, they-went-away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And they-send to him some of-the Pharisees and of-the Herodians in-order-that they-might-trap him in-(his)-word. 14And having-come, they-say to-him, "Teacher, we-know that you-are true, and it-is┘not└ (a) concern to-you about nobody/anybody, for you-do┘not└look at (the) face of-men, but in truth you-teach the way of-[the] God. Is-it-lawful to-give tribute to-Caesar or not? Shall-we-give or shall-we┘not└give?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And the/he, knowing the hypocrisy of-them, said to-them, "Why are-you-testing me? Bring me (a) denarius in-order-that I-may-see (it)"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the/they brought (one), and he-says to-them, "Whose (is) [the] this image and [the] inscription?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "Pay to-Caesar the-things of-Caesar and to-[the] God the-things of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And Sadducees come to him, who say resurrection not to-be, and they-began-to-ask him, saying, 19"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that 'if (the) brother of-someone dies' and leaves-behind (a) wife 'and does┘not└leave (a) child,' [in-order]that 'the brother of-him raise-up seed for-the brother of-him.' 20Seven brothers were, and the first took (a) wife and, dying, did┘not└leave (a) seed. 21And the second took her and he-died not leaving-behind (a) seed. And the third likewise. 22And the seven did┘not└leave (a) seed. Last of-all the woman also died. 23In the resurrection [when they arise]ms, (the) wife of-which of-them will-she-be? For the seven had her (as a) wife." "Do-you┘not└err on-account-of this: not knowing the scriptures neither the power of-[the] God? 25For when they-resurrect from (the) dead neither do-they-marry nor are-given-in-marriage, but they-are like angels in [the] heaven[s]. 26Now concerning the dead that they-arise, did-you┘not└read in the book of-Moses at the bush how [the] God spoke to-him, saying, 'I (am) the Good of-Abraham and [the]ms God of-Isaac and [the]ms God of-Jacob'? 27He is not (a) God of-(the)-dead but of-(the)-living. You-err greatly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And one of-the scribes having-come, having-heard them arguing, having-seen that he-answered them well, asked him, "What is (the) first commandment of-all?" "First is, 'Hear, Israel, (the) Lord the God of-you is one Lord, 30and you-shall-love (the) Lord the God of-you out-of the whole heart of-you and out-of the whole soul of-you' and out-of the mind of-you 'and out-of all the strength of-you.' 31This (is) second, 'You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself.' Another commandment is not greater than these."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And the scribe said to-him, "Well, Teacher, you-spoke in truth, because 'One is and another is not besides him; 33and [the] loving him out-of the whole heart and out-of the whole understanding and out-of the whole strength and [the] loving the neighbor as yourself is much-more than all the whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-seen [him]ms that he-responded intelligently, said to-him, "You-are not far from the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-answered, was-saying, teaching in the temple, "How do┘the scribes└say that the Messiah is (the) son of-David? 36David himself said by the Holy [the] Spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> David himself says him (to be) Lord, and whence is-he (a) son of-him?"</span>
