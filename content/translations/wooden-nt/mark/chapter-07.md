## Mark Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the Pharisees and some of-the scribes, having-come from Jerusalem, are-gathering to-him; 2and having-seen some of-the disciples of-him that they-are/were-eating [the] loaves/[the] bread[s] with-common/defiled hands 3—for the Pharisees and all the Jews unless2 they-wash the/their hands vigorously, do┘not└eat, holding-onto the tradition of-the elders; 4and from (the) marketplace unless2 they-bathe themselves, they-do┘not└eat, and many other-things there-are that they-received to-hold-onto, washing of-cups and pitchers and copper-pots [and bed-rolls]ms—5and the Pharisees and the scribes began-to-ask him, "On-account-of what do┘the disciples of-you not└walk according-to the tradition of-the elders, but eat [the] bread with common/defiled hands?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the/he said to-them, "Isaiah well prophesied concerning you [the] hypocrites, when he-has-written [that]ms,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Having-left the commandment of-[the] God, you-hold-onto the tradition of-[the] 'men.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, "Well you-set-aside the commandment of-[the] God in-order-that you-may-establish the tradition of-you. 10For Moses said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> But you say, 'If (a) man says to-the/his father or the/his mother, "Corban," (that is, "(It-is) (a) gift,") whatever2 from me you-would-be-helped, 12you no-longer allow him to-do nothing/anything for-the/his father or for-the/his mother,' 13annulling the word of-[the] God by-the tradition of-you which you-handed-down; and you-do many such similar-things."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And having-summoned the crowd again, he-began-to-say to them, "Hear me all and understand. 15Nothing is from-outside the/a man entering into him that is-able to-defile him, but the-things coming out-of the/a man are the-things defiling the/a man." [[16]] 17And when he-entered in (a) house from the crowd, the disciples of-him started-asking him about the parable/illustration. 18And he-says to-them, "Thus also you are without-understanding? Do-you┘not└know that everything [the] from-outside entering into the/a man is┘not└able to-defile him, 19because it-does┘not└enter into the heart of-him, but into the/his stomach, and comes-out in the stool (cleansing all [the] foods)?" 20And he-continued-saying [that], "The-thing coming-out of the/a man—that defiles the/a man." 21For from-inside—from the heart of-[the] men—come [the] evil [the] imaginings, fornications, thefts, murders, 22adulteries, greed-acts, wicked-acts, deceit, sensuality, (an) evil-eye, blasphemy/slander, arrogance, foolishness; 23all these [the] evil-things come from-inside and defile the/a man."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-arisen from-there, he-went-away into the-regions of-Tyre. And having-entered into (a) house, he-was-wanting nobody to-know, and he-was┘not└able to-escape-notice. 25But immediately (a) woman having-heard about him, whose [the] little-daughter [of-her] was-having (an) unclean spirit, having-come, fell-down at the feet of-him. 26Now the woman was (a) Greek, (a) Syro-Phoenician by-[the] nationality; and she-kept-asking him in-order-that he-might-cast the demon out-of the daughter of-her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And he-was-saying to-her, "Let the children first be-fed, for it-is not good to-take the bread of-the children and to-toss (it) to-the house-dogs."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And the/she answered and says to-him, "Sir, even the house-dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of-the children."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And he-said to-her, "On-account-of this [the] word, go; the demon has-gone-out of the daughter of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And having-gone-away into the house of-her, she-found the little-child laid on the bed and the demon gone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And again having-come-out of the regions of-Tyre, he-went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in-the-midst2 of-the regions of-Decapolis. 32And they-were-bringing to him (a) deaf and mute-(man), and they-were-appealing-to him in-order-that he-might-lay┘the/his hand└on him. 33And having-taken him away-from the crowd by himself/privately2, he-put the fingers of-him into the ears of-him and, having-spit, he-touched the tongue of-him, 34and having-looked-up to the sky, he-groaned, and says to-him, "Ephphatha," (that is, "Be-opened.") 35And [immediately]ms the ears of-him were-opened, and the bond of-the tongue of-him was-untied and he-began-to-speak plainly. 36And he-charged them in-order-that they-tell nobody. But as-much-as he-would-charge them, they-would-proclaim (it) more instead. 37They-were┘utterly└astonished, saying, "He-has-done all-things well; he┘even└makes the deaf to-hear and the mute to-speak."</span>
