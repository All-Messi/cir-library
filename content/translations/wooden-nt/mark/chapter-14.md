## Mark Chapter **14**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the Passover and [the] (Feast of) Unleavened-(Bread) was after two days, and the chief-priests and the scribes were-trying how, having-arrested him by stealth, they-might-put┘(him)└to-death. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For they-were-saying, <em>“Not during the feast lest-at-any-time (a) riot will-be among the people.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And he being in Bethany in the house of-Simon the leper, he-reclining, (a) woman came having (an) alabaster-vial of-expensive, pure nard, (and) she-began-to-pour-(it)-on the head of-him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And some were being-indignant with each-other, <em>“Unto</em><em> what has┘[the] this </em><em>waste└happened</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> this [the] ointment was-able to-be-sold for-</em><em>over</em><em> three hundred denarii and given to-the poor.</em><em>”</em> And they-started-scolding her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>Let┘her└alone</em><em>; why are-you-giving her trouble?</em><em> </em><em>She-worked (a) good work on me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> you always have the poor with you</em><em>;</em><em> and whenever you-want</em><em>,</em><em> you-are-able to-do well for-them, but </em><em>you-do┘not</em><em> </em><em>always└have</em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>She</em><em>-did what she-could.</em><em> </em><em>She-anointed</em><em> the body of-me ahead-of-time for </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> entombment.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> truly I-tell you, </em><em>wherever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the gospel is-preached in the whole world, what she-did </em><em>sha</em><em>ll be-told as (a) memorial of-her.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And Judas Iscariot, [the] one of-the twelve, went-away to the high-priests in-order-that he-might-deliver him to-them. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And the/they, having-heard, rejoiced and promised to-give him silver, and be-began-trying how he-might-deliver him at-a-good-time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And on-the first day of-the Unleavened-(Bread), when the Passover was-being-sacrificed, the disciples of-him say to-him, <em>“Where do-you-want, having-gone-away, us-to-prepare in-order-that we-may-eat the Passover?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>And he-sent two of-the disciples of-him and says to-them, <em>“Go into the city and (a) man will-meet you </em><em>carrying</em><em> (a) pot of-water.</em><em> </em><em>Follow him, </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>wherever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> he-enters, say to-the master-of-the-</em><em>house that, ‘The Teacher says, “</em><em>Where is the upper-room of-me where I-may-eat the Passover with the disciples of me?</em><em>”’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> he will-show you (a) large upper-room, furnished, ready.</em><em> </em><em>And there prepare for-us.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And the disciples went-out and they-came into the city and they-found even-as he-said to-them, and they-prepared the Passover. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And evening having-come, he-arrives with the twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And they reclining and eating, [the] Jesus said, <em>“Truly I-say to-you that one </em><em>out-of</em><em> you will-betray me, the-one eating with me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>They-began to-be-grieved and to-say to-them one by one, <em>“(It is) </em><em>not┘me</em><em>, └is-it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>And the/he said to-them, <em>“One of-the twelve, the-one dipping with me in the bowl.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Because</em><em> the Son of-[the]</em><em>M</em><em>an goes even-as it-is-written concerning him, but woe to-</em><em>[the] that</em><em> man through whom the son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an is-destroyed.</em><em> </em><em>(It would have been) good for-him if </em><em>[the] that</em><em> man </em><em>had┘not└been-born</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they eating, having-taken (a) loaf, having-blessed (it), he-broke (it) and gave (it) to-them and said, <em>“Take, this is the body of-me.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And having-taken (a) cup, having-given-thanks, he-gave (it) to-them, and they┘all└drank from it. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And he-said to-them, <em>“This is the blood of-me, (the blood) of-the covenant [the] poured-out on-behalf-of all.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Truly</em><em> I-say to-you that </em><em>I-will┘certainly</em><em> not </em><em>no-longer/</em><em>any-longer</em><em>└be-drinking</em><em> of-the fruit of-the vine until [the] that day when I-drink it new in the kingdom of-[the] God.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And having-sung-a-hymn, they-went-out to the Mount of-[the] Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus says to-them [that], <em>“</em><em>You┘all└will-be-offended</em><em> because it-is-written,</em> <strong><em>‘I-will-strike the shepherd,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd the sheep will-be-scattered.’</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup><em>But</em><em> after [the] my being-raised, I-will-go-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And [the] Peter said to-him, <em>“Even if all will-be-offended, </em><em>[</em><em>but</em><em>]</em><em> I (will) not.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus says to-him, <em>“Truly I-say to-you that </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> today, this [the] night</em><em>,</em><em> before (a) rooster </em><em>double crows</em><em>/crows twice</em><em>, you-will-deny me three-times.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But the/he kept-saying insistently, “<em>If it-is-necessary for-me to-die-with you, </em><em>I-will┘certainly</em><em> </em><em>not└deny</em><em> you.”</em> And they┘all└were-saying likewise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And they-are-going into (a) parcel-of-land the name of-which (is) Gethsemane, and he-says to-the disciples of-him, <em>“Sit here while I-pray.”</em> <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And he-takes-along [the] Peter and [the]<sup>ms</sup> James and [the]<sup>ms</sup> John with him, and he-began to-be-completely-distressed and to-be-anxious, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and he-says to-them, <em>“The soul of-me is deeply-grieved to death.</em><em> </em><em>Stay here and keep-watch.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And having-gone-forward a-little, he-fell on the ground and began-to-pray in-order-that, if possible, the hour might-go-past from him. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>And he-was-saying, <em>“Abba [the]</em> <em>Father, all-things (are) possible for-you.</em><em> </em><em>Take [the] this cup from me, but not what </em><em><u>I</u></em><em> want but what </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> (want).</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And he-comes and finds them sleeping, and he-says to-[the] Peter, <em>“Simon, are-you sleeping?</em><em> </em><em>Were-you┘not└able</em><em> to-keep-watch </em><em>for-one</em><em> hour?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>Watch</em><em> and pray, in-order-that </em><em>you┘not└come</em><em> into temptation; the spirit (is) willing, but the flesh (is) weak.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And again, going-away, he-prayed, saying the same word. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>And again coming, he-found them sleeping, for the eyes of-them were weighed-down, and they-did┘not└know what they-might-answer him. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And he-comes the/a third (time) and says to-them, <em>“Keep-sleeping</em><em> the/a little (while) and rest.</em><em>”</em> <em>“It-is enough.</em><em> </em><em>The hour came; behold, the Son of-</em><em>M</em><em>an is-being-betrayed into the hands of-[the] sinners.</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em>-up; let-us-go.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the-one betraying me came-near.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And immediately he-yet speaking, Judas, one of-the twelve, comes and with him (a) crowd with swords and clubs from the chief-priests and the scribes and the elders. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And the-one betraying him had-given (a) signal to-them, saying, <em>“</em><em>Whomever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-kiss—</em><em><u>he</u></em><em> is the-One; arrest him and </em><em>lead┘him└away</em><em> safely.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And having-come, immediately, having-come-to him, says, <em>“Rabbi,” </em>and kissed him. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>And the/they laid┘[the] hands└on him and arrested him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And [(a) certain]<sup>ms</sup> one of-the-ones standing-by, having-drawn the/his sword, struck the/a servant of-the high-priest and cut-off the ear of-him. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus, having-responded, said to-them, <em>“As against (an) insurrectionist, you-came-out with swords and clubs to-seize me?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>According</em><em>-to (the) day/</em><em>Daily</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> I-was with you in the temple teaching, and </em><em>you-did┘not└arrest</em><em> me, but (this has happened) in-order-that the scriptures might-be-fulfilled.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And having-left him, they┘all└fled.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And a-certain young-man was-following him dressed, (a) linen-sheet (being) over (his) naked (body), and they-seize him. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>And the/he, having-left the linen-sheet, fled naked.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And they-brought [the] Jesus to the high-priest, and all the chief-priests and the elders and the scribes come-together. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>And [the] Peter followed him from afar up-to inside the courtyard of-the high-priest, and he-was sitting-down with the officers and warming-himself at the fire.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the chief-priests and the whole Sanhedrin were-looking-for testimony against [the] Jesus unto [the] putting┘him└to-death, and they-were┘not└finding (it). <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>For many were-bringing-false-witness against him, and the/their testimony was not consistent. <strong><sup>57</sup></strong>And some, having-arisen, were-bringing-false-witness against him, saying <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>[that], <em>“We heard him saying [that</em><em>] ,</em><em>’I will-tear-down [the] this [the] hand-made sanctuary</em><em>,</em><em> and through three days I-will-build another made-without-hands.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>And not-even so was the testimony of-them consistent.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And having-arisen in-the-midst<sup>2</sup>, the high-priest, he-asked [the] Jesus, saying, <em>“</em><em>You-are┘not└answering</em><em> nothing/anything what these are-testifying-against you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>61</sup></strong>And the/he continued-to-be-silent and answered nothing. Again the high-priest was-asking him and saying to-him, <em>“Are </em><em>y</em><em>ou the Messiah the S</em><em>on of-the Blessed?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>I </em><em>am;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>a</em><em>nd ‘you-will-see the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	sitting on (the) right-(hand) of-[the] Power</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	and coming with the clouds of-the sky.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup><strong>63</strong></sup>And the high-priest having-torn the clothes of-him, says, <em>‘Why </em><em>do-we┘still└have</em><em> need of-witnesses?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>You</em><em>-heard the blasphemy.</em><em> </em><em>What does-it-seem to-you?”</em> And all the-ones condemned him to-be deserving of-death. <strong><sup>65</sup></strong>And certain-ones began to-spit-on him and to-blindfold the face of-him and to-hit-(him)-with-(their)-fist and to-say to-him, <em>“Prophesy,”</em> and the officers held him with-slaps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And [the] Peter being below in the courtyard one one-of the servant-girls of-the high-priest comes, <strong><sup>67</sup></strong>and having-seen [the] Peter warming-himself, having-looked-at him, says, <em>“You also were with the Nazarene, [the] Jesus.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v68"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the/he denied (it), saying, <em>“</em><em>I-do┘neither└know</em><em> nor understand what </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> </em><em>are-saying</em><em>.”</em> And he-went outside into the forecourt [and (a) rooster crowed]<sup>ms</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the servant-girl, having-seen him, began again to-say to-the-ones standing-by [that], <em>“This-one is of-them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And the/he denied (it) again, and after (a) little (while) again the-ones standing-by began-to-say to-[the] Peter, <em>“Truly you-are of them, for you-are also (a) Galilean.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And the/he began to-curse and to-swear [that], <em>“</em><em>I-do┘not└know</em><em> [the] this man whom you-say.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And immediately of (a) second-(time) (a) rooster crowed, and [the] Peter remembered the word as [the] Jews said to-him [that], <em>“Before (a) rooster crows twice you-will-deny me three-times.”</em><em> </em>And breaking-down, he-began-to-cry.</span>
