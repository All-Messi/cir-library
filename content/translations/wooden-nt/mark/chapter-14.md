## Mark Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And the Passover and [the] (Feast of) Unleavened-(Bread) was after two days, and the chief-priests and the scribes were-trying how, having-arrested him by stealth, they-might-put┘(him)└to-death. 2For they-were-saying, "Not during the feast lest-at-any-time (a) riot will-be among the people."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he being in Bethany in the house of-Simon the leper, he-reclining, (a) woman came having (an) alabaster-vial of-expensive, pure nard, (and) she-began-to-pour-(it)-on the head of-him. 4And some were being-indignant with each-other, "Unto what has┘[the] this waste└happened? 5For this [the] ointment was-able to-be-sold for-over three hundred denarii and given to-the poor." And they-started-scolding her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And [the] Jesus said, "Let┘her└alone; why are-you-giving her trouble? She-worked (a) good work on me. 7For you always have the poor with you; and whenever you-want, you-are-able to-do well for-them, but you-do┘not always└have me. 8She-did what she-could. She-anointed the body of-me ahead-of-time for [the] entombment. 9And truly I-tell you, wherever2 the gospel is-preached in the whole world, what she-did shall be-told as (a) memorial of-her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And Judas Iscariot, [the] one of-the twelve, went-away to the high-priests in-order-that he-might-deliver him to-them. 11And the/they, having-heard, rejoiced and promised to-give him silver, and be-began-trying how he-might-deliver him at-a-good-time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And on-the first day of-the Unleavened-(Bread), when the Passover was-being-sacrificed, the disciples of-him say to-him, "Where do-you-want, having-gone-away, us-to-prepare in-order-that we-may-eat the Passover?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And he-sent two of-the disciples of-him and says to-them, "Go into the city and (a) man will-meet you carrying (a) pot of-water. Follow him, 14and wherever2 he-enters, say to-the master-of-the-house that, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the upper-room of-me where I-may-eat the Passover with the disciples of me?"' 15And he will-show you (a) large upper-room, furnished, ready. And there prepare for-us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And the disciples went-out and they-came into the city and they-found even-as he-said to-them, and they-prepared the Passover. 17And evening having-come, he-arrives with the twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And they reclining and eating, [the] Jesus said, "Truly I-say to-you that one out-of you will-betray me, the-one eating with me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They-began to-be-grieved and to-say to-them one by one, "(It is) not┘me, └is-it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And the/he said to-them, "One of-the twelve, the-one dipping with me in the bowl. 21Because the Son of-[the]Man goes even-as it-is-written concerning him, but woe to-[the] that man through whom the son of-[the] Man is-destroyed. (It would have been) good for-him if [the] that man had┘not└been-born."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And they eating, having-taken (a) loaf, having-blessed (it), he-broke (it) and gave (it) to-them and said, "Take, this is the body of-me." 23And having-taken (a) cup, having-given-thanks, he-gave (it) to-them, and they┘all└drank from it. 24And he-said to-them, "This is the blood of-me, (the blood) of-the covenant [the] poured-out on-behalf-of all. 25Truly I-say to-you that I-will┘certainly not no-longer/any-longer└be-drinking of-the fruit of-the vine until [the] that day when I-drink it new in the kingdom of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And having-sung-a-hymn, they-went-out to the Mount of-[the] Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-them [that], "You┘all└will-be-offended because it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But after [the] my being-raised, I-will-go-ahead-of you into [the] Galilee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And [the] Peter said to-him, "Even if all will-be-offended, [but] I (will) not."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And [the] Jesus says to-him, "Truly I-say to-you that you today, this [the] night, before (a) rooster double crows/crows twice, you-will-deny me three-times."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> But the/he kept-saying insistently, "If it-is-necessary for-me to-die-with you, I-will┘certainly not└deny you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And they-are-going into (a) parcel-of-land the name of-which (is) Gethsemane, and he-says to-the disciples of-him, "Sit here while I-pray." 33And he-takes-along [the] Peter and [the]ms James and [the]ms John with him, and he-began to-be-completely-distressed and to-be-anxious, 34and he-says to-them, "The soul of-me is deeply-grieved to death. Stay here and keep-watch."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> And having-gone-forward a-little, he-fell on the ground and began-to-pray in-order-that, if possible, the hour might-go-past from him. 36And he-was-saying, "Abba [the] Father, all-things (are) possible for-you. Take [the] this cup from me, but not what I want but what you (want)."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And he-comes and finds them sleeping, and he-says to-[the] Peter, "Simon, are-you sleeping? Were-you┘not└able to-keep-watch for-one hour? 38Watch and pray, in-order-that you┘not└come into temptation; the spirit (is) willing, but the flesh (is) weak."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And again, going-away, he-prayed, saying the same word. 40And again coming, he-found them sleeping, for the eyes of-them were weighed-down, and they-did┘not└know what they-might-answer him. 41And he-comes the/a third (time) and says to-them, "Keep-sleeping the/a little (while) and rest." "It-is enough. The hour came; behold, the Son of-Man is-being-betrayed into the hands of-[the] sinners. 42Get-up; let-us-go. Behold, the-one betraying me came-near."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And immediately he-yet speaking, Judas, one of-the twelve, comes and with him (a) crowd with swords and clubs from the chief-priests and the scribes and the elders. 44And the-one betraying him had-given (a) signal to-them, saying, "Whomever2 I-kiss—he is the-One; arrest him and lead┘him└away safely."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> And having-come, immediately, having-come-to him, says, "Rabbi," and kissed him. 46And the/they laid┘[the] hands└on him and arrested him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> And [(a) certain]ms one of-the-ones standing-by, having-drawn the/his sword, struck the/a servant of-the high-priest and cut-off the ear of-him. 48And [the] Jesus, having-responded, said to-them, "As against (an) insurrectionist, you-came-out with swords and clubs to-seize me? 49According-to (the) day/Daily2 I-was with you in the temple teaching, and you-did┘not└arrest me, but (this has happened) in-order-that the scriptures might-be-fulfilled."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> And having-left him, they┘all└fled. 51And a-certain young-man was-following him dressed, (a) linen-sheet (being) over (his) naked (body), and they-seize him. 52And the/he, having-left the linen-sheet, fled naked. 53And they-brought [the] Jesus to the high-priest, and all the chief-priests and the elders and the scribes come-together. 54And [the] Peter followed him from afar up-to inside the courtyard of-the high-priest, and he-was sitting-down with the officers and warming-himself at the fire. 55And the chief-priests and the whole Sanhedrin were-looking-for testimony against [the] Jesus unto [the] putting┘him└to-death, and they-were┘not└finding (it). 56For many were-bringing-false-witness against him, and the/their testimony was not consistent. 57And some, having-arisen, were-bringing-false-witness against him, saying 58[that], "We heard him saying [that] ,'I will-tear-down [the] this [the] hand-made sanctuary, and through three days I-will-build another made-without-hands." 59And not-even so was the testimony of-them consistent. 60And having-arisen in-the-midst2, the high-priest, he-asked [the] Jesus, saying, "You-are┘not└answering nothing/anything what these are-testifying-against you." 61And the/he continued-to-be-silent and answered nothing. Again the high-priest was-asking him and saying to-him, "Are you the Messiah the Son of-the Blessed?" 62And [the] Jesus said, 63And the high-priest having-torn the clothes of-him, says, 'Why do-we┘still└have need of-witnesses? 64You-heard the blasphemy. What does-it-seem to-you?" And all the-ones condemned him to-be deserving of-death. 65And certain-ones began to-spit-on him and to-blindfold the face of-him and to-hit-(him)-with-(their)-fist and to-say to-him, "Prophesy," and the officers held him with-slaps. 66And [the] Peter being below in the courtyard one one-of the servant-girls of-the high-priest comes, 67and having-seen [the] Peter warming-himself, having-looked-at him, says, "You also were with the Nazarene, [the] Jesus." 68And the/he denied (it), saying, "I-do┘neither└know nor understand what you are-saying." And he-went outside into the forecourt [and (a) rooster crowed]ms. 69And the servant-girl, having-seen him, began again to-say to-the-ones standing-by [that], "This-one is of-them." 70And the/he denied (it) again, and after (a) little (while) again the-ones standing-by began-to-say to-[the] Peter, "Truly you-are of them, for you-are also (a) Galilean." 71And the/he began to-curse and to-swear [that], "I-do┘not└know [the] this man whom you-say." 72And immediately of (a) second-(time) (a) rooster crowed, and [the] Peter remembered the word as [the] Jews said to-him [that], "Before (a) rooster crows twice you-will-deny me three-times." And breaking-down, he-began-to-cry.</span>
