## Mark Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And in those [the] days, (a) big crowd being again, and not having anything they-might-eat, having-summoned the disciples, he-says to-them, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>I-have-compassion on the crowd, because already three days they-are-remaining-with me and </em><em>they-do┘not└have</em><em> anything they-might-eat.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> if I-dismiss them hungry to (the) house of-them, they-will-faint on the way, and some of-them have-come from afar.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And the disciples of-him answered him [that], <em>“Whence </em><em>will┘anybody└</em><em>be-able</em><em> to-satisfy these of-bread in (an) unpopulated-area?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>And he-went-on-to-ask them, <em>“How many loaves do-you-have</em><em>?</em><em>”</em> And the/they said, <em>“Seven.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And he-instructed the crowd to-sit-down on the ground. And having-taken the seven loaves, having-given-thanks, he-broke (them) and started-giving (them) to-the disciples of-him in-order-that they-might-distribute (them), and the-distributed (them) to-the crowd. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And they-were-having (a) few small-fish; and having-blessed them, he-said also to-distribute these. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And they-ate and they-were-satisfied, and they-picked-up leftovers of-pieces seven baskets. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And they-were about four-thousand, and he-dismissed them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And immediately having-gotten into the boat with the disciples of-him, he-went into the parts of-Dalmanutha.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And the Pharisees came-out and began to-argue-with him, seeking from him (a) sign from the sky, testing him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>And having-sighed-deeply/having-taken-a-deep-breath, he-says, <em>“Why does┘[the] this evil </em><em>generation└seek</em><em> </em><em>(a) sign?</em><em> </em><em>Truly I-tell you, </em><em>if (a) sign will-be-given/no sign will be given</em><em> to-[the] this generation.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And having-left them, again having-gotten (in the boat), he-went-away to the other-side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>And they-forget to-take loaves and only<sup>2</sup> one loaf were-they-having with them in the boat. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And he-began-to-give┘them└strict-orders, <em>“Look, beware of the leaven of-the Pharisees and the leaven of-Herod.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>And they-began-reasoning to one-another that they-do/did┘not└have loaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>And having-known, he-says to-them<em>, “Why are-you-reasoning that </em><em>you-do┘not└have</em><em> loaves?</em><em> </em><em>Do-you┘not-yet└know</em><em> nor understand?</em><em> </em><em>Do-you-have</em><em> the heart </em><em>of-you</em><em> hardened?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Having</em><em> eyes, </em><em>do-you┘not└see</em><em>; and having ears, </em><em>do-you┘not└hear</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>And </em><em>do-you┘not└remember</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>when</em><em> I-broke the five loaves for the </em><em>five-thousand</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>How-many baskets of-pieces full did-you-pick-up?”</em><em> </em> They-say to-him, <em>“Twelve.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“When</em><em> (I broke the loaves) for the </em><em>four-thousand</em><em>, </em><em>how-many</em><em> baskets full of-pieces did-you-pick-up?”</em><em> </em> And they-say [to-him]<sup>ms</sup>, <em>“Seven.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>And he-went-on-to-say, <em>“</em><em>Do-you┘not-yet└understand</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And they-come into Bethsaida. And they-bring him (a) blind-(man), and they-appeal-to him in-order-that he-might-touch him. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And having-taken-hold of-the hand of-the blind-(man), he-brought him out-of the village. And having-spit in the eyes of-him, having-put┘the/his hands└on him, he-was-asking him [whether], <em>“Do-you-see anything?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>And having-looked-up, he-was-saying, <em>“I-see [the] men, because like trees I-see (them) walking.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Then he-put┘the/his hands└on the eyes of-him again; and he-looked-intently, and he-was-restored and he-saw all-things clearly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And he-sent┘him└away to (the) house of-him, saying, <em>“</em><em>Do┘not└go</em><em> into the village.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him went-out into the villages of-Caesarea [the] Philippi, and on the road he-began-to-ask the disciples of-him, saying to-them, <em>“Who do [the] men </em><em>say</em><em> me to-be?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>And the/they said to-him, saying [that]<sup>ms</sup>, <em>“</em><em>John the Baptist and others, Elijah, and others that (you-are) one of-the prophets.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And <u>he</u> went-on-to-ask them, <em>“But who </em><em>do┘you└</em><em>say</em><em> me to-be?”</em><em> </em> Having-answered, [the] Peter says to-him, <em>“You are the Messiah.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>And he-charged them in-order-that they-tell nobody about him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>And he-began to-teach them that it-is/was-necessary for-the Son of-[the] Man to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by the elders and the chief-priests and the scribes, and to-be-put-to-death and after three days to-be-resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>And he-was-speaking frankly/plainly, and [the] Peter, having-taken┘him└aside, began to-rebuke him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>And the/he, having-turned and having-seen the disciples of-him, rebuked Peter and says, <em>“Get behind me, Satan, because </em><em>you-do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>have-your-mind-on</em><em> the-things of-[the] God</em><em>,</em><em> but the-things of-[the] men.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup>And having-summoned the crowd with the disciples of-him, he-said to-them, <em>“If anybody wants </em><em>to-follow</em><em> after me, let-him-deny himself, and let-him-pick-up </em><em>the cross of-him, and let-him-follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> </em><em>whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> wants </em><em>to-save</em><em> the life of-him will-lose it, and </em><em>whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me and the gospel will-save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> what does-it-profit (a) man to-gain the whole world and to-forfeit the life of-him?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> what would┘(a) </em><em>man└give</em><em> (as an) exchange of-the life of-him?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>For</em><em> </em><em>whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> is-ashamed-of me and [the] my words in [the] this [the] adulterous and sinful generation the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an will be-ashamed-of [him] when he-comes in the glory of-the Father of-him with the holy [the] angels.”</em></span>
