## Mark Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And in those [the] days, (a) big crowd being again, and not having anything they-might-eat, having-summoned the disciples, he-says to-them, 2"I-have-compassion on the crowd, because already three days they-are-remaining-with me and they-do┘not└have anything they-might-eat. 3And if I-dismiss them hungry to (the) house of-them, they-will-faint on the way, and some of-them have-come from afar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And the disciples of-him answered him [that], "Whence will┘anybody└be-able to-satisfy these of-bread in (an) unpopulated-area?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And he-went-on-to-ask them, "How many loaves do-you-have?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And he-instructed the crowd to-sit-down on the ground. And having-taken the seven loaves, having-given-thanks, he-broke (them) and started-giving (them) to-the disciples of-him in-order-that they-might-distribute (them), and the-distributed (them) to-the crowd. 7And they-were-having (a) few small-fish; and having-blessed them, he-said also to-distribute these. 8And they-ate and they-were-satisfied, and they-picked-up leftovers of-pieces seven baskets. 9And they-were about four-thousand, and he-dismissed them. 10And immediately having-gotten into the boat with the disciples of-him, he-went into the parts of-Dalmanutha.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the Pharisees came-out and began to-argue-with him, seeking from him (a) sign from the sky, testing him. 12And having-sighed-deeply/having-taken-a-deep-breath, he-says, "Why does┘[the] this evil generation└seek (a) sign? Truly I-tell you, if (a) sign will-be-given/no sign will be given to-[the] this generation." 13And having-left them, again having-gotten (in the boat), he-went-away to the other-side.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And they-forget to-take loaves and only2 one loaf were-they-having with them in the boat. 15And he-began-to-give┘them└strict-orders,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And they-began-reasoning to one-another that they-do/did┘not└have loaves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And having-known, he-says to-them, "Why are-you-reasoning that you-do┘not└have loaves? Do-you┘not-yet└know nor understand? Do-you-have the heart of-you hardened? 18Having eyes, do-you┘not└see; and having ears, do-you┘not└hear? And do-you┘not└remember 19when I-broke the five loaves for the five-thousand? How-many baskets of-pieces full did-you-pick-up?" 20"When (I broke the loaves) for the four-thousand, how-many baskets full of-pieces did-you-pick-up?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And he-went-on-to-say, "Do-you┘not-yet└understand?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And they-come into Bethsaida. And they-bring him (a) blind-(man), and they-appeal-to him in-order-that he-might-touch him. 23And having-taken-hold of-the hand of-the blind-(man), he-brought him out-of the village. And having-spit in the eyes of-him, having-put┘the/his hands└on him, he-was-asking him [whether],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And having-looked-up, he-was-saying, "I-see [the] men, because like trees I-see (them) walking."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then he-put┘the/his hands└on the eyes of-him again; and he-looked-intently, and he-was-restored and he-saw all-things clearly.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And he-sent┘him└away to (the) house of-him, saying, "Do┘not└go into the village."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him went-out into the villages of-Caesarea [the] Philippi, and on the road he-began-to-ask the disciples of-him, saying to-them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And the/they said to-him, saying [that]ms, "John the Baptist and others, Elijah, and others that (you-are) one of-the prophets."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And he went-on-to-ask them, "But who do┘you└say me to-be?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> And he-charged them in-order-that they-tell nobody about him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And he-began to-teach them that it-is/was-necessary for-the Son of-[the] Man to-suffer many-things and to-be-rejected by the elders and the chief-priests and the scribes, and to-be-put-to-death and after three days to-be-resurrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> And he-was-speaking frankly/plainly, and [the] Peter, having-taken┘him└aside, began to-rebuke him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> And the/he, having-turned and having-seen the disciples of-him, rebuked Peter and says, "Get behind me, Satan, because you-do┘not└have-your-mind-on the-things of-[the] God, but the-things of-[the] men."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And having-summoned the crowd with the disciples of-him, he-said to-them, "If anybody wants to-follow after me, let-him-deny himself, and let-him-pick-up the cross of-him, and let-him-follow me. 35For whoever2 wants to-save the life of-him will-lose it, and whoever2 loses the life of-him for-the-sake-of me and the gospel will-save it. 36For what does-it-profit (a) man to-gain the whole world and to-forfeit the life of-him? 37For what would┘(a) man└give (as an) exchange of-the life of-him? 38For whoever2 is-ashamed-of me and [the] my words in [the] this [the] adulterous and sinful generation the Son of-[the] Man will be-ashamed-of [him] when he-comes in the glory of-the Father of-him with the holy [the] angels."</span>
