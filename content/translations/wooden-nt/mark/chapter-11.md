## Mark Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And when they-are-nearing [to] Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the Mount of-[the] Olives, he-sends two of-the disciples of-him, 2and he-says to-them, "Go into the village [the] across-from you, and immediately, entering into it, you-will-find (a) donkey-colt tied, on which nobody of-men [not-yet]ms sat. Untie it and bring (it). 3And if anybody says to-you, 'Why are-you-doing this,' say, 'The Lord has need of-it,' and immediately he-will-send it back here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And they-went-away and found (a) donkey-colt tied at (the) gate outside by the street, and they-untie it. 5And some of-the-ones standing there began-to-say to-them, "What are-you-doing, untying the donkey-colt?" 6And the/they said to-them even-as [the] Jesus said, and they-let them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> And they-bring the donkey-colt to [the] Jesus, and they-put-on it the clothes of-them, and he-sat on it. 8And many spread the clothes of-them in the road; and others, having-cut-off branches from the fields, 9and the-ones going-in-front and the-ones following began to-shout,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And he-entered into Jerusalem into the temple; and having-looked-around-at all-things, the hour already being late, he-entered into Bethany with the twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And the next-day, they having-come from Bethany, he-was-hungry. 13And having-seen (a) fig tree from-afar having leaves, he-came (to see) whether then he-would-find anything on it. And having-come to-it, he-found nothing on it except2 leaves, for the time was not of-figs. 14And having-responded, he-said to-it, "No-longer may nobody/anybody eat from you unto the age/forever3," and the disciples of-him were-listening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And they-come into Jerusalem; and having-entered into the temple, he-began to-drive-out the-ones selling and the-ones buying in the temple, and he-overturned the tables of-the money-changers and the seats of-the-ones selling [the] doves, 16and he-would┘not└allow [in-order]-that anybody should-carry (a) vessel through the temple. 17And he-began-to-teach and to-say to-them, "Is-it┘not└written [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> And the chief-priests and the scribes heard and began-to-seek how they-might-destroy him, for they-were-afraid-of him, for all the crowd was-being-amazed at the teaching of-him. 19And when evening came, they-would-travel outside the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And passing-by in-the-morning, they-saw the fig-tree withered from (the) root. 21And having-been-reminded, [the] Peter says to-him, "Rabbi, behold, the fig-tree that you-cursed has-withered.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And having-answered, [the] Jesus says to-them, "Have faith of-God. 23Truly I say to-you that whoever2 says to-[the] this mountain, 'Be-picked-up and be-thrown into the sea, and does┘not└doubt in the heart of-him, but believes that what he-says happens, it-will-be to-him. 24On-account-of this I-say to-you, all-things as-many-as you-pray and ask-for you-receive—believe that you-received (them), and it-will-be to-you. 25And when you stand praying, forgive, if you-have something against somebody, in-order-that the Father of-youpl [the] in [the] heaven[s] may-forgive you the trespasses of-you." [[26]]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And they-come again into Jerusalem; and in the temple, he walking, the chief-priests and the scribes and the elders come to him, 28and they-begin-by-saying, "By what authority are-you-doing these-things, and who gave you [the] this authority in-order-that you-may-do these-things?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "I-will-ask you one matter, and you-answer me and I-will-tell you by what authority I-do these-things. 30The baptism [the] of-John—was-it from heaven or from man? Answer me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> And they-began-reasoning with each-other, saying, "If we-say, 'From heaven,' he-will-say, 'On-account-of what [then]ms did-you┘not└believe-in him?' 32But (if) we-say, 'From men,'"—they-were-afraid-of the crowd, for all were-having [the] John truly that he-was (a) prophet. 33And having—answered [the] Jesus, they-say, "We-do┘not└know." And [the] Jesus says to-them, "Neither do┘I└say to-you by what authority I-am-doing these-things."</span>
