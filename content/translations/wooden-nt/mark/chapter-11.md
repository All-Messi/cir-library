## Mark Chapter **11**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And when they-are-nearing [to] Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the Mount of-[the] Olives, he-sends two of-the disciples of-him, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and he-says to-them, <em>“Go into the village [the] across-from you, and immediately, </em><em>entering into</em><em> it, you-will-find (a) donkey-colt tied, on which nobody of-men [not-yet]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> sat.</em><em> </em><em>Untie it and bring (it).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> if anybody says to-you, ‘Why are-you-doing this,’ say, ‘The Lord has need of-it,’ and immediately he-will-send it back here.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>And they-went-away and found (a) donkey-colt tied at (the) gate outside by the street, and they-untie it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And some of-the-ones standing there began-to-say to-them, <em>“What are-you-doing</em><em>,</em><em> untying the donkey-colt?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And the/they said to-them even-as [the] Jesus said, and they-let them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>And they-bring the donkey-colt to [the] Jesus, and they-put-on it the clothes of-them, and he-sat on it. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And many spread the clothes of-them in the road; and others, having-cut-off branches from the fields, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and the-ones going-in-front and the-ones following began to-shout, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Hosanna;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>b</em></strong><strong><em>lessed (is) the-One coming in (the name of-(the)-Lord.</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“Blesed</em><em> (is) the coming kingdom of-the father of-us David.</em> <em>	Hosanna in the highest.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And he-entered into Jerusalem into the temple; and having-looked-around-at all-things, the hour already being late, he-entered into Bethany with the twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And the next-day, they having-come from Bethany, he-was-hungry. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And having-seen (a) fig tree from-afar having leaves, he-came (to see) whether then he-would-find anything on it. And having-come to-it, he-found nothing on it except<sup>2</sup> leaves, for the time was not of-figs. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And having-responded, he-said to-it, <em>“No-longer may nobody/anybody eat from you </em><em>unto the age/</em><em>forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>,”</em> and the disciples of-him were-listening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>And they-come into Jerusalem; and having-entered into the temple, he-began to-drive-out the-ones selling and the-ones buying in the temple, and he-overturned the tables of-the money-changers and the seats of-the-ones selling [the] doves, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and he-would┘not└allow [in-order]-that anybody should-carry (a) vessel through the temple. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And he-began-to-teach and to-say to-them, <em>“</em><em>Is-it</em><em>┘</em><em>not└written</em><em> [that],</em> <strong><em>‘The house of-me will-be-called (a) house of-prayer</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>for</em></strong><strong><em>-all (the) </em></strong><strong><em>nations’</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong> <em>But you-have-made it (a) den of-thieves.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>And the chief-priests and the scribes heard and began-to-seek how they-might-destroy him, for they-were-afraid-of him, for all the crowd was-being-amazed at the teaching of-him. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And when evening came, they-would-travel outside the city.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And passing-by in-the-morning, they-saw the fig-tree withered from (the) root. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And having-been-reminded, [the] Peter says to-him, <em>“Rabbi, behold, the fig-tree that you-cursed has-withered.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>And having-answered, [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Have faith of-G</em><em>od.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Truly</em><em> I say to-</em><em>you that </em><em>whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> says to-[the] this mountain, ‘Be-picked-up and be-thrown into the </em><em>sea, and</em><em> </em><em>does┘not└doubt</em><em> in the heart of-him, but believes that what he-says happens, it-will-be to-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>On</em><em>-account</em><em>-of this I-say to-you, all-things as-many-as y</em><em>ou-pray and ask-for you-receive—</em><em>believe that you-received (them), and it-will-be to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>And</em><em> when you stand praying, forgive</em><em>,</em><em> if you-have something against somebody, in-order-that the Father of-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> [the] in [the] heaven[s] may-forgive you the trespasses of-you.”</em> [[<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>]]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And they-come again into Jerusalem; and in the temple, he walking, the chief-priests and the scribes and the elders come to him, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and they-begin-by-saying, <em>“By what authority are-you-doing these-things, and who gave you [the] this authority in-order-that you-may-do these-things?</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus said to-them<em>, “I-will</em><em>-</em><em>ask you one matte</em><em>r, and you</em><em>-answer me and I-will-tell you by what authority I-do these-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> baptism [the] of-John—was-it from heaven or from man?</em><em> </em><em>Answer me.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>And they-began-reasoning with each-other, saying, <em>“If we-say, ‘From heaven,’ he-will-say, ‘On-account-of</em><em> what [then]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> </em><em>did-you┘not└believe</em><em>-in</em><em> him?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> </em><em>(if) we</em><em>-say, ‘From men,’”</em>—they-were-afraid-of the crowd, for all were-having [the] John truly that he-was (a) prophet. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And having—answered [the] Jesus, they-say, <em>“</em><em>We-do┘not└know</em><em>.”</em> And [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“Neither </em><em>do┘</em><em><u>I</u></em><em>└</em><em>say</em><em> to-you by what authority I-am-doing these-things.”</em></span>
