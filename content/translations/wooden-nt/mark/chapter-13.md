## Mark Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And he going-out of the temple, one of-the disciples of-him says, "Teacher, behold, what stones! And what buildings!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> And [the] Jesus said to-them, "Do-you-see these [the] large buildings? Stone on stone here will┘certainly not└be-left that will┘certainly not└be-torn down."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And he sitting on the Mount of-[the] Olives over-against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew ask privately2, 4"Tell us, when will-these-things be, and what (will be) the sign when these-things are┘all└about to-be-finished?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> And [the] Jesus began to-say to-them, "Beware lest anybody deceives you. 6Many will-come in the name of-me, saying [that], 'I am,' and will-deceive many. 7And when you hear-about wars and rumors of-wars, do┘not└be-alarmed. It-is-necessary for-(these) to-happen, but the end (is) not-yet. 8For nation will-be-raised-up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. Earthquakes will-be according-to places/everywhere; famines will-be. These (are) (the) beginning of-birth-pangs. 9But you yourselves beware. They-will-betray you into courts, and you-will-be-scourged in synagogues, and you-will-stand before governors and kings for-the-sake of-me for (a) testimony to-them. 10And it-is-necessary for-the gospel to-be-preached in all the nations. 11And when they lead you, betraying (you), do┘not└worry-ahead-of-time what you-will-say, but whatever2 is-given to-you in that [the] hour, say this, for you are not the-ones speaking but the Holy [the] Spirit. 12And brother will-betray brother to death and father (will betray) son, and children will-rise-up-against parents and put┘them└to-death. 13And you-will-be hated by all on-account-of me, but the-one having-remained to (the) end—this-one will-be-saved. 14"And when you-see the abomination of-[the] desolation standing where it-must not, [let┘the reading-one└understand], then let┘the-ones in [the] Judaea└flee into the mountains, 15and let┘not the-one on the housetop [not]└go-down nor enter-in to-take anything out-of the house of-him. 16And let┘not the-one in the field└return into the-things behind to-pick-up the/a garment of-him. 17And to-the-ones having in (the) womb/pregnant and to-the-ones nursing in those [the] days. 18But pray [in-order]-that it┘not└be during-(the)-winter; 19for [the] those days will-be (a) tribulation such as has┘not└been from (the) beginning of-creation that [the] God created until the now and will┘certainly not└be. 20And except2 the Lord cut┘the days└short, all flesh would not be-saved, but on-account-of the elect/chosen-ones whom he-chose, he-cut┘the days└short. 21And then if anybody says to-you, 'Behold, the Messiah (is) here; behold, (he is) there; do┘not└believe (it). 22For false-Messiahs and false-prophets will-arise and do signs and wonders unto [the] deceiving, if possible, the elect/chosen-ones. 23But you beware. I-have-told┘you these-things└ahead-of-time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But in those [the] days after [the] that tribulation,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And they they-will-see 'the Son of-[the] Man coming on (the) clouds' with great power and glory. 27And then he-will-send-out the/his angels and they-will-bring-together (one) end of-earth unto (the) end of-(the) sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And learn (a) parable from the fig-tree. Indeed when the branch of-it becomes tender and puts-out [the] leaves, you-know that [the] summer is near. 29Thus also you, when you-see these-things happening, you-know that it-is near at (the) doors. 30Truly I-say to-you that [the] this generation will┘certainly not└pass-by until2 all-these-things happen. 31[The] heaven and [the] earth will-pass-away, bu the words of-me will┘certainly not└pass-away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Now concerning [the] that day or [the] hour nobody knows, not-even the angels in heaven, not-even the Son, except2 the Father. 33Watch; stay-alert, for you-do┘not└know when the time is. 34Like (a) man away-from-home, having-left the house of-him and having-given to-the servants of-him [the] authority, to-each the work of-him and to-the doorkeeper he-gave-commandments [in-order]-that he-should-be-on-the-alert. 35So watch. For you do┘not└know when the lord of-the house is-coming, whether in-the-evening or in-the-middle-of-the-night or during rooster-crowning or in-the-morning, 36lest, having-come suddenly, he-find you sleeping. 37But what I-say to-you I-say to-all: watch.</span>
