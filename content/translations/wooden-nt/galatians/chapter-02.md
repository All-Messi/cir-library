## Galatians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then after fourteen years again I-went-up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking┘Titus└along. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But I-went-up by revelation and I-put-before them the gospel that I-was-preaching among the Gentiles, but privately to-the reputed-ones lest somehow I-would-be-running or had-run in vain. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But not-even Titus the-one with me, being (a) Greek, was-compelled to-be-circumcised. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But because-of secretly-come-in false-brothers, who-slipped-in to-spy-out the liberty of-us that we-have in Christ Jesus, in-order-that they-would-bring┘us└into-bondage, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>to-whom not-even for (an) hour did-we-yield to-[the] subjection, in-order-that the truth of-the gospel might-remain with you. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But from the-ones reputed to-be something—whatever at-the-time they-were matters nothing to-me; [the] God does┘not└receive (the) face of-(a)-man—for the reputed-ones added nothing to-me. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>But to-the-contrary, seeing that I-had-been-entrusted-with the gospel of-the uncircumcision as Peter (with the gospel) of-the circumcision—<strong><sup>8</sup></strong>for the-one having-worked for-Peter in (the) apostleship of-the circumcision also worked for-me in the Gentiles—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and, knowing the grace [the] given to-me, James and Cephas and John, the reputed to-be pillars, gave to-me and to-Barnabas (the) right (hands) that we (might go) to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>only in-order-that we-might-remember the poor, which also I┘myself└was-eager to-do this.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And when Cephas came to Antioch, I-opposed him to (the) face because he-was condemned. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For before [the] certain-ones came from James, he-was-eating with the Gentiles; but when they-came, he-began-to-withdraw and was-separating himself, fearing the-ones of-the circumcision; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and the remaining/rest-of-(the) Jews joined-with┘him└in-the-hypocrisy, so-that even Barnabas was-led-astray by-the hypocrisy of-them. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But when I-saw that they-were┘not└walking-straight in-reference-to the truth of-the gospel, I-said to-[the] Peter before all, <em>“If you, being (a) Jew, live like-Gentiles and not like-Jews—how do you-compel </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> Gentiles to-live-l</em><em>ike-Jews?</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>15</sup></em></strong><em>We</em><em>, </em><em>(</em><em>being</em><em>)</em><em> Je</em><em>ws by-nature and not sinners of (the) </em><em>Gentiles, </em><strong><em><sup>16</sup></em></strong><em>and</em><em> knowing that (a) man </em><em>is┘not└justified</em><em> by works of-law, </em><em>but</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> through faith of-Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus in-order-that we-might-be-justified by faith of-Christ and not by works of-law, because all flesh </em><em>will┘not└</em><em>be-justified</em><em> by works of-law.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>17</sup></em></strong><em>A</em><em>nd</em><em> if, trying to-be-justified in</em><em> Christ, </em><em>we┘ourselves└are-found</em><em> sinners, then (is) Christ (a) minister of-sin?</em><em> </em><em>May-it┘not└be</em><em>!</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>18</sup></em></strong><em>For</em><em> if I-build again the</em><em>se-things that I-destroyed, I-make myself (a) transgressor.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>19</sup></em></strong><em>For</em><em> </em><em>through the </em><em>L</em><em>aw </em><em>I died to-(the)-</em><em>l</em><em>aw</em><em>, </em><em>in-order-</em><em>that I-might-live to-</em><em>God.</em><em> </em><em>I-have-been-crucified-with Christ.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>20</sup></em></strong><em>But</em><em> I no-longer live, but Christ lives in me.</em><em> </em><em>And what now I-live in (the) flesh, I-live by faith [the] of-the Son of-[the] God</em><em>,</em><em> the-one having-loved me and given himself </em><em>on-behalf-of</em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><em><sup>21</sup></em></strong><em>I-</em><em>do┘not└nullify</em><em> the grace of-[the] God.</em><em> </em><em>For if r</em><em>ighteousness (is) by law, then </em><em>Christ died needlessly.</em><em>”</em></span>
