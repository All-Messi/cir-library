## Galatians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Brothers, even if (a) man is-caught-up in any sin, you the-ones spiritual restore [the] such-(a person) in (the) spirit of-humility/gentleness, watching yourselves lest you also get-tempted. 2Bear the burdens of-one-another, and in-this way fulfill the 'law' of-[the] Christ. 3For if anybody thinks (himself) to-be something, being nothing, he-deceives himself. 4But let┘each└examine the work of-himself, and then he-will-have [the] boasting to himself only and not to the other-(person). 5For each will-bear [the] his-own burden. 6But let┘the-one taught the word└share-with the-one teaching in all good-things. 7Do┘not└be-deceived; God is┘not└mocked. For what (a) man sows—this he-will┘also└reap; 8because the-one sowing to-the flesh of-himself will-reap from the flesh corruption, but the-one sowing to the spirit will-reap from the spirit eternal life. 9But doing [the] good, let-us┘not└become-discouraged, for in-our-own-time we-will-reap, not giving-up. 10So then, as we-have opportunity, let-us-work-(hard at) the good-thing toward all, but especially toward the-ones of-(the)-household of-[the] faith/trust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> See with-what-large letters I-wrote to-you with-[the] my hand. 12As-many-as want to-make-(a)-good-showing in (the) flesh—these are-requiring you to-be-circumcised in-order-that they-may┘not└be-persecuted for-the cross of-[the] Christ. 13For not even the-ones circumcised keep the Law themselves, but they-want you to-be-circumcised in-order-that they-may-take-pride-in [the] your flesh. 14But may-it┘not└be for-me to-take-pride except2 in the cross of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, through whom (the) world has-been-crucified to-me and-I to-(the)-world. 15For neither circumcision is anything or uncircumcision, but (a) new creation. 16And as-many-as will-conduct-themselves by this [the] rule—(may) peace (be) on them and mercy and on the Israel of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> During-the remaining (time) let┘nobody└cause me trouble, for I bear in the body of-me the marks of-[the] Jesus. 18[The] grace of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ (be) with the spirit of-you, brothers. Amen.</span>
