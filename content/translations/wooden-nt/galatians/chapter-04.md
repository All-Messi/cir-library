## Galatians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I-say, for as-long┘(a) time└as the/an heir is (a) minor, he-differs with-respect-to-nothing from-(a)-slave, though-being lord of-all, 2but is under guardians and trustees until the pre-set-time of-the father. 3So also we, when we-were minors, were enslaved by the basic-rules of-the world; 4but when the fullness of-[the] time came, [the] God sent-out the Son of-him, becoming from woman, become under law, 5in-order-that he-might-redeem the-ones under law in-order-that we-might-receive [the] sonship-by-adoption. 6And because you-are sons, [the] God sent-out the Spirit of-the Son of-him into the hearts of-us, crying-out, "Abba, [the] Father." 7So-that yousg are no-longer (a) slave, but (a) son; and if (a) son, also (an) heir through God. 8But at-that-time, not knowing God, you-served the-ones by-nature not being gods. 9But now, having-come-to-know God—but rather having-been-known by God, how do-you-turn-back again to the weak and beggarly elements which you-desire to-serve back again? 10You-observe days and months and seasons and years. 11I-am-afraid-for you lest somehow I-have-labored for you for-nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Become as I (am), because I┘(am)└also like you (are), brothers; I-beg you. You-wronged me with-respect-to-nothing. 13And you-know that through (a) weakness of-the flesh I-preached-the-gospel-to you the first/former-time, 14and the trial of-youpl in the flesh of-me you-did┘not└look-down-on-with-contempt nor spit-at, but like (an) angel of-God you-welcomed me, like Christ Jesus. 15Where then (is) the blessing of-you? For I-testify to-you that, if possible, having-gouged-out the eyes of-you, you-would-have-given (them) to-me. 16So-that have-I-become (an) enemy of-you telling┘you└ (the)-truth? 17They-do┘not└seek you well, but they-want-to-exclude you in-order-that you-might-show-great-interest-in them. 18But (it is) good always to-be-shown-great-interest in (a) good (way) and not only in my (the) being-present with you. 19My children, whom again I-am-in-labor-pains-for till2 Christ is-formed in you. 20And I-was-wanting to-be-present with you now and to change the voice of-me, because I-am-disturbed by you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Tell me, the-ones wanting to-be under law, are-you┘not└listening to the Law? 22For it-has-been-written that Abraham had two sons, one by the/a slave-girl and one by the/a free woman. 23But the-one has-been-born by the slave girl according-to (the) flesh, but the-one by the free (woman) through promise—24which-things are allegorically-spoken. For these are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing to slavery, which is Hagar. 25And [the] Hagar is Mount Sinai in [the] Arabia, and parallels the present Jerusalem, for she-is-(a)-slave along-with the children of-her. 26But the Jerusalem above is free, who is (the) mother of-us. 27For it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But you, brothers, are children of-promise according-to Isaac. 29But as then the-one having-been-born according-to (the) flesh was-persecuting the-one (having-been-born) according-to the spirit. So also now. 30But what does┘the scripture└say?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Wherefore, brothers, we-are not children of-(a)-slave-girl, but of-the free (woman).</span>
