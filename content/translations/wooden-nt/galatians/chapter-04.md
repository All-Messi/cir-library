## Galatians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I-say, for as-long┘(a) time└as the/an heir is (a) minor, he-differs with-respect-to-nothing from-(a)-slave, though-being lord of-all, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>but is under guardians and trustees until the pre-set-time of-the father. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So also we, when we-were minors, were enslaved by the basic-rules of-the world; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>but when the fullness of-[the] time came, [the] God sent-out the Son of-him, becoming from woman, become under law, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>in-order-that he-might-redeem the-ones under law in-order-that we-might-receive [the] sonship-by-adoption. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And because you-are sons, [the] God sent-out the Spirit of-the Son of-him into the hearts of-us, crying-out, <em>“Abba, [the] Father.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So-that you<sup>sg</sup> are no-longer (a) slave, but (a) son; and if (a) son, also (an) heir through God. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But at-that-time, not knowing God, you-served the-ones by-nature not being gods. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But now, having-come-to-know God—but rather having-been-known by God, how do-you-turn-back again to the weak and beggarly elements which you-desire to-serve back again? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>You-observe days and months and seasons and years. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>I-am-afraid-for you lest somehow I-have-labored for you for-nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Become as I (am), because I┘(am)└also like you (are), brothers; I-beg you. You-wronged me with-respect-to-nothing. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And you-know that through (a) weakness of-the flesh I-preached-the-gospel-to you the first/former-time, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>and the trial of-you<sup>pl</sup> in the flesh of-me you-did┘not└look-down-on-with-contempt nor spit-at, but like (an) angel of-God you-welcomed me, like Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Where then (is) the blessing of-you? For I-testify to-you that, if possible, having-gouged-out the eyes of-you, you-would-have-given (them) to-me. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So-that have-I-become (an) enemy of-you telling┘you└ (the)-truth? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They-do┘not└seek you well, but they-want-to-exclude you in-order-that you-might-show-great-interest-in them. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But (it is) good always to-be-shown-great-interest in (a) good (way) and not only in my (the) being-present with you. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>My children, whom again I-am-in-labor-pains-for till<sup>2</sup> Christ is-formed in you. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And I-was-wanting to-be-present with you now and to change the voice of-me, because I-am-disturbed by you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Tell me, the-ones wanting to-be under law, are-you┘not└listening to the Law? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For it-has-been-written that Abraham had two sons, one by the/a slave-girl and one by the/a free woman. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But the-one has-been-born by the slave girl according-to (the) flesh, but the-one by the free (woman) through promise—<strong><sup>24</sup></strong>which-things are allegorically-spoken. For these are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing to slavery, which is Hagar. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And [the] Hagar is Mount Sinai in [the] Arabia, and parallels the present Jerusalem, for she-is-(a)-slave along-with the children of-her. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>But the Jerusalem above is free, who is (the) mother of-us. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>For it-has-been-written, <strong>“Celebrate, barren-one the-one not bearing (children).</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>Cry</strong><strong>-out and </strong><strong>scream</strong><strong>, the-one not being-in-labor,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>because </strong><strong>many more (</strong><strong>are) the children of-the desolate</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>han of-the-one having </strong><strong>the/a</strong><strong> husband.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But you, brothers, are children of-promise according-to Isaac. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>But as then the-one having-been-born according-to (the) flesh was-persecuting the-one (having-been-born) according-to the spirit. So also now. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But what does┘the scripture└say? <strong>“Cast-out the slave-girl and the son of-</strong><strong>her;</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>for the son of-the slave-girl </strong><strong>will┘certainly</strong><strong> </strong><strong>not└inherit</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>with the son” of-the free</strong><strong> (woman)</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Wherefore, brothers, we-are not children of-(a)-slave-girl, but of-the free (woman). <strong>5</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Christ certainly set┘us└free<sup>3</sup>; so stand-firm and do┘not again└be-subject to-(a)-yoke of-bondage.</span>
