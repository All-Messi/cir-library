## Galatians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, (an) apostle not from men nor through men, but through Jesus Christ and God (the) Father, the-one having-raised him from (the) dead, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and all the brothers with me to-the churches of-[the] Galatia. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>the-One having-given himself on-behalf-of the sins of-us, in-order-that he-might-deliver us from the present [the] evil world according-to the will of-the God and Father of-us, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>to-whom (be) [the] for the ages of the ages. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I-am-amazed that so quickly you-are-turning-away from the-One having-called you by (the) grace [of-Christ]<sup>ms</sup> to another gospel, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>which is not another, except<sup>2</sup> some are the-ones troubling you and wanting to-distort the gospel of-[the] Christ. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But, if we or (an) angel from heaven preaches┘to-you└ (a)-gospel (different) from what we-preached to-you, let-him-be-accursed. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>As we-have-said-already, also now I-say (it) again, if anybody preaches┘you└ (a)-gospel (different) from what you received, let-him-be accursed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> For now am-I-persuading men or [the] God? Or am-I-trying to-please men? If I-were┘yet└pleasing men, I┘would not└be (a) servant of-Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> For I-make-know to-you, brothers, the gospel [the] preached by me that it-is not according-to man. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>For neither did┘I└receive it from man, nor was-I-taught (it), but (it came to me) through (the) revelation of-Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> For you-heard-about [the] my former manner-of-life in [the] Judaism that beyond measure I-used-to-persecute the church of-[the] God and tried-to-destroy it. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And I-was-advancing in [the] Judaism above many contemporaries in the race of-me, being more-zealously (a) person for the traditions of-(the) ancestors of-me. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But when [the God]<sup>ms</sup>, the-One having-set┘me└apart from (the) womb of-(the)-mother of-me and having-called (me) through the grace of-him, was-pleased <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>to-reveal the Son of-him in me, in-order-that I-might-preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I-did┘not└consult-with flesh and blood, <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>not did-I-go-up to Jerusalem to the apostles before me, but I-went-away into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then after three years I-went-up to Jerusalem to-get-acquainted-with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>but I-did┘not└see another of-the apostles except<sup>2</sup> James, the brother of-the Lord. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And what-things I-am-writing to-you, behold, before [the] God because I-am┘not└lying. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Then I-went into the districts of-[the] Syria and [the] Cilicia; <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>and I-was unknown by-[the] face to-the churches of-[the] Judaea the-ones in Christ. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But they-were-hearing only that “The-one persecuting us at-one-time is┘now└preaching the faith that he┘once└was-trying-to-destroy.” <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>And they-glorified [the] God in me.</span>
