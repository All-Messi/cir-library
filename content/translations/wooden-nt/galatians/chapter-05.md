## Galatians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Christ certainly set┘us└free3; so stand-firm and do┘not again└be-subject to-(a)-yoke of-bondage.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you are circumcised, Christ will┘not└benefit you anything. 3And I-testify again to every man (that is) circumcised that he is (a) debtor to-do the whole Law. 4You-have-been-cut-off from Christ, (you) who are-justified by law; you-fell from [the] grace. 5For we by-(the)-spirit out-of trust are-waiting-for (the) hope of-righteousness. 6For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision accomplishes anything nor uncircumcision, but trust working through love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You-were-running well. Who prevented you not to-obey the truth? The persuasion (was) not from the-One calling you. 9(A) little yeast leavens the whole lump. 10I am-confident in you in (the) Lord that you-will-adopt no other thing, but the-one disturbing you will-bear [the] judgment, whoever2 he-is. 11But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am-I┘still└being-persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of-the cross would-disappear. 12I-wish the-ones troubling you will┘even└mutilate themselves!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> For you were-called for freedom, brothers. Only (do) not (use) [the] freedom as (an) occasion for the flesh, but through [the] love serve one-another. 14For all the Law has-been-fulfilled in one statement—in [the], "You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself." 15And if you bite and devour one-another, beware lest you-get-consumed by one-another.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I tell you, walk by (the) spirit and you-will┘certainly not└be-fulfilling (the) desire of-(the)-flesh. 17For the flesh desires against the spirit, and the spirit (desires) against the flesh, for these are-opposed to one-another, in-order-that not what you want these-things you-do. 18But if you-are-led by (the) spirit, you-are not under law. 19Now the deeds of-the flesh are evident, which are sexual-immorality, uncleanness, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, rivalry, jealous, rages, disputes, divisions, factions, 21envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and the-things like these, which I-say┘to-you└ahead-of time, as I-told-(you)-before, [that] the-ones doing [the] such-things will┘not└inherit (the) kingdom of-God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But the fruit of-the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23gentleness, self-control. No law exists against [the] such-things. 24But the-ones of-Christ [Jesus]ms crucified the flesh with the/its passions and the/its desires. 25If we-have-life by-(the)-spirit, let-us┘also└conduct-ourselves by-(the)-spirit. Let-us┘not└become-boastful, irritating one-another, envying one-another.</span>
