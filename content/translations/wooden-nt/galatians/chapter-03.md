## Galatians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>O foolish Galatians, who put┘you└under-a-spell, to-whom according-to eyes Jesus Christ was-displayed crucified? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>This only do-I-want to-learn from you: did-you-receive the Spirit by works of-law or (the) hearing of-faith? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Are-you so foolish, having-begun with-spirit, are-you┘now└trying-to-finish with flesh? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Did-you-suffer so-many-things for-nothing—if indeed<sup>2</sup> (it was) for-nothing? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So then, the-one providing the Spirit to-you and working miracles among you—(does he do it) by works of-law or by (the) hearing of-faith? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Even-as Abraham <strong>“believed [the] God, and it-was-regarded to-him for righteousness.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Know then that the-ones of faith—these are sons of Abraham. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The scripture, foreseeing that [the] God would-justify the Gentiles by faith, preached-the-gospel-beforehand to-[the] Abraham [that], <strong>“All the nations will-be-blessed in you.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>So-that the-ones of faith are-blessed with [the] faithful Abraham. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For as-many-as are of works of-law are under (a) curse, for it-has-been-written [that], <strong>“Accursed (is) everybody who </strong><strong>does┘not└continue</strong><strong> in all the-things written in the book of-the </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>aw [the] to-do them.”</strong> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Now that by law nobody is-able to-be-justified before [the] God is evident, because, <strong>“The just-one shall-live by faith.”</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Now [the] law is not of faith, but, <strong>“The-one having-done them will-have-life in them.</strong><strong>”</strong><strong> </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Christ redeemed us from the curse of-the law, becoming (a) curse on-behalf-of us, because it-has-been-written, <strong>“Everybody [the</strong><strong>-one</strong><strong>] hanging on (a) tree (is) accursed,”</strong> in-order-that in Christ Jesus the blessing of-[the] Abraham might-become to the Gentiles, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>in-order-that we-might-receive the promise of-the Spirit through [the] faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Brothers, I-am-speaking according-to man. Even-though, (it is a) ratified/enacted-covenant of-man, nobody annuls or adds-to-it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Now the promises were-spoken to-[the] Abraham and to-the seed of-him. It-does┘not└say “and to-[the] seeds,” as in-reference-to many, but as in-reference-to one, <strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd to-the seed of-you,</strong><strong>”</strong> who is Christ. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But I-say this: (a) covenant ratified/enacted-beforehand by [the] God, the law having-come-to-be after four-hundred and thirty years does┘not└annul unto the abolishing-of the promise. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For if the inheritance (is) by law, (it is) no-longer by promise. But to-[the] Abraham [the] God has-granted (it) through promise. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>What then ((is) the Law? It was-added because-of [the] transgressions until<sup>2</sup> the seed should-come to-whom it-was-promised, having-been-ordained by angels at (the) hand of-(a)-mediator. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But the/a mediator is not of-one, but [the] God is one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>So (is) the Law against the promises of-[the] God? May-it┘not└be! For if (a) law had-been-given [the] able to-make-alive, truly [the] righteousness would-have been by law. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But the scripture locked-up all┘[the]└things under sin, in-order-that the promise might-be-given to-[the] believing-ones by trust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>But before [the] trust [the] coming, we-were-being-held-in-custody by law, being-locked-up for the future faith to-be-revealed, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>with-the-result-that the Law has-become (a) tutor unto Christ, in-order-that we-might-be-justified by trust. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But [the] trust having-come, we-are no-longer under (a) tutor. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>For you-are all sons of-God through [the] trust in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>For as-many┘of-you<sup>┘┘</sup>└as <sup>└└</sup>were-baptized into Christ, put-on Christ. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>There-is not Jew or Greek, there-is not slave or free, there-is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>If you<sup>pl</sup> (are) of-Christ, then you-are seed<sup>sg</sup> of-Abraham, heirs according-to promise.</span>
