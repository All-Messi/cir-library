## Galatians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> O foolish Galatians, who put┘you└under-a-spell, to-whom according-to eyes Jesus Christ was-displayed crucified? 2This only do-I-want to-learn from you: did-you-receive the Spirit by works of-law or (the) hearing of-faith? 3Are-you so foolish, having-begun with-spirit, are-you┘now└trying-to-finish with flesh? 4Did-you-suffer so-many-things for-nothing—if indeed2 (it was) for-nothing? 5So then, the-one providing the Spirit to-you and working miracles among you—(does he do it) by works of-law or by (the) hearing of-faith? 6Even-as Abraham "believed [the] God, and it-was-regarded to-him for righteousness."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Know then that the-ones of faith—these are sons of Abraham. 8The scripture, foreseeing that [the] God would-justify the Gentiles by faith, preached-the-gospel-beforehand to-[the] Abraham [that], "All the nations will-be-blessed in you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So-that the-ones of faith are-blessed with [the] faithful Abraham. 10For as-many-as are of works of-law are under (a) curse, for it-has-been-written [that], "Accursed (is) everybody who does┘not└continue in all the-things written in the book of-the Law [the] to-do them." 11Now that by law nobody is-able to-be-justified before [the] God is evident, because, "The just-one shall-live by faith." 12Now [the] law is not of faith, but, "The-one having-done them will-have-life in them." 13Christ redeemed us from the curse of-the law, becoming (a) curse on-behalf-of us, because it-has-been-written, "Everybody [the-one] hanging on (a) tree (is) accursed," in-order-that in Christ Jesus the blessing of-[the] Abraham might-become to the Gentiles, 14in-order-that we-might-receive the promise of-the Spirit through [the] faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Brothers, I-am-speaking according-to man. Even-though, (it is a) ratified/enacted-covenant of-man, nobody annuls or adds-to-it. 16Now the promises were-spoken to-[the] Abraham and to-the seed of-him. It-does┘not└say "and to-[the] seeds," as in-reference-to many, but as in-reference-to one, "And to-the seed of-you," who is Christ. 17But I-say this: (a) covenant ratified/enacted-beforehand by [the] God, the law having-come-to-be after four-hundred and thirty years does┘not└annul unto the abolishing-of the promise. 18For if the inheritance (is) by law, (it is) no-longer by promise. But to-[the] Abraham [the] God has-granted (it) through promise. 19What then ((is) the Law? It was-added because-of [the] transgressions until2 the seed should-come to-whom it-was-promised, having-been-ordained by angels at (the) hand of-(a)-mediator. 20But the/a mediator is not of-one, but [the] God is one.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So (is) the Law against the promises of-[the] God? May-it┘not└be! For if (a) law had-been-given [the] able to-make-alive, truly [the] righteousness would-have been by law. 22But the scripture locked-up all┘[the]└things under sin, in-order-that the promise might-be-given to-[the] believing-ones by trust.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But before [the] trust [the] coming, we-were-being-held-in-custody by law, being-locked-up for the future faith to-be-revealed, 24with-the-result-that the Law has-become (a) tutor unto Christ, in-order-that we-might-be-justified by trust. 25But [the] trust having-come, we-are no-longer under (a) tutor. 26For you-are all sons of-God through [the] trust in Christ Jesus. 27For as-many┘of-you┘┘└as └└were-baptized into Christ, put-on Christ. 28There-is not Jew or Greek, there-is not slave or free, there-is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29If youpl (are) of-Christ, then you-are seedsg of-Abraham, heirs according-to promise.</span>
