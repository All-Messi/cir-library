## Romans Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I-tell (the) truth in Christ—I-do┘not└lie, the conscience of-me testifying-with (me) in the Holy Spirit 2that great grief is to-me and constant sorrow to-the heart of-me. 3For I┘myself └would-wish to-be accursed from [the] Christ on-behalf-of the brothers of-me, the kin/relatives of-me according-to (the) flesh, 4who are Israelites, whose (is) the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the giving-of-the-Law and the service and the promises, 5whose (are) the fathers and out-of whom the Messiah (has come) [the] according-to (the) flesh, the-One being over all, God blessed forever3. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But it (is) not such that the word of-[the] God has-become-ineffective. For not all the-ones from/out-of Israel—these (are) Israel. 7Neither because they-are seed/descendants of-Abraham (are they) all children, but, "In Isaac (the) seed to-you will-be-called"; 8that is, not the children of-the flesh—these (are) children of-[the] God but the children of-[the] promise are regarded as seed. 9For this (is) the word of-promise, "According-to [the] this time I-will-come and (a) son will-be to-[the] Sarah." 10And not only (that), but also Rebekah, having marital-relationship from one, Isaac, the father of-us. 11For not-yet having-been-born nor having-done anything good or bad, in-order-that by choice (the) purpose of-[the] God might-remain, 12not out-of deeds, but out-of the-One calling, it-was-said to her [that], "The greater/older will-serve the lesser/younger."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> As it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> What will-we-say then? (There is) not┘injustice with [the] God└is-there? May-it┘not└be! 15For he-says to-[the] Moses,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So then, (it is) not of-the-one willing/desiring nor of-the-one running, but of-the having-mercy God. 17For the scripture says to-[the] [Pharaoh [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So then whom he-wants-to he-has-mercy-on, and whom he-wants-to he-makes stubborn.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Will-you-say to-me then, "Why [then]ms does-he┘still└find-fault? For who has-resisted the will of-him?" 20O man, to-the-contrary, who are you the-one answering-back to-[the] God? The-thing formed will┘not┘┘└say to-the one-having-formed (it), └└will-it, "Why did-you make me this-way?" 21Or does┘not the potter of-the clay└have (a) right from the same lump to-make what (is a) vessel for-honor and what (is) for dishonor? 22And if [the] God, desiring to-demonstrate the wrath (of him) and 'to-make-known the power of-him,' with-much longsuffering put-up-with containers/vessels of-wrath fit for destruction, 23and (did so) in-order-that he-might-make-known the abundance of-the glory of-him on containers/vessels of-mercy that he-prepared-ahead-of-time for glory?—24us whom also he-called, not only from (the) Jews, but also from (the) Gentiles, 25as also he-says in [the] Hosea,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And it-will-be in the place where</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And Isaiah shouts-out on-behalf-of [the] Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And as Isaiah said-before,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> What will-we-say then? That Gentiles the-ones not pursuing righteousness received righteousness, even (the) righteousness (the one) of faith/trust; 31but Israel, pursuing (the/a) Law of-righteousness, did┘not└attain unto (that) Law. 32On-account-of what? Because (they did) not (pursue it) by faith/trust, but as by works. They-tripped/stumbled-over the stone of-[the] tripping/stumbling, 33as it-has-been-written,</span>
