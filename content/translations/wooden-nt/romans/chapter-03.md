## Romans Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What then (is) the advantage of-the Jew, or what (is) the benefit of-[the] circumcision? 2Much according-to every way. For, first-of-all, (that) they-were-entrusted-with the oracles of-[the] God. 3For what? If some disbelieved, the disbelief of-them will┘not┘┘└cancel-out the faithfulness of-[the] God, └└will it? 4May-it┘not└be! But let┘[the] God└be true, and every man (a) liar, as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now if the unrighteousness of-us highlights (the) righteousness of-God, what will-we-say? [The] God the-one inflicting [the] wrath (is) not┘unjust└is he? (I am talking according-to (a) man.) 6May-it┘not└be! Because how will┘[the] God└judge the world? 7But if the truth of-[the] God abounded to the glory of-him in [the] my lie, why am-I┘still also└judged as (a) sinner? 8And (why) not (say), even-as we-are-slandered and even-as some say we say [that], "Let-us-do [the] evil-things in-order-that [the] good-things may-come"?—the condemnation of-whom is just.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> What then? Are-we-ahead-of (them)? Not at-all, for we-already-said (that) both Jews and Greeks are all under sin, 10even-as it-has-been-written [that],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> All turned-away; together they-became-useless;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Now we-know that as-many-things-as the Law says, it-says to-those under the Law, in-order-that every mouth may-be-shut and all the world may-become answerable to-[the] God, 20because by works of-law all flesh will┘not└be-justified before him, for through law (is the) knowledge of-sin.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> But apart-from law (a) righteousness of-God has-been-manifested, testified-to by the Law and the prophets, 22even (the) righteousness of-God through trust/faith of-Jesus Christ to all the-ones trusting-believing. For (there) is not (a) distinction, 23for all sinned and fall-short of-the glory of-[the] God, 24being-justified freely by-the grace of-him through the redemption [the-one] in Christ Jesus, 25whom God put-forward (as a) propitiation/basis-for-forgiveness through [the]ms trust/faith in the blood of-him unto (the) demonstration of-the righteousness of-him on-account-of the overlooking of-the previously-committed sins 26during-the-time-of the forbearance of-[the] God to the demonstration of-the righteousness of-him at the present time, unto his [the] being just and justifying-one-for the-one of-trust/faith of-Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> So where (is) the basis-for-boasting? It-is-excluded. By what-kind-of law/principle? (By a law) of-works? No, but by (a) law/principle of-faith. 28For we-reckon (that a) person is-justified by-faith apart-from works of-law. 29Or (is) [the] God (the God) of-(the)-Jews only? (Is-he) not (the God) of-(the)-Gentiles too? Yes, (he is God) of-(the)-Gentiles too, 30if indeed [the] God (is) one who will-justify (the) circumcision by trust/faith and (the) uncircumcision through [the] faith. 31So are-we-nullifying law by [the] trust/faith? May-it┘not└be! But we-are-establishing law</span>
