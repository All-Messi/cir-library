## Romans Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So (there is) now no condemnation to-the-ones in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For the law of-the spirit of-[the] life in Christ Jesus freed you<sup>sg</sup>/me<sup>ms</sup> from the law of-[the] sin and [the] death. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For the impossible-thing of-the Law in which it-was-weak through the flesh, [the] God, having-sent the Son of-himself in (the) likeness of-(the)-flesh of-sin and concerning sin, condemned [the] sin in the flesh, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>in-order-that the righteousness of-the Law might-be-fulfilled in us the-ones walking not according-to (the) flesh, but according-to (the) spirit. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For the-ones being according-to the flesh set-(their)-minds-on the-things of-the-flesh, but the-ones (being) according-to (the) spirit (set their minds on) the-things of-the spirit. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For the mind of-the flesh (is) dead, but the mind of-the spirit (is) life and peace. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Wherefore the mind of-the flesh (is) hostility toward God, for to-the Law of-[the] God it-does┘not└submit, for neither is-it-able (to submit). <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the-ones being in (the) flesh are┘not└able to-please God. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But you<sup>pl</sup> are not in (the) flesh, but in (the) spirit, if (the) Spirit of-God dwells in you. But if somebody does┘not└have (the) spirit of-Christ, this-one is not of-him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But if Christ (is) in you, the body (is) dead on-account-of sin, but the spirit (is) life on-account-of righteousness. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But if the Spirit of-the-One having-resurrected Jesus from (the) dead dwells in you<sup>pl</sup>, the-One having-resurrected Christ from (the) dead will┘also└give-life-to the mortal bodies of-you through the Spirit of-him dwelling in you<sup>pl</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So then, brothers, we-are debtors, not to-the flesh in-order-to live according-to (the) flesh, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>for if you-live according-to (the) flesh, you-will die; but if you-put-to-death by-(the)-spirit the practices of the body, you-will-live. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For as-many-as are-led by-(the)-Spirit of-God, these are sons of-God. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For you-did┘not└receive (a) spirit of-bondage again unto fear, but you-received (a) spirit of-sonship in which we-cry-out, “Abba, [the] Father.” <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>The Spirit himself testifies-with the spirit of-us that we-are children of-God. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And if children, then heirs, heirs of-God, and fellow-heirs-withChrist, if we-suffer-with (him) in-order-that we-may┘also└be-glorified-with (him).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For I-reason that the sufferings of-the present time (are) not worthy (of comparison) to the future glory to-be-revealed to us. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For the deep-desire of-the creation eagerly-awaits the revelation of-the sons of-[the] God. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For the creation was-subjected to-[the] futility, not willingly, but on-account-of the-One having-subjected (it) in hope <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>that also this [the] creation will-be-freed from the bondage of-[the] corruption to the freedom of-the glory of-the children of-[the] God. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>For we-know that all the creation groans-together and suffers-the-pains-of-childbirth until [the] now. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And not only (that), but also we ourselves having the first-fruits of-the Spirit—we also ourselves groan in ourselves eagerly-awaiting adoption-as-sons, the redemption of-the body of-us. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>For we-were-saved by [the] hope; but hope, being-seen, is not hope, for what (a) person sees–what does-he-hope-for? <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But if what we-do┘not└see we hope for, we-eagerly-await (it) through perseverance.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But likewise also the Spirit helps the weakness of-us. For [the] what we-should-pray as it-is-necessary we-do┘not└know, but the Spirit himself intercedes-on-behalf (of us) with-unspeakable-sighs. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>But the-One examining [the] hearts knows what the mentality of-the spirit (is), because he-intercedes on-behalf-of (the) saints according-to (the will of) God. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And we-know that for-the-ones loving [the] God, all-things work-together for good, to-the-ones being called according-to (his) purpose; <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>because whom he-foreknew he┘also└predestined (to be) conformed-to the image of-the Son of-him, unto [the] his being (the) firstborn among many brothers. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And whom he-predestined—these he┘also└called, and whom he-called—these he┘also└justified—these he┘also└glorified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>What then will-we-say to these-things? If [the] God (is) for us, who (will be) against us? <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Who did┘not└spare [the] his-own Son, but offered┘him└up for us all—how will-he┘not also with him└graciously-give us [the] all-things? <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Who will-bring-charges against (the) chosen-ones of-God? God (is) the justifier; <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>who (is) the condemner? Christ [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> (is) the-One having-died, but rather was-resurrected, who is also on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God, who also intercedes for us. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>What will-separate us from the love of-[the] Christ? Trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Even-as it-has-been-written [that], <strong>“For-(the)-sake of-you we-are-killed the whole day (long</strong><strong>);</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>e-we</strong><strong>re-regarded as sheep of-slaughter.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> But in all these-things we-more-than-conquer through the-One having-loved us. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>For I-have-been-persuaded that neither death or life neither angels or rulers neither present things or future-things or death nor powers <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>neither-height or depth nor any other creation will-be-able to-separate us from the love of-[the] God [the] in Christ Jesus the Lord of us.</span>
