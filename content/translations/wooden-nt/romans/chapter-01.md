## Romans Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Paul, bond-servant of-Christ Jesus, called (to be an) apostle, set-apart to (the) gospel of-God, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>which he-promised-beforehand through the prophets of-him in (the) holy scriptures <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>about the Son of-him, the-one having-arisen from (the) seed of-David according-to (the) flesh, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>the-one designated (the) Son of-God with power according-to (the) Spirit of-holiness out-of (the) resurrection of-(the)-dead, Jesus Christ the Lord of-us, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>through whom we-received grace and apostleship unto (the) obedience of-faith among all the Gentiles on-behalf-of the name of-him, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>among whom you also (are) called-ones of-Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>to-all the beloved-ones of-God being in Rome, called (to be) holy. Grace (be) to-you and peace from God (the) Father of-us and (the) Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>First, I-thank the God of-me through Jesus Christ about all of-you, because the faith of-you is-being-proclaimed in the whole world. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For [the] God is (the) witness of-me, whom I-serve in the Spirit/spirit of-me in the gospel of-the Son of-him as I┘constantly└make remembrance of-you <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>always in the prayers of-me, asking somehow<sup>2</sup> now at-last it-will-be-possible-for (me) in the will of-[the] God to-come to you. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For I-long to-see you in-order-that I-may-share┘some spiritual gift└with you unto [the] your being-established, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>now, that is, (unto) being-encouraged-with [in] you by the among one-another faith of┘both└you and me. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And I-do┘not└want you to-be-ignorant, brothers, that many-times I-purposed to-come to you, and I-was-prevented until the here in-order-that I-might-have some fruit also among you as also in the remaining Gentiles. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I-am (a) debtor both to-Gentiles and barbarians, both to-wise and foolish, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>thus-as-respects-the willingness according-to me to-preach also to you [the-ones] in Rome.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For I-am┘not└ashamed-of the gospel, for it-is (the) power of-God unto salvation to-everybody [the-one] believing, both to-(the) Jew first and to-(the)-Gentile. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For by it (the) righteousness of-God is-being-revealed from faith to faith, as it-has-been-written, <strong>“Now the just-one is-to-live by faith.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For (the) wrath of-God is-being-revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of-men the-ones suppressing the truth with unrighteousness, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>because [the] known-thing of-[the] God is manifest in them, for [the] God manifested (it) to-them. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For the invisible-things of-him from (the) creation of-(the)-world are-seen-clearly by-the-things made, even<sup>2</sup> (the) eternal power and godness of-him, unto [the] their being without-excuse; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>because, having-known [the] God they-did┘not└glorify (him) as God or were-thankful, but were-given-over-to-empty-speculation in the reasonings of-them and their senseless heart of-them was-darkened. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Claiming to-be wise, they-became fools, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and exchanged the glory of-the incorruptible God into (the) likeness of-(the)-image of-corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Wherefore [the] God gave┘them└up in the lusts of-[the] hearts of-them to uncleanness to-[the] dishonoring-of the bodies of-them among themselves, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>who exchanged the truth of-[the] God for the/a lie and worshiped and served the creation rather-than the-one having-created—who is blessed forever. Amen. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>On-account-of this [the] God gave┘them└up to passions of-dishonor, for even the females of-them exchanged the natural function for the-one contrary-to nature, <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>and likewise also the males, leaving the natural function of-the female burned in the elicit-desire of-them toward one-another, males with males committing [the] shamefulness, and receiving-back in themselves the repayment that was-necessary for-the error of-them. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>And even-as they-dids┘not└see-fit to have [the] God in (their) knowledge, [the] God gave┘them└up to depravity of-mind, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>being-filled with-all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, malice, full-of jealousy, murder, strife, deception, meanness; (they are) gossips, <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>slanderers, God-haters, arrogant people, boasters, disloyal, schemers of-evil-(things), disobedient to-parents, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>who, knowing the requirement of-[the] God, that the-ones practicing [the] such-things are worthy of-death, not only do them but also delight-in the-ones doing (them).</span>
