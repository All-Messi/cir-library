## Romans Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Brothers, the desire of-[the] my heart and the prayer to [the] God (is) for them for salvation. 2For I-testify in-regard-to-them that they-have (a) zeal of-God, but not according-to knowledge. 3For not-knowing the righteousness of-[the] God and seeking to-establish [the] their-own [righteousness]ms, they-did┘not└submit themselves to-the righteousness of-[the] God. 4For Christ (is the) end of-(the)-Law unto righteousness to-everybody the-one believing/trusting.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> For Moses writes in-regard-to the righteousness [the] from [the]ms Law [that], "The man having-done them will-have-life by them." 6But the righteousness from faith/trust speaks this-way,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Or, 'Who will-descend into the abyss'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But what does-it-say? that is, the word of-[the] faith/trust that we-preach. 9Because if you-confess with the mouth of-you (that) Jesus (is) Lord and trust/believe in the heart of-you that [the] God raised┘him└up from (the) dead, you-will-be-saved. 10For with-(the)-heart (a person) trusts for righteousness, and with-(the)-mouth he-confesses unto/for salvation. 11For the scripture says, "Everyone [the[ trusting/believing in him will┘not└be-disappointed/put-to-shame." 12For (there) is not (a) distinction of┘both└Jew and Greek, for the same Lord (is Lord) of-all, being-wealthy toward all the-ones calling-on him. 13For "everybody2 that calls-on the name of-(the)-Lord will-be-saved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> How then will-they-call on whom they-did┘not└trust/believe? And how will-they-trust/believe whom they-did┘not└hear? And how till-they-hear without (a) preaching-one? 15And how will-they-preach if they-are┘not└sent? Even-as it-is-written, "How welcome/attractive (are) the feet of-the-ones announcing [the] good-news/things." 16But not all obeyed the good-news, for Isaiah says, "Lord, who listened-to/believed the report of-us?" 17Then [the] 'trust/faith' (comes) from 'hearing,' and [the] listening/hearing (comes) through/by (the) word of-Christ. 18But I-say, they-did┘not┘┘ not└hear, └└did-they? On-the-contrary,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> But I-say, did not┘ not┘┘ └know, └└did-they? First Moses says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And Isaiah is-bold and says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> And to [the] Israel he-says, "All the day-long I-stretched-out the hands of-me to (a) disobeying and contradicting people."</span>
