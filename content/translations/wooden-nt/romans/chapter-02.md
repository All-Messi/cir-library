## Romans Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wherefore you-are without-excuse, O man everybody the-one judging. For by whom you-judge the other person, you-condemn yourself, for you┘the-one judging└practice the same things. 2Now we-know that the judgment of-[the] God is according-to truth against the-ones doing [the] such-things. 3Now do-you-suppose this, O man the-one judging the-ones practicing [the] such-things and doing them, that you will-escape the judgment of-[the] God? 4Or do-you-disregard the wealth of-the kindness of-him and [the] forbearance and [the] patience, not-knowing that the kindness of-[the] God is-leading you to-repentance? 5But on-account-of the stubbornness and unrepentant heart of-you, you-are-storing-up for-yourself wrath in the day of-wrath and (the) revelation of-[the] righteous-judgment of-[the] God, 6who will-pay-back to-each according-to the works of-him—7to-the-ones seeking according-to (the) perseverance of-good work, glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; 8but to-the-ones of selfish-ambition and disobeying the truth, but following-after [the] injustice, wrath and anger. 9(There will be) trouble and distress on every soul of-man the-one working [the] evil, both of-(the) Jew first and also of-(the) Greek, 10but glory and honor and peace to-every-one [the] working [the] good, both Jew first and Greek. 11For respect-of-person is not with [the] God. 12For as-many-as sinned without-(the)-Law, will┘also└perish with-(the)-Law; and as-many-as sinned under (the) Law, will-be-condemned by (the) Law. 13For not the hearers of-(the)-Law are righteous with [the] God, but the doers of-(the)-Law will-be-made-righteous. 14For when Gentiles the-ones not having the Law do by nature the-things of-the law, these, not having he Law, are (a) law for-themselves, 15who show the work of-the Law written on the hearts of-them, (the) conscience of-them testifying-with (them) and (the/their) [the] thoughts accusing or else defending between one-another 16in the day when [the] God judges by Christ Jesus the hidden-things of-[the] men according-to the gospel of-me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But if you are-named (a) Jew and rely-on (the) Law, and take-pride in God, 18and know the/his will, and approve the superior-things, being-instructed by the Law, 19and are-confident yourself to-be (a) guide of-(the)-blind, (a) light of-those in darkness, 20(a) corrector of-(the)-foolish, (a) teacher of-babies, having the form of-[the] knowledge and [the] truth (that is) in the Law—21then do-you┘, the-one teaching another, not└teach yourself? Do-you, the-one preaching not to steal, steal? 22Do-you┘ the-one saying (a person) not to-commit-adultery, └commit adultery? Do-you┘ the-one detesting-idols, └rob [the] temples? 23Do-you who take-pride in (the) Law, dishonor [the] God by the transgression of-the Law? 24For "the name of-[the] God is-blasphemed among the Gentiles on-account-of you," even-as it-has-been-written. 25For, on-the-one-hand, circumcision is-beneficial if you practice (the) Law. On-the-other-hand, if you are (a) transgressor of-(the)-Law, the circumcision of-you has-become uncircumcision. 26If then uncircumcision keeps the righteous requirements of-the Law, will┘the uncircumcision of-him not└be-considered [for] circumcision? 27And the by nature uncircumcision, carrying-out the Law, will-condemn you—the by letter and circumcision transgressor of-(the)-Law. 28For not the in [the] apparent (part) Jew is (one), nor the in the apparent in (the) flesh circumcision, 29but the-one in the hidden-(part) is (a) Jew, and (a) circumcision of-(the)-heart, in spirit not letter, the praise of-whom (is) not from men but from [the] God.</span>
