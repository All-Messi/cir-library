## Romans Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Now accept the-one weak in-the faith, not unto passing-judgments of-reasons. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>One has-faith/believes to-eat all-things, but the weak-one eats vegetables. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Let┘the-one eating not└look-down-on the-one not eating, and let┘the-one not eating not└criticize the-one eating, for [the] God accepted him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Who are you the-one criticizing another’s servant? To his-own Lord he-stands or falls. And he-will-stand, for the Lord is-able to-make┘him└stand. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For one regards day above day, and another regards every day. Let┘each└be-fully-convinced in [the] his-own mind. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The-one regarding the day observes (it) to-(the)-Lord. And the-one eating eats to-(the)-Lord, for he-thanks [the] God; and the-one not eating does not eat to-(the)-Lord and thanks [the] God. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For nobody of-us lives to-himself, and nobody dies to-himself. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For if we-live, we-live to-the Lord; and if we-die, we-die to-the Lord. So both if we-live and if we-die, we-are of-the Lord. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For to this Christ died and lived, in-order-that he-might-be-Lord of (the) dead and (the) living. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And why do┘ you<sup>sg</sup> └criticize the brother of-you? Or also why do┘you└look-down-on the brother of-you? For we┘all└will-stand before the judgment-seat of-[the] God, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>for it-has-been-written, <strong>“(As) I live, says (the) Lord</strong><strong> [that]</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>very knee </strong><strong>will-bend</strong><strong> to-me,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd every tongue will-confess to-[the] God.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So [then]<sup>ms</sup> each of-us will-give account [to-[the] God] concerning himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So let-us┘not└criticize one-another anymore; but determine this instead: [the] not to-put (an) obstacle or stumbling-block for-the brother. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I-know and have-been-persuaded in (the) Lord Jesus that no-thing (is) common of itself—except<sup>2</sup> to-the-one regarding something to-be common (it is) common. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>For if the brother of-you is-made-sorrowful/grieved/made-uncomfortable on-account-of food, do┘not└destroy with-[the] food that-one for whom Christ died. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So do┘not└let the good of-you be-slandered. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For the kingdom of-[the] God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in (the) Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For the-one in this (way) serving [the] Christ (is) acceptable to-[the] God and approved to-[the] people. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>So then let-us-pursue the-things of-[the] peace and the-things of-[the] edification [the] for one-another. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Do┘not└tear-down for-the-sake-of food the work of-[the] God. All-things (are) pure, but (they are) bad for-the person [the one] eating with offence. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>[The] not to-eat meat (is) good, or to-drink wine or in what the brother of-you<sup>sg</sup> stumbles. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>(The) faith that you-have, have according-to yourself before [the] God. Blessed (is) the-one not judging himself in what he-approves. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But the-one doubting, if he-eats, has-been-condemned/condemned-himself, because (it is) not out-of faith. And everything that (is) not out-of faith is sin.</span>
