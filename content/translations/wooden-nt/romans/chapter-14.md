## Romans Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now accept the-one weak in-the faith, not unto passing-judgments of-reasons. 2One has-faith/believes to-eat all-things, but the weak-one eats vegetables. 3Let┘the-one eating not└look-down-on the-one not eating, and let┘the-one not eating not└criticize the-one eating, for [the] God accepted him. 4Who are you the-one criticizing another's servant? To his-own Lord he-stands or falls. And he-will-stand, for the Lord is-able to-make┘him└stand. 5For one regards day above day, and another regards every day. Let┘each└be-fully-convinced in [the] his-own mind. 6The-one regarding the day observes (it) to-(the)-Lord. And the-one eating eats to-(the)-Lord, for he-thanks [the] God; and the-one not eating does not eat to-(the)-Lord and thanks [the] God. 7For nobody of-us lives to-himself, and nobody dies to-himself. 8For if we-live, we-live to-the Lord; and if we-die, we-die to-the Lord. So both if we-live and if we-die, we-are of-the Lord. 9For to this Christ died and lived, in-order-that he-might-be-Lord of (the) dead and (the) living. 10And why do┘ yousg └criticize the brother of-you? Or also why do┘you└look-down-on the brother of-you? For we┘all└will-stand before the judgment-seat of-[the] God, 11for it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So [then]ms each of-us will-give account [to-[the] God] concerning himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So let-us┘not└criticize one-another anymore; but determine this instead: [the] not to-put (an) obstacle or stumbling-block for-the brother. 14I-know and have-been-persuaded in (the) Lord Jesus that no-thing (is) common of itself—except2 to-the-one regarding something to-be common (it is) common. 15For if the brother of-you is-made-sorrowful/grieved/made-uncomfortable on-account-of food, do┘not└destroy with-[the] food that-one for whom Christ died. 16So do┘not└let the good of-you be-slandered. 17For the kingdom of-[the] God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in (the) Holy Spirit. 18For the-one in this (way) serving [the] Christ (is) acceptable to-[the] God and approved to-[the] people. 19So then let-us-pursue the-things of-[the] peace and the-things of-[the] edification [the] for one-another. 20Do┘not└tear-down for-the-sake-of food the work of-[the] God. All-things (are) pure, but (they are) bad for-the person [the one] eating with offence. 21[The] not to-eat meat (is) good, or to-drink wine or in what the brother of-yousg stumbles. 22(The) faith that you-have, have according-to yourself before [the] God. Blessed (is) the-one not judging himself in what he-approves. 23But the-one doubting, if he-eats, has-been-condemned/condemned-himself, because (it is) not out-of faith. And everything that (is) not out-of faith is sin.</span>
