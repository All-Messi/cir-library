## Romans Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I-say, then, [the] God did┘not┘┘└set-aside the people of-him, └└did-he? May-it┘not└be! For I also am (an) Israelite, from (the) seed of-Abraham, of-(the)-tribe of-Benjamin. 2[The] God did┘not└set-aside the people of-him that he-foreknew/set-his-regard-upon-ahead-of-time. Or do-you┘not└know in (a text about) Elijah what the scripture says when he-pleads-with [the] God against Israel?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But what says the divine-oracle to-him?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So thus also in the present time, (a) remnant has-come-to-be according-to choice of-grace. 6And if (it is) by-grace, (it is) no-longer from works; otherwise [the] grace becomes no-longer grace. 7What then? What Israel is-looking-for—this it-did┘not└obtain, but [the] chosen/elect obtained (it). And the rest 'were-made stubborn.' 8Even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And David says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Let┘the eyes of-them└be-darkened for-[the] not seeing,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So I-say, they-did┘not┘┘└stumble in-order-to fall, └└did-they? May-it┘not└be! But by the transgression of-them [the] salvation of-them (came) to-the Gentiles unto [the] making┘them└jealous. 12But if the transgression of-them (is the) wealth of-(the)-world and the failure of-them (is the) wealth of-(the)-Gentiles, more by-much (will be) the fullness of-them!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now I-am-speaking to-you [the] Gentiles. Since2 then I am (an) apostle of-Gentiles, I-glorify the ministry of-me, 14if somehow I-may-make-jealous the flesh/fellow-countrymen of-me, and I-may-save some of them. 15For if the rejection of-them (is the) reconciliation of-(the)-world, what (will) the acceptance (of them be) except2 life from (the) dead? 16And if the first-part (of the dough is) holy, the lump-of-dough (is) also (holy). And if the root (is) holy, the branches (are) also (holy).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But if some of-the branches were-cut-out and you, being (a) wild-olive-tree, were-grafted-in among them and became (a) partaker of-the root of-the richness of-the olive-tree, do┘not└be-proud-against the branches. 18And if you-are-proud, (remember that) you do┘not└support the root, but the root (supports) you. 19You-will-say then, "Branches were-removed in-order-that I might-be-grafted-in." 20Well, they-were-removed by-[the] disbelief/distrust, and you have-stood by-[the] trust/faith. Do┘not└think high-things, but fear. 21For if [the] God did┘not└spare the according-to nature branches, he-will┘not somehow└spare you either, [will-he]ms? 22So behold (the) kindness and severity of-God—on the-ones having-fallen, severity, but on you (the) kindness of-God—if you-remain-in his/the kindness. Otherwise you-will-be-cut-off too. 23And those-also if they-do┘not└remain-in [the] distrust/disbelief, they-will-be-grafted-in. For [the] God is able to-graft┘them└in again. 24For if you were-removed from the/a by nature will-olive-tree and were-grafted contrary-to nature into (a) cultivated-olive-tree, more by-much these [the] will-be-grafted-in [the] their-own olive-tree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> For I-do┘not└want you to-be-ignorant, brothers, with-respect-to this [the] mystery, in-order-that you-be┘not└wise in yourselves that hardening has-come in part to-[the] Israel until2 the fullness/full-number of-[the] Gentiles comes-in. 26And in-this-manner all Israel will-be-saved even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> As-respects the gospel (they are) enemies for-the-sake-of you, but as-respects [the] election/choice (they are) beloved for-the-sake-of the fathers, 29for the gifts and the calling of-[the] God (are) irrevocable. 30For as you once disobeyed [to-the] God, but now received-mercy because-of-the disobedience of-these, 31so also these now disobeyed because-of-[the] your mercy, in-order-that they also [now]ms may-receive-mercy. 32For [the] God locked-up [the] all in disobedience in-order-that he-might-have-mercy-on all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> O (the) depth of-wealth and wisdom and knowledge of-God! How unsearchable (are) the judgments of-him, and the ways of-him incomprehensible!</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Or who first-gave to-him, 36because from him and through him and for him (are) all-things. [The] glory (be) to-him forever3! Amen.</span>
