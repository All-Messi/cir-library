## Romans Chapter **15**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And we the-ones strong ought to-bear-with the weaknesses of-the-ones not-strong, and not to-please ourselves. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Let┘each of-us└try-to-please the/our neighbor unto the good-thing for edification. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For [the] Christ also did┘not└please himself, but even-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“The insults of-the-ones insulting you fell on me.”</strong> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For as-many-things-as were-written-beforehand were-written for [the] our instruction, in-order-that through [the] patience and through the encouragement of-the scriptures we-might-have hope. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And may┘the God of-[the] patience and [the] encouragement└give you [the] to-be-of-(the) ┘same└mind with one-another according-to Christ Jesus, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>in-order-that together with one mouth you-may-glorify the God and Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Wherefore accept one-another, even-as also [the] Christ accepted you to (the) glory of-[the] God. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For I-say (that) Christ has-become (a) minister of-(the)-circumcision on-behalf-of (the) truth of-God, unto [the] confirming of-the promises of-the fathers, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and for-the Gentiles to-glorify [the] God for mercy, even-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“On-account-of this I-</strong><strong>will</strong><strong>-confess you among </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> Gentiles,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd I-will-sing-praise to-the name of-you.”</strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And again (it says), <strong>“Gentiles, rejoice with the people of-him.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And again, <strong>“All [the] nations, praise the Lord,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd </strong><strong>let┘all</strong><strong> the </strong><strong>peoples└praise</strong><strong> him.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And again Isaiah says, <strong>“The</strong><strong>/a</strong><strong> root of-[the] Jesse will-be,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd the-one </strong><strong>ari</strong><strong>sing to-rule (the) Gentiles.</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	Gentiles will-hop</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> in him.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Now may┘the God of-[the] hope└fill you with-all joy and peace in the/your believing, unto [the] your abounding in [the] hope by (the) power of-(the)-Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And, my brothers, I myself also have-been-persuaded about you that you yourselves are full of-goodness, having-been-filled with-all [the] knowledge, and able to-admonish one-another. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But I-wrote very-boldly to-you from part as reminding you because of the grace [the] given to-me by [the] God <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>unto [the] my being (a) minister of-Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering-as-(a)-priest the gospel of-[the] God, in-order-that the offering of-the Gentiles might-become acceptable, having-been-sanctified by (the) Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So I-have [the] boasting in Christ Jesus with-respect-to-the-things toward [the] God. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For I-will┘not└take-it-on-myself to-say anything of-what Christ did┘not└accomplish through me unto (the) obedience of-(the)-Gentiles by-word and by-deed, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>with (the) power of-signs and wonders, with (the) power of-(the)-Spirit [of-God]<sup>ms</sup>, so that from Jerusalem and around to [the] Illyricum I have-fulfilled the gospel of-[the] Christ; <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>and in-this-way endeavoring to-preach not where Christ was-named, in-order-that I-might┘not└be-building on another’s foundation, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>but even-as it-has-been-written, <strong>“To-whom </strong><strong>it-was┘not└announced</strong><strong> about him they-will-see,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	and who </strong><strong>have┘not└heard</strong><strong> will-understand.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Wherefore also [the] many-times I-was-hindered [the] to-come to you. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>But now no-longer having (a) place in [the] these regions, but having (a) desire [the] to-come to you from many years, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>whenever<sup>2</sup> I-go to [the] Spain—for I-hope, passing-through, to-see you and to-be-sent-forward by you there if by you first I-am-filled from (a) part. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>But now I-am-going to-Jerusalem, serving the saints. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>For Macedonia and Achaia were-pleased to-make (a) certain contribution to the poor of-the saints [the] in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>For they-were-pleased and are debtors of-them. For if the Gentiles shared [the] spiritual-things of-them, they┘also└ought to-minister to-them with [the] physical-things. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>So having-finished this and having-sealed for-them [the] this fruit, I-will-go-away through you into Spain. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>And I-know that, coming to you, I-will-come in (the) fullness of-(the)-blessing of-Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Now I-urge you, [brothers]<sup>ms</sup>, by the Lord of-us Jesus Christ and by the love of-the Spirit to-strive-with me in [the] prayers for me to [the] God, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>in-order-that I-may-be-delivered from the-ones disobeying in [the] Judaea and (that) the ministry of-me [the] in Jerusalem may-be acceptable to-the saints, <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>in-order-that with joy, having-come to you by (the) will of-God I-may-have-a-time-of-rest-with you. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Now the God of-[the] peace (be) with all of-you. Amen.</span>
