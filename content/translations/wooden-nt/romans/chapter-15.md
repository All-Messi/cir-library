## Romans Chapter 15

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And we the-ones strong ought to-bear-with the weaknesses of-the-ones not-strong, and not to-please ourselves. 2Let┘each of-us└try-to-please the/our neighbor unto the good-thing for edification. 3For [the] Christ also did┘not└please himself, but even-as it-has-been-written, "The insults of-the-ones insulting you fell on me." 4For as-many-things-as were-written-beforehand were-written for [the] our instruction, in-order-that through [the] patience and through the encouragement of-the scriptures we-might-have hope. 5And may┘the God of-[the] patience and [the] encouragement└give you [the] to-be-of-(the) ┘same└mind with one-another according-to Christ Jesus, 6in-order-that together with one mouth you-may-glorify the God and Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Wherefore accept one-another, even-as also [the] Christ accepted you to (the) glory of-[the] God. 8For I-say (that) Christ has-become (a) minister of-(the)-circumcision on-behalf-of (the) truth of-God, unto [the] confirming of-the promises of-the fathers, 9and for-the Gentiles to-glorify [the] God for mercy, even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And again (it says),</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And again,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And again Isaiah says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Now may┘the God of-[the] hope└fill you with-all joy and peace in the/your believing, unto [the] your abounding in [the] hope by (the) power of-(the)-Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And, my brothers, I myself also have-been-persuaded about you that you yourselves are full of-goodness, having-been-filled with-all [the] knowledge, and able to-admonish one-another. 15But I-wrote very-boldly to-you from part as reminding you because of the grace [the] given to-me by [the] God 16unto [the] my being (a) minister of-Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering-as-(a)-priest the gospel of-[the] God, in-order-that the offering of-the Gentiles might-become acceptable, having-been-sanctified by (the) Holy Spirit. 17So I-have [the] boasting in Christ Jesus with-respect-to-the-things toward [the] God. 18For I-will┘not└take-it-on-myself to-say anything of-what Christ did┘not└accomplish through me unto (the) obedience of-(the)-Gentiles by-word and by-deed, 19with (the) power of-signs and wonders, with (the) power of-(the)-Spirit [of-God]ms, so that from Jerusalem and around to [the] Illyricum I have-fulfilled the gospel of-[the] Christ; 20and in-this-way endeavoring to-preach not where Christ was-named, in-order-that I-might┘not└be-building on another's foundation, 21but even-as it-has-been-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Wherefore also [the] many-times I-was-hindered [the] to-come to you. 23But now no-longer having (a) place in [the] these regions, but having (a) desire [the] to-come to you from many years, 24whenever2 I-go to [the] Spain—for I-hope, passing-through, to-see you and to-be-sent-forward by you there if by you first I-am-filled from (a) part. 25But now I-am-going to-Jerusalem, serving the saints. 26For Macedonia and Achaia were-pleased to-make (a) certain contribution to the poor of-the saints [the] in Jerusalem. 27For they-were-pleased and are debtors of-them. For if the Gentiles shared [the] spiritual-things of-them, they┘also└ought to-minister to-them with [the] physical-things. 28So having-finished this and having-sealed for-them [the] this fruit, I-will-go-away through you into Spain. 29And I-know that, coming to you, I-will-come in (the) fullness of-(the)-blessing of-Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Now I-urge you, [brothers]ms, by the Lord of-us Jesus Christ and by the love of-the Spirit to-strive-with me in [the] prayers for me to [the] God, 31in-order-that I-may-be-delivered from the-ones disobeying in [the] Judaea and (that) the ministry of-me [the] in Jerusalem may-be acceptable to-the saints, 32in-order-that with joy, having-come to you by (the) will of-God I-may-have-a-time-of-rest-with you. 33Now the God of-[the] peace (be) with all of-you. Amen.</span>
