## Romans Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What will-we-say then? Let-us-remain-in [the] sin in-order-that [the] grace may increase? 2May-it┘not└be! Whoever-of us died to-[the] sin—how will-we┘still└live in it? 3Or do you┘not└know that as-many┘of-us┘┘└as └└were-baptized into Christ Jesus were-baptized into the death of-him? 4So we-were-buried-with him by [the] baptism into [the] death in-order-that as Christ was-raised from (the) dead by the glory of-the Father, so also we might-walk in the newness of-life. 5For if we-have-become united-with the likeness of-the death of-him, certainly we-will-be also (in the likeness) of-the resurrection (of him); 6knowing this: that the old man/self of-us was-crucified-with (him), in-order-that the body of-[the] sin might-be-destroyed, [the] our no-longer serving [the] sin. 7For the-one having-died has-been-justified from [the] sin. 8And if we-died with Christ, we-believe/trust that we will┘also└live-with him, 9knowing that Christ, having-been-raised from (the) dead does┘not└die anymore—death no-longer is-lord-of him. 10For what he-died, he-died to-[the] sin once; and what he-lives, he-lives to-[the] God. 11So also we consider ourselves [to be]ms dead with-respect-to [the] sin, but living to-[the] God in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So let┘not [the] sin└rule in the mortal body of-youpl unto [the] obeying the lusts of-it, 13neither keep-offering the members of-youpl to-[the] sin (as) tools/instrument of-unrighteousness, but start-offering yourselves to-[the] God as living from (the) dead, and (offering) to-[the] God the members of-you (as) tools of-righteousness. 14For sin will┘not└be-lord of-you, for you-are not under law, but under grace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> What then? Will-we-keep-sinning because we-are not under law but under grace? May-it┘not└be! 16Do-you┘not└know that to-what you-offer yourselves (as) slaves unto obedience, you-are slaves to-what you-obey, either (as slaves) of-sin unto death or (as slaves) of obedience unto righteousness? 17But thanks (be) to-[the] God that you-were slaves of-[the] sin, but you-obeyed from (the) heart [unto] what form of-teaching you-were-delivered. 18And having-been-freed from [the] sin, you-were-enslaved to-[the] righteousness. 19I-am-speaking in-everyday-illustrations/humanly on-account-of the weakness of-the flesh of-you, for as you-offered the members of-you (as) slaves to-[the] uncleanness and [the] lawlessness for [the] lawlessness, so now offer the members of-you (as) slaves to-[the] righteousness unto sanctification. 20For when you-were slaves of-[the] sin, you-were free with-respect-to-[the] righteousness. 21So what fruitsg were-you-having then? What-things now you-are-ashamed-of, for the end of-that (is/was) death. 22But now having-been-freed from [the] sin and having-been-enslaved to-[the] God, you-have the fruit of-you unto sanctification, but/and in-the-end/finally2 eternal life. 23For the wages of-[the] sin (is) death, but the gracious-gift of-[the] God (is) life in Christ Jesus the Lord of-us.</span>
