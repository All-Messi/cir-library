## Romans Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>What will-we-say then? Let-us-remain-in [the] sin in-order-that [the] grace may increase? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>May-it┘not└be! Whoever-of us died to-[the] sin—how will-we┘still└live in it? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Or do you┘not└know that as-many┘of-us<sup>┘┘</sup>└as <sup>└└</sup>were-baptized into Christ Jesus were-baptized into the death of-him? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So we-were-buried-with him by [the] baptism into [the] death in-order-that as Christ was-raised from (the) dead by the glory of-the Father, so also we might-walk in the newness of-life. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For if we-have-become united-with the likeness of-the death of-him, certainly we-will-be also (in the likeness) of-the resurrection (of him); <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>knowing this: that the old man/self of-us was-crucified-with (him), in-order-that the body of-[the] sin might-be-destroyed, [the] our no-longer serving [the] sin. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For the-one having-died has-been-justified from [the] sin. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And if we-died with Christ, we-believe/trust that we will┘also└live-with him, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>knowing that Christ, having-been-raised from (the) dead does┘not└die anymore—death no-longer is-lord-of him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For what he-died, he-died to-[the] sin once; and what he-lives, he-lives to-[the] God. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So also we consider ourselves [to be]<sup>ms</sup> dead with-respect-to [the] sin, but living to-[the] God in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So let┘not [the] sin└rule in the mortal body of-you<sup>pl </sup>unto [the] obeying the lusts of-it, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>neither keep-offering the members of-you<sup>pl </sup>to-[the] sin (as) tools/instrument of-unrighteousness, but start-offering yourselves to-[the] God as living from (the) dead, and (offering) to-[the] God the members of-you (as) tools of-righteousness. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>For sin will┘not└be-lord of-you, for you-are not under law, but under grace.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>What then? Will-we-keep-sinning because we-are not under law but under grace? May-it┘not└be! <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Do-you┘not└know that to-what you-offer yourselves (as) slaves unto obedience, you-are slaves to-what you-obey, either (as slaves) of-sin unto death or (as slaves) of obedience unto righteousness? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But thanks (be) to-[the] God that you-were slaves of-[the] sin, but you-obeyed from (the) heart [unto] what form of-teaching you-were-delivered. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>And having-been-freed from [the] sin, you-were-enslaved to-[the] righteousness. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I-am-speaking in-everyday-illustrations/humanly on-account-of the weakness of-the flesh of-you, for as you-offered the members of-you (as) slaves to-[the] uncleanness and [the] lawlessness for [the] lawlessness, so now offer the members of-you (as) slaves to-[the] righteousness unto sanctification. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For when you-were slaves of-[the] sin, you-were free with-respect-to-[the] righteousness. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So what fruit<sup>sg</sup> were-you-having then? What-things now you-are-ashamed-of, for the end of-that (is/was) death. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But now having-been-freed from [the] sin and having-been-enslaved to-[the] God, you-have the fruit of-you unto sanctification, but/and in-the-end/finally<sup>2</sup> eternal life. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>For the wages of-[the] sin (is) death, but the gracious-gift of-[the] God (is) life in Christ Jesus the Lord of-us.</span>
