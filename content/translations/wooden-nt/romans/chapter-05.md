## Romans Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So having-been-justified by faith/trust, we-have peace toward [the] God through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>through whom we┘also└have-had [the] access [by-[the] trust/faith] to this [the] grace in which we stand and take-pride in (the) hope of-the glory of-[the] God. 3And not only (that) but we also take-pride in [the] troubles, knowing that [the] tribulation produces perseverance, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and [the] perseverance (produces) character, and [the] character produces hope, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and [the] hope does┘not└disappoint, because the love of-[the] God is-being-poured-out in the hearts of-us through (the) Holy Spirit [the] given to-us. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For we still being weak, yet in due-time Christ died for (the) ungodly. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>For hardly will┘somebody└die for (a) righteous (person); for maybe somebody would-take-it-on-himself even to-die for the/a good man. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But [the] God commends the love of-himself toward us because, we yet being sinners, Christ died for us. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>More by-much then, having-been-justified now by the blood of-him, we-will-be-saved through him from [the] wrath. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For if, being enemies, we-were-reconciled to-[the] God through the death of-the Son of-him, more by-much, having-been-reconciled, we-will-be-saved by the life of-him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>And not only (that), but also, taking-pride in [the] God through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, through whom now we-received the reconciliation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> On-account-of this as through one man [the] sin entered into the world and [the] death through [the] sin, and so [the] death passed into all men because<sup>2</sup> all sinned. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>For until law sin was in (the) world, but sin is┘not└regarded, law not being; <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>but [the] death ruled from Adam till Moses even over the-ones not having-sinned at the likeness of-the transgression of-Adam, who is (a) type of-the-One coming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But not like the transgression so also is the gracious-gift. For if the many died by-the transgression of-the-One, more by-much the grace of-[the] God and the gracious-gift by (the) grace [the] of-the One man Jesus Christ abounded to the many. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>For not as through one having-sinned (is) the gracious-gift, for [the] judgment (was) from/by one (transgression) unto condemnation, but the gracious-gift (was) from many transgressions unto justification/righteousness. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For if by-the sin of-the one [the] death ruled through the one, more by-much the-ones receiving the abundance of-[the] grace and of-the gift of-[the] righteousness will-rule in life through the One Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>So then as through one transgression (there was what led) to condemnation for all men, so also through one (act of) righteousness (there will be what leads) to (the) justification of-life for all men. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For as through the disobedience of-the one man the many were-constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of-the One the many will-be-constituted righteous. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And (the) Law came-in-alongside in-order-that [the] transgression might-increase, but where [the] sin increased, [the] grace increased-all-the-more; <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>in-order-that, as [the] sin ruled in [the] death, so also [the] grace might-rule through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ, the Lord of-us.</span>
