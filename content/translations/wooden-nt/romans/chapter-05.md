## Romans Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So having-been-justified by faith/trust, we-have peace toward [the] God through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ 2through whom we┘also└have-had [the] access [by-[the] trust/faith] to this [the] grace in which we stand and take-pride in (the) hope of-the glory of-[the] God. 3And not only (that) but we also take-pride in [the] troubles, knowing that [the] tribulation produces perseverance, 4and [the] perseverance (produces) character, and [the] character produces hope, 5and [the] hope does┘not└disappoint, because the love of-[the] God is-being-poured-out in the hearts of-us through (the) Holy Spirit [the] given to-us. 6For we still being weak, yet in due-time Christ died for (the) ungodly. 7For hardly will┘somebody└die for (a) righteous (person); for maybe somebody would-take-it-on-himself even to-die for the/a good man. 8But [the] God commends the love of-himself toward us because, we yet being sinners, Christ died for us. 9More by-much then, having-been-justified now by the blood of-him, we-will-be-saved through him from [the] wrath. 10For if, being enemies, we-were-reconciled to-[the] God through the death of-the Son of-him, more by-much, having-been-reconciled, we-will-be-saved by the life of-him. 11And not only (that), but also, taking-pride in [the] God through the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, through whom now we-received the reconciliation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> On-account-of this as through one man [the] sin entered into the world and [the] death through [the] sin, and so [the] death passed into all men because2 all sinned. 13For until law sin was in (the) world, but sin is┘not└regarded, law not being; 14but [the] death ruled from Adam till Moses even over the-ones not having-sinned at the likeness of-the transgression of-Adam, who is (a) type of-the-One coming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> But not like the transgression so also is the gracious-gift. For if the many died by-the transgression of-the-One, more by-much the grace of-[the] God and the gracious-gift by (the) grace [the] of-the One man Jesus Christ abounded to the many. 16For not as through one having-sinned (is) the gracious-gift, for [the] judgment (was) from/by one (transgression) unto condemnation, but the gracious-gift (was) from many transgressions unto justification/righteousness. 17For if by-the sin of-the one [the] death ruled through the one, more by-much the-ones receiving the abundance of-[the] grace and of-the gift of-[the] righteousness will-rule in life through the One Jesus Christ. 18So then as through one transgression (there was what led) to condemnation for all men, so also through one (act of) righteousness (there will be what leads) to (the) justification of-life for all men. 19For as through the disobedience of-the one man the many were-constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of-the One the many will-be-constituted righteous. 20And (the) Law came-in-alongside in-order-that [the] transgression might-increase, but where [the] sin increased, [the] grace increased-all-the-more; 21in-order-that, as [the] sin ruled in [the] death, so also [the] grace might-rule through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ, the Lord of-us.</span>
