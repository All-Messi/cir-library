## Romans Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Let┘every person└submit to-higher authorities, for there-is not (an) authority except<sup>2</sup> by God. And the-ones existing have-been established by God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So the-one resisting the authority has-resisted the ordained-thing of-[the] God, and the-ones having-resisted will-receive condemnation for-themselves. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For [the] rulers are not (a) fear to [the/a] good work but to [the/a] evil. Now you-want not to—be-afraid-of the authority? Do the good-thing, and you-will-have praise from it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For he-is (a) helper of-God to-you for [the] good. But if you-do the evil-thing, be afraid; for he-does┘not└bear the sword in-vain. For he-is (a) minister/helper of-God, (an) avenger for wrath to-the-one doing the evil-thing. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Wherefore (it is a) necessity to-submit, not only on-account-of [the] wrath, but also on-account-of [the] conscience. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>For on-account-of this also you-pay taxes. For they-are ministers/helpers of God, devoting-themselves-to this very-thing. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Pay to-all their/the dues, [the] tribute to-whom [the] tribute, [the] tax to-whom [the] tax, [the] respect to-whom [the] respect, [the] honor to-whom [the] honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Owe nothing to-anybody except<sup>2</sup> [the] to-love one-another. For the-one loving the other has-fulfilled (the) Law. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For [the], <strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou-shall┘</strong><strong>not└commit-</strong><strong>adultery</strong><strong>,”</strong> <strong>“</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>ou-shall┘not└murder</strong><strong>,” </strong> <strong>“</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>ou-shall┘not└steal</strong><strong>,” </strong> <strong>“</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>ou-shall┘not└covet</strong><strong>,” </strong> and if (there is) any other commandment, it-is-summed-up [in [the<sup>]</sup>]<sup>ms</sup>, <strong>“You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself.”</strong> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>[The] love does┘not└work evil to-the/a neighbor; therefore, [the] love is (the) fulfillment of-(the)-Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And this, knowing the time, that (the) hour (is) already for-you to-arise from sleep, for now the salvation of-us (is) nearer than when we-came-to-believe. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>The night has-gone-far, and the day has-come-near. So let-us-lay-aside the works of-[the] darkness, and let-us-put-on the armor of-[the] light. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>As in (the) daylight let-us-walk respectably, not with-carousing[s] and drunkenness[es], not with-sexual-promiscuity/ies and indecency, not with-rivalry and jealousy, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>but put-on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do┘not└make provision of-the flesh for lusts.</span>
