## Romans Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let┘every person└submit to-higher authorities, for there-is not (an) authority except2 by God. And the-ones existing have-been established by God. 2So the-one resisting the authority has-resisted the ordained-thing of-[the] God, and the-ones having-resisted will-receive condemnation for-themselves. 3For [the] rulers are not (a) fear to [the/a] good work but to [the/a] evil. Now you-want not to—be-afraid-of the authority? Do the good-thing, and you-will-have praise from it. 4For he-is (a) helper of-God to-you for [the] good. But if you-do the evil-thing, be afraid; for he-does┘not└bear the sword in-vain. For he-is (a) minister/helper of-God, (an) avenger for wrath to-the-one doing the evil-thing. 5Wherefore (it is a) necessity to-submit, not only on-account-of [the] wrath, but also on-account-of [the] conscience. 6For on-account-of this also you-pay taxes. For they-are ministers/helpers of God, devoting-themselves-to this very-thing. 7Pay to-all their/the dues, [the] tribute to-whom [the] tribute, [the] tax to-whom [the] tax, [the] respect to-whom [the] respect, [the] honor to-whom [the] honor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Owe nothing to-anybody except2 [the] to-love one-another. For the-one loving the other has-fulfilled (the) Law. 9For [the], and if (there is) any other commandment, it-is-summed-up [in [the]]ms, "You-shall-love the neighbor of-you as yourself." 10[The] love does┘not└work evil to-the/a neighbor; therefore, [the] love is (the) fulfillment of-(the)-Law.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And this, knowing the time, that (the) hour (is) already for-you to-arise from sleep, for now the salvation of-us (is) nearer than when we-came-to-believe. 12The night has-gone-far, and the day has-come-near. So let-us-lay-aside the works of-[the] darkness, and let-us-put-on the armor of-[the] light. 13As in (the) daylight let-us-walk respectably, not with-carousing[s] and drunkenness[es], not with-sexual-promiscuity/ies and indecency, not with-rivalry and jealousy, 14but put-on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do┘not└make provision of-the flesh for lusts.</span>
