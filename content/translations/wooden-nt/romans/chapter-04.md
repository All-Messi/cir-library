## Romans Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> What then will-we-say (that) Abraham, the forefather of-me, has-found according-to (the) flesh? 2For if Abraham was-justified by [the] works, he-has (a)-basis-for-boasting, but not toward God. 3For what does┘the scripture└say? "And Abraham trusted-in [the] God, and it-was-regarded to-him [as] righteousness." 4But for-the-one working, the reward/result is┘not└regarded according-to grace, but according-to debt. 5But for-the-one not working, but trusting in the-One justifying the ungodly, the trust/faith of-him is-regarded as righteousness. 6Just-as David also says-of the blessedness of-the person to-whom [the] God regards righteousness apart-from works,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Blessed (is the) man sin of-whom (the) Lord certainly does┘not└regard</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So (is) this [the] blessedness on the circumcision or on the uncircumcision too? For we-say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> How then was-it-regarded (to him)? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 11And he-received the sign of-circumcision (as a) seal of-[the] righteousness of-[the] faith/trust in [the] uncircumcision, unto [the] his being (the) father of-all the-ones trusting through uncircumcision, unto [the]ms righteousness [the] being regarded to-them, 12and (the) father of-circumcision to-the-ones not of circumcision only but also to-the-ones walking in the footsteps of faith/trust in-the state-of uncircumcision of-the father of-us, Abraham.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> For not through law (was) the promise to-[the] Abraham or to-the seed of-him, (that) he was the heir of-(the)-world, but through (the) righteousness of-trust/faith. 14For if the-ones of law (are) heirs, trust/faith has-been-made void and [the] promise has-been-nullified. 15For the law brings-about wrath, but where (there) is not law neither (is there) sin. 16On-account-of this (it is) of trust/faith, in-order-that (it may be) according-to grace, unto the promise's being sure to-all the seed, not only for-the-one of the Law, but also to-the-one of (the) trust/faith of-Abraham, who is (the) father of-all of us, 17just-as it-has-been-written [that], "I-have-established you (as the) father of-many nations," before whom he-believed/trusted, God, the-One making┘the dead└alive and calling the-things not being as being, 18who, in hope against hope, trusted unto [the] his becoming '(the) father of-many nations' according-to the thing spoken, "So the seed of-you will-be." 19And not being-weak in-respect-to-[the] trust/faith he-considered [the] body of-himself [already]ms as-good-as having-been-dead, being about (a) hundred-years-old, and the deadness of-the womb of-Sarah. 20and unto the promise of-[the] God he-did┘not└hesitate in-[the] distrust/disbelief, but grew-strong in-[the] trust/faith, having-given/giving glory to-[the] God 21and having-been-freely-assured that what he-had-promised he-was able also to-do. 22Wherefore [also]ms, "It-was regarded to-him as righteousness." 23Now it-was┘not└written on-account-of him only that it-was-regarded to-him, 24but also on-account-of us, to-whom it-will-be-regarded, to-the-ones believing/trusting in the-One having-raised Jesus the Lord of-us from (the) dead, 25who was-delivered-up on-account-of the wrong-doing of-us and was-raised on-account-of the justification of-us.</span>
