## Romans Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So I-urge you, brothers, by the mercies of-[the] God to-present the bodies of-you (as a) living sacrifice, holy well-pleasing to-[the] God, [the] your spiritual service. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Do┘not└conform-yourselves to-[the] this world/age, but transform-yourselves by-[the] renewing the mind unto your discerning what the will of-[the] God (is), the good and pleasing and perfect.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> For I-say, by the grace [the] given to-me to-everybody [the] being among you not to-think-of-himself above what it-is-appropriate to-think, but to-think unto [the] good-judgment, as [the] God measured-out to-each (a) measure of-faith. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>For as in one body we have many members/parts, and the many parts do┘not└have the same function, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>so we the many are one in Christ, and [the] according-to one members/parts of-one-another. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And having different gifts according-to the grace [the] given to-us, if (it is) prophecy, (let us do it) according-to the proportion of-[the] faith; <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>if (it is) service, (let us carry out our commitment to–him) in [the] service; if the-one teaching, (let us do it) in [the] teaching; <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>if the-one encouraging, (let us do it) in [the] encouraging; the-one sharing (let us do it) in liberality; the-one leading, (let us do it) in diligence; the-one showing-mercy, (let us do it) in cheerfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> (Let [the] love (be) without-hypocrisy, hating the evil-thing; hanging-onto the good-thing; <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>(being) devoted-to one-another in brotherly-love, giving-preference to-one-another with [the] honor; <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>in-respect-to zeal (do) not (be) lazy; being-enthusiastic in-[the] spirit, serving the Lord; <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>rejoicing with-[the] hope; enduring [the] tribulation; devoting (yourselves to-[the] prayer; <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>sharing the needs of-the saints, pursuing the love-of-strangers. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Bless the-ones persecuting you; bless and do┘not└curse. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Rejoice with rejoicing-ones; weep with weeping-ones. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Mind the same-thing to one-another, but associate-with the humble.. Do┘not└be wise toward yourselves. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Do┘not└repay evil for evil; have-in-mind-to-do good-things in-front-of all men. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>If possible with-respect-to the-thing of you, be-at-peace with all men. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Do┘not└avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to-[the] wrath, for it-has-been-written, <strong>“Revenge (is) to-me; I will-repay,” </strong>says (the) Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> But <strong>if the enemy </strong><strong>of-you</strong><strong> is-hungry, feed him.</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	If he-is-thirsty, </strong><strong>give┘</strong><strong>him</strong><strong>└ (a)-</strong><strong>drink;</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or doing</strong><strong> this, </strong><strong>you-will</strong><strong>-pour</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>oals of-fire on the head of-him.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Do┘not└be-overcome by [the] evil, but overcome [the] evil with [the] good.</span>
