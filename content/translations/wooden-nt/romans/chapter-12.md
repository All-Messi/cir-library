<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> For I-say, by the grace [the] given to-me to-everybody [the] being among you not to-think-of-himself above what it-is-appropriate to-think, but to-think unto [the] good-judgment, as [the] God measured-out to-each (a) measure of-faith. 4For as in one body we have many members/parts, and the many parts do┘not└have the same function, 5so we the many are one in Christ, and [the] according-to one members/parts of-one-another. 6And having different gifts according-to the grace [the] given to-us, if (it is) prophecy, (let us do it) according-to the proportion of-[the] faith; 7if (it is) service, (let us carry out our commitment to–him) in [the] service; if the-one teaching, (let us do it) in [the] teaching; 8if the-one encouraging, (let us do it) in [the] encouraging; the-one sharing (let us do it) in liberality; the-one leading, (let us do it) in diligence; the-one showing-mercy, (let us do it) in cheerfulness. 9(Let [the] love (be) without-hypocrisy, hating the evil-thing; hanging-onto the good-thing; 10(being) devoted-to one-another in brotherly-love, giving-preference to-one-another with [the] honor; 11in-respect-to zeal (do) not (be) lazy; being-enthusiastic in-[the] spirit, serving the Lord; 12rejoicing with-[the] hope; enduring [the] tribulation; devoting (yourselves to-[the] prayer; 13sharing the needs of-the saints, pursuing the love-of-strangers. 14Bless the-ones persecuting you; bless and do┘not└curse. 15Rejoice with rejoicing-ones; weep with weeping-ones. 16Mind the same-thing to one-another, but associate-with the humble.. Do┘not└be wise toward yourselves. 17Do┘not└repay evil for evil; have-in-mind-to-do good-things in-front-of all men. 18If possible with-respect-to the-thing of you, be-at-peace with all men. 19Do┘not└avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to-[the] wrath, for it-has-been-written,</span>
