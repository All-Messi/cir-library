<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Now I-urge you, brothers, to-watch the-ones causing [the] divisions and [the] stumbling[s] contrary-to the teaching that you learned, and turn-away from them. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>For [the] such-people are┘not└serving the Lord of-us Christ but [the] their-own appetites, and by the smooth-talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For [the] obedience of-you reached to all. So I-am-rejoicing over you, but I-want you to-be wise to [the] good, and innocent of [the] evil. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And the God of-[the] peace will-crush [the] Satan under the feet of-you soon/swiftly.
