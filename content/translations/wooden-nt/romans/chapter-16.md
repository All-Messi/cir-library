Greet Epaenetus, the beloved-one of-me, who is (the) first-fruit to Christ in Asia. 6Greet Mary, who worked┘very└hard for you. 7Greet Andronicus and Juniaf/Juniasm, [the] kinsmen of me and fellow-prisoners of-me, who are well-known among the apostles, who also have-been in Christ before me. 8Greet Ampliatus, the beloved of-me in (the) Lord. 9Greet Urbanus, the fellow-worker of-us in Christ, and Stachysm, the beloved of-me. 10Greet Apellesm, the approved-one in Christ.

So I-am-rejoicing over you, but I-want you to-be wise to [the] good, and innocent of [the] evil. 20And the God of-[the] peace will-crush [the] Satan under the feet of-you soon/swiftly.
