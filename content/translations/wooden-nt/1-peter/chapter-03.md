## 1 Peter Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Likewise, [the] wives, submit to-[the] your husbands, in-order-that even if some are-disobedient to-the word, they-will-be-won aside-from (the) word by the behavior of-the/their wives, 2having-watched the chaste behavior of-you with respect, 3of-whom [the] adornment let┘not└be the external elaborate-braiding of-hair[s] and wearing of-gold-things or (the) putting-on of-clothes, 4but the hidden person of-the heart in the imperishableness of-(a)-gentle and quiet spirit, which is before [the] God very-precious.  5For thus once also [the] holy women [the-ones] hoping in God would-adorn themselves, submitting to-[the] their husbands, 6as Sarah submitted to-[the] Abraham, calling him "sir/lord," whose offspring you-became, doing-good and not fearing any frightening-thing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Likewise [the] husbands, dwell-with the/your wife according-to knowledge as (the/a) weaker vessel, showing honor as also to-fellow-heirs of-(the)-grace of-life unto (the) not hindering the prayers of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And in-summary/finally2, let┘you) all└be-like-minded, sympathetic, brotherly, tenderhearted, humble-minded, 9not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but blessing instead; because for this you-were-called, in-order-that you-might-inherit blessing.  10For</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And who (is) the-one going-to-harm you if you-became zealots of-(the) 'good'?  14But even if you-should-suffer on-account-of 'righteousness,' blessed (you would be).  But do┘not└fear the fear of-them nor be-terrified; 15but sanctify [the] Christ as Lord in the hearts of-you, always ready for (a) defense to-everybody [the] asking┘ you └for (a)reason concerning the hope in you; 16but (do it) with gentleness and respect, having (a) good conscience, in-order-that in what you-are-slandered, the-ones reviling you the good behavior of-you in Christ may-be-put-to-shame.  17For (your) to-suffer/suffering doing-good (is) better than doing-evil, if the will of-[the] God should-will (it), 18because Christ also suffered concerning sins once-and-for-all, (a) righteous (man) for unrighteousness (men), in-order-that he-might-bring you to-[the] God, having-been-put-to-death in (the) flesh [on-the-one-hand], but having-been-made-alive in-(the)-spirit; 19in which also having-gone, he-proclaimed to-the spirits in prison, 20formerly having-been-disobedient, when the longsuffering of-[the] God was-waiting in (the) days of-Noah, (the) ark being-prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls were-saved by/through water, 21with respect to-which also baptism as-(a)-likeness now saves you, not (a) removal of-dirt of-(the)-flesh, but (an) appeal of-(a)-good conscience to God, through (the) resurrection of-Jesus Christ, 22who is on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God, having-gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers having-been-subjected to-him.</span>
