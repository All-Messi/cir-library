## 1 Peter Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Likewise, [the] wives, submit to-[the] your husbands, in-order-that even if some are-disobedient to-the word, they-will-be-won aside-from (the) word by the behavior of-the/their wives, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>having-watched the chaste behavior of-you with respect, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>of-whom [the] adornment let┘not└be the external elaborate-braiding of-hair[s] and wearing of-gold-things or (the) putting-on of-clothes, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>but the hidden person of-the heart in the imperishableness of-(a)-gentle and quiet spirit, which is before [the] God very-precious.  <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For thus once also [the] holy women [the-ones] hoping in God would-adorn themselves, submitting to-[the] their husbands, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>as Sarah submitted to-[the] Abraham, calling him “sir/lord,” whose offspring you-became, doing-good and not fearing any frightening-thing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Likewise [the] husbands, dwell-with the/your wife according-to knowledge as (the/a) weaker vessel, showing honor as also to-fellow-heirs of-(the)-grace of-life unto (the) not hindering the prayers of-you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And in-summary/finally<sup>2</sup>, let┘you) all└be-like-minded, sympathetic, brotherly, tenderhearted, humble-minded, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but blessing instead; because for this you-were-called, in-order-that you-might-inherit blessing.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>For 	<strong>“The-one wanting to-love life</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd to-see good days—</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	Let-him-</strong><strong>stop</strong><strong> the/his tongue from evil</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd </strong><strong>let</strong>┘<strong> (</strong><strong>his</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> lips</strong><strong> not [the] not</strong>└<strong>speak</strong><strong> deceit.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> <strong>Let-him-turn from evil and do good.</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	Let-him-seek peace and pursue it;</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <strong>b</strong><strong>ecause (the) eyes of-(the)-Lord (are) upon the righteous,</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd (the) ears of-him</strong><strong> (are)</strong><strong> to (the) prayer of-them,</strong> <strong>a</strong><strong>nd (the) face of-(the)-Lord is against (the ones) doing evil-things.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And who (is) the-one going-to-harm you if you-became zealots of-(the) ‘good’?  <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But even if you-should-suffer on-account-of ‘righteousness,’ blessed (you would be).  But do┘not└fear the fear of-them nor be-terrified; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but sanctify [the] Christ as Lord in the hearts of-you, always ready for (a) defense to-everybody [the] asking┘ you └for (a)reason concerning the hope in you; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>but (do it) with gentleness and respect, having (a) good conscience, in-order-that in what you-are-slandered, the-ones reviling you the good behavior of-you in Christ may-be-put-to-shame.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>For (your) to-suffer/suffering doing-good (is) better than doing-evil, if the will of-[the] God should-will (it), <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>because Christ also suffered concerning sins once-and-for-all, (a) righteous (man) for unrighteousness (men), in-order-that he-might-bring you to-[the] God, having-been-put-to-death in (the) flesh [on-the-one-hand], but having-been-made-alive in-(the)-spirit; <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>in which also having-gone, he-proclaimed to-the spirits in prison, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>formerly having-been-disobedient, when the longsuffering of-[the] God was-waiting in (the) days of-Noah, (the) ark being-prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls were-saved by/through water, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>with respect to-which also baptism as-(a)-likeness now saves you, not (a) removal of-dirt of-(the)-flesh, but (an) appeal of-(a)-good conscience to God, through (the) resurrection of-Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>who is on (the) right (hand) of-[the] God, having-gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers having-been-subjected to-him.</span>
