## 1 Peter Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Therefore, putting-aside all wickedness/hateful-feelings and all deceit and hypocrisy and jealousy and all insults, 2like newborn infants be-hungry for the spiritual/designed-for-you, pure/undiluted milk so you-can-grow by it into salvation, 3if you tasted that the Lord (is) kind; 4to whom coming—(as to a) living stone, rejected [on-the-one-hand] by men, but to God chosen (and) precious—5be┘also yourselves└built-up (as a) spiritual house for (a) holy priesthood to-offer-up┘spiritual sacrifices└in acceptable to-God through Jesus Christ.  6Wherefore it-stands in scripture,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So to-you the-ones 'believing' (is) the value, but to unbelievers (he is) who 'stumble,' being-disobedient to-the word—unto which (situation) also they-were-appointed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But you (are an) elect race, (a) royal priesthood, (a) holy nation, (a) people for (a) possession, in-order-that you-may-proclaim the excellences of-the-One having-called you out-of darkness into the amazing light of-him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The-ones once not (a) people,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Beloved, I-urge (you) as foreigners and sojourners to abstain from [the] fleshly lusts, which fight against the soul, 12having the manner-of-life of-you good/fitting among the Gentiles in-order-that, in what they-try-to-slander you as evildoers, observing the good/fitting works, they-may-glorify [the] God in (the) day of-visitation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> For-the-sake-of the Lord, submit to-every human creation/institution/societal-structure—whether to-(a) king as being-in-authority, 14whether to governors as sent by him unto (the) punishment of-evildoers and (the) praise of-good-doers, 12because thus is the will of-[the] God (that) by-doing-good—to-put-to-silence the ignorance of-[the] evil men, 16as free but not having freedom as (a) pretext of-[the] evil, but as servants of-God.  17Honor all-men, love the brotherhood, fear [the] God, honor the king. 18[The] household-servants, submit in all respect to-the/your masters, not only to-the good an d considerate, but also to-the harsh.  19For this (is) graciousness:  if on-account-of conscience of-God, (a)-person bears-up-under sorrows, suffering unjustly.  20For what credit (is it), if sinning and being-beaten, you-bear (it)?  But if doing-good and suffering, you-bear (it), this (is) graciousness with God.  21For to this you-were-called, because also Christ suffered for you, leaving-behind (an) example for you, in-order-that you-might-walk-in the steps of-him, 22who 23who, being-insulted, did┘not└insult-in return; having-suffered, would, was┘not└threaten; but continued-to-deliver-himself to-the One judging righteously, 24who himself bore the sins of-us in the body of-him on the tree, in-order-that, having-no-part in-[the] sins, we-might-live in-[the] righteousness, by-the wounds of-whom you-were-healed.  25For you-were like sheep straying, but now you-have-returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of-the souls of-you.</span>
