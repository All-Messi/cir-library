## 1 Peter Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Therefore, putting-aside all wickedness/hateful-feelings and all deceit and hypocrisy and jealousy and all insults, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>like newborn infants be-hungry for the spiritual/designed-for-you, pure/undiluted milk so you-can-grow by it into salvation, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>if you tasted that the Lord (is) kind; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>to whom coming—(as to a) living stone, rejected [on-the-one-hand] by men, but to God chosen (and) precious—<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>be┘also yourselves└built-up (as a) spiritual house for (a) holy priesthood to-offer-up┘spiritual sacrifices└in acceptable to-God through Jesus Christ.  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Wherefore it-stands in scripture, <strong>“Behold, I-lay in Zion (a) stone,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	(</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>) precious corner-</strong><strong>stone;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd the-one believing in him </strong> <strong>w</strong><strong>ill┘certa</strong><strong>inly not└be-disappointed.</strong><strong>”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>So to-you the-ones ‘believing’ (is) the value, but to unbelievers (he is) <strong>“(A) stone that the builders rejected</strong><strong>;</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>his-One became [for] (the) head of-(the)-corner”;</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>and <strong>“(A) stone of-stumbling</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd (a) rock of-offense,”</strong> who ‘stumble,’ being-disobedient to-the word—unto which (situation) also they-were-appointed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> (are <strong>an) elect race, (a) royal priesthood, (a) holy nation, (a) people for (a) possession, </strong><strong>in-order-</strong><strong>that you-may-proclaim the excellences </strong>of-the-One having-called you out-of darkness into the amazing light of-him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The-ones once not (a) people, but now (a) people of-God; the-ones not mercied, but now mercied.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Beloved, I-urge (you) as foreigners and sojourners to abstain from [the] fleshly lusts, which fight against the soul, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>having the manner-of-life of-you good/fitting among the Gentiles in-order-that, in what they-try-to-slander you as evildoers, observing the good/fitting works, they-may-glorify [the] God in (the) day of-visitation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For-the-sake-of the Lord, submit to-every human creation/institution/societal-structure—whether to-(a) king as being-in-authority, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>whether to governors as sent by him unto (the) punishment of-evildoers and (the) praise of-good-doers, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>because thus is the will of-[the] God (that) by-doing-good—to-put-to-silence the ignorance of-[the] evil men, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>as free but not having freedom as (a) pretext of-[the] evil, but as servants of-God.  <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Honor all-men, love the brotherhood, fear [the] God, honor the king. <sup>18</sup>[The] household-servants, submit in all respect to-the/your masters, not only to-the good an d considerate, but also to-the harsh.  <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>For this (is) graciousness:  if on-account-of conscience of-God, (a)-person bears-up-under sorrows, suffering unjustly.  <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>For what credit (is it), if sinning and being-beaten, you-bear (it)?  But if doing-good and suffering, you-bear (it), this (is) graciousness with God.  <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For to this you-were-called, because also Christ suffered for you, leaving-behind (an) example for you, in-order-that you-might-walk-in the steps of-him, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>who <strong>“D</strong><strong>id┘not└do sin</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>either was┘deceit</strong><strong>└found in the mouth of-him,”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>who, being-insulted, did┘not└insult-in return; having-suffered, would, was┘not└threaten; but continued-to-deliver-himself to-the One judging righteously, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>who himself bore the sins of-us in the body of-him on the tree, in-order-that, having-no-part in-[the] sins, we-might-live in-[the] righteousness, by-the wounds of-whom you-were-healed.  <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>For you-were like sheep straying, but now you-have-returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of-the souls of-you.</span>
