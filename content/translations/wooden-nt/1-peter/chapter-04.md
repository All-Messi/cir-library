## 1 Peter Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So Christ having-suffered in-(the)-flesh, you also arm-yourselves-with the same attitude, because the-one having-suffered in-(the)-flesh has-ceased sins 2unto [the] no-longer living the remaining time in (the) flesh by (the) desires of-men, but (the) will of-God.  3For the having passed-by time (is) sufficient to-have-carried-out the will of-the Gentiles, having-pursued-(a)-course/pattern in indecencies, lusts, drunkenness[es], revelries, drunken orgies, and abominable idolatries, 4in which they-think-strange your not running-with (them) in the same excess of-[the]-reckless-living, slandering (you), 5who-will-give-(an)-account to-the-One having-prepared to-judge (the) living and (the) dead.  6For to this (end) the-gospel-was-preached even to-(the)-dead in-order-that they-might-be-judged according-to men in-(the)-flesh, but living according-to God in-(the)-spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Now the end of-all-things has-come-near.  So be-of-sound-judgment and be-sober unto prayer 8before all-things, having love constant to each another, because love covers (a) multitude of-sins, 9(being) hospitable to one-another without complaining, 10even-as each received (a) gift, ministering it to one-another as good stewards of-(the)-manifold/manifold grace of-God.  11If anybody speaks, (let it be) as utterances of-God; if anybody serves (let it be) as out-of (the) strength that [the] God supplies, in-order-that in all-things [the] God may-be-glorified through Jesus Christ, to-whom is [the] glory and [the] might forevermore5.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Beloved, do┘not└think-it-strange/be-surprised at-the fiery-trial among you coming at-you for testing, as if something-strange happening to-you; 13but to-the-degree-that you-share the sufferings of-[the] Christ, rejoice, in-order-that you-may┘also greatly└rejoice at the revelation of-the glory of-him.  14If you-are-insulted at (the) name of-Christ, (you are) blessed, because the Spirit of-[the] glory and [the] Spirit of-[the] God rest on you.  15For let┘not anybody of-you└suffer as (a) murderer or thief or evildoer or as (a)-busybody/interfering-in-other-people's-business; 16but if as (a) Christian (any of you suffer), let-him┘not└be-ashamed, but let-him-glorify [the] God in this matter/part; 17because (it is) the time of-[the] judgment's beginning from the household of-[the] God; and if (it is) from us first, what (will be) the end of-the-ones disbelieving the gospel of-[the] God?  18And 19so-that also let┘the-ones suffering according-to the till of-[the] God└entrust their souls to-the faithful creator in doing-good.</span>
