## 1 Peter Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>(The) elders [the] among you I-exhort, (being) the/a fellow-elder and witness of-the sufferings of-Christ, the/a sharer also of-the future glory to-be-revealed.  <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Shepherd the flock of-[the] God among you, exercising-(the)-oversight; not under-compulsion, but willingly according-to God; not for-shameful-gain, but eagerly; <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>neither as lording-(it)-over the/your charges, but by-being (an) example of-the flock; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and the chief-Shepherd having-appeared, you-will-receive the unfading crown of-[the] glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Likewise, younger-men, be-subject to-(the)-elders; and you┘all└clothe-yourselves-with [the] ‘humility’ toward-one-another, because <strong>“[The] God resists (the) proud,</strong> <strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>ut gives grace to-the-(the)-humble.”</strong> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>‘Humble’-yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of-[the] God, in-order-that he-may-exalt you in-due-time, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>having-casting all the care of-you on him, because it-is-(a)-concern to-him about you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Be-serious-minded; be alert.  The adversary of-you, (the) devil, like a roaring lion, walks around, seeking whom to-devour, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>whom resist resolute in-the faith, knowing the same-things of-[the] sufferings to-be-accomplished by-the brotherhood of-you in (the) world.  <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But the God of-all grace—the-One having-called you into the eternal glory of-him in Christ, having-suffered<sup>pl</sup> (a)-little-while—will┘himself└make-(you)-perfect/complete, will-confirm, will-strengthen, will-establish (you).  <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>To-him (be) [the] dominion forevermore<sup>3</sup>.  Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By Silvanus the faithful brother, as-I-consider (him), I-wrote to-you through few (words), exhorting and testifying this to-be the true grace of-[the] God—in which stand-fast<sup>imper</sup>.  <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The fellow-elect (church)<sup>ms</sup> in Babylon greets you, and (so does) Mark, the son of-me.  <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Greet one-another with (a) loving kiss.  Peace to-you all the-ones in Christ. Virgil Warren, PhD translator christir.org</span>
