<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Peter, apostle of-Jesus Christ to-(the) elect sojourners of-(the)-Diaspora of-Pontus, Galatian, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>according-to (the) foreknowledge of-God (the) Father in (the) sanctification of-(the)-Spirit, unto (the) obedience and sprinkling of-(the)-blood of Jesus Christ.  Grace to-you and peace be-multiplied.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed (be/is) the God and Father of-the Lord of-us Jesus Christ, the-one having-begotten us again according-to the abundant mercy of-him to (a) living hope through (the) resurrection of-Jesus Christ from (the) dead <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>unto (an) inheritance incorruptible and imperishable and undefiled, kept in (the) heaven[s] for us, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>the-ones protected by (the) power of-God through faith for (a) salvation ready to-be-revealed at (the) last time, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>in whom you-are-rejoicing now for-(a)-little-(while), if it-is necessary, though-having-been-grieved by various trials, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>in-order-that the proof of-the faith of-you—more valuable than gold [the] perishing, though-proved by-fire—may-be-found unto praise and glory and honor at (the) revelation of-Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>whom not having-seen, you-love, in whom not now seeing, but trusting you-rejoiceᴖwith-joy/you┘greatly└rejoice inexpressible and glorified, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>receiving-back (as) the outcome of-the faith of-you (the) salvation of-(your)-souls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Concerning which salvation prophets, the-ones having-prophesied-beforehand about the grace (to be offered) to you, searched-out and tried-to-find-out, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>searching into what time and what-kind-of time the Spirit of-Christ in them was-indicating, testifying-beforehand-about the sufferings in Christ and the glories after these (sufferings); <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>to-whom it-was-revealed that, not to-themselves, but to-you they-were-ministering them, which now were-announced to-you through the-ones having-evangelized you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, into-which things angels desire to-look-into.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Wherefore, having-girded-up the loins of-the mind of-you, being-self-controlled, put-(your)-hope completely on the grace being-brought to-you at (the) revelation of Jesus Christ, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>as children of-obedience, not being-conformed-to the former lusts in the ignorance of-you; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>but according-to the-One having-called you (is) holy, you┘also yourselves└may-become holy in all conduct; <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>because it-has-been-written, <strong>“You-shall-be-holy because I (am) holy.”</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> And if you-call Father the-One judging according-to the work of-each without-respect-of-persons/favoritism, in fear conduct the time of-the sojourning of-you, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>knowing that you-were┘not└redeemed with-corruptible-things—silver or gold—from the empty way-of-life of-you inherited-from-(your)-forefathers, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>but with precious blood as of-(an)-unblemished and spotless lamb—Christ, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>foreknown<sup>sg</sup> before (the) founding of-(the) world, but revealed at (the) last of-[the]-times on-account-of you, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>the-ones through him being-faithful to God the-One having-resurrected him from (the) dead and having-given glory to-him, so-that the faith and hope of-you is in God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Having-purified the souls of-you in [the] obedience of-the truth unto (a) sincere brotherly-love, fervently continue-to-love one-another out-of (a) pure heart, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>having-been-born-again, not from corruptible, but incorruptible, seed through (the) living and ‘remaining/staying’ word of-God.  <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>Wherefore 	<strong>“All flesh (is) like grass,</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd all glo</strong><strong>ry of-it (is) like (a) flower of-(the)-</strong><strong>grass.</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>[</strong><strong>The</strong><strong>]</strong><strong> grass withers,</strong> 	<strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>	</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd </strong><strong>[</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>]</strong><strong> flower</strong><strong>(s) fall</strong><strong>-off;</strong></span>
