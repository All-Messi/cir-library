## John Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things was (a) feast of-the Jews, and Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And there-is in [the] Jerusalem at the sheep (gate a) pool [the] called in-Hebrew ‘Bethesda,’ having five porches. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>In these (a) crowd of-[the] sick-ones was-lying—blind, lame, paralyzed. [<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>] <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>(A)-certain man was there for-thirty and eight years, having in the weakness of-him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>[The] Jesus, seeing this-one lying and knowing that he was-having already for-(a)-long time, says to-him, <em>“Do-you-want</em><em> </em><em>to-become well?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The infirm-one answered him, <em>“Sir, I-do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>have </em><em>(a) person in-o</em><em>rder-that,</em><em> when the water is stirred, he-can-put me in the pool.</em><em> </em><em>And in which (time) I</em><em> </em><em>am-coming</em><em>, another (person) comes down ahead-of me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> [The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“Get-up, pick-up the bedroll of-you and walk</em>.<strong><sup>”</sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And immediately the man became healthy and picked-up the bedroll of-him and began-to-walk. And it-was (the) Sabbath on that [the] day. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Then the Jews said to-the healed-one, <em>“It-is Sabbath, and it-is┘not└lawful for-you to-carry the bedroll of-you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the (man) answered them, <em>“The-one having-made</em><em>┘me└healthy—that-one said to me, ‘Pick-up the bedroll of-you and walk.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> They-asked him, <em>“Who is the man the-one having-said to-you, ‘Pick-up and walk’?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And the-one having-been-healed did┘not└know who he-was, for [the] Jesus had-left, (a) crowd being in-the-place. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>After these-things [the] Jesus finds him in the temple and said to-him, <em>“Behold, you-have-become healthy; no-longer sin, lest</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> something worse become to-you.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The man went-away and reported to-the Jews that Jesus was the-One having-made┘him└well. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And on-account-of this, the Jews began-to-persecute [the] Jesus, because he-was-doing these-things on (the) Sabbath. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But [the] Jesus answered them, <em>“The Father of</em><em>-me is-working up-to now an</em><em>d-I </em><em>am-working</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Then on-account-of this, the Jews were-seeking more to-kill him because not only was-he-breaking the Sabbath, but also he-was-calling [the] God his ‘Father,’ making himself equal to-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then [the] Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-tell you, </em><em>t</em><em>he Son is┘not└able of himself to-do something unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> he-sees the Father doing something; for whatever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> that-One does—these-things also the Son likewise does.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all-things that he does, and he-will-show him greater works than-these in-order-that you may-marvel.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>For as the Father raises the dead and makes-alive, so also the Son makes-alive whom he-wants-to.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>For neither does┘the Father└judge anybody, but he-has-given all [the] judgment to-the Son, </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>in-order-that all may-honor the Son as they-honor the Father.</em><em> </em><em>The-one not honoring the Son does┘not└honor the Father</em><em>,</em><em> the-One having-sent him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-tell you that the-one hearing the word of-me and believing the-One having-sent me has eternal life and does┘not└come into </em><em>condemnation, but</em><em> has-crossed-over from [the] death into [the] life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-tell you that (the) hour is-coming and now is when the dead will-hear the voice of the Son of-[the] God</em><em>,</em><em> the remaining</em><em> and the-ones having-hear</em><em>d</em><em> will-come-to-life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>For as the Father has life in himself, so </em><em>also</em><em> he-gave to-the Son to-have life in himself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>And he-gave him authority to-make judgment, because he-is (a) Son of-</em><em>M</em><em>an.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>Do┘ not└marvel</em><em>-at this—that (the) hour is-coming in which all the-ones in the grave will hear the voice of-him, </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>and the-ones having-done [the] good-things will-come-out into (the) resurrection of-life, and the-ones having-done [the] foul-things into (the) resurrection of-condemnation.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>I am┘not└able to-do anything from myself; even-as I-hear, I judge; and [the] my</em><em> </em><em>[the] judgment is just, because I-do┘not└seek [the] my [the] will, but the will of-the-One having-sent me.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <em>“</em><em>If I testify about myself, the testimony </em><em>of-me</em><em> is not </em><em>valid</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>Another is the-one testifying about me, and </em><em>I-know</em><em> that</em><em> the testimony that he-testifies</em><em> about me is true.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>You<em> have-sent to John, and he-has-testified to-the truth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>But I do┘not└receive</em><em> [the] testimony from man, but I-say these-things in-order-that you may-be-saved.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>That-one was the/a lamp [the] burning and shining</em><em>,</em><em> and you were-willing to-be-happy for (a) time in the light of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>But I have [the] testimony greater than [the] John, for the works that the Father has-given me in-order-that I-might-carry┘them└out—the works themselves that I-do tes</em><em>tify about me that the Father has-</em><em>sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>And the having-sent me Father—that-one has-testified about me.</em><em> </em><em>You-have┘neither└heard</em><em> </em><em>(the) voice of-him at-any-time</em><em>,</em><em> nor have-you-seen (the) visible-form of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>And the word of-him you-do┘not└have stayi</em><em>ng in you, because whom that-One sent—this-One you do┘not└believe.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>You-search the scriptures because you think in them to-have eternal life; and those are the-ones testifying about me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>And you-do┘not└want </em><em>to-come</em><em> to me in-order-that you-may-find life.</em></span>
