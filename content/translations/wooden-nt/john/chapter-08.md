## John Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And Jesus went to the Mount of-[the] Olives. 2And again early-in-the-morning he-arrived in the temple, and all the people began-to-come to him; and, having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach them. 3And the scribes and the Pharisees bring (a) woman having-been-caught in adultery; and, having-stood her in (the) midst, 4they-say to-him, "Teacher, this [the] woman has-been-caught committing-adultery—in (the) very-act. 5And in the Law Moses commanded to-stone [the] such (a woman). So what do┘you└say?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now they-were-saying this, testing him, in-order-that they-might-have (something) to-accuse him. But [the] Jesus having-squatted down, wrote-down on the ground with-the-finger. 7And as they-were-remaining, asking him, he-stood-up and said to-them, "Let┘the sinless-one of-you first└throw (a) stone at her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And having-squatted-down again, he-started writing on the ground on the ground. 9And the-ones having-heard were-beginning-to-leaving one by one, starting from the older-ones; and he-was-left alone and the woman being in (the) midst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-stood-up, "Woman, where are-they? Did┘nobody└condemn you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And the (woman) said, "Nobody, Sir." And [the] Jesus said, "Neither do┘I└condemn you; Go, and from the now do┘not└sin again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then [the] Jesus spoke again to-them, saying, "I am the light of-the world. The-one following me will┘certainly not└walk in darkness, but will-have the light of-[the] life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Then the Pharisees said to-him, "You testify about yourself; the testimony of-you is not valid."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus answered and said to-them, "Even-if I testify about myself, the testimony of-me is valid because I know whence I-came and whence I-am-going. But you do┘not└know whence I-come or where I-go. 15You are-judging/judge according-to the flesh; I am┘not└judging/judge anybody. 16And if I do-judge, [the] my [the] judgment is true, because I-am not alone; but I and the having-sent me Father. 17But in [the] your [the] Law it-is┘also└written that the testimony of-two men is valid. 18I am the-one testifying for myself, and the having-sent me Father testifies for me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then they-were-saying to-him, "Where is the Father of-you?" Jesus answered, "You-know neither me nor the Father of-me. If you had-known me, you┘would└have-known the Father of-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> These [the] words he-spoke teaching in the Treasury in the temple, and nobody arrested him because the hour of-him had┘not-yet└come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then he-said again to-them, "I am-going-away and you-will-look-for me, and you-will-die in the sins of-you. Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then the Jews said, "He-is┘not┘┘└going-to-kill himself, └└is he?" because he-says, "Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And he-was-saying to-them, "You are from the-things below; I am from the-things above. You are from this [the] world; I am not from this [the] world. 24So I-said to-you that you-will-die in the sins of-you, for if you-do┘not└believe that I am (the One), you-will-die in the sins of-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then they-were-saying to-him, "Who are you?" [The} Jesus said to-them, "Even what I-said to you from the beginning. 26I-have many-things to-say and to-judge about you, but the-One having-sent me is true. And what-things I-heard from him—these-things I-say to the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They-did┘not└know that he-was-speaking to-them with-respect-to-the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-them, "When you-lift-up the Son of-[the] Man, then you-will-know that I am, and do mothering of myself, but even-as the Father taught me—I speak these-things. 29And the-One having-sent me is with me. He-did┘not└leave me alone, because I always do the-things pleasing to-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> He saying these-things, many believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then [the] Jesus continued-on-saying to the ones-having-believed him Jews. "If you remain in[the] my [the] word, you really are disciples of-me, 32and you-will-know the truth, and the truth will-free you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They-responded to him, "We-are Abraham's seed and have┘never└been-enslaved to-anybody. How do┘you└say [that], "You-will-become free?" 34[The] Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I-say to you that everybody the-one doing [the] sin is (a) slave of-[the] sin. 35But a/the slave does┘not└remain in the household forever3; a/the son remains forever3. 36If then the Son makes┘you└free, you┘really└are free. 37I-know that you are seed of-Abraham, but you-are-trying-to-kill me because [the] my [the] word does┘not└have-room in you. 38The-things I have-seen from the Father I-speak, and you then do what-things you-heard from the father [of-you]ms."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> They-answered and said, "[The] father of-us is Abraham." Jesus says to-them, "If you-were children of Abraham, you-would-be-doing the works of-[the] Abraham. 40But now you-are-trying to-kill me, (a) man that has-told you the truth that I-heard from [the] God. This Abraham did┘not└do. 41You do the works of-the father of-you." They-said [then]ms to-him, "We have┘not└been-born of sexual-immorality. We-have one Father—[the] God." 42[The] Jesus said to-them, "If [the] God were father of-you, you┘would└love me; for I went-[out] from [the] God and have-come. For I-have┘not└come from myself, but that-One sent me. 43On-account-of what are-you┘not└understanding [the] my [the] speech? Because you-are┘not└able to-hear [the] my [the] word? 44You are of [the] father the devil, and you-want to-do the desires of-the father of-you. That-one was (a) murderer from (the) beginning, and has┘not└stood in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he-tells a/the lie, he-speaks of-[the] his-own things, because he-is (a) liar and the father of it. 45But because I speak the truth, you-do┘not└believe me. 46Who of you shows┘me└guilty of sins? 47The-one being of [the] God hears the words of-[the] God; on-account-of this you do┘not└hear: because you-are not of [the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> The Jews answered and said to-him, "Do-we┘not└say well that you are (a) Samaritan and have (a) demon?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Jesus answered, "I do┘not└have (a) demon, but I-do-honor the Father of-me, and you dishonor me. 50And I do┘not└seek the glory of-men. The-One seeking and judging exists. 51Truly, truly, I-say to-you, if anybody keeps [the] my word, he-will┘certainly not└see death forever3." 52Then the Jews said to-him, "Now we-know that you-have (a) demon. Abraham died and the prophets, and you say, 'If anybody keeps the word of-me, he-will┘certainly not└taste of-death forever3.' 53You are not┘┘ greater than-the father of-us who died, └└are you? And the prophets died. Who are-you-making yourself?" 54Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, the glory of-me is nothing; the Father of-me is the-One glorifying me, whom you-say that he-is (the) God of-you. 55And you-do┘not└know him, but I know him. And-if I-say that I-do┘not└know him, I-will-be (a) liar like you. But I-know him, and I-keep the word of-him. 56Abraham the father of-you rejoiced in-order-that he-might-see [the] my [the] day, and he-saw (it) and was glad." 57Then the Jews said to him, "You-do┘not-yet└have fifty years, and you-have-seen Abraham?" 58Jesus said to-them, "Truly, truly, I-say to-you, I am before Abraham existed." 59Then they-picked-up stones in-order-that they-might-throw (them) at him. But Jesus was-hid and went-out from the temple.</span>
