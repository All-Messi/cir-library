## John Chapter **8**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>And Jesus went to the Mount of-[the] Olives. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And again early-in-the-morning he-arrived in the temple, and all the people began-to-come to him; and, having-sat-down, he-began-to-teach them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring (a) woman having-been-caught in adultery; and, having-stood her in (the) midst, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>they-say to-him, <em>“Teacher, this [the] woman has-</em><em>been-cau</em><em>ght committing-adultery—i</em><em>n (the) very-act.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw Moses commanded to-stone </em><em>[the] such</em><em> (a woman).</em><em> </em><em>So</em><em> what do┘you└say?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Now they-were-saying this, testing him, in-order-that they-might-have (something) to-accuse him. But [the] Jesus having-squatted down, wrote-down on the ground with-the-finger. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And as they-were-remaining, asking him, he-stood-up and said to-them, <em>“Let┘the sinless-one of-you first└throw (a) stone at her.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>And having-squatted-down again, he-started writing on the ground on the ground. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And the-ones having-heard were-beginning-to-leaving one by one, starting from the older-ones; and he-was-left alone and the woman being in (the) midst.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, having-stood-up, <em>“Woman, where are-they?</em><em> </em><em>Did┘nobody└condemn you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>And the (woman) said, <em>“Nobody, Sir.”</em><em> </em> And [the] Jesus said, <em>“Neither do┘</em><em>I</em><em>└condemn you; Go</em><em>,</em><em> and from the now do┘not└sin again.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus spoke again to-them, saying, <em>“I am the light of-the world.</em><em> </em><em>The-one following me will┘certain</em><em>ly</em><em> not└walk in </em><em>darkness, </em><em>but</em><em> will-have the light of-[the] life.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Then the Pharisees said to-him, <em>“You testify about yourself; the testimony of-you </em><em>is</em><em> not valid.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“Even-if I testify about myself, the testimony of-me is valid because I know whence I-came and whence I-am-going.</em><em> </em><em>But you do┘</em><em>not└know whence I-come or where I-go</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>You are-judging/judge according-to the flesh; I am┘not└judging/judge anybody.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And if I do-judge, [the] my [the] judgment </em><em>is true, because I-am not alone;</em><em> but I and the having-sent me Father.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But in [the] your [the] </em><em>L</em><em>aw it-is┘also└written that the testimony of-two men is valid.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>I am</em><em> the-one testifying for myself</em><em>,</em><em> and the having-sent me Father testifies for me.</em><strong><em><sup>”</sup></em></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Then they-were-saying to-him, <em>“Where is the Father of-you?”</em><em> </em> Jesus answered, <em>“You-know neither me nor the Father of-me.</em><em> </em><em>If you had-known me, you┘would└have-known the Father of-me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>These [the] words he-spoke teaching in the Treasury in the temple, and nobody arrested him because the hour of-him had┘not-yet└come.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Then he-said again to-them, <em>“I am-going-away and you-will-look-for me, and you-will-die in the sins of-you.</em><em> </em><em>Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>Then the Jews said, <em>“He-is┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└going-to-kill himself, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>is he?”</em> because he-says, <em>“Where I am-going you are┘not└able to-come.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And he-was-saying to-them, <em>“You are from the-things below; I am</em><em> from the-things above.</em><em> </em><em>You are from </em><em>this [the] world</em><em>; I am not from this [the] world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>So I-said to-you that you-will-die in the sins of-you, for if you-do┘not└believe that I am (the One), you-will-die in the sins of-you.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Then they-were-saying to-him, <em>“Who are you?”</em><em> </em> [The} Jesus said to-them, <em>“Even what I-said to you from the beginning.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>I-have many-things to-say and to-judge about you, but the-One having-sent me is true.</em><em> </em><em>And what-things I-heard from him—these-things I-say to the world.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>They-did┘not└know that he-was-speaking to-them with-respect-to-the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“When you-lift-up the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an, then you-will-know that I am, and do mothering of myself, but even-as the Father taught me—I speak these-things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>And the-One having-sent me is with me.</em><em> </em><em>He-did┘not└leave</em><em> me alone, because I always do </em><em>the-things</em><em> pleasing </em><em>to-him.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>He saying these-things, many believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus continued-on-saying to the ones-having-believed him Jews. <em>“</em><em>If you remain in[the] my [the] word, you really are disciples of-me, </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>and you-will-know the truth, and the truth will-free you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>They-responded to him, <em>“We-are Abraham’s seed and have┘never└been-enslaved to-anybody.</em><em> </em><em>How do┘you└say </em><em>[that],</em><em> “You-will-become free?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answered them, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to you that everybody the-one doing [the] sin is (a</em><em>) slave of-[the] sin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>But a/the slave does┘not└remain in the household forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>; a/the son remains forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>If then the Son makes┘you└free, you┘really└are free.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>I-know that you are seed of-Abraham, but you-are-trying-to-kill me because [the] my [the] word does┘not└have-room in you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>The-things I have-seen from the Father I-speak, and you then do what-things you-heard from the father [of-you]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>They-answered and said, “[The] father of-us is Abraham.” Jesus says to-them, <em>“If you-were children of Abraham, you-would-be-doing the works of-[the] Abraham.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>But now you-are-trying to-kill me, (a) man that has-told you the truth that I-heard from [the] God.</em><em> </em><em>This Abraham did┘not└do.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>You do the works of-the father of-you.”</em> They-said [then]<sup>ms</sup> to-him, <em>“We have┘not└been-born of sexual-immorality.</em><em> </em><em>We-have one Father—[the] God.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>[The] Jesus said to-them, <em>“If [the] God were father of-you, you┘</em><em>would└love me;</em><em> for I went-[out] from [the] God and have-come.</em><em> </em><em>For I-have┘not└come from myself, but that-One sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>On-account-of what are-you┘not└understanding [the] my [the] speech?</em><em> </em><em>Because you-are┘not└able </em><em>to-hear</em><em> [the] my [the] word?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>You are of [the] father the devil, and </em><em>you-want</em><em> to-do the desires of-the father of-you.</em><em> </em><em>That-one was (a) murderer from (the) beginning, and has┘not└stood in the truth, because truth is not in him.</em><em> </em><em>When he-tells a/the lie, he-speaks of-[the] his-own things, because he-is (a) liar and the father of it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>But because I speak the truth, you-do┘not└believe me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>Who of you shows┘me└guilty of sins?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>The-one being of [the] God hears the words of-[the] God; on-account-of this you do┘not└</em><em>hear:</em><em> </em><em>because you-are not of [the] God.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>The Jews answered and said to-him, <em>“Do-we┘not└say well that you are (a) Samaritan and have (a) demon?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>Jesus answered, <em>“I do┘not└have (a) demon, but I-do-honor the Father of-me, and you dishonor me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>And I do┘not└seek the glory of-men.</em><em> </em><em>The-One seeking and judging exists.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, if anybody keeps [the] my word, he-will</em><em>┘certainly not└</em><em>see death forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>Then the Jews said to-him, <em>“Now we-know that you-have (a) demon.</em><em> </em><em>Abraham died and the prophets, and you say, 'If anybody keeps the word of-me, he-will┘certainly not└taste of-death forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>You are not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em> greater than-the father of-us who died, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>are you? And the prophets died.</em><em> </em><em>Who </em><em>are-you-making</em><em> </em><em>yourself?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup>Jesus answered, <em>“If I glorify myself, the glory of-me is nothing; the Father of-me is the-One glorifying me, whom you-say that he-i</em><em>s (the) God of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>55</sup></strong><em>And you-do┘not└</em><em>know him, but I know</em><em> him.</em><em> </em><em>And-if</em><em> </em><em>I-say</em><em> that </em><em>I-do┘not└</em><em>know him, I-will-be (a) liar like you.</em><em> </em><em>But </em><em>I-know</em><em> him, and </em><em>I-keep</em><em> the word of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>56</sup></strong><em>Abraham the father of-you rejoiced </em><em>in-order-</em><em>that he-</em><em>might-</em><em>see [the] my [the] day, and he-saw (it) and was glad.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>Then the Jews said to him, <em>“You-do┘not-yet└have fifty years, and you-have-seen Abraham?</em>”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup>Jesus said to-them, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, I am before Abraham existed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup>Then they-picked-up stones in-order-that they-might-throw (them) at him. But Jesus was-hid and went-out from the temple.</span>
