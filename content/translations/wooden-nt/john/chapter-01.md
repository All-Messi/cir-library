## John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with [the] God, and the Word was deity/God. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>This-One was in the beginning with [the] God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>All-things came-to-be through him, and without him not-even one-thing came-to-be that has-come-to-be. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>In him was life, and the life was the light of-[the] men. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did┘not└apprehend it/put┘it└out. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>(A) man came, sent from God, name to-him (was) John. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>This-one came for (a) witness in-order-that he-might-testify about the Light, in-order-that all might-believe through him. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>That-one was not the Light, but (he came) in-order-that he-might-testify about the Light. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He-was the true [the] Light that enlightens every man coming into the world. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He-was in the world, and the world came-to-be through him, and the world did┘not└know him. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He-came into [the] his-own-things, and [the] his-own-people did┘not└receive him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But as-many-as did-receive him—he-gave to-them (the) right to-become children of-God, to-the-ones believing in the name of-him, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>who were-begotten, not out-of/by blood[s], or out-of/by (the) will/desire of-flesh, or out-of/by (the) will/desire of-(a)-husband, but out-of/by God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and we-saw the glory of-him, glory as/like (the) only-begotten-One from (the) Father, full-of grace and truth. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>John testifies about him and has-cried-out, saying, <em>“This was whom I-said, ‘The-One coming before me has-come-to-be before me, because he-was first of-me,’”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>because out-of the fullness of-him we all received—even grace in-place-of/upon grace; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>because the Law was-given through Moses; [the] grace and [the] truth came-to-be through Jesus Messiah. Nobody has-seen God at-any-time; (the) only-begotten deity/God, the-One being in the chest/arms/embrace of-the Father—that-One made-(him)-known.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And this is the testimony of-[the] John when the Jews sent [to him]<sup>ms</sup> from Jerusalem priests and Levites in-order-that they-might-ask him, <em>“Who are you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-confessed—and did┘not└deny—but confessed [that], <em>“I am not the Messiah.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>And they-asked him<em>, “What </em><em>then?</em> <em>Are you Elijah?”</em> And he-says, <em>“I-am not.”</em><em> </em> <em>“Are you the prophet?”</em><em> </em> And he-answered, <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then they-said to-him, <em>“Who are you?</em><em> </em><em>In-order-that we-may-give (an) answer </em><em>to-the-ones</em><em> </em><em>having-sent</em><em> us</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>What do-you-say about yourself?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He-said, <strong><em>“</em></strong><em>I (am </em><em>the)</em><strong><em> voice of-one-crying-out in the</em></strong><strong><em> wilderness, ‘Make-straight the </em></strong><strong><em>way of-(the)-Lord,’”</em></strong><em> as Isaiah the prophet said.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And they-were sent from/by the Pharisees. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>And they-asked him and said to-him, <em>“Why then are┘you└baptizing if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>[The] John answered them, saying<em>, “I </em><em>am-baptizing</em><em> in/with water; in-the-midst-of you stands/has-stood whom you do┘not└know.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>The-One coming after me, of-whom [I]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> am not worth</em><em>y</em><em> in-order-that I-might undo the strap of-the sandal of-him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> These-things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where [the] John was baptizing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>On-the next-day he-sees [the] Jesus coming to him, and says, <em>“Behold, the Lamb of</em><em>-</em><em>[the] God, the-One taking-away the sin of-the world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>This is about whom I said, </em><em>‘</em><em>After me (a) man is-coming who has-come-to-be before me, because he-was first of-me.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>And-I did┘not└know him, but in-order-that he-might-be-manifested to-[the] Israel—on-account-of this I came baptizing in/with water.”</em> <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>And John testified, saying [that], <em>“I-have-seen the Spirit descending like/as (a) dove out-of </em><em>(the) sky</em><em> and remained on him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>And-I did┘not└know him, but the-One having-sent me to-baptize in/w</em><em>ith water—that-One said to-me, ‘</em><em>On whomever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you see the Spirit descending and remaining on him—</em><em>this-O</em><em>ne is the-One baptizing in/with (the) Ho</em><em>l</em><em>y Spirit</em><em>.</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>And-I have-seen and have-testified that this is the Son of-[the] God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>On-the next-day again [the] John stood/had-stood and two of the disciples of-him, and <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>having-looked-on [the] Jesus walking, says, <em>“Behold, the Lamb of</em><em>-</em><em>[the] God!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the two disciples heard him speaking and followed [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-turned and having-seen them following, says to-them, <em>“What are-you-looking for?”</em> And they said to-him, <em>“Rabbi, </em>[which, being-translated, means ‘Teacher’]<em>,</em><em> </em><em>where are-you-staying?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He-says to-them, <em>“Come and you-will-see.”</em> So they-went and saw where he-was-staying, and they-stayed with him that [the] day. It was about (the) tenth hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Andrew, the brother of-Simon Peter, was one of the two [the] having-heard from John and having-followed him. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>This-one first finds his [the] brother Simon and says to-him, <em>“We-have-found the Messiah </em>[which is translated ‘Christ’]<em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> He-brought/led him to [the] Jesus. [The] Jesus, having-looked-at him, said, <em>“You are Simon</em><em>,</em><em> the son of-John.</em><em> </em><em>You will-be-called ‘Cephas’ </em>[which is-translated ‘Peter’]<em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>On-the next-day he-wanted to-go-out into [the] Galilee, and he-finds Philip, and [the] Jesus says to-him, <em>“Follow me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And [the] Philip was from Bethsaida, out-of the city of-Andrew and Peter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Philip finds [the] Nathaniel and says to-him, <em>“We-have-found whom Moses in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw and the prophets (wrote), Jesus, son of-[the] Joseph</em><em>,</em><em> [the] from Nazareth.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And Nathaniel said to-him, <em>“</em><em>Is┘anything good└able to-come out-of Nazareth?”</em> [The] Philip says to-him, <em>“Come and see.”</em> <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>[The] Jesus saw [the] Nathaniel coming to him, and says about him, <em>“Behold, truly (an) Israelite in whom deceit is not.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Nathaniel says to-him, <em>“Whence do-you-know me?”</em> Jesus answered and said to-him, <em>“Before Philip’s [the] calling you being under the fig-tree, I-saw you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Nathaniel answered him, <em>“Rabbi, you are the Son of-[the] God!</em><em> </em><em>You are king of-[the] Israel!”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus answered and said to-him, <em>“Because I-said to-you</em><em><sup>sg</sup></em><em> that I-saw you under the fig-tree</em><em>, you believe?</em><em> </em><em>You-will-see greater-things than-these.”</em> <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And he-says to-him, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>, ‘You-will-see the sky</em><em>/heaven</em><em> open and the angels of-[the] God ascending and descending on the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an.’”</em></span>
