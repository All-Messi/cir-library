## John Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with [the] God, and the Word was deity/God. 2This-One was in the beginning with [the] God. 3All-things came-to-be through him, and without him not-even one-thing came-to-be that has-come-to-be. 4In him was life, and the life was the light of-[the] men. 5And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did┘not└apprehend it/put┘it└out. 6(A) man came, sent from God, name to-him (was) John. 7This-one came for (a) witness in-order-that he-might-testify about the Light, in-order-that all might-believe through him. 8That-one was not the Light, but (he came) in-order-that he-might-testify about the Light. 9He-was the true [the] Light that enlightens every man coming into the world. 10He-was in the world, and the world came-to-be through him, and the world did┘not└know him. 11He-came into [the] his-own-things, and [the] his-own-people did┘not└receive him. 12But as-many-as did-receive him—he-gave to-them (the) right to-become children of-God, to-the-ones believing in the name of-him, 13who were-begotten, not out-of/by blood[s], or out-of/by (the) will/desire of-flesh, or out-of/by (the) will/desire of-(a)-husband, but out-of/by God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and we-saw the glory of-him, glory as/like (the) only-begotten-One from (the) Father, full-of grace and truth. 15John testifies about him and has-cried-out, saying, "This was whom I-said, 'The-One coming before me has-come-to-be before me, because he-was first of-me,'" 16because out-of the fullness of-him we all received—even grace in-place-of/upon grace; 17because the Law was-given through Moses; [the] grace and [the] truth came-to-be through Jesus Messiah. Nobody has-seen God at-any-time; (the) only-begotten deity/God, the-One being in the chest/arms/embrace of-the Father—that-One made-(him)-known.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> And this is the testimony of-[the] John when the Jews sent [to him]ms from Jerusalem priests and Levites in-order-that they-might-ask him, "Who are you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> And he-confessed—and did┘not└deny—but confessed [that], "I am not the Messiah." 21And they-asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then they-said to-him, "Who are you? In-order-that we-may-give (an) answer to-the-ones having-sent us. What do-you-say about yourself?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He-said, "I (am the) voice of-one-crying-out in the wilderness, 'Make-straight the way of-(the)-Lord,'" as Isaiah the prophet said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> And they-were sent from/by the Pharisees. 25And they-asked him and said to-him, "Why then are┘you└baptizing if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet?" 26[The] John answered them, saying, "I am-baptizing in/with water; in-the-midst-of you stands/has-stood whom you do┘not└know. 27The-One coming after me, of-whom [I]ms am not worthy in-order-that I-might undo the strap of-the sandal of-him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> These-things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where [the] John was baptizing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> On-the next-day he-sees [the] Jesus coming to him, and says, "Behold, the Lamb of-[the] God, the-One taking-away the sin of-the world. 30This is about whom I said, 'After me (a) man is-coming who has-come-to-be before me, because he-was first of-me.' 31And-I did┘not└know him, but in-order-that he-might-be-manifested to-[the] Israel—on-account-of this I came baptizing in/with water." 32And John testified, saying [that], "I-have-seen the Spirit descending like/as (a) dove out-of (the) sky and remained on him. 33And-I did┘not└know him, but the-One having-sent me to-baptize in/with water—that-One said to-me, 'On whomever2 you see the Spirit descending and remaining on him—this-One is the-One baptizing in/with (the) Holy Spirit.' 34And-I have-seen and have-testified that this is the Son of-[the] God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> On-the next-day again [the] John stood/had-stood and two of the disciples of-him, and 36having-looked-on [the] Jesus walking, says, "Behold, the Lamb of-[the] God!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And the two disciples heard him speaking and followed [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-turned and having-seen them following, says to-them, "What are-you-looking for?" And they said to-him, "Rabbi, [which, being-translated, means 'Teacher'], where are-you-staying?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He-says to-them, "Come and you-will-see." So they-went and saw where he-was-staying, and they-stayed with him that [the] day. It was about (the) tenth hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Andrew, the brother of-Simon Peter, was one of the two [the] having-heard from John and having-followed him. 41This-one first finds his [the] brother Simon and says to-him, "We-have-found the Messiah [which is translated 'Christ']."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> He-brought/led him to [the] Jesus. [The] Jesus, having-looked-at him, said, "You are Simon, the son of-John. You will-be-called 'Cephas' [which is-translated 'Peter']."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> On-the next-day he-wanted to-go-out into [the] Galilee, and he-finds Philip, and [the] Jesus says to-him, "Follow me." 44And [the] Philip was from Bethsaida, out-of the city of-Andrew and Peter.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Philip finds [the] Nathaniel and says to-him, "We-have-found whom Moses in the Law and the prophets (wrote), Jesus, son of-[the] Joseph, [the] from Nazareth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> And Nathaniel said to-him, "Is┘anything good└able to-come out-of Nazareth?" 47[The] Jesus saw [the] Nathaniel coming to him, and says about him, "Behold, truly (an) Israelite in whom deceit is not."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Nathaniel says to-him, "Whence do-you-know me?" Jesus answered and said to-him, "Before Philip's [the] calling you being under the fig-tree, I-saw you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> Nathaniel answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of-[the] God! You are king of-[the] Israel!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus answered and said to-him, "Because I-said to-yousg that I-saw you under the fig-tree, you believe? You-will-see greater-things than-these." 51And he-says to-him, "Truly, truly, I-say to-youpl, 'You-will-see the sky/heaven open and the angels of-[the] God ascending and descending on the Son of-[the] Man.'"</span>
