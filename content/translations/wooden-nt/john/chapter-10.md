## John Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, the-one not coming through the gate into the coral of-the sheep</em><em>, but coming-over by-</em><em>another-way—that-one is (a) thief and (a) robber.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>But the-one coming through the gate is the shepherd of-the sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The gatekeeper opens to-this-one, and the sheep </em><em>recognize</em><em> the voice of-him, and he-calls [the] his-own sheep by name, and they-follow him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>When he-gets┘[the] all his-own└out, he-goes in-front-of</em><em> them, and the sheep follow him</em><em> because they recognize the voice of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And they-will┘certainly not└follow (a) stranger, but they-will-flee from him, because they-do┘not└recognize the voice of-[the] strangers.</em><em>”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>[The] Jesus told this [the] illustration, but those-ones did┘not└understand what it-was that he-was-saying to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then [the] Jesus said, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you that I am the door of-the sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>All as-many-as came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did┘not└recognize them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I am the door; if anybody enters through </em><em>me</em><em> he-will-be-safe, and he-will-go-in and will-go-out and will-find pasture.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The/A thief does┘only└come except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> in-order-that he-might-slaughter and destroy.</em><em> </em><em>I came in-order-that they-might-have life and have (it) more-abundantly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>I am the good [the] shepherd.</em><em> </em><em>The/A good [the] shepherd risks the life of-him for the sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>The hired-hand also, not being (a) shepherd, whose [the] sheep they-are not his-own, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees—and the wolf </em><em>seizes them and scatters (them)—</em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>because he-is (a) hired-hand, and it-is┘not└(a)-care about the sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I am the/a good [the] shepherd</em><em>,</em><em> and </em><em>I-know</em><em> [the] my (sheep) and [the] my [the] </em><em>(sheep) know me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>As the Father knows me, I-also know the Father, and I </em><em>lay-down</em><em> the life of-me for the sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>And I-have other sheep that are not of [the] this fold.</em><em> </em><em>It-is-necessary</em><em> </em><em>for-me</em><em> </em><em>to-lead</em><em> </em><em>them-too</em><em>, and </em><em>they-will-hear</em><em> the voice </em><em>of-me</em><em>, and </em><em>they-will-become</em><em> one flock, one shepherd.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>On-acco</em><em>unt-of</em><em> this the Father loves me,</em><em> because I-lay-down the life of-me in-order-that I-may-take┘it└up again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Nobody takes it from me, but I </em><em>lay┘it└</em><em>down of myself.</em><em> </em><em>I-have (the) right to-lay┘it└down, and I-have (the) right to-take it again.</em><em> </em><em>I-received this commandment </em><em>from the Father of-me</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Again (a) division arose among the Jews on-account-of these [the] words. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>On-the-one-hand, many of them were saying, <em>“He-has (a) demon and is crazy.</em><em> </em><em>Why are-you-listening-to him?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Others were-saying, <em>“These are not the words of-(a)-demon-possessed-one.</em><em> </em><em>(A) demoniac is┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└able to-open (the) eyes of-blind-ones, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>is-he?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then was the Feast of Dedication in [the] Jerusalem. It was winter-time. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus was-walking in the temple in the Porch of-[the] Solomon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then the Jews encircled him, and said to-him, <em>“Until when are-you taking-up the soul of-us?</em><em> </em><em>If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answered them, <em>“I-told you and you-do┘not└believe.</em><em> </em><em>The works that I do in the name of-the Father of-me—these testify about me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But you do┘not└believe because </em><em>you-are</em><em> not of [the] my [the] sheep.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>[The] my [the] sheep hear the voice of-me, and-I know them and they-follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>And-I give them eternal life, and they-will┘certainly not└perish forever</em><strong><em><sup>3</sup></em></strong><em>, and somebody will┘not└snatch them out-of the hand of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>The Father of-me who has-given (them) to-me is greater than-all, and nobody is-able to-snatch (them) out-of the hand of-the Father.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>I and the Father are one.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Again the Jews picked-up stones in-order-that they-might-stone him. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>[The] Jesus responded to-them, <em>“I-showed you many good works from the Father.</em><em> </em><em>On-account-of whic</em><em>h work of-them are-you-ready-to</em><em>-stone me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Jews answered him, <em>“We-are┘not└ready-to-stone you about (a)</em><em> good work, but about blasphemy;</em><em> and because, being (a) man, you-make yourself God.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answered them, <em>“Is-it not written in the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-you [that], </em><strong><em>‘I said, you-are </em></strong><strong><em>gods’</em></strong><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>If he called them </em><em>‘</em><em>gods</em><em>’</em><em> to whom the word of-God came—and scripture is</em><em>┘not└</em><em>able to-be-broken, </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>do</em><em>┘you└</em><em>say regarding-him-whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, “</em><em>You-are-</em><em>blaspheming</em><em>” because I-said, “I-am [the] God’s Son”?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>If I-am┘not└doing the works of-the Father of-me, do┘not└believe me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>If I-am-doing (them), even-if you-do┘not└believe me, believe the works, in-order-that you-may-know and understand that the Father (is) in me and-I (am) in the Father.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Then they-tried to-arrest him again, and he-went-away out-of the hand of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And again he-went-away beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at-the first, and stayed there. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And many came to him and were-saying [that], <em>“</em><em>John, o</em><em>n-the-one-hand</em><em>, did no</em><em> sign, but all-things as-many-as John said about this-One were true.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And many believed in him there.</span>
