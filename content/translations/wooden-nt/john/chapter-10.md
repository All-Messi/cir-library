## John Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Truly, truly, I-say to-you, the-one not coming through the gate into the coral of-the sheep, but coming-over by-another-way—that-one is (a) thief and (a) robber. 2But the-one coming through the gate is the shepherd of-the sheep. 3The gatekeeper opens to-this-one, and the sheep recognize the voice of-him, and he-calls [the] his-own sheep by name, and they-follow him. 4When he-gets┘[the] all his-own└out, he-goes in-front-of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize the voice of-him. 5And they-will┘certainly not└follow (a) stranger, but they-will-flee from him, because they-do┘not└recognize the voice of-[the] strangers." 6[The] Jesus told this [the] illustration, but those-ones did┘not└understand what it-was that he-was-saying to-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then [the] Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I-say to-you that I am the door of-the sheep. 8All as-many-as came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did┘not└recognize them. 9I am the door; if anybody enters through me he-will-be-safe, and he-will-go-in and will-go-out and will-find pasture. 10The/A thief does┘only└come except2 in-order-that he-might-slaughter and destroy. I came in-order-that they-might-have life and have (it) more-abundantly. 11I am the good [the] shepherd. The/A good [the] shepherd risks the life of-him for the sheep. 12The hired-hand also, not being (a) shepherd, whose [the] sheep they-are not his-own, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees—and the wolf seizes them and scatters (them)—13because he-is (a) hired-hand, and it-is┘not└(a)-care about the sheep. 14I am the/a good [the] shepherd, and I-know [the] my (sheep) and [the] my [the] (sheep) know me. 15As the Father knows me, I-also know the Father, and I lay-down the life of-me for the sheep. 16And I-have other sheep that are not of [the] this fold. It-is-necessary for-me to-lead them-too, and they-will-hear the voice of-me, and they-will-become one flock, one shepherd. 17On-account-of this the Father loves me, because I-lay-down the life of-me in-order-that I-may-take┘it└up again. 18Nobody takes it from me, but I lay┘it└down of myself. I-have (the) right to-lay┘it└down, and I-have (the) right to-take it again. I-received this commandment from the Father of-me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Again (a) division arose among the Jews on-account-of these [the] words. 20On-the-one-hand, many of them were saying, "He-has (a) demon and is crazy. Why are-you-listening-to him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Others were-saying, "These are not the words of-(a)-demon-possessed-one. (A) demoniac is┘not┘┘└able to-open (the) eyes of-blind-ones, └└is-he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Then was the Feast of Dedication in [the] Jerusalem. It was winter-time. 23And [the] Jesus was-walking in the temple in the Porch of-[the] Solomon.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then the Jews encircled him, and said to-him, "Until when are-you taking-up the soul of-us? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly." 25[The] Jesus answered them, "I-told you and you-do┘not└believe. The works that I do in the name of-the Father of-me—these testify about me. 26But you do┘not└believe because you-are not of [the] my [the] sheep. 27[The] my [the] sheep hear the voice of-me, and-I know them and they-follow me. 28And-I give them eternal life, and they-will┘certainly not└perish forever3, and somebody will┘not└snatch them out-of the hand of-me. 29The Father of-me who has-given (them) to-me is greater than-all, and nobody is-able to-snatch (them) out-of the hand of-the Father. 30I and the Father are one."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Again the Jews picked-up stones in-order-that they-might-stone him. 32[The] Jesus responded to-them, "I-showed you many good works from the Father. On-account-of which work of-them are-you-ready-to-stone me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The Jews answered him, "We-are┘not└ready-to-stone you about (a) good work, but about blasphemy; and because, being (a) man, you-make yourself God." 34[The] Jesus answered them, "Is-it not written in the Law of-you [that], 'I said, you-are gods'? 35If he called them 'gods' to whom the word of-God came—and scripture is┘not└able to-be-broken, 36do┘you└say regarding-him-whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, "You-are-blaspheming" because I-said, "I-am [the] God's Son"? 37If I-am┘not└doing the works of-the Father of-me, do┘not└believe me. 38If I-am-doing (them), even-if you-do┘not└believe me, believe the works, in-order-that you-may-know and understand that the Father (is) in me and-I (am) in the Father."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Then they-tried to-arrest him again, and he-went-away out-of the hand of-them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> And again he-went-away beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at-the first, and stayed there. 41And many came to him and were-saying [that], "John, on-the-one-hand, did no sign, but all-things as-many-as John said about this-One were true." 42And many believed in him there.</span>
