## John Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I-have-spoken these-things to-you in-order-that you-might┘not└be-made-to-stumble. 2They-will-make you excommunicants, but (the) hour is-coming in-order-that everybody the-one having-killed you will-suppose (himself) to-be-serving [the] God, 3they-will-do these-things because they-did┘not└know the Father nor me. 4But I-have-spoken these-things to-you in-order-that when the hour of-them comes, you-may-remember them that I said to-you. "And these-things I-did┘not└tell you from (the) beginning because I-was with you. 5But now I-am-going to the-One having-sent me, and nobody of you is-asking me, 'Where are-you-going?" 6But because I-have spoken these-things to-you [the] sorrow has-filled the heart of-you. 7But I am-speaking the truth to-you, it-is-beneficial to-you in-order-that I go-away. For if I do┘not└go-away, the Comforter will┘not└be-coming to you. But if I-go, I-will-send him to you, 8and having-come, that-One will-convict the world about sins and about righteousness and about judgment—9about sins, on-the-one-hand, because they-do┘not└believe in me; 10about righteousness, on-the-other-hand, because I-am-going to the Father and no-longer do-you-see me; 11about judgment, on-the-one-hand, because the ruler of-[the] this world has-been-judged. 12"Yet many-things I-have to-say to-you, but you-are┘not└able to-bear (them) now. 13But when that-One comes—the Spirit of-[the] truth, he-will-lead you in all the/[the] truth. For he-will┘not└speak from himself, but as-many-things-as he-will-hear he-will-speak, and he-will-announce to-you the-things coming. 14That-one will-glorify me, because he-will-take from [the] my [thing] and announce to-you. 15All-things as-many-as the Father has are mine; on-account-of this-thing I-say that he-takes from the my (thing) and will-announce (it) to-you. 16"(A) little (time) and no-longer do-you-see me, and again (a) little (time) and you-will-see me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Therefore they┘of-the disciples of-him└said to one-another, "What is this-thing that he-says to us, '(A) little (while) and you-do┘not└see me,' and, 'Because I-am-going to the Father'?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So they-kept-saying, "What is this [that-is-saying]ms '(a) little (while)? We-do┘not└know what he-is-saying." "About this-thing are-you-seeking with one-another that I-said, 20Truly, truly, I-say to you that you will-weep and mourn, but the world will-rejoice. You-will-be-grieved, but the grief of-you will-become [for] joy. 21The/A woman when she-bears (a child) has pain, because the hour of-her came. But when she-bears the little-child, no-longer does-she-remember the tribulation on-account-of the joy because (a) man was-born into the world. 22And you therefore now, on-the-one-hand, have sorrow; on-the-other-hand, again I-will-see you, and the heart of-you will-rejoice, and nobody takes/will-takems the joy of-you from you. 23And in [the] that day you-will┘not└ask me anything. Truly, truly, I-say to-you, whatever2 you-ask the Father in the name of-me, he-will-give (it) to-you. 24Until now you-did┘not└ask anything in the name of-me. Ask and you-will-receive in-order-that they joy of-you may-be full. 25"These-things I-have-spoken to-you in figures. (The) hour is-coming when I-will┘no-longer└speak to-you in figures, but boldly about the Father I-will-announce to-you. 26In that [the] day in the name of-me you-will-ask, and I-do┘not└say to-you that I will-ask the Father about you. 27For the Father himself loves you, because you have-loved me and have-believed that I came-out from the Father. 28I-went-out from the Father, and I-have-come into the world. Again I-am-leaving the world and I-am-going to the Father."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> The disciples of-him say, "Behold, now in plainness you-are-speaking and saying no figure. 30Now we-know that you-know all-things and do┘not└have need in-order-that anybody should-ask you. By this we-believe that you-came-out from God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jesus answered them, "Now you-believe. 32Behold, (the) hour is-coming and has-come in-order-that you-will┘each└seek [for the] your-own-things and┘leave└me alone. And I-am not alone, because the Father is with me. 33These-things I-have-spoken to-you in-order-that in me you-may-have peace. In the world you-have tribulation; but take-courage! I have-overcome the world."</span>
