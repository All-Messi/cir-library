## John Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Ofter these-things [the] Jesus again showed himself to-the disciples at the Sea of-[the] Tiberias. And he-appeared thus. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Together were Simon Peter and Thomas, the-one called Didymus, and Nathanael [the] from Cana of-[the] Galilee, and the (sons) of-[the] Zebedee, and two others of the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Simon Peter says to-them, <em>“I-am-going to-fish.”</em> They-say to-him, <em>“We </em><em>are-going</em><em> with you.”</em> They-went-out and got into the boat, and in that [the] night they-caught nothing. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Now already morning having-come, Jesus stood on the shore; however, the disciples did┘not└ know that it-was Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“Children, you-do</em><em>┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└ </em><em>have any fish,</em><em> </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>do-you?”</em><em> </em> They-answered him, <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And the [Jesus] said to-them, <em>“Cast the net on the right parts of-the boat, and you-will-find (some).”</em><em> </em><em> </em> So they-cast, and no-more were-they-strong-enough to-haul-(it)-in from the multitude of-[the] fish. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then that [the] disciple whom [the] Jesus loved says to-[the] Peter, <em>“It-is the Lord.”</em> Then Simon Peter, having-heard that it-was the Lord, put-on the/his coat, for he-was undressed, and cast himself into the sea. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And the other disciples came by-the boat, for they-were not far from [the] land, but about<sup>2</sup> two-hundred cubits, dragging the net of-[the] fish. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then when they-got-out onto the land, they-see (a) charcoal-fire laid and fish lying (on it) and (a) loaf. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says to-them, <em>“Bring of the fish that you-caught just-now.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>So Simon Peter went-up and drew the net onto the land full-</span>

### large fish, and, so-many being, the net did┘not└ rip. 12[The] Jesus says to-them, “Come, break-fast.”  And nobody of-the disciples was-daring to-ask him, “Who are you?” knowing that it-was the Lord. 13Jesus comes and brings the loaf and gives to-them, and the fish likewise. 14Already this third-(time) Jesus appeared to-the disciples, having-been-raised from (the) dead.


<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then when they-broke-fast, [the] Jesus says to-[the] Simon Peter, <em>“Simon, (son) of-John, do-you-love me more </em><em>than-these/than-than-these-(do)</em><em>?”</em><em> </em> He-says to-him, <em>“Yes, Lord; you know that I-love you.”</em> He-says to-him, <em>“Feed the lambs of-me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>He-says to-him again (a) second-(time), <em>“Simon (son) of-John, do-you-love me?</em><em>”</em><em> </em> He-says to-him, <em>“Yes, Lord; you know that I-love you.”</em><em> </em> He-says to-him, <em>“Shepherd the sheep of-me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He-says to-him the third-(time), <em>“Simon, (son) of-John, “Do-you-love me?”</em> [The] Peter was-grieved that he-said to-him the third-(time), <em>“Do-you-love me?”</em> And he-says to-him, <em>“Lord, you know all-things.</em><em> </em><em>You know that I-love you.”</em> [[The] Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> says to-him, <em>“Feed the sheep</em><em> of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly, </em><em>I-say</em><em> too-you, when you-were younger, you-would-dress yourself and would-walk-around wherever you-were-wanting.</em><em> </em><em>But when you-are-old, you-will-stretch-out the hands of-you, and another will-dress you and carry (you) wherever you-do┘not└ want.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Now he-said this, signifying by-what-kind-of death he-would-glorify [the] God. And having-said this, he-says to-him, <em>“Follow me.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>[The] Peter, having-turned, sees the disciple whom [the] Jesus loved following, who also leaned on the chest of-him at the dinner, and said, <em>“Lord, who is the-one betraying you?”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Then [the] Peter having-seen this-one, says to-[the] Jesus, <em>“And what is this-one?”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“If I-will him to-remain till I-come, what (is that) to you?</em><em> </em><em>You follow me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Then this [the] word went-out into the brothers that that [the] disciple does┘not└ die. But [the] Jesus did┘not└ say to-him that he-does┘not└ die, but, <em>“If I-will him to-remain till I-come, [what (is that) to you?]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>This is the disciple the-one testifying about these-things and the-one having-written these-things, and we-know that the testimony of-him is true. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Now many other-things also are that [the] Jesus did that, if they-were-written every one, I-suppose not-even the world itself would-hold the written books.
