## John Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Ofter these-things [the] Jesus again showed himself to-the disciples at the Sea of-[the] Tiberias. And he-appeared thus. 2Together were Simon Peter and Thomas, the-one called Didymus, and Nathanael [the] from Cana of-[the] Galilee, and the (sons) of-[the] Zebedee, and two others of the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Simon Peter says to-them, "I-am-going to-fish." They-went-out and got into the boat, and in that [the] night they-caught nothing. 4Now already morning having-come, Jesus stood on the shore; however, the disciples did┘not└ know that it-was Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then [the] Jesus says to-them, "Children, you-do┘not┘┘└ have any fish, └└ do-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And the [Jesus] said to-them, "Cast the net on the right parts of-the boat, and you-will-find (some)." So they-cast, and no-more were-they-strong-enough to-haul-(it)-in from the multitude of-[the] fish. 7Then that [the] disciple whom [the] Jesus loved says to-[the] Peter, "It-is the Lord." Then Simon Peter, having-heard that it-was the Lord, put-on the/his coat, for he-was undressed, and cast himself into the sea. 8And the other disciples came by-the boat, for they-were not far from [the] land, but about2 two-hundred cubits, dragging the net of-[the] fish. 9Then when they-got-out onto the land, they-see (a) charcoal-fire laid and fish lying (on it) and (a) loaf.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So Simon Peter went-up and drew the net onto the land full-of 153 large fish, and, so-many being, the net did┘not└ rip. And nobody of-the disciples was-daring to-ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it-was the Lord. 13Jesus comes and brings the loaf and gives to-them, and the fish likewise. 14Already this third-(time) Jesus appeared to-the disciples, having-been-raised from (the) dead.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then when they-broke-fast, [the] Jesus says to-[the] Simon Peter, "Simon, (son) of-John, do-you-love me more than-these/than-than-these-(do)?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He-says to-him again (a) second-(time), "Simon (son) of-John, do-you-love me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He-says to-him the third-(time), "Simon, (son) of-John, "Do-you-love me?" [The] Peter was-grieved that he-said to-him the third-(time), "Do-you-love me?" And he-says to-him, "Lord, you know all-things. You know that I-love you." [[The] Jesus]ms says to-him, "Feed the sheep of-me. 18Truly, truly, I-say too-you, when you-were younger, you-would-dress yourself and would-walk-around wherever you-were-wanting. But when you-are-old, you-will-stretch-out the hands of-you, and another will-dress you and carry (you) wherever you-do┘not└ want."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Now he-said this, signifying by-what-kind-of death he-would-glorify [the] God. And having-said this, he-says to-him, "Follow me." 20[The] Peter, having-turned, sees the disciple whom [the] Jesus loved following, who also leaned on the chest of-him at the dinner, and said, "Lord, who is the-one betraying you?" 21Then [the] Peter having-seen this-one, says to-[the] Jesus, "And what is this-one?" 22[The] Jesus says to-him, "If I-will him to-remain till I-come, what (is that) to you? You follow me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Then this [the] word went-out into the brothers that that [the] disciple does┘not└ die. But [the] Jesus did┘not└ say to-him that he-does┘not└ die, but, "If I-will him to-remain till I-come, [what (is that) to you?]ms."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> This is the disciple the-one testifying about these-things and the-one having-written these-things, and we-know that the testimony of-him is true. 25Now many other-things also are that [the] Jesus did that, if they-were-written every one, I-suppose not-even the world itself would-hold the written books.</span>
