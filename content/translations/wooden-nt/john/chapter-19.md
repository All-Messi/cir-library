## John Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So then [the] Pilate took [the] Jesus and scourged (him). <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the soldiers, having-woven (a) crown out-of thorns, put┘(it)└on the head of-him, and put┘(a) purple robe└on him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And they-began-coming-up to him and saying, <em>“Hail, [the] king of-the Jews.”</em> And they-were-giving him slaps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Pilate went out and says to-them, <em>“Look; I-am-leading him out to-you in-order-that you-may-know that I-find no </em><em>fault</em><em> in him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So [the] Jesus came out wearing the thorn crown and the purple robe, and he-says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Behold, the man!</em><em>” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they-began-to-shout, saying, <em>“</em><em>Crucify (him)!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify (him)!</em><em>”</em> [The] Pilate says to-them, <em>“You take him and crucify (him), for I do┘not└find (a) </em><em>fault</em><em> in him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Jews answered him, <em>“We have (a) law, and according-to the law he-ought to-die, because he-made himself (the) Son of-God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then when [the] Pilate heard this [the] word, he-became┘more└fearful. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And he-went into the Praetorium again and says to-[the] Jesus, <em>“Where┘are you└from?”</em><em> </em> And [the] Jesus did┘not└give him (an) answer.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then [the] Pilate says to-him, <em>“You-are┘not└talking to-me?</em><em> </em><em>Do-you┘not└know that I-have authority to-release you, and I-have authority to crucify you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus answered [him]<sup>ms</sup>, <em>“You-would┘not└have any authority over me except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> it-was</em><em> given to-you from above.</em><em> </em><em>On-acc</em><em>ount-of this the-</em><em>one betraying me to-you </em><em>has</em><em> greater sin.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From this [the] Pilate was-seeking to-release him. But the Jews began-to-shout, saying, <em>“If you-release this-(man), you-are not (a) </em><em>friend of-</em><em>[the] Caesar.</em><em> </em><em>Everybody [the]</em><em> making himself king speaks-against [the] Caesar.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So [the] Pilate, having-heard these [the] words, led [the] Jesus outside and sat on (the) judgment-seat in (a) place called Pavement, but in-Hebrew Gabbatha. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And it-was Preparation of-the Passover; it-was about (the) sixth hour. And he-says to-the Jews, <em>“Behold, the king of-you!”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then they shouted, <em>“Take┘(him)└away!</em><em> </em><em>Take┘</em><em>(him)└away!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify him!</em><em>”</em> [The] Pilate says to-them, <em>“Am-I-going-to-crucify the king of-you?”</em><em> </em> The chief priests answered, <em>“We-do┘not└have (a) king except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> Caesar.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So then he-delivered him to-them in-order-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So they-took Jesus, and, carrying the cross for-himself, he-went out into the (place) called Place of the Skull, which is-called in-Hebrew ‘Golgotha,’ <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>where they-crucified him, and with him too others on each side and [the] Jesus between. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And [the] Pilate also wrote (a) title and put (it) on the cross. And it-was written, <em>“Jesus the Nazarene, the king of-the Jews.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>So many of-the Jews read this [the] title because the place was near the city where [the] Jesus was-crucified. And it-was written in-Hebrew, in-Latin, (and) in-Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So the chief priests of-the Jews began-to-say to-[the] Pilate, <em>“Do┘not└write, ‘The king of-the Jews,’ but that that-one said, ‘I-am king of-the Jews.’”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[The] Pilate answered, <em>“What I-have written I-have-written.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the soldiers, when they-crucified [the] Jesus, they-took the clothes of-him and made four parts, (a) part to-each soldier, plus the cloak. And the coat was seamless, woven from the above through (the) whole. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So they-said to one-another, <em>“Let-us┘not└tear it, but let-us-cast-lots for it whose it-will-be</em><em>”</em>; in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, [the] saying, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>T</em></strong><strong><em>hey-divided</em></strong><strong><em> the clothes of-me for themselves</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd on the clothing of-me they-cast lot(s).”</em></strong> So the soldiers did these-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the mother of-him and the sister of-the mother of-him, Mary the (wife) of-[the] Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene had-been-standing by the cross of-Jesus. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>Then Jesus, seeing the mother and the disciple standing-by that he loved, says to-the/his mother, <em>“Behold, the son </em><em>of-you.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Then he-says to-the disciple, <em>“Behold, the mother of-you.”</em> And from that [the] hour the disciple took her into [the] his-own-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>After this, [the] Jesus, having-seen that all-things already had-been-finished in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, says, <em>“I-thirst.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong>(A) vessel was-sitting full-of sour-wine. Then having-wrapped┘(a) sponge full-of the sour-wine└around (a) hyssop, they-brought (it) to-the mouth (of him). <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Then when he-took the sour-wine, [the] Jesus said, <em>“It-is-finished”</em>; and having-bowed-down the/his head, he-gave-up the spirit/breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then the Jews, because it-was Preparation, in-order-that the bodies might┘not└remain on the cross on the Sabbath—for the day of-that [the] Sabbath was great—asked [the] Pilate [in-order]-that the legs of-them might-be-broken and they-would-be-taken-(down). <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of-the first and of-the other [the] having-been-crucified-with him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>But, having-come to [the] Jesus, when they-saw him already having-died, they-did┘not└break the legs of-him. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>But one of-the soldiers with-(the)-spear of-him pierced the/his side, and immediately blood and water came-out. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>And the-one having-seen has-testified, and the testimony of-him is true, and that-one knows that he-says true-things in-order-that you may-believe. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>For these-things came-to-be in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, <strong><em>“(A) bone of-him will┘not└ be-broken.”</em></strong><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And again another scripture says, <strong><em>“They-will-look at whom they-pierced.”</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>And after these-things Joseph [the]<sup> </sup><sup>ms</sup> from Arimathea, being (a) disciple of-[the] Jesus, but having-been-secretly on-account-of the fear of-the Jews, asked [in-order]-that he-might-take the body of-[the] Jesus. Then he-came and took the body of-him. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And also Nicodemus came, the-one having-come to him during-(the)-night at-the first, bringing (a) mixture of-myrrh and aloes about (a) hundred Roman-pounds. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>So they-took the body of-[the] Jesus and bound it with-linen-cloths with the aromatic-spices, as is (the) custom of-the Jews to-bury. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And in the place where he-was-crucified (a) garden was, and in the garden (was a) new tomb in which not-yet was anybody buried. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>There then on-account-of the Preparation of-the Jews, because the tomb was nearby, they-placed [the] Jesus.</span>
