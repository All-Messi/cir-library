## John Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So then [the] Pilate took [the] Jesus and scourged (him). 2And the soldiers, having-woven (a) crown out-of thorns, put┘(it)└on the head of-him, and put┘(a) purple robe└on him. 3And they-began-coming-up to him and saying, "Hail, [the] king of-the Jews." And they-were-giving him slaps.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Pilate went out and says to-them, "Look; I-am-leading him out to-you in-order-that you-may-know that I-find no fault in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So [the] Jesus came out wearing the thorn crown and the purple robe, and he-says to-them, "Behold, the man!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they-began-to-shout, saying, "Crucify (him)! Crucify (him)!" [The] Pilate says to-them, "You take him and crucify (him), for I do┘not└find (a) fault in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The Jews answered him, "We have (a) law, and according-to the law he-ought to-die, because he-made himself (the) Son of-God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Then when [the] Pilate heard this [the] word, he-became┘more└fearful. 9And he-went into the Praetorium again and says to-[the] Jesus, "Where┘are you└from?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then [the] Pilate says to-him, "You-are┘not└talking to-me? Do-you┘not└know that I-have authority to-release you, and I-have authority to crucify you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus answered [him]ms, "You-would┘not└have any authority over me except2 it-was given to-you from above. On-account-of this the-one betraying me to-you has greater sin."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> From this [the] Pilate was-seeking to-release him. But the Jews began-to-shout, saying, "If you-release this-(man), you-are not (a) friend of-[the] Caesar. Everybody [the] making himself king speaks-against [the] Caesar."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So [the] Pilate, having-heard these [the] words, led [the] Jesus outside and sat on (the) judgment-seat in (a) place called Pavement, but in-Hebrew Gabbatha. 14And it-was Preparation of-the Passover; it-was about (the) sixth hour. And he-says to-the Jews, "Behold, the king of-you!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then they shouted, "Take┘(him)└away! Take┘(him)└away! Crucify him!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So then he-delivered him to-them in-order-that he-might-be-crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So they-took Jesus, and, carrying the cross for-himself, he-went out into the (place) called Place of the Skull, which is-called in-Hebrew 'Golgotha,' 18where they-crucified him, and with him too others on each side and [the] Jesus between. 19And [the] Pilate also wrote (a) title and put (it) on the cross. And it-was written, "Jesus the Nazarene, the king of-the Jews." 20So many of-the Jews read this [the] title because the place was near the city where [the] Jesus was-crucified. And it-was written in-Hebrew, in-Latin, (and) in-Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So the chief priests of-the Jews began-to-say to-[the] Pilate, "Do┘not└write, 'The king of-the Jews,' but that that-one said, 'I-am king of-the Jews.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> So the soldiers, when they-crucified [the] Jesus, they-took the clothes of-him and made four parts, (a) part to-each soldier, plus the cloak. And the coat was seamless, woven from the above through (the) whole. 24So they-said to one-another, "Let-us┘not└tear it, but let-us-cast-lots for it whose it-will-be"; in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, [the] saying,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> And the mother of-him and the sister of-the mother of-him, Mary the (wife) of-[the] Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene had-been-standing by the cross of-Jesus. 26Then Jesus, seeing the mother and the disciple standing-by that he loved, says to-the/his mother, "Behold, the son of-you." 27Then he-says to-the disciple, "Behold, the mother of-you." And from that [the] hour the disciple took her into [the] his-own-things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> After this, [the] Jesus, having-seen that all-things already had-been-finished in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled, says, "I-thirst." 29(A) vessel was-sitting full-of sour-wine. Then having-wrapped┘(a) sponge full-of the sour-wine└around (a) hyssop, they-brought (it) to-the mouth (of him). 30Then when he-took the sour-wine, [the] Jesus said, "It-is-finished"; and having-bowed-down the/his head, he-gave-up the spirit/breath.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then the Jews, because it-was Preparation, in-order-that the bodies might┘not└remain on the cross on the Sabbath—for the day of-that [the] Sabbath was great—asked [the] Pilate [in-order]-that the legs of-them might-be-broken and they-would-be-taken-(down). 32Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of-the first and of-the other [the] having-been-crucified-with him. 33But, having-come to [the] Jesus, when they-saw him already having-died, they-did┘not└break the legs of-him. 34But one of-the soldiers with-(the)-spear of-him pierced the/his side, and immediately blood and water came-out. 35And the-one having-seen has-testified, and the testimony of-him is true, and that-one knows that he-says true-things in-order-that you may-believe. 36For these-things came-to-be in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And again another scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And after these-things Joseph [the] ms from Arimathea, being (a) disciple of-[the] Jesus, but having-been-secretly on-account-of the fear of-the Jews, asked [in-order]-that he-might-take the body of-[the] Jesus. Then he-came and took the body of-him. 39And also Nicodemus came, the-one having-come to him during-(the)-night at-the first, bringing (a) mixture of-myrrh and aloes about (a) hundred Roman-pounds. 40So they-took the body of-[the] Jesus and bound it with-linen-cloths with the aromatic-spices, as is (the) custom of-the Jews to-bury. 41And in the place where he-was-crucified (a) garden was, and in the garden (was a) new tomb in which not-yet was anybody buried. 42There then on-account-of the Preparation of-the Jews, because the tomb was nearby, they-placed [the] Jesus.</span>
