## John Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And on-the first (day) of-the week, Mary the Magdalene comes early to-the tomb, darkness still being, and sees the stone removed from the tomb. 2Then she-runs and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom [the] Jesus loved, and says to-them, "They-took the Lord out-of the tomb, and we-do┘not└ know where they-put him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Then [the] Peter went-out and the other disciple, and were-coming to the tomb. 4And the two were-running together, and the other disciple ran-ahead faster than-[the] Peter and came first to the tomb; 5and, stooping-down, he-sees the linen-cloths lying; however, he-did┘not└ go-in. 6[The] Simon Peter also comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees linen-cloths lying, 7and the shroud, which was on the head of-him, not lying with the linen-cloths, but separate, folded in one place. 8So then the other disciple also entered into the tomb, and saw and believed. 9For they-did┘not└ know the scripture that it-was-necessary for-him to-resurrect. 10Then they-went-away again to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> And Mary stood at the tomb outside, crying. Then as she-was crying, she-stooped-down into the tomb, 12and sees two angels in white, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of-[the] Jesus was-lying. 13And those say to-her, "Woman, why are-you-crying?" She-says to-them [that], "They-took the Lord of-me, and I-do┘not└ know where they-put him." 14Having-said these-things, she-turned around and sees [the] Jesus standing, and did┘not└ know that it-was Jesus. 15Jesus says to-her, "Woman, why are-you-crying? Whom do-you-seek?" That-one, supposing that he-was the gardener, says to-him, "Sir, if you took┘him└away, tell me where you-put him, and-I will-remove him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus says to-her, "Mary." Having-turned, that-one says to-him in-Hebrew, "Rabboni," which means, 'Teacher.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus says to-her, "Do┘not└ keep-clinging-to me, for I-have┘not-yet└ ascended to the Father. But go to [the] brothers of-me and say to-them, 'I-am-ascending to the Father of-me and Father of-you, God of-me and God of-you.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Mary the Magdalene goes, announcing to-the disciples [that], "I-have-seen the Lord," and (that) he-said these-things to-her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then evening being on-that [the] day, the (day)-one of-(the)-week, and the doors having-been-locked where the disciples were on-account-of the fear of-the Jews, [the] Jesus came and stood in the midst and says to-them, "Peace to-you." 20And having-said this, he-showed the/his hands and the/his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced, having-seen the Lord. 21[The] Jesus said again to-them, "Peace to you. Even-as the Father has-sent me, I-also am-sending you." 22And having-said this, he-blew and says to-them, "Receive (the) Holy Spirit." 23Whosever2 (sins) you-retain, they-have-been-retained."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Now Thomas, one of the twelve, the-one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25So the other disciples were-saying to-him, "We-have-seen the Lord." And the-one said to-them, "Unless I-see in the hands of-him the print of-the spikes and put the finger of-me in the print of-the spikes and put the/my hand in the side of-him, I-will┘certainly not└believe."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> And after eight days, the disciples of-him were again inside, and Thomas (was) with them. [The] Jesus comes, the doors being-locked, and stood in the midst and said, "Peace (be) to-you." 27Then he-says to-[the] Thomas, "Bring the finger of-you here and see the hands of-me, and take the hand of-you and put (it) into the side of-me, and do┘not└be unbelieving but believing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Thomas answered and said to-him, "The Lord of-me and the God of-me!" 29[The] Jesus says to-him, "Because you-have-seen me, you-have-believed? Blessed (are) the-ones not seeing and believing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then many and other signs [the] Jesus did in-the-presence-of the disciples [of-him]ms that are not written in [the] this book, 31but these have-been-written in-order-that you-may-believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of-[the] God, and that believing, you-may-have life in the name of-him.</span>
