## John Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And on-the first (day) of-the week, Mary the Magdalene comes early to-the tomb, darkness still being, and sees the stone removed from the tomb. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Then she-runs and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom [the] Jesus loved, and says to-them, <em>“They-took the Lord out-of the tomb, and we-do┘not└ know where they-put him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Then [the] Peter went-out and the other disciple, and were-coming to the tomb. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the two were-running together, and the other disciple ran-ahead faster than-[the] Peter and came first to the tomb; <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and, stooping-down, he-sees the linen-cloths lying; however, he-did┘not└ go-in. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><strong><sup>[</sup></strong>The] Simon Peter also comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees linen-cloths lying, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and the shroud, which was on the head of-him, not lying with the linen-cloths, but separate, folded in one place. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So then the other disciple also entered into the tomb, and saw and believed. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>For they-did┘not└ know the scripture that it-was-necessary for-him to-resurrect. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Then they-went-away again to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And Mary stood at the tomb outside, crying. Then as she-was crying, she-stooped-down into the tomb, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>and sees two angels in white, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of-[the] Jesus was-lying. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>And those say to-her, <em>“Woman, why are-you-crying?”</em><em> </em> She-says to-them [that], <em>“They-took the Lord of-me, and I-do┘not└ know where they-put him.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Having-said these-things, she-turned around and sees [the] Jesus standing, and did┘not└ know that it-was Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Jesus says to-her, <em>“Woman, why are-you-crying?</em><em> </em><em>Whom do-you-seek?”</em><em> </em> That-one, supposing that he-was the gardener, says to-him, <em>“Sir, if you </em><em>took┘him└away</em><em>, tell me where you-put him, and-I will-remove him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Jesus says to-her, <em>“Mary.”</em> Having-turned, that-one says to-him in-Hebrew, <em>“Rabboni,” </em>which means, ‘Teacher.’</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Jesus says to-her, <em>“Do┘not└ </em><em>keep-</em><em>cling</em><em>ing</em><em>-to me, for I-have┘not-yet└ ascended to the Father.</em><em> </em><em>But go to [the] b</em><em>rothers of-me and say to-them, ‘</em><em>I-am-ascending to the Father of-me and Father of-you, God of-me and God of-you.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Mary the Magdalene goes, announcing to-the disciples [that], <em>“I-have-seen the Lord,”</em> and (that) he-said these-things to-her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Then evening being on-that [the] day, the (day)-one of-(the)-week, and the doors having-been-locked where the disciples were on-account-of the fear of-the Jews, [the] Jesus came and stood in the midst and says to-them, <em>“Peace to-you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And having-said this, he-showed the/his hands and the/his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced, having-seen the Lord. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>[The] Jesus said again to-them, <em>“Peace to you.</em><em> </em><em>Even-as the Father has-sent me, I-also am-sending you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong>And having-said this, he-blew and says to-them, <em>“Receive (the) Holy Spirit.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Whosever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> (sins) you-</em><em>retain</em><em>, they-have-been-retained.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, the-one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>So the other disciples were-saying to-him, <em>“We-have-seen the Lord.”</em> And the-one said to-them, <em>“</em><em>Unless I-see in the hands of-him the prin</em><em>t of-the spikes and put the finger</em><em> of-me in the print of-the spikes and put the/my hand in the side of-him, I-will┘certainly not└believe.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>And after eight days, the disciples of-him were again inside, and Thomas (was) with them. [The] Jesus comes, the doors being-locked, and stood in the midst and said, <em>“Peace (be) to-you.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Then he-says to-[the] Thomas, <em>“</em><em>Bring</em><em> the finger of-you here and see the hands of-me</em><em>,</em><em> and take the hand of-you and put (it) into the side of-me, and do┘not└be unbelieving but believing.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Thomas answered and said to-him, <em>“T</em><em>he Lord of-me and the God of-me!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“Because you-have-seen me</em><em>,</em><em> you-have-believed?</em><em> </em><em>Blessed (are) the-ones not seeing and believing.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then many and other signs [the] Jesus did in-the-presence-of the disciples [of-him]<sup>ms</sup> that are not written in [the] this book, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>but these have-been-written in-order-that you-may-believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of-[the] God, and that believing, you-may-have life in the name of-him.</span>
