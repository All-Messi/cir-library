<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And on-the third [the] day (a) wedding took-place in Cana of-[the] Galilee, and the mother of-[the] Jesus was there. 2And [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him were also invited to the wedding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> And, the wine having-run-out, the mother of-[the] Jesus says to him, "They-do┘not└have wine." 4[And]ms Jesus says to-her, "What to-me and to-you, woman? The hour of-me has┘not yet└come."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> And (there) were six stone water-pots according-to the cleansing of-the Jews, standing there, holding about two or three measures. 7And he-says to-them, "Fill the water-jugs with-water."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> And he-says to-them, "Draw┘(some)└out now and take (it) to-the master-recliner/master-of-ceremonies."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> And when the master-recliner/master-of-ceremonies tasted the water become wine and did┘not└know whence it was—but the servers the-ones having-drawn the water knew, the master-recliner/the master-of-ceremonies calls the groom, 10and says to-him, "Every man first sets the good wine; and when (people)-are-sated, (he sets out) the lesser. You-have-kept the good wine till now."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> This beginning of-[the] signs [the] Jesus did in Cana of-[the] Galilee, and manifested the glory of-him, and the disciples of-him believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> After this he-went-down to Capernaum—he and the mother of-him and the brothers [of-him] ms and the disciples of-him—and stayed there not many days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> And the Passover of-the Jews was near, and [the] Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. 14And he-found in the temple the-ones selling oxen and sheep and doves, and [the] money-changers sitting. 15And having made (a) whip out-of cords, he drove-out of the temple all both the sheep and the oxen, and he-poured-out the money of-the money-changers and overturned the(ir) tables. 16And to-the-ones selling the doves he-said, "Take these hence; do┘not└make the house of-the Father of-me (a) house of-merchandise." 17And the disciples of-him remembered that it-was written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then the Jews answered and said to-him, "What sign do-you-show us that you-are-doing these-things?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus answered and said to-them, "Destroy this [the] temple, and in three days I-will-raise┘it└up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then the Jews said, "This [the] temple was-built in-forty and six years, and you will-raise┘it└up in three days?" 21But That-One was-talking about the temple of-the body of-him. 22When then he-was-raised from (the) dead, the disciples of-him remembered that he-had-said this, and they believed [the] scripture and the word that [the] Jesus said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And when he-was in [the] Jerusalem at the Passover at the feast, many believed in the name of-him, seeing the signs of-him that he-was-doing. 24But Jesus himself was┘not└entrusting himself to-them on-account-of [the] his knowing all-(people), 25and because he-did┘not└have necessity that anybody should-testify about [the] mankind/(a) man for he-himself knew that was in [the] mankind/(a) man.</span>
