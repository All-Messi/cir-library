## John Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And on-the third [the] day (a) wedding took-place in Cana of-[the] Galilee, and the mother of-[the] Jesus was there. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus and the disciples of-him were also invited to the wedding.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>And, the wine having-run-out, the mother of-[the] Jesus says to him, <em>“They-do┘not└have wine.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>[And]<sup>ms</sup> Jesus says to-her, <em>“What to-me and to-you, woman?</em><em> </em><em>The hour of-me has┘not yet└come.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>[The] his mother says to-the servers, <em>“Whatever he-says to-you, do (it).”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>And (there) were six stone water-pots according-to the cleansing of-the Jews, standing there, holding about two or three measures. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>And he-says to-them, <em>“Fill the water-jugs with-water.”</em><em> </em> And they-filled them to-the-brim<sup>2</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>And he-says to-them, <em>“</em><em>Draw┘(some)└</em><em>out now and take (it) to-the master-recliner/master-of-ceremonies.”</em><em> </em> And they-carried (it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>And when the master-recliner/master-of-ceremonies tasted the water become wine and did┘not└know whence it was—but the servers the-ones having-drawn the water knew, the master-recliner/the master-of-ceremonies calls the groom, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and says to-him, <em>“Every man first sets the good wine; and when (people)-are-sated, (he sets out) the lesser.</em><em> </em><em>You-have-kept the good wine till now.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>This beginning of-[the] signs [the] Jesus did in Cana of-[the] Galilee, and manifested the glory of-him, and the disciples of-him believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>After this he-went-down to Capernaum—he and the mother of-him and the brothers [of-him]<sup> ms</sup> and the disciples of-him—and stayed there not many days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And the Passover of-the Jews was near, and [the] Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>And he-found in the temple the-ones selling oxen and sheep and doves, and [the] money-changers sitting. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>And having made (a) whip out-of cords, he drove-out of the temple all both the sheep and the oxen, and he-poured-out the money of-the money-changers and overturned the(ir) tables. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>And to-the-ones selling the doves he-said, <em>“Take </em><em>these hence;</em><em> do┘not└make the house of-the </em><em>Father of-me (a) house of-merchandise.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong>And the disciples of-him remembered that it-was written, <strong><em>“The zeal of-the house of-me will-consume me.”</em></strong><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>Then the Jews answered and said to-him, <em>“What sign do-you-show us that you-are-doing these-things?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“Destroy this [the] temple</em><em>,</em><em> and in three days I-will-raise┘it└up.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>Then the Jews said, <em>“This [the] temple was-built in-forty and six years, and you will-raise┘it└up in three days?”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>But That-One was-talking about the temple of-the body of-him. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>When then he-was-raised from (the) dead, the disciples of-him remembered that he-had-said this, and they believed [the] scripture and the word that [the] Jesus said.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>And when he-was in [the] Jerusalem at the Passover at the feast, many believed in the name of-him, seeing the signs of-him that he-was-doing. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>But Jesus himself was┘not└entrusting himself to-them on-account-of [the] his knowing all-(people), <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and because he-did┘not└have necessity that anybody should-testify about [the] mankind/(a) man for he-himself knew that was in [the] mankind/(a) man.</span>
