## John Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After these-things [the] Jesus went-away beyond the Sea of-[the] Galilee, (the Sea of-[the] Tiberias. 2And (a) large crowd was following him, because they-were-seeing the signs that he-was-doing on the-ones being-sick. 3And Jesus went-up into the hill-country, and sat-down there with the disciples of-him. 4And the Passover was near, the feast of-the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Then [the] Jesus, lifting-up the eyes and seeing that a large crowd was-coming to him, says to Philip, "Whence will-we-buy loaves-of-bread in-order-that these may-eat?" 6Now he-was-saying this, testing him, for he-himself knew what he-was-about to-do. 7[The] Philip answered, "Loaves of-two-hundred denarii do┘not└suffice for-them in-order-that each may-receive (a) small-amount."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> One of the disciples—Andrew, the brother of-Simon Peter—says to-him, 9"(A) boy is here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so-many?" 10[The] Jesus said, "Make the people [to]-sit-down." And much short-vegetation/grass (was) in the place; so the men sat-down, the number about five-thousand. 11Then [the] Jesus took the bread; and, having-blessed (it), gave it to-the-ones sitting-up—likewise also [of] the fish—as-much-as they-wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And when they-were-filled, he-says to-the disciples of-him, "Gather-up the leftover pieces, in-order-that nothing may-be-lost."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So they-gathered-(them)-up and filled twelve baskets of-pieces from the five barley loaves that were-left by-the-ones having-eaten. 14Then the men, having-seen the sign that he did, started-saying, "This is truly the prophet the-one coming into the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Then Jesus, knowing that they were-about-to-come and seize him in-order-that they-might-make (him) king, withdrew again into the hill-country himself alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> And when evening came, the disciples of-him went-down to the sea; 17and, having-gotten into (a) boat, they started-to-go across the sea to Capernaum; and darkness had┘already└become, and [the] Jesus had┘not-yet└come to them, 18and the sea was-getting-rough, (a) wind┘blowing└hard. 19Then, having-rowed about twenty-five or thirty stades, they-see Jesus walking on the sea and becoming near the boat, and they-were-afraid. 20And [the] Jesus says to-them, "I am; do┘not└be-afraid." 21So they came to-take him into the boat, and presently the boat arrived at the land into which they-were-returning. 22On-the- next-day, the crowd [the] standing, on-the-other-side-of the sea, saw that no other little-boat was there except2 one, and that Jesus did┘not└go-with the disciples of-him into the boat, but only the disciples of-him went-away. 23Other small-boats came from Tiberias near the place where they-ate the bread, the Lord having-blessed (it). 24So when the crowd saw that [the] Jesus was not there nor the disciples of-him, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking [the] Jesus, 25and finding him on-the-other-side-of the sea, they-said to-him, "Teacher, when did-you-come-to-be-here?" 26[The] Jesus answer them and said, "Truly, truly, I-say to-you, you-are-looking-for me, not (so much) because you-saw signs, but because you-ate of the loaves and were-satisfied. 27Work┘not└for the food [the] perishing, but for the food [the] remaining unto life eternal, which the Son of [the] Man will-give you, for this the Father, [the] God, sealed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> So they-said to him, "What will-we-do in-order-that we-may-be-doing the works of-[the] God?" 29[The] Jesus answered and said to-them, "This is the work of-[the] God: [in-order]-that you-believe on whom that-One sent."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then they-said to-him, "What sign then do-you-do in-order-that we-may-see and believe you? What do-you-work? 31The fathers of-us ate [the] manna in the desert, even-as it-is written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-them, "Truly, truly, I-say to-you, Moses did┘not└give the bread out-of the sky, but the Father of-me is-giving you the true [the] bread out-of [the] heaven. 33[For] the bread of-[the] God is the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven and giving life to-the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then they-said to-him, "Sir, always give us this [the] bread!" "I am the bread of-[the] life; the-one believing in me will┘certainly not ever└be-thirsty. 36But I-said to-you that you┘also/even└have-seen me and do┘not└believe. 37Everything that the Father gives to-me will-come to me, and the-one coming to me I-will┘not└throw out, 38because I-have-come-down from [the] heaven, not in-order-that I-might-do [the] my [the] will, but the will of-the-One having-sent me. 39This is the will of-the-One having-sent me: everything that he-has-given me—I-should┘not└lose of it, but I-should-raise┘it└up in the last day. 40For this is the will of-the Father of-me: that everyone [the] seeing the Son and believing in him has eternal life, and I will-raise┘him└up in the last day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Then the Jews began-to-grumble about him because he-said, "I am the bread the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> And they-said, "This is Jesus, the son of-Joseph, is it not, whose [the] father and [the] mother we-know? How now does-he-say [that],'Out-of [the] heaven I-have come'?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Jesus answered and said to-them, "Do┘not└grumble with one-another. 44Nobody is-able to-come to me unless2 the Father the-One having-sent me is-drawing him. 45It has-been-written in the prophets, "And they-will┘all└be-taught-ones by-God.' Every the-one having-heard from the Father and having-learned comes to me—46not that anybody has-seen the Father except2 the-One being from [the] God; this-One has-seen the Father. 47Truly, truly, I-say to-you, the-one believing has eternal life. 48I am the bread of-[the] life. 49The fathers of-you ate the manna in the desert and died. 50This is the bread the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven, in-order-that anybody may-eat of-him and not die. 51I am the living [the] Bread the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven. If anybody eats of this [the] bread, he-will-live forever3, and also the bread that I will-give (him) is the flesh of-me for the life of-the world." 52Then the Jews began-to-quarrel with one-another: "How is┘this-one└able to-give us the flesh of-him to eat?" 53Then [the] Jesus said to-them, "Truly, truly, I-say to-you, unless2 you-eat the flesh of [the Son of-[the] Man and drink the blood of-him, you-do┘not└have life in yourselves. 54The-one eating the flesh of-me and drinking the blood of-me has eternal life, and-I-will-raise┘him└up in the last day. 55For the flesh of-me truly is food, and the blood of-me truly is drink. 56The-one eating the flesh of-me and drinking the blood of-me remains in me and-I in him. 57Even-as the living Father sent me and-I live on-account-of the Father, also the-one eating me—that-one-also will-live on-account-of me. 58This is the bread [the-one] coming out-of heaven, not like the fathers ate and died; the-one eating this [the] bread will-live forever3." 59These-things he-said teaching in (the) synagogue in Capernaum. 60Then many, having-believed, of the disciples of-him said, "This [the] word is hard. Who is-able to-hear/understand it?" 61And [the] Jesus, knowing in himself that the disciples of-him were-grumbling about his, said to-them, "Does┘this└offend you? 62If then you-see the Son of-[the] Man ascending where he-was [the] before? 63The spirit is the-thing giving-life; the flesh does┘not└profit anything. The words that I have-spoken to-you are spirit and they-are life. 64But some of-you there-are who do┘not└believe" (, for from (the) beginning Jesus knew who were the-ones not believing and who was the-one betraying him). 65And he-was-saying, "On-account-of this I-have-said to-you that nobody is-able to-come to me unless2 it-has been-given to him by the Father." 66From this (time) many of the disciples of-him went-away into the-things behind and no-longer continued-walking with him. 67Then [the] Jesus said to-the disciples, "You are┘not┘┘└wanting to-go-away too, └└are-you?" 68Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom will-we-go? You-have (the) words of-eternal life, 69and we have-believed and know that you are the Holy-One of-[the] God." 70[The] Jesus answered them, "Did┘I not└choose you [the] twelve, and one of-you is (a) devil?" 71And he-was-speaking-of [the] Judas, (son) of-Iscariot, for this-one would betray him, one of the twelve.</span>
