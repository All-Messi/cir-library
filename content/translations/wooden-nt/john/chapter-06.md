## John Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After these-things [the] Jesus went-away beyond the Sea of-[the] Galilee, (the Sea of-[the] Tiberias. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And (a) large crowd was following him, because they-were-seeing the signs that he-was-doing on the-ones being-sick. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>And Jesus went-up into the hill-country, and sat-down there with the disciples of-him. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the Passover was near, the feast of-the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus, lifting-up the eyes and seeing that a large crowd was-coming to him, says to Philip, <em>“Whence will-we-buy loaves-o</em><em>f-bread in-order-that these may-</em><em>eat?”</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now he-was-saying this, testing him, for he-himself knew what he-was-about to-do. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>[The] Philip answered, <em>“Loaves of-two-hundred denarii do┘not└suffice</em><em> for-</em><em>them in-order-that each may-receive (a) small-amount.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>One of the disciples—Andrew, the brother of-Simon Peter—says to-him, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“(A) boy is here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so-many?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>[The] Jesus said, <em>“Make the people [to]-</em><em>sit-down</em><em>.”</em> And much short-vegetation/grass (was) in the place; so the men sat-down, the number about five-thousand. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus took the bread; and, having-blessed (it), gave it to-the-ones sitting-up—likewise also [of] the fish—as-much-as they-wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>And when they-were-filled, he-says to-the disciples of-him, <em>“Gather-up the leftover pieces, in-order-that nothing may-be-lost.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>So they-gathered-(them)-up and filled twelve baskets of-pieces from the five barley loaves that were-left by-the-ones having-eaten. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Then the men, having-seen the sign that he did, started-saying, <em>“This is truly the prophet the-one coming into the world.</em><em>”</em><sup> </sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Then Jesus, knowing that they were-about-to-come and seize him in-order-that they-might-make (him) king, withdrew again into the hill-country himself alone.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And when evening came, the disciples of-him went-down to the sea; <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and, having-gotten into (a) boat, they started-to-go across the sea to Capernaum; and darkness had┘already└become, and [the] Jesus had┘not-yet└come to them, <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and the sea was-getting-rough, (a) wind┘blowing└hard. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Then, having-rowed about twenty-five or thirty stades, they-see Jesus walking on the sea and becoming near the boat, and they-were-afraid. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“I </em><em>am;</em><em> do┘not└be-afraid.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So they came to-take him into the boat, and presently the boat arrived at the land into which they-were-returning. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>On-the- next-day, the crowd [the] standing, on-the-other-side-of the sea, saw that no other little-boat was there except<sup>2</sup> one, and that Jesus did┘not└go-with the disciples of-him into the boat, but only the disciples of-him went-away. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Other small-boats came from Tiberias near the place where they-ate the bread, the Lord having-blessed (it). <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So when the crowd saw that [the] Jesus was not there nor the disciples of-him, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking [the] Jesus, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and finding him on-the-other-side-of the sea, they-said to-him, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>eacher, when did-you-come-to-be-here?”</em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answer them and said<em>, “Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, you-are-</em><em>looking-for me, not (so much) because you-saw signs, but because you-ate of the loaves and were-satisfied.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Work┘not└for the food [the] perish</em><em>ing, but for the</em><em> food </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> remaining </em><em>unto life eternal, which the Son of </em><em>[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an will-give you, for this</em><em> the Father, [the] God, sealed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>So they-said to him, <em>“What wi</em><em>ll-we-do in-order-that we-may-be-doing the works of-[the] God?”</em> <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“This is the work of-[the] God:</em><em> </em><em>[in-order]-</em><em>that you-believe on whom that-One sent.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then they-said to-him, <em>“What sign then do-you-do in-order-that we-may-see and believe you?</em><em> </em><em>What </em><em>do-you-work</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The<em> fathers </em><em>of-us</em><em> at</em><em>e</em><em> [the] manna in the desert, even-as it-is written, </em> <strong>‘He-gave them bread out-</strong><strong>of the</strong><strong>-sky to-eat</strong><strong>.’”</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, Moses did┘not└give the bread out-of the sky, but the Father of-me is-giving you the true [the] bread out-of [the] heaven</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>[For] the bread of-[the] God is the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven and giving life to-the world.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then they-said to-him, <em>“</em><em>Sir, always g</em><em>ive us this [the] bread!</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>[The] Jesus said to-them, <em>“I am the bread of-[the] life; the-one believing in me will┘certainly not ever└be-thirsty.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>But I-said to-you that you┘also/even└have-seen me </em><em>and </em><em>do┘not└believe.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>Everything that the Father gives to-me will-come to m</em><em>e, and the-one coming to me I-wi</em><em>ll┘not└throw out, </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>because I-have-come-down from [the] heaven, not in-order-that I-might-do [the] my [the] will, but the will of-the-One having-sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>This is the will of-the-One having-sent me:</em><em> </em><em>everything that he-has-given me—</em><em>I-should┘not└lose of it, but I-should-raise┘it└up in the last day.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>For this is the will of-the Father of-me:</em><em> </em><em>that everyone [the] seeing the Son and believing in him has eternal life, and I will-raise┘him└up in the last day.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Then the Jews began-to-grumble about him because he-said, <em>“</em><em>I am the bread the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>And they-said, <em>“This is Jesus, the son of-Joseph, is it not, whose [the] father and [the] mother we-know?</em><em> </em><em>How now does-he-say </em><em>[that],</em><em>’Out-of [the] heaven I-have come’?</em>”<strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup>Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“Do┘not└grumble with one-another.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>Nobody is-able to-come </em><em>to me </em><em>unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the Father the-One having-sent me is-drawing him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>It has-been-written in the prophets, “And they-</em><em>will┘all└</em><em>be-taught</em><em>-ones by-God.’</em><em> </em><em>Every the-one having-heard from the Father and having-learned comes to me—</em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>not that anybody has-seen the Father except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the-One being from [the] God; this-One has-seen the Father.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>I-say</em><em> to-you, the-one believing has eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>I am the b</em><em>read of-[the] life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>The fathers of-you ate the manna in the desert and died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>This is the b</em><em>read the-One coming-down out-of [the] heaven, in-order-that anybody may-eat of-him and not die.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> am the living [the] B</em><em>read the-One c</em><em>oming-down out-of [the] heaven.</em><em> </em><em>If anybody eats of this</em><em> [the] b</em><em>read, he-will-live forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>, </em><em>and also</em><em> the bread that I will-give (him) is the flesh of-me for the life of-the world.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>Then the Jews began-to-quarrel with one-another: <em>“How is┘this-one└able to-give us the flesh of-him to eat?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v53"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you, unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-eat the flesh of</em><em> </em><em>[the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an and drink the blood of-him, you-do┘not└have life in yourselves.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>54</sup></strong><em>The-one eating the flesh of-me and drinking the </em><em>blood of-me has eternal life, and-I-will-raise┘him└up in the last day.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>55</sup></strong><em>For the flesh of-me truly is food, and the blood of-me truly is drink.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>56</sup></strong><em>The-one eating the flesh of-me and drinking the blood of-me remains in me and-I in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>57</sup></strong><em>Even-as the living Father sent me and-I live on-account-of the Father, also the-one </em><em>eating me—</em><em>that-one-also will-live on-account-of me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>58</sup></strong><em>This is the bread [the-o</em><em>ne] coming out-of heaven, not like the fathers ate and died;</em><em> the-one eating this [the] bread will-live forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>59</sup></strong>These-things he-said teaching in (the) synagogue in Capernaum.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup>Then many, having-believed, of the disciples of-him said, <em>“</em><em>This [the] word is hard.</em><em> </em><em>Who is-able to-hear/understand it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v61"><sup><strong>61</strong></sup>And [the] Jesus, knowing in himself that the disciples of-him were-grumbling about his, said to-them, <em>“Does┘this└offend you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>62</sup></strong><em>If then you-see the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an ascending where he-was [the] before?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>63</sup></strong><em>The spirit is the-thing giving-life; the flesh does┘not└profit anything.</em><em> </em><em>The words that I </em><em>have-spoken</em><em> </em><em>to-you</em><em> are spirit and </em><em>they-are</em><em> life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>But some of-you there-are who do┘not└believe</em><em>”</em> (, for from (the) beginning Jesus knew who were the-ones not believing and who was the-one betraying him).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup>And he-was-saying, <em>“On-account-of this I-have-said to-you that nobody is-able to-come to me unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> it-has been-given to him by the Father.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup><strong>66</strong></sup><strong><em><sup>6</sup></em></strong>From this (time) many of the disciples of-him went-away into the-things behind and no-longer continued-walking with him. <strong><em><sup>67</sup></em></strong>Then [the] Jesus said to-the disciples, <em>“You are┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└wanting to-go-away too, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>are-you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v68"><sup><strong>68</strong></sup>Simon Peter answered him, <em>“Lord, to whom will-we-go?</em><em> </em><em>You-have (the) words of-eternal</em><em> life, </em><strong><sup>69</sup></strong><em>and we have-believed and know that you are the Holy-One of-[the] God.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>70</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answered them<em>, “Did┘I not└choose you [the] twelve, and one of-you </em><em>is</em><em> (a) devil?”</em> <strong><sup>71</sup></strong>And he-was-speaking-of [the] Judas, (son) of-Iscariot, for this-one would betray him, one of the twelve.</span>
