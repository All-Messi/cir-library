## John Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then [the] Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>So they-made (a) supper for-him there, and [the] Martha was-serving, and [the] Lazarus was one of the–ones reclining with him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then [the] Mary, having-taken 11½-ounces of-ointment—expensive pure nard—anointed the feet of-Jesus and wiped the feet of-him with the hair[s] of-her. And the house was-filled from the fragrance of-the ointment.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But Judas [the] Iscariot, one of the disciples of-him, the-one going to-betray him, says, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>On-account-of what was┘this [the] ointment not└sold for-three-hundred denarii and given to-(the)-poor?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>But he-said this, not because it-was-(a)-care to-him about the poor, but because he-was (a) thief, and, having the money-bag, was-stealing the-things put-(in-it).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then [the] Jesus said, <em>“Let┘her└alone, </em><em>in-order-</em><em>that for the day of-the burial of-me she-may-keep it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>For you┘always└have the poor with you, but you-do┘not always└have me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> The large crowd of [the] Jews knew that he-was there, and they-came, not only on-account-of [the] Jesus, but in-order-that they-might┘also└see [the] Lazarus, whom he-raised from (the) dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>But the chief priests took-counsel in-order-that they-might┘also└kill [the] Lazarus, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>because on-account-of him many of-the Jews were-going-away and believing in [the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> On-the next-day the great crowd [the] having-come to the feast, having-heard that [the] Jesus was-coming into Jerusalem, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>took [the] fronds of-the palm-trees and went-out for meeting him, and began-to-shout, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Hosanna;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>b</em></strong><strong><em>lessed (is) the-One coming in (the) name of-(the) Lord,</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>e</em><em>ven the king of-</em><em>[the] Israel</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-found (a) young-donkey, sat on it, as it-is-written,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> <strong><em>Do┘not└fear, daughter of-</em></strong><strong><em>Zion;</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>“Behold, the king of-you is-coming,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Sitting on (the) colt of-(a)-donkey.”</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The disciples of-him at-first<sup>2</sup> did┘not└understand, but when Jesus was-glorified, then they-remembered that these-things were written about him and they-did these-things to-him. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So the crowd—the-one being with him when he-called [the] Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from (the) dead—was-testifying. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>On-account-of this also the crowd met him: because they-heard he had-done this [the] sign.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the Pharisees said to one-another, <em>“You-see that you-do┘not└achieve anything.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, the world went after him.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>And there-were some Greeks of the-ones coming-up in-order-that they-might-worship at the feast. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>So/Then these came-to Philip, the-one from Bethsaida of-[the] Galilee, and were-asking him, saying, <em>“Sir, we-want to-see [the] Jesus.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>[The] Philip comes and speaks to-[the] Andrew, and Andrew and Philip come and speak to-[the] Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> And [the] Jesus answers them, saying, <em>“The hour has-come in-order-that the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an might-be-glorified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-tell you, unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the/a kernel of-[the] grain dies, falling into the ground, it remains alone.</em><em> </em><em>But if</em><em> </em><em>it-dies</em><em>, </em><em>it-bea</em><em>rs</em><em> much fruit.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>The-o</em><em>ne loving the life of-him loses</em><em> it</em><em>, and the-one disregarding the life of-him in this [the] world will-keep it unto eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If anybody serves me, let-him-follow me, and where I am—there also [the] my [the] servant will-be.</em><em> </em><em>If anybody serves me, the Father will-value/honor him.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Then the crowd [the] standing and having-heard began-to-say (that) thunder had-happened; others were=saying, <em>“(An) angel has-spoken to-him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus answered and said, <em>“This [the] voice has┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└occurred </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>so-much</em><em> </em><em>on-account-of me, but on-account-of you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Now</em><em> </em><em>(the) judgment of-this [the] world </em><em>is;</em><em> now the ruler of-this [the] world will-be-thrown out.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>And-I if </em><em>I-am-lifted up</em><em> from the ground, I-will-draw all-people/men to me.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>And he-said this, signifying by-what-kind-of death he┘would└die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Then the crowd answered, <em>“We heard out-of the </em><em>L</em><em>aw that the Messiah remains forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>, and how do┘you└say that it-is-necessary for-the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an to-be-lifted-up?</em><em> </em><em>Who is this [Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an’?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Then [the] Jesus said to-them, <em>“</em><em>Yet (</em><em>a) little time the light is among you.</em><em> </em><em>Walk while you have the light, </em><em>in-order-that</em><em> darkness may┘not└overtake you.</em><em> </em><em>And </em><em>the-one</em><em> walking in the darkness does┘not└know where </em><em>he-is-going</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>When you-have the light, trust in the light, in-order-that you-may-become sons of-light.”</em> Jesus said these-things, and having-gone-away was-hid from them. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>And he having-performed such signs in-front-of them, they-were┘not└believing in him, <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>in-order-that the word of-Isaiah the prophet might-be-fulfilled that he-said, <strong><em>“Lord, who believed the report of-us?</em></strong> <strong><em>	And to-whom was┘the arm of-the Lord└revealed?” </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> On-account-of this they-were┘not└able to-believe, because Isaiah said again,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Isaiah said these-things because he-saw the glory of-him, and spoke about him. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>Nevertheless, however, even many of the rulers believed in him, but on-account-of the Pharisees they-were┘not└confessing (it) in-order-that they-might┘not└be excommunicated-from-the-synagogue. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>For they-loved the glory of-[the] men more than the glory of-[the] God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> And Jesus shouted and said, <em>“The-one believing in me does┘not└believe in me</em><em> (only), but in the-One having-sent me;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>and the-one seeing </em><em>me </em><em>sees the-One having-sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>I have-come</em><em> into the world as-(a)-light, in-order-that the-one believing in me does┘not└remain in the darkness.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>And if anybody hears the words of-me and does┘not└keep (them), I do┘not└condemn him.</em><em> </em><em>For I-did┘not└come in-order-that I-might-condemn the world, but in-order-that I-might-save the world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>The-one ignoring/rejecting me and not receiving </em><em>the words of-me has the-thing condemning him:</em><em> </em><em>the message that I-spoke—it will-condemn him in the last day, </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>because I did┘not└speak from myself</em><em>,</em><em> but the-One ha</em><em>ving-sent me—the Father himself—</em><em>has-given me (a) commandment what I-should-say and what I-should-speak.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>And </em><em>I-know</em><em> that the commandment of-him is eternal life.</em><em> </em><em>So</em><em> </em><em>what-things</em><em> I speak, as the Father has-spoken to-me, thus I-</em><em>speak.”</em></span>
