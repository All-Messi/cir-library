## John Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus said these-things and, having-lifted-up the eyes of-him to they sky, said, "Father, the hour has-come; glorify the Son of-you, in-order-that the Son may-glorify you. 2As you-gave him authority over-all flesh in-order-that everything that you-have-given him, he-might-give to-them eternal life. 3And this is [the] eternal life: that they-may-know you, the only true God and Jesus Messiah, whom you-sent. 4I glorified you on earth, having-finished the work that you-have-given me in-order-that I-might-do. 5And now you glorify me, Father, together-with yourself with-the glory that I-used-to-have with you before the world was. 6"I-manifested the name of-you to-the men you gave me out-of the world. They-were to-you and┘you-gave them└to-me, and they-have-kept the word of-you. 7Now they-have-known that all-things as-many-as you-have-given me are from you; 8because the words that you-gave me I-have-given to-them, and they received and knew truly that I-came-out from you, and they believed that you sent me. 9I ask about them; not about the world do-I-ask, but about whom you-have-given to-me, because they-are to-you. 10And all [the] my-things are your-things and [the] your-things (are) mine, and I-have-been-glorified in them. 11And no-longer am-I in the world, and they are in the world, and-I am-coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in the name of-you that you-have-given to-me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are). 12When I-was with them, I was-keeping them in the name of-you that you-have-given me; and I guarded and nobody out-of them perished except2 the son of-[the] perdition in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled. 13But now I-am-coming to you, and I-say these-things in the world in-order-that they-may-have [the] my [the] joy fulfilled in themselves. 14I have-given them the word of-you, and the world hated them, because they-are not of the world as I am not of the world. 15I-do┘not└ask in-order-that you-take them out-of the world, but in-order-that you-may-keep them from the evil-one. 16They-are not of the world as I-am not of the world. 17Sanctify them in the truth; [the] your [the] word is truth. 18As you-sent me into the world, I-also am-sending them into the world. 19And on-behalf-of them I am-sanctifying myself in-order-that they may┘also└be sanctified by (the) truth. 20And not only about these am-I-asking, but also about the-ones believing in me through the word of-them, 21in-order-that they┘all└may-be one as you, Father, (are) in me and-I (am) in you, in-order-that the world may-believe that you sent me. 22And-I have-given them the glory that you-have-given me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are) one. 23I in them and you in me in-order-that they-may-be perfected into one in-order-that the world may-know that you sent me and loved them as you loved me. 24Father, what you-have-given me I-desire that where I am those-also may-be with me, in-order-that they-may-see [the] my [the] glory, which you-have-given me because you-loved me before (the) foundation of-(the)-world. 25Righteous Father, indeed the world did┘not└know you; but I knew you, and these know that you sent me, 26and I-made-known to them the name of-you and I-will-continue-to-make-(it)-known, in-order-that the love that you-loved me may-be in them and-I in them."</span>
