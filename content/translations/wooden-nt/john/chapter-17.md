<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus said these-things and, having-lifted-up the eyes of-him to they sky, said, <em>“Father, the hour has-come; glorify the Son of-you, in-order-that the Son may-glorify you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>As </em><em>you-gave</em><em> him authority over-all flesh in-order-that everything that </em><em>you-have-given</em><em> him, </em><em>he-might-give</em><em> </em><em>to-them</em><em> eternal life.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>And this is [the] eternal life:</em><em> </em><em>that they-may-know you, the only true God and Jesus </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, whom you-sent.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> glorified you on earth, having</em><em>-finished the work that you-have-given </em><em>me in-order-that I-might-do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>And now you glorify me, Father, together-with yourself with-the glory that I-used-to-have with you before the world was.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <strong><em><sup>“</sup></em></strong><em>I-manifested the name of-you to-the men you gave me out-of the world.</em><em> </em><em>They-were to-you and┘you-gave them└to-me, and they-have-kept the word of-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Now they-have-known that all-things as-many-as </em><em>you-have-given me are from you;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>because</em><em> the words that you-gave me I-have-given to-them, and the</em><em>y</em><em> r</em><em>eceived and knew truly that </em><em>I</em><em>-came-out from you, and they believed that you sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>I ask about th</em><em>em;</em><em> not about the </em><em>w</em><em>orld</em><em> do-I-ask, but about whom you</em><em>-have-given to-me, because they-are to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>And all [the] my-things are your-things and [the] your-things (are) mine, and I-have-been-glorified in them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>And no-longer am-I in the world, and they are in the world, and-I am-coming to you.</em><em> </em><em>Holy Father, keep them in the name of-you th</em><em>a</em><em>t you-have-given to-me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>When I-was with them, I </em><em>was-keeping</em><em> them in the nam</em><em>e of-you that you-have-given me;</em><em> and I guarded and nobody out-of them perished except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the son of-[the] perdition in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But now </em><em>I-am-coming</em><em> to you, and </em><em>I-say</em><em> </em><em>these-things</em><em> in the world </em><em>in-order-that</em><em> they-may-have [the] my [the] joy fulfilled in themselves.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>I ha</em><em>ve-given them the word of-you</em><em>, and the world hated them, because they-are not of the world as I am not of the world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>I-do┘not└ask in-order-that you-take them out-of the world, but in-order-that you-may-keep them from the evil-one.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>They-are</em><em> not</em><em> of the world as </em><em>I-am</em><em> not of the world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>Sanctify them in the truth; [the] your [the] word is truth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>As you-sent me into the world, I-also am-sending them into the world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>And on-behalf-of them I </em><em>am-sanctifying</em><em> myself in-order-that they may┘also└be sanctified by (the) truth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>And not only about these am-I-asking, </em><em>but also about the-ones believing in me through the word of-them, </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>in-order-that they┘all└may-be one as you, Father, (are) in me and-I (am) in you, in-order-that the world may-believe that you sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>And-I have-given them the glory that you-have-given me in-order-that they-may-be one as we (are) one.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>I in them and you in me in-order-that they-may-be perfected into one in-order-that the world may-know that you sent me and loved them as you loved me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Father, what you-have-given</em><em> me I-desire that where I am tho</em><em>se-also may-be with me, in-order-that they-may-see [the] my [the] glory</em><em>,</em><em> which you-have-given me because you-loved me before (the) foundation of-(the)-world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Righteous Father, indeed the world did</em><em>┘not└</em><em>know you;</em><em> but I knew you, and these know that you sent me, </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>and I-made-known to them the name of-you and I-will-continue-to-make</em><em>-(it)-known, in-order-that the love that you-loved me may-be in them and-I in them.”</em></span>
