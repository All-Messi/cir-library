## John Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup> </sup></strong>When then [the] Jesus knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus was-making and baptizing more disciples than-John—<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>although Jesus himself was┘not└doing-the-baptizing, but the disciples of-him (were doing the baptizing)—<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>he-left [the] Judaea and went-away back into [the] Galilee. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And it-was-necessary-for him to-go through [the] Samaria. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then he-comes into (a) village of-the Samaritans called Sychar near the parcel that Jacob gave Joseph, the son of-him. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>And (the) well of-[the] Jacob was there. Then [the] Jesus, having-become-weary from the journey was-sitting thus on the well. It-was about (the) sixth hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> (A) woman from [the] Samaria comes to-draw water. (The) Jesus says to-her, <em>“Give me to-drink.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>For the disciples of-him had-gone into the village in-order-that they-might-buy food.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Then the Samaritan [the] woman says to-him, <em>“How do┘you, being (a) </em><em>Jew,└</em><em>ask to-drink from me, being (a) Samaritan woman?”</em> (For Jews do┘not└associate-with Samaritans.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus answered and said to-her, <em>“If you knew the gift of-[the] God and who the-One is that-is-saying to-you, ‘Give me to-drink,’ you would have-asked him, and he┘would└have-given you living water.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The woman says to-him, <em>“Sir, you-do┘not-even└have (a) bucket and the well is deep.</em><em> </em><em>Whence then do-you-have [the] living [the] water?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>You are not┘greater than-the father of-us, </em><em>Jacob,└</em><em>are-you, who gave us the well and himself drank from it and the sons of-him and the domesticated-animals of-him?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Jesus answered and said to-her, <em>“Everybody who drinks from this [the] water will-get-thirsty</em><em> again.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>But whoever</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> drinks </em><em>of</em><em> </em><em>the </em><em>water that I-will-give him, will┘certainly not└thirst forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>But,</em><em> the water that I-will-give to-him will-become in him (as) spring of water springing-up into eternal life.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The woman says to him, <em>“Sir, give me this [the] water in-order-that I-will┘not└get-thirsty or come here to-draw (it).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He-says to-her, <em>“Go call the husband of-you and come here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> The woman answered and said to-him, <em>“I-do┘not└have (a) husband.”</em> [The] Jesus says to-her, <em>“You-said well [that], ‘I-do┘not└have (a) husband.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>For you-had five husbands and now whom you-have is not your husband.</em><em> </em><em>You-have-said </em><em>this truly.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The woman says to-him, <em>“Sir, I-see that you are (a) prophet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The fathers of-us worship</em><em>ed</em><em> on this [the] mountain</em><em>,</em><em> and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it-is-necessary to-worship.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> [The] Jesus says to-her, <em>“Believe me, woman, [that] (the) time/hour is-coming when neither on this [the] mountain nor in Jerusalem will-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>-worship the Father.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>You</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> worship what you-do┘not└know; we worship what we-know, because [the] salvation is of the Jews.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>But (the) time is-coming—and now is—when the true worshipers will-worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such the-ones worshiping him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>[The] God (is a) spirit, and it-is-necessary-for the-ones worshiping him to-worship in spirit and truth.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The woman says to-him, <em>“I-know that Messiah is-coming, the-One called Christ.</em><em> </em><em>When that-one comes he-will-announce all-things to-us.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus says to-her, <em>“I, the-One speaking to-you, </em><em>am</em><em> (he).” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> And upon this (situation) the disciples of-him came, and they-were-amazed that/because he-was-speaking with (a) woman. However, nobody said, <em>“What are-you-looking-for?</em><em>” </em>or<em> “Why are-you-talking with her</em><em>?</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then the woman left the water-pot of-her and went-away into the village, and says to-the men, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Come, see (a) fellow who told me all-things as-many-as I-did.</em><em> </em><em>This is not┘ the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, └is it?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They-went-out of the village and were-coming to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> In-the-meantime the disciples kept-asking him, saying, <em>“Eat (something</em><em>)</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> But the/he said to-them, <em>“I have food to-eat that you do┘not└know.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The disciples started-saying to-one-another, <em>“Somebody has┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└brought him (something) to-eat, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>have-they?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> (The) Jesus says to-them, <em>“My food is in-order-that I-might-do the will of-the-One having-sent me and in-order-that I-might-finish the work of-him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Do<em>-you┘not└</em><em>say [that] yet three-months are and [the] harvest is-coming?</em><em> </em><em>Behold, I-tell you, lift-up the eyes of-you and look-at the fields that they-are already white for harvest.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>The reaper receives pay and gathers fruit unto eternal life, </em><em>in-order-that</em><em> the sower and the reaper </em><em>may-rejoice</em><em> together.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>For th</em><em>is [the] saying is true [that],’</em><em>One is the sow</em><em>er and another (is) the reaper.’</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>I sent you to-reap what you have┘not└labored-on.</em><em> </em><em>Others have-labored, and you have-entered into the work of-them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And from that [the] village many of-the Samaritans came-to-believe on-account-of the word of-the woman testifying [that], <em>“He-told me everything [that] that I-did.”</em> <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>So when the Samaritans came to him, they-asked him to-stay with them, and he-stayed there two days. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>And more by-much they-came-to-belief on-account-of the word of-him. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>And to-the woman they-were-saying [that], <em>“No-longer do-we-believe on-account-of [the] your saying, for we</em><em>┘ourselves└</em><em>have-heard</em><em> and know that this is truly the Savior of the world.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> And after the two days he-went-out from-there into [the] Galilee. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>For Jesus himself testified that (a) prophet in [the] his-own country does┘not└have honor. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>Therefore when he-came into [the] Galilee, the Galileans received him, having-seen all-things as-many-as he-did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went to the feast.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> So they came again into [the] Cana of-[the] Galilee, where he-made the water wine. And (a) certain ruler was whose [the] son was-sick in Capernaum. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>This-one, having heard that Jesus came from Judaea into [the] Galilee, went-away to him and began-to-ask in-order-that he-come-down and heal the son of-him, for he-was-about to-die.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> So [the] Jesus said to him, <em>“Unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>-see signs and wonders, you-will┘not└believe at-all!</em><strong><sup>”</sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The ruler says to-him, <em>“Sir, go-down before the son of-me dies.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> [The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“Go, the son of-you </em><em>lives</em><em>.”</em> The man believed the word that [the] Jesus said to-him and went. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>And already, he going-down, the slaves of-him met him, saying that the son of-him was-living. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>So he-asked from them the hour in which he-had recovery. So they said to-him [that], <em>“Yesterday the fever left him at-(the)-seventh hour.”</em><em> </em></span>
