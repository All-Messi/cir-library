## John Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And (a) certain-one was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha, the sister of-her. 2And Mary was the-one having-anointed the Lord with-myrrh and having-wiped the feet of-him with-the hair of-her, the brother of-whom Lazarus was-sick. 3So the sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, whom you love is-sick."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-heard, said, "This [the] sickness is not to death, but for the glory of-[the] God, in-order-that the Son of-[the] God might-be-glorified by it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now [the] Jesus loved [the] Martha and the sister of-her and [the] Lazarus. 6When then he-heard that he-was-sick, then he-stayed in what place he-was for-two days. 7Then after this he-says to-the disciples, "Let-us-go into [the] Judaea again."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The disciples say to-him, "Rabbi, the Jews were┘just-now└trying to-stone you, and you-are-going there again?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus answered, "Are-there not twelve hours of-the-day? If (a) person walks in the day, he-does┘not└stumble, because he-sees the light of-this [the] world. 10But if anybody walks in the night, he-stumbles, because [the] light is not in him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He-said these-things, and after this he-says to-them, "Lazarus, the friend of-us, has-gone-to-sleep. But I-am-going in-order-that I-may-awaken him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the disciples said to-him, "Lord, if he-is-asleep, he-will-be-saved."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But [the] Jesus had-spoken about the death of-him, but they supposed that he-was-speaking about the sleep of-[the] rest. 14So then [the] Jesus said to-them plainly, "Lazarus died. 15And I-am-glad on-account-of you that you-may-believe because I-was not there, but let-us-go to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Thomas, the-one called Didymus, said, to the fellow-disciples, "Let┘us└go too in-order-that we-may-die with him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then [the] Jesus, having-come, found him already having four days in the tomb. 18Now [the] Bethany was about fifteen stades from Jerusalem. 19And many of the Jews had-come to [the] Martha and Mary in-order-that they-might-console them about the brother. 20Then [the] Martha, when she-heard that Jesus was-coming, met him. But Mary continued-to-sit in the house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then [the] Martha said to [the] Jesus, "Lord, if you had-been here, [the] brother of-us would not have-died. 22But even now I-know that as-many-things-as you ask [the] God, [the] God will-give." 24[The] Martha says to-him, "I-know that he-will-resurrect in the resurrection in the last day." 25[The] Jesus said to-her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The-one believing in me, even-if he-dies, he-will-live. 26And everybody [the] living and believing in me will┘certainly not└die forever3."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> She-says to-him, "Yes, Lord; I-have-believed that you are the Messiah, the Son of-[the] God, the-One coming into the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And having-said this, she-went-away and called Mary the sister of-her quietly, saying, "The teacher is-here, and he-is-calling-for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And when she heard, she-arose quickly and was-going to him. 30And [the] Jesus had┘not└come into the village, but was still on the road where [the] Martha met him. 31Then the Jews the-ones being with her in the house and comforting her, having-seen [the] Mary that she-arose and went, they-followed her supposing that she-was-going to the tomb in-order-that she-might-weep there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> So [the] Mary, when she-came where Jesus was, having-seen him, fell to the feet of-him, saying to-him, "Lord, if you-had-been here, the brother of-me would┘not└have died."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then Jesus, when he-saw her weeping and the coming-with her Jews weeping, was-deeply-moved-in [the] spirit and troubled himself, 34and said, "Where have-youpl-laid-him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And some of them said, "This the-One having-opened the eyes of-the blind was-able, was-he not, to do in-order-that this-one also would┘not└have died?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then Jesus, again deeply-moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it-was (a) cave, and (a) stone was-lying against it. 39[The] Jesus says, "Take┘the stone└away." The sister of-the-one having-died, Martha, says to-him, "Lord, he stinks already. It-is (the) fourth (day)." 40[The] Jesus says to-her, "Did-I┘not└say to-you that if you-have-faith, you-will-see the glory of-[the] God?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> So they-took┘the stone└away. And [the] Jesus lifted up the eyes of-him and said, "Father, I-thank you that you-heard me. 42And I-have-known that you┘always└hear me, but on-account-of the crowd [the] having-stood-around me, I-am-saying (this) so they-will-believe that you-sent me." 43And having-said these-things, he-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, "Lazarus, come out." 44The-one having-died came-out bound [the] feet and [the] hands with-strips-of-cloth and the face of-him was-wrapped with-(a)-shroud. [The] Jesus says to-them, "Loose him and let him [to]-go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Then many of the Jews, the-ones having-come to [the] Mary and having-seen what-things he-did, believed in him. 46But some of them went-away to the Pharisees and told them what-things Jesus did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled (the) Sanhedrin and said, "What do-we-do, because this [the] man is-doing many signs? 48If we-leave┘thus└alone, all will-believe in him, and the Romans will-come and remove both our [the] place and [the] nation."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> But (a) certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest during [the] that year, said to-them, "You do┘not└know something, 50nor take into-consideration that it-is-better for-us that one man die for the people and the whole nation not be-destroyed." 51But he-did┘not└say this of himself; but, being high priest during-[the] that year, prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52and not for the nation only, but that he-would┘also└assemble [the] scattered of-[the] God into one. 53So from that [the] day they-planned in-order-that they-might-kill him. 54Then [the] Jesus no-longer was-walking openly among the Jews, but went-away from-there into the area near the desert, into (a) city called Ephraim, and┘remained└there with the disciples. 55And the Passover of-the Jews was near, and many went-up to Jerusalem from the area before the Passover in-order-that they-might-sanctify themselves. 56Then they-were-looking-for [the] Jesus and saying with one-another, standing in the temple, "What does-it-seem to-you? [That] he-will┘certainly not┘┘└come to the feast, └└will-he?" 57Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had-given orders that if anybody knew where he-was, he-should-report (it), in-order-that they-might-arrest him.</span>
