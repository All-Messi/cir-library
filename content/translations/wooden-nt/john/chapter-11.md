## John Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And (a) certain-one was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha, the sister of-her. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And Mary was the-one having-anointed the Lord with-myrrh and having-wiped the feet of-him with-the hair of-her, the brother of-whom Lazarus was-sick. <sup>3</sup>So the sisters sent to him, saying, <em>“Lord, behold, whom you love is-sick.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> And [the] Jesus, having-heard, said, <em>“This [the] sickness is not to death, but for the glory of-[the] God, in-order-that the Son of-[the] God might-be-glorified by it.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Now [the] Jesus loved [the] Martha and the sister of-her and [the] Lazarus. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When then he-heard that he-was-sick, then he-stayed in what place he-was for-two days. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then after this he-says to-the disciples, <em>“Let-us-go into [the] Judaea again.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The disciples say to-him, <em>“Rabbi, t</em><em>he Jews were┘just-now└trying to-stone you, and you-are-going there again?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“Are-there not twelve hours of-the-day?</em><em> </em><em>If (a) person walks in the day, he-does</em><em>┘not└</em><em>stumble, because he-sees the light of-this [the] world.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>But if anybody walks in the night, he-stumbles, because [the] light is not in him.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> He-said these-things, and after this he-says to-them, <em>“Lazarus, the friend of-us, has-gone-to-sleep.</em><em> </em><em>But I-am-going in-order-that I-may-awaken him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the disciples said to-him, <em>“Lord, if he-is-asleep</em><em>,</em><em> he-will-be-saved.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> But [the] Jesus had-spoken about the death of-him, but they supposed that he-was-speaking about the sleep of-[the] rest. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So then [the] Jesus said to-them plainly, <em>“Lazarus died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>And I-am-glad on-account-of you that you-may-believe because I-was not </em><em>there, but</em><em> let-us-go to him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then Thomas, the-one called Didymus, said, to the fellow-disciples, <em>“Let┘us└go too </em><em>in-order-</em><em>that we-may-die with him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then [the] Jesus, having-come, found him already having four days in the tomb. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Now [the] Bethany was about fifteen stades from Jerusalem. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And many of the Jews had-come to [the] Martha and Mary in-order-that they-might-console them about the brother. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Then [the] Martha, when she-heard that Jesus was-coming, met him. But Mary continued-to-sit in the house.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Then [the] Martha said to [the] Jesus, <em>“Lord, if you had-been here, [the] brother of-us would not have-died.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>But even now I-know that as-many-things-as you ask [the] God, [the] God will-give.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> [The] Jesus says to-her, <em>“The brother of-you will-resurrect.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> [The] Martha says to-him, <em>“I-know that he-will-resurrect in the resurrection in the last day.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> [The] Jesus said to-her, <em>“I am the resurrection and the life.</em><em> </em><em>The-one believing in me, even-if he-dies, he-will-live.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>And everybody [the] living and believing in me will┘certainly not└die forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> She-says to-him, <em>“Yes, Lord; I-have-believed that you are the Messiah, the Son of-[the] God, the-One coming into the world.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And having-said this, she-went-away and called Mary the sister of-her quietly, saying, <em>“The teacher is-here, and he-is-calling-for you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> And when she heard, she-arose quickly and was-going to him. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>And [the] Jesus had┘not└come into the village, but was still on the road where [the] Martha met him. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>Then the Jews the-ones being with her in the house and comforting her, having-seen [the] Mary that she-arose and went, they-followed her supposing that she-was-going to the tomb in-order-that she-might-weep there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> So [the] Mary, when she-came where Jesus was, having-seen him, fell to the feet of-him, saying to-him, <em>“Lord, if you-had-been here, the brother of-me would┘not└have died.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then Jesus, when he-saw her weeping and the coming-with her Jews weeping, was-deeply-moved-in [the] spirit and troubled himself, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>and said, <em>“Where have-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>-laid-him?”</em> They-say to-him, <em>“Lord, come and see.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> [The] Jesus shed-tears. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Then the Jews began-to-say, <em>“See how he-loved him!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And some of them said, <em>“This</em><em> the</em><em>-One</em><em> having-opened the eyes of-the blind was-able, was-he not, to do in-order-that this-one also would┘not└have died?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Then Jesus, again deeply-moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it-was (a) cave, and (a) stone was-lying against it. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says, <em>“Take┘the stone└away.”</em> The sister of-the-one having-died, Martha, says to-him, <em>“Lord, he stinks already.</em><em> </em><em>It-is (the) fourth (day).”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> [The] Jesus says to-her, <em>“Did-I┘not└say to-you that if you-have-faith, you-will-see the glory of-[the] God?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> So they-took┘the stone└away. And [the] Jesus lifted up the eyes of-him and said, <em>“Father, I-thank you that you-heard me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>And I-have-known that you┘always└hear me, but </em><em>on-account-of the crowd [the</em><em>] having-stood-around me, I-am-saying (this) so they-will-believe that you-sent me.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>And having-said these-things, he-shouted with-(a)-loud voice, <em>“Lazarus, come out.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The-one having-died came-out bound [the] feet and [the] hands with-strips-of-cloth and the face of-him was-wrapped with-(a)-shroud. [The] Jesus says to-them, <em>“Loose him and let him [to]-go.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Then many of the Jews, the-ones having-come to [the] Mary and having-seen what-things he-did, believed in him. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>But some of them went-away to the Pharisees and told them what-things Jesus did.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled (the) Sanhedrin and said, <em>“What do-we-do, because this [the] man is-doing many signs?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> we-leave┘thus└alone, all will-believe in him, and the Romans will-come and remove both our [the] place and [the] nation.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> But (a) certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest during [the] that year, said to-them, <em>“You do┘not└</em><em>know something, </em><strong><sup>50</sup></strong><em>nor take into-consideration that it-is-better for-us that one man die for the people and the whole nation not be-destroyed.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>51</sup></strong>But he-did┘not└say this of himself; but, being high priest during-[the] that year, prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>and not for the nation only, but that he-would┘also└assemble [the] scattered of-[the] God into one. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>So from that [the] day they-planned in-order-that they-might-kill him.</span>
