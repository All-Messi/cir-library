## John Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And after these-things [the] Jesus was-walking in [the] Galilee, for he-did┘not└want to-walk in [the] Judaea, because the Jews were-trying to-put┘(him)└to-death. 2But the feast of-the Jews, the Feast-of-Booths, was near. 3Then [the] brothers of-him said to him, "Leave from-here and go into [the] Judaea in-order-that the disciples of-you will┘also└see the works that you-are-doing, 4for nobody does anything in secret and himself tries to-be in openness. If you-are-doing these-things, manifest yourself to-the world." 5For not-even the brothers of-him were-believing in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Then [the] Jesus says to-them, "[The] my [the] time is┘not-yet└here, but [the] your [the] time is always ready. 7The world is┘not└able to-hate you, but it-hates me because I-testify about it that the works of-it are evil. 8You go-up to the feast; I am┘not└going-up to [the] this feast, because [the] my time is┘not-yet└fulfilled." 9And having-said these-things, he remained in [the] Galilee. 10And when the brothers of-him had-gone-up to the feast, then he also went-up, not openly, but as in secret. 11So the Jews were-looking-for him at the feast and saying, "Where is he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And (there) was much murmuring in the crowds about him. Some, on-the-one-hand, were-saying [that], "He-is (a) good (man)," but others were-saying, "No, to-the-contrary, he-deceives the common-people." 13Nobody, however, was-speaking openly about him on-account-of the fear of-the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> And the feast already being-in-the-middle, Jesus went-up to the temple to-teach. 15So the Jews were-marveling, saying, "How does┘this (man)└know letters, not having-learned?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then [the] Jesus answered and said, "[The] my teaching is not mine, but of-the-One having-sent me. 17If anybody wants to-do the will of-him, he-will-know about the teaching whether-it-is of [the] God or I-am-speaking from myself. 18The-one speaking from himself seeks [the] his-own [the] glory; but the-one seeking the glory of-the-One having-sent him—this-One is true, and injustice is┘not└in him. 19Did┘not Moses└give you the Law? And nobody of-you does the Law. Why are-you-trying to-kill me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The crowd answered, "You-have (a) demon. Who is-trying to-kill you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus answered and said to-them, "I did one work and you┘all└marveled. 22On-account-of this, Moses gave you [the] circumcision—not that it-is from [the] Moses, but from the fathers—and you-circumcise (a) man on (the) Sabbath. 23If (a) man receives circumcision on (the) Sabbath in-order-that he-will┘not└break the Law of-Moses, are-you-angry with-me because I-made (a) whole man healthy on (the) Sabbath? 24Do┘not└make-judgment according-to appearance, but judge [the] righteous judgment."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then some of the Jerusalemites started-saying, "Is this not whom they-are-trying to-put-to-death? 26and, behold, he-is-speaking with-boldness, and they-are-saying nothing to-him? Do┘the rulers indeed└know perhaps that this-One is the Messiah? 27But we-know where┘this-One is└from. But when the Messiah comes nobody knows whence he-is."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then Jesus shouted in the temple, teaching and saying, "You┘both┘┘└know └└me, and you-know whence I am. And I-have┘not└come of myself, but the-One having-sent me is true, whom you do┘not└know. 29I know him because I-am from him, and that-One sent me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Then they-were-trying to-arrest him, but nobody laid the/a hand on him, because the hour of-him had┘not-yet└come. 31And many of the crowd believed in him and were-saying, "When the Messiah comes, he-will┘not┘┘└do greater signs than-what this-One has-done, └└will-he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these-things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in-order-that they-might-arrest him. 33Then [the] Jesus said, "Yet (a) short time I-am with you, and I-am-going-away to the-One having-sent me. 34You-will-seek me and not find [me]ms, and where I am you are┘not└able to-come."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Then the Jews said to one-another, "Where does┘this-One└intend to-go that we will┘not└find him? He-does┘not┘┘└intend to-go to the Diaspora of-the Greeks and teach the Greeks, └└does-he? 36What is this [the] word that he-said, 'You will-seek me and not find [me]ms,' and 'Where I am you are┘not└able to-go.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> And on the last day, the great (day) of-the feast, [the] Jesus stood and shouted, saying, "If anybody is-thirsty, let-him-come to me and drink. 38The-one believing in me, as the scripture said, rivers of-living water will-flow out of-the stomach of-him." 39And he-said this about the Spirit that the-ones having-believed in him would receive, for (the) Spirit was not-yet because Jesus was not-yet glorified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The out-of the crowd, having-heard these [the] words, they-began-to-say, "This is truly the prophet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Others were-saying, "This is the Messiah," but the-(others), "For the Messiah does┘not┘┘└ come out-of [the] Galilee, └└does-he? 42Did┘not the scripture└say that out-of the seed of-David and from Bethlehem the village where David was the Messiah comes?" 44And some of them were-wanting to-arrest him, but nobody laid [the] hands on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> So the officers went to the chief priests and Pharisees; and those (men) said to-them, "On-account-of what did-you┘not└bring him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> The officers answered, "Never did┘(a) man└speak thus."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Then the Pharisees answered them, "You are┘not┘┘└deceived too, └└are-you? 48Not┘┘any of the rulers believed in him or of the Pharisees, └└have-they? 49But this [the] crowd the-one not knowing the Law is accursed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Nicodemus says to them (the-one having-come to him [at-the] earlier, being one of them), 51"The Law of-us does┘not┘┘└condemn the/a man unless2 it┘first└hears from him, and knows what he-is-doing, └└does-it?" 52They-answered and said to-him, "You are not┘ from [the] Galilee too, └are-you? Search and see that out-of [the] Galilee (a) prophet does┘not└arise." 53And they-went each-one to the house of-him.</span>
