## John Chapter **7**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>And after these-things [the] Jesus was-walking in [the] Galilee, for he-did┘not└want to-walk in [the] Judaea, because the Jews were-trying to-put┘(him)└to-death. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>But the feast of-the Jews, the Feast-of-Booths, was near. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then [the] brothers of-him said to him, <em>“Leave from-here and go into [the] Judaea in-order-that the disciples of-you will</em><em>┘also└</em><em>s</em><em>ee the works that you-are-doing, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>for nobody does anything in secret and himself tries to-be in openness.</em><em> </em><em>If you-are-doing these-things, manifest yourself to-the world.”</em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>For not-even the brothers of-him were-believing in him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus says to-them, <em>“[The] my [the] time is┘not-yet└here, but [the] your [the] time is always ready.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>The world is┘not└able to-hate you, but </em><em>it-hates</em><em> me because </em><em>I-testify</em><em> about it that the works </em><em>of-it</em><em> </em><em>are</em><em> evil.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>You go-up to the feast; I am┘not└going-up to [the] this </em><em>feast, because [the] my time is┘not-yet└fulfilled.”</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>And having-said these-things, he remained in [the] Galilee. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>And when the brothers of-him had-gone-up to the feast, then he also went-up, not openly, but as in secret. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>So the Jews were-looking-for him at the feast and saying, <em>“Where is he?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And (there) was much murmuring in the crowds about him. Some, on-the-one-hand, were-saying [that], <em>“He-is (a) good (man),” </em>but others were-saying,<em> “No, to-the-contrary, he-deceives the common-people.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Nobody, however, was-speaking openly about him on-account-of the fear of-the Jews.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And the feast already being-in-the-middle, Jesus went-up to the temple to-teach. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So the Jews were-marveling, saying, <em>“How does┘this (man)└know letters, not having-learned?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup>Then [the] Jesus answered and said, <em>“[The] my te</em><em>aching is not mine, but of-the-O</em><em>ne having-sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If anybody wants to-do the will of-him, he-will-know about the teaching whe</em><em>ther-it-is of [the] God or I-am</em><em>-speaking from myself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>The-one speaking from himself seeks [the] his-own [the] glory; but the-one seeking the glory of-the-One having-sent him—this-One is true, and injustice is┘not└in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Did┘not Moses└give you the </em><em>L</em><em>aw?</em><em> </em><em>And nobody of-you </em><em>does</em><em> the </em><em>L</em><em>aw.</em><em> </em><em>Why are-you-trying to-kill me?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup>The crowd answered, <em>“You-have (a) demon.</em><em> </em><em>Who is-trying to-kill you?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Jesus answered and said to-them, <em>“I did one work and you┘all└marveled.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>On-account-of this, Moses gave you [the] circumcision—not that it-is from [the] Moses, but from the fathers—and you-circumcise (a) man on (the) Sabbath.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>If (a) man receive</em><em>s</em><em> circumcision on (the) Sabbath in-order-that he-will┘not└break the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-Moses, are-you-angry with-me because I-made (a) whol</em><em>e man healthy on (the) Sabbath?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Do┘not└make-judgment according-to appearance, but judge [the] righteous judgment.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Then some of the Jerusalemites started-saying, <em>“Is this not whom they-are-trying to-put-to-death? </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>and, behold,</em><em> he-is-speaking with-boldness, and they-are-saying nothing to-him?</em><em> </em><em>Do┘the rulers indeed└know perhaps that this-One is the Messiah?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>But we-know where┘this-One is└from.</em><em> </em><em>But when the Messiah comes nobody knows </em><em>whence</em><em> he-is.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Then Jesus shouted in the temple, teaching and saying, <em>“You┘both</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└know </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>me, and you-know whence I am.</em><em> </em><em>And I-have┘not└come </em><em>of</em><em> myself, but </em><em>the-One</em><em> having-sent me is true, whom you do┘not└know.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I know him because I-am from him</em><em>,</em><em> and that-One sent me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup>Then they-were-trying to-arrest him, but nobody laid the/a hand on him, because the hour of-him had┘not-yet└come. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>And many of the crowd believed in him and were-saying, <em>“When the Messiah comes, he-will┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└do greater signs than-what this-One has-d</em><em>o</em><em>ne, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>will-he?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these-things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in-order-that they-might-arrest him. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus said, <em>“Yet (a) short time I-am with you</em><em>,</em><em> and I-am-going-away to the-One having-sent me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>You-will-seek me and not find [me]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>, and where I am you are┘not└able to-come.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>Then the Jews said to one-another, <em>“Where does</em><em>┘this-One└</em><em>intend to-go </em><em>that we will┘not└find him?</em><em> </em><em>He-does┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└intend to-go </em><em>to the Diaspora of-the Greeks and teach the Greeks,</em><em> </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>does-he?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>What is this [the] word that he-said, ‘You will-seek me and not find [me]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>,’ and ‘Where I am you are┘not└able to-go.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>And on the last day, the great (day) of-the feast, [the] Jesus stood and shouted, saying, <em>“If anybody is-thirsty, let-him-come to me and drink.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>The-one believing in me, as the s</em><em>cripture said, rivers of-li</em><em>ving water will-flow out of-the stomach of-him.”</em> <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>And he-said this about the Spirit that the-ones having-believed in him would receive, for (the) Spirit was not-yet because Jesus was not-yet glorified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>The out-of the crowd, having-heard these [the] words, they-began-to-say, <em>“This is truly the prophet.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Others were-saying, <em>“This is the Messiah,”</em> but the-(others), <em>“For the Messiah does┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└ come out-of [the] Galilee, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>does-he?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>Did┘not the scripture└say that out-of the seed of-David and from Bethlehem the village where David was</em><em> the Messiah comes</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>And some of them were-wanting to-arrest him, but nobody laid [the] hands on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>So the officers went to the chief priests and Pharisees; and those (men) said to-them, <em>“On-account-of what did-you┘not└bring him?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>The officers answered, <em>“Never did┘(a) man└speak thus.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>Then the Pharisees answered them, <em>“You are┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└deceived too, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>are-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>Not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>any of the rulers </em><em>believed in him or of the Pharisees, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>have-they?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>But this [the] crowd the-one not knowing the </em><em>L</em><em>aw is</em><em> </em><em>accursed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>Nicodemus says to them (the-one having-come to him [at-the] earlier, being one of them), <strong><sup>51</sup></strong><em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-us does┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└condemn the/a </em><em>man unless</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> it┘first└hears from him, and knows what he-is-doing, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>does-it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>They-answered and said to-him, <em>“You are not</em><em>┘ from [the] Galilee too, └are-you?</em><em> </em><em>Search and see that out-of [the] Galilee (a) prophet does┘not└arise.”</em> <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>And they-went each-one to the house of-him.</span>
