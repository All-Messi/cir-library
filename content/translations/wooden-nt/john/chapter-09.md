## John Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And passing by, he-saw (a) man blind from birth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And the disciples of-him asked him, saying, <em>“Rabbi, who-sinned, this-one or the parents of-him, that he was-born blind?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus answered<em>, “Neither this-one sinned nor the parents of-him, but that the works of-[the] God might-be-manifested in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>It-is-necessary for-us to-work the works of-the-One having-sent me while it-is-day.</em><em> </em><em>Night is-coming when nobody </em><em>is-able</em><em> </em><em>to-work</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>When I-am in the world, I-am (the) light of-the world.</em><em>”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Saying these-things, he-spit on-the-ground and made mud out-of the spit, and smeared┘the mud└on him on the eyelids, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and said to-him, <em>“Go wash in the Pool of-[the</em><em>] Siloam,”</em> [which is-translated ‘Sent’]. So he-went-away and washed and came seeing. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Then the neighbors and the-ones seeing him [the] previously that he-was (a) beggar, started-saying, <em>“Is</em><em> this not the-one sitting and begging?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Others were-saying [that], <em>“This is.”</em> Others were-saying, <em>“No, but he is like him.”</em> That-one said [that], <em>“I am</em><em> (he)</em><em>.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So they-started-saying to-him, <em>“How [then]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> were┘the eyes of-you└opened?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> That-one answered, <em>“The man [the] called Jesus made mud and smeared┘(it)└on the eyes of-me</em><em>,</em><em> and said to-me [that], “Go to [the] Siloam and wash.</em><em> </em><em>Then going-away and washing, I-looked-up.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And they-said to-him, <em>“Where is that-One?”</em> He-says, <em>“I-do┘not└know.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They-bring him to the Pharisees, the once blind-one. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Now it-was Sabbath on which day [the] Jesus made the mud and opened-up the eyes of-him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So again the Pharisees also started-asking him how he came-to-see. And the/he said to-them, <em>“He-put mud on the eyes of-me, and I-washed and I-see.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then some of the Pharisees said, <em>“This [the] man is not from [the] God, because he-does┘not└keep the Sabbath.”</em><em> </em> But others were-saying, <em>“How is (a) sinner man able to-do such signs?</em><em>”</em> And (a) division was among them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then they-say to-the blind-one again, <em>“What do┘you└say about him, because he-opened the eyes of-you?</em><em>”</em><em> </em> And the/he said [that], <em>“He-is (a) prophet.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then the Jews did┘not└believe about him that he-was blind and saw until<sup>2</sup> they-called the parents of-him the-one having-received-sight. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And they-asked them, saying, <em>“Is this the son of-you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>, whom you say that he-was-born blind?</em><em> </em><em>How then does-he┘now└see?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then the parents of-him answered and said, <em>“We-know that this is the son of-us and that he-was-born blind.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But how he-sees now we-do┘not└know, or who opened the eyes of-him we-do┘not└know.</em><em> </em><em>Ask him, he-has adulthood; he will-speak for himself.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The parents of-him said these-things because they-were-afraid-of the Jews; for the Jew already agreed that if anybody confessed him as-Messiah, he-would-be excommunicated-from-the-synagogue. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>On-account-of this, the parents of-him said [that], <em>“He-has adulthood; ask him.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then they-summoned the man who was blind [of] (a) second (time), and said to-him, <em>“Give glory to-[the] God.</em><em> </em><em>We know that this [the] man is (a) sinner.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then that-one answered, <em>“Whether he-is (a) sinner I-do┘not└know.</em><em> </em><em>One-thing I-do-know:</em><em> </em><em>being blind, now I-see.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then they-said to-him, <em>“What did-he-do to-you?</em><em> </em><em>How did-he-open the eyes of-you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He-answered them, <em>“I-told you already and you-did┘not└listen.</em><em> </em><em>Why </em><em>do-you-want</em><em> </em><em>to-hear</em><em> (it) again?</em><em> </em><em>You-do┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└want </em><em>to-</em><em>become</em><em> his</em><em> disciples, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>do-you? </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And they-insulted him and said, <em>“You are (a) disciple</em><em> of that-One; but we are disciples of-Moses.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>We know that [the] God spoke to-Moses, but we-do</em><em>┘not└</em><em>know this-One whence he-is.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The man answered and said, <em>“For in this is the marvelous-thing:</em><em> </em><em>that you do┘not└know whence he-is, and he-opened the eyes of-me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>We-know that [the] God does┘hear└hear sinners, but if anybody is God-fearing and does the will of-him, he-hears him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>From [the] eternity it-was┘not└heard that anybody opened eyes of-(a) ┘born└blind (man).</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>If this-</em><em>One were not from God, he would┘not└</em><em>be-able to-do anything.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And they-answered him, <em>“You were┘whol</em><em>y└born in sins, and you are-tryi</em><em>ng-to-teach us?”</em><em> </em>And they-cast him out (of the synagogue).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus heard that they-cast him out; and, having-found him, he-said, <em>“</em><em>Do-you-believe</em><em> in the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> That-one answered and said, <em>“And who is-he, Sir, that I-may-believe in him?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> [The] Jesus said to-him, <em>“You-have┘both└seen him and that-One is the-One speaking with you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/he said, <em>“I-believe, L</em><em>ord”</em>; and he-worshiped him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And [the] Jesus said, <em>“For judgment I came into [the] world, in-order-that the-ones not seeing might-see and the ones seeing might-become-blind.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The-ones being with him from the Pharisees overheard (it), and said to-him, <em>“We are┘not</em><em><sup>┘┘</sup></em><em>└blind too, </em><em><sup>└└</sup></em><em>are we?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> [The] Jesus said to-them, <em>“If you-were blind, you would</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em>┘not└ ha</em><em>ve sin; but now you-say [that] ‘We-see’</em><em>; the-sin of-you </em><em>remains</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>
