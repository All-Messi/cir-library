## John Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> And passing by, he-saw (a) man blind from birth. 2And the disciples of-him asked him, saying, "Rabbi, who-sinned, this-one or the parents of-him, that he was-born blind?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus answered, "Neither this-one sinned nor the parents of-him, but that the works of-[the] God might-be-manifested in him. 4It-is-necessary for-us to-work the works of-the-One having-sent me while it-is-day. Night is-coming when nobody is-able to-work. 5When I-am in the world, I-am (the) light of-the world."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Saying these-things, he-spit on-the-ground and made mud out-of the spit, and smeared┘the mud└on him on the eyelids, 7and said to-him, "Go wash in the Pool of-[the] Siloam," [which is-translated 'Sent']. So he-went-away and washed and came seeing. 8Then the neighbors and the-ones seeing him [the] previously that he-was (a) beggar, started-saying, "Is this not the-one sitting and begging?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Others were-saying [that], "This is."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> So they-started-saying to-him, "How [then]ms were┘the eyes of-you└opened?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> That-one answered, "The man [the] called Jesus made mud and smeared┘(it)└on the eyes of-me, and said to-me [that], "Go to [the] Siloam and wash. Then going-away and washing, I-looked-up."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> And they-said to-him, "Where is that-One?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> They-bring him to the Pharisees, the once blind-one. 14Now it-was Sabbath on which day [the] Jesus made the mud and opened-up the eyes of-him. 15So again the Pharisees also started-asking him how he came-to-see. And the/he said to-them, "He-put mud on the eyes of-me, and I-washed and I-see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Then some of the Pharisees said, "This [the] man is not from [the] God, because he-does┘not└keep the Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then they-say to-the blind-one again, "What do┘you└say about him, because he-opened the eyes of-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Then the Jews did┘not└believe about him that he-was blind and saw until2 they-called the parents of-him the-one having-received-sight. 19And they-asked them, saying, "Is this the son of-youpl, whom you say that he-was-born blind? How then does-he┘now└see?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Then the parents of-him answered and said, "We-know that this is the son of-us and that he-was-born blind. 21But how he-sees now we-do┘not└know, or who opened the eyes of-him we-do┘not└know. Ask him, he-has adulthood; he will-speak for himself."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The parents of-him said these-things because they-were-afraid-of the Jews; for the Jew already agreed that if anybody confessed him as-Messiah, he-would-be excommunicated-from-the-synagogue. 23On-account-of this, the parents of-him said [that], "He-has adulthood; ask him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then they-summoned the man who was blind [of] (a) second (time), and said to-him, "Give glory to-[the] God. We know that this [the] man is (a) sinner."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then that-one answered, "Whether he-is (a) sinner I-do┘not└know. One-thing I-do-know: being blind, now I-see."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then they-said to-him, "What did-he-do to-you? How did-he-open the eyes of-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> He-answered them, "I-told you already and you-did┘not└listen. Why do-you-want to-hear (it) again? You-do┘not┘┘└want to-become his disciples, └└do-you?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> And they-insulted him and said, "You are (a) disciple of that-One; but we are disciples of-Moses. 29We know that [the] God spoke to-Moses, but we-do┘not└know this-One whence he-is."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The man answered and said, "For in this is the marvelous-thing: that you do┘not└know whence he-is, and he-opened the eyes of-me. 31We-know that [the] God does┘hear└hear sinners, but if anybody is God-fearing and does the will of-him, he-hears him. 32From [the] eternity it-was┘not└heard that anybody opened eyes of-(a) ┘born└blind (man). 33If this-One were not from God, he would┘not└be-able to-do anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> And they-answered him, "You were┘wholy└born in sins, and you are-trying-to-teach us?" And they-cast him out (of the synagogue).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Jesus heard that they-cast him out; and, having-found him, he-said, "Do-you-believe in the Son of-[the] Man?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> That-one answered and said, "And who is-he, Sir, that I-may-believe in him?" 37[The] Jesus said to-him, "You-have┘both└seen him and that-One is the-One speaking with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> And the/he said, "I-believe, Lord"; and he-worshiped him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> And [the] Jesus said, "For judgment I came into [the] world, in-order-that the-ones not seeing might-see and the ones seeing might-become-blind."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The-ones being with him from the Pharisees overheard (it), and said to-him, "We are┘not┘┘└blind too, └└are we?" 41[The] Jesus said to-them, "If you-were blind, you would2┘not└ have sin; but now you-say [that] 'We-see'; the-sin of-you remains."</span>
