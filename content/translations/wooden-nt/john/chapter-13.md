## John Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now before the feast of-the Passover, [the] Jesus, knowing that the hour of-him came in-order-that he-might-leave from this [the] world to the Father, having-loved [the] his-own [the] in the world, loved them to (the) end. 2And dinner coming, the devil already having-entered into the/his heart that Judas, Simon Iscariot, might-betray him, 3[Jesus,] knowing that the Father gave all-things to-him into the/his hands and that he-had-come from God and was-going to [the] God, 4gets-up from the meal and puts the/his outer garment (aside) and having-taken (a) towel, draped it (over his shoulder). 5Then he-puts water in the/a basin and began to-wash the feet of-the disciples and to-dry-(them)-off with-the towel with-which he-was draped. 6Then he-comes to Simon Peter. He-says, "Lord, are┘you└washing the feet of-me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus answered and said to-him, "What I am-doing you do┘not└understand now, but you-will-understand after these-things."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Peter says to-him, "You-will┘certainly not└wash the feet of-me forever3."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Simon Peter says to-him, "Lord, not the feet of-me only, but also the/my hands and the/my head." 10[The] Jesus says to-him, "The-one washed does┘not└have need to-be-washed except2 the/his feet, but is all clean; and youpl are clean, but not all." 11For he-knew the-one betraying him; on-account-of this he-said [that], "You-are not all clean."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So when he-washed the feet of-them and took the clothes of-him and sat-down again, he-said to-them, "Do-you-know what I-have-done to-you? 13You call me, '[The] teacher,' and 'Lord,' and you-say well, for I-am. 14So if I washed the feet of-you, [the] Lord and [the] Teacher, you also ought to-wash one-another's feet. 15For I-have-given you (an) example in-order-that as I did to-you, you also should-do. 16Truly, truly, I-say to-you, (a) slave is not greater than–the Lord of-him; neither (is a) messenger greater than-the-one having-sent him. 17If you know these-things, you-are blessed if you-do them. 18I-am┘not└speaking about all of-you. I know whom I-chose, but in-order-that the scripture might-be-fulfilled,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> From now-on I-tell you, the-one receiving somebody I-will-send receives me, and the-one receiving me receives the-One having-sent me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Having-said these-things, [the] Jesus was-troubled in-the spirit, and testified and said, "Truly, truly, I-tell you that one of you will-betray me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The disciples started-looking at one-another, perplexed about whom he-is-speaking. 23One of the disciples of-him was reclining-at-table on the chest-side of-[the] Jesus, whom [the] Jesus loved. 24So Simon Peter motioned to-this-one to-ask who it┘would└be about whom he-is-speaking. 25So that-one, leaning back thus on the chest of-[the] Jesus, says to-him, "Lord, who is-it?" 26[The] Jesus answers, "It-is that-one to-whom I dip the piece-of-bread and give (it) to-him." Then having-dipped the piece-of-bread, he-takes and gives (it) to-Judas, Simon Iscariot. 27And after the piece-of-bread, then [the] Satan entered into that-one. Then [the] Jesus says to-him, "What you-are-doing do quickly." 28[But]ms nobody of-the-ones reclining-at-table knew unto what he-spoke to-him. 29For some were-supposing, since Judas used-to-have the money-pouch, that [the] Jesus said to-him, "Buy what we-have need for the feast," or that he-give something to-the poor. 30Then having-taken the piece-of-bread, that-one went-out straightway. And it-was night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When then he-went-out, Jesus says, "Now the Son of-[the] Man will-be-glorified, and [the] God will-be-glorified in him. 32[If [the] God will-be-glorified in him]ms, indeed [the] God will-glorify him in him, and he-will-glorify him soon. 33Children, yet (a) little (while) I-am with you. You-will-seek me, and as I-told the Jews [that], 'Where I am-going you-are┘not└able to-go,' and now I-say (it) to-you. 34I-am-giving you (a) new commandment: that you-love one-another—even-as I-loved you, that you also love one-another. 35By this they-will-know that you-are disciples to-me—if you-have love in one-another."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Simon Peter says, "Lord, where are-you-going?" Jesus said [to-him]ms, "Where I-am-going you-are┘not└able to-follow now. But you-will-follow later." 37[The] Peter says to-him, "Lord, on-account-of what am-I┘not└able to-follow you now." I-will-lay-down the life of-me for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Jesus answered, "Will-you-lay-down the life of-you for me? Truly, truly, I-tell you, (a) rooster will┘not└crow until2 you-deny me three-times."</span>
