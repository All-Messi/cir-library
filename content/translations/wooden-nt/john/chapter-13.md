## John Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now before the feast of-the Passover, [the] Jesus, knowing that the hour of-him came in-order-that he-might-leave from this [the] world to the Father, having-loved [the] his-own [the] in the world, loved them to (the) end. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And dinner coming, the devil already having-entered into the/his heart that Judas, Simon Iscariot, might-betray him, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>[Jesus,] knowing that the Father gave all-things to-him into the/his hands and that he-had-come from God and was-going to [the] God, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>gets-up from the meal and puts the/his outer garment (aside) and having-taken (a) towel, draped it (over his shoulder). <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Then he-puts water in the/a basin and began to-wash the feet of-the disciples and to-dry-(them)-off with-the towel with-which he-was draped. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then he-comes to Simon Peter. He-says, <em>“Lord, are┘you└washing the feet of-me?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus answered and said to-him, <em>“What I am-doing you do┘not└understand now, but you-will-understand after these-things.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Peter says to-him, <em>“You-wil</em><em>l┘certainly not└wash the feet of-me forever</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>.”</em><em> </em> Jesus answered him, <em>“If I-do┘not└wash you, you-do┘not└have (a) part with me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Simon Peter says to-him, <em>“Lord, not the feet of-me only, but also the/my hands and</em><em> </em><em>the/my head.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>[The] Jesus says to-him, <em>“The-one washed does┘not└have need to-be-washed except</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> the/his </em><em>feet, but</em><em> is all clean;</em><em> and you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> are clean, but not all.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>For he-knew the-one betraying him; on-account-of this he-said [that], <em>“You-are not all clean.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So when he-washed the feet of-them and took the clothes of-him and sat-down again, he-said to-them, <em>“Do-you-know what I-have-done to-you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>You call </em><em>me, ‘[</em><em>The</em><em>]</em><em> teacher,’</em><em> and ‘Lord,’ and </em><em>you-say</em><em> well, for I-am.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> if I washed the feet </em><em>of-you</em><em>, [the] Lord and [t</em><em>h</em><em>e] Teacher, you also ought </em><em>to-wash</em><em> </em><em>one-another’s</em><em> feet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>For I-have-given you (an) example in-order-that as I did to-you, you also should-do. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Truly, truly</em><em>,</em><em> I-say to-you</em><em>, (a) slave is not greater than–the Lord of-him; neither (is a) messenger greater than-the-one having-sent him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>If you know </em><em>these-things</em><em>, </em><em>you-are</em><em> blessed if </em><em>you-do</em><em> them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>I-am┘not└speaking about </em><em>all of</em><em>-you.</em><em> </em><em>I know whom </em><em>I-chose</em><em>, but </em><em>in-order-that</em><em> the scripture </em><em>might-be-fulfilled</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>“The-one eating the bread of-me lifted-up the heel of-him against me.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>From now-on I-tell you, the-one receiving somebody I-will-send receives me, and the-one receiving me receives the-One having-sent me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Having-said these-things, [the] Jesus was-troubled in-the spirit, and testified and said, <em>“Truly, truly, I-tell you that one of you will-betray me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> The disciples started-looking at one-another, perplexed about whom he-is-speaking. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>One of the disciples of-him was reclining-at-table on the chest-side of-[the] Jesus, whom [the] Jesus loved. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So Simon Peter motioned to-this-one to-ask who it┘would└be about whom he-is-speaking. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>So that-one, leaning back thus on the chest of-[the] Jesus, says to-him, <em>“Lord, who is-it?”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>[The] Jesus answers, <em>“It-is that-one to-whom I dip the piece-of-bread and give (it) to-him.”</em><em> </em>Then having-dipped the piece-of-bread, he-takes and gives (it) to-Judas, Simon Iscariot. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>And after the piece-of-bread, then [the] Satan entered into that-one. Then [the] Jesus says to-him, <em>“What you-are-doing do quickly.”</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>[But]<sup>ms</sup> nobody of-the-ones reclining-at-table knew unto what he-spoke to-him. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>For some were-supposing, since Judas used-to-have the money-pouch, that [the] Jesus said to-him, <em>“Buy what we-have need for the feast,” </em>or that he-give something to-the poor. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Then having-taken the piece-of-bread, that-one went-out straightway. And it-was night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When then he-went-out, Jesus says, <em>“Now the Son of-[the] </em><em>M</em><em>an will-be-glorified, and [the] God will-be-glorified in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>[If </em><em>[</em><em>the</em><em>]</em><em> God will-be-glorified in him]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>, indeed [the] God will-glorify him in him, and he-will-glorify him soon.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Children, yet (a) little (while) </em><em>I-am</em><em> with you.</em><em> </em><em>You-will-seek me, and as I-told the Jews [that], ‘Where I </em><em>am-going</em><em> you-are┘not└able to-go,’ and now I-say (it) to-you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>I-am-giving you </em><em>(</em><em>a) new commandment</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>that you-</em><em>love</em><em> one-another—even-a</em><em>s I-loved you, that you also </em><em>love</em><em> one-another.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>By this they-will-know that you-are disciples to-me—if you-have love in one-another.</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Simon Peter says, <em>“Lord, where are-you-going?”</em><em> </em> Jesus said [to-him]<sup>ms</sup>, <em>“Where I-am-going you-are┘not└able to-follow</em><em> now</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>But you-will-follow later.”</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>[The] Peter says to-him, <em>“Lord, on-account-of what am-I┘not└able to-follow you</em><em> now</em><em>.” </em><em>I-will-lay-down the life of-me for you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“Will-you-lay-down the life of-you for me?</em><em> </em><em>Truly, truly, I-tell you, (a) rooster will┘not└crow until</em><em><sup>2</sup></em><em> you-deny me three-times.</em><em>”</em></span>
