## John Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Having-said these-things, Jesus went-out with the disciples of-him beyond the wadi [the] Kedron, where there-was (a) garden, into which he and the disciples of-him went. 2And Judas the betrayer also knew the place because Jesus often went there with the disciples of-him. 3Then [the] Judas, having-taken the/a cohort and servants from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with torches and lamps and weapons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then Jesus, knowing all the-things coming on him, went-out and said to-them, "Whom are-you-seeking?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They-answered him, "Jesus the Nazarene." And Judas, the-one betraying him, also stood with them. 6Then when he-said to-them, "I am (he)," they-went-away into the-things behind and fell to-the-ground. 7Then again he-asked them, "Whom are-you-seeking?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus answered, "I-said to you that I am (Jesus). If then you-are-looking-for me, let these [to]-go"—9in-order-that the word that he-spoke might-be-fulfilled [that], "Whom you-have-given me—I-did┘not└lose any of them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Simon Peter, having (a) sword, drew it and struck the servant of-the high priest, and cut-off the right [the] ear of-him. And (the) name to-the servant was Malchus. 11Then [the] Jesus said to-[the] Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath. The cup that the Father has-given me—will-I┘not└drink it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the cohort and the tribune and the officers of-the Jews arrested [the] Jesus and bound him, 13and led (him) to Annas first, for he-was (the) father-in-law of-[the] Caiaphas, who was high priest during-that [the] year. 14Now Caiaphas was the-one having-advised the Jews that one man's dying for the people was-better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And Simon Peter was-following [the] Jesus, and another disciple (was-following him). And that [the] disciple was known to-the high priest. 16But [the] Peter stood at the gate outside. Then the [other] the disciple the-one known to-the high priest went-out and spoke to-the gatekeeper and brought┘[the] Peter└in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then the/a servant-girl, the gatekeeper, says to-[the] Peter, "You are not┘one of the disciples of-this [the] man also,└are-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now the servants and the officers had-been-standing, having-made (a) charcoal-fire, because it-was cold. And they-were-warming-themselves. And [the] Peter also was standing with them and warming-himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the high priest asked [the] Jesus about the disciples of-him and the teaching of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Jesus answered him, "I openly have-spoken to-the world. I always taught in (the) synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble, and in secret I-said nothing. 21Why are-you-asking me? Ask the-ones having-heard what I-said to-them. Behold, these know what-things I said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And he having-said these-things, one of-the officers standing-beside (him) gave [the] Jesus (a) slap, having-said, "Do-you-answer the high priest so?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus answered him, "If I-spoke in-an-evil-way, testify about the evil; but if well, why are-you-slapping me?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then [the] Annas sent him-away bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they-said to-him, "You are not┘also of the disciples of-him└are-you?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> One of the servants of-the high priest, being (a) kinsman whose [the] ear Peter cut-off, says, "Did-I┘not└see you in the garden with him?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Again then Peter denied, and immediately (a) rooster crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then they-lead [the] Jesus from [the] Caiaphas into the Praetorium. And it-was early and they-themselves did┘not└enter into the Praetorium, in-order-that they-might┘not└be-defiled, but might-eat the Passover. 29(The) Pilate went out to them and says, "What charge are-you-bringing [against]ms this [the] man?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They-answered and said to-him, "If this-one were not one-doing evil, we┘would not└have-delivered him to-you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then [the] Pilate said to-them, "Take him yourselves and judge him according-to the Law of-you." The Jews said to-him, "It-is┘not└lawful for-us to-execute anybody"—32(in-order-that the word of-[the] Jesus might-be-fulfilled that he-said signifying by-what-kind-of death he-would die).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then [the] Pilate entered again into the Praetorium and called [the] Jesus and said to-him, "Are you the king of-the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus answered, "Of yourself are┘you└saying this-thing or did┘others└speak to-you about me?" 35[The] Pilate answered, "I am not┘(a) Jew,└am-I? [The] your (the) nation and the high priests delivered you to-me. What did-you-do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Jesus answered, "[The] my [the] 'kingdom' is not of this [the] world. If [the] my [the] 'kingdom' were of this [the] world, [the] my [the] officers [would]ms be-struggling in-order-that I-might┘not└be-delivered to-the Jews. But now [the] my [the] 'kingdom' is not from-here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Then [the] Pilate said to-him, "You are (a) king, then┘, are you└not?" [The] Jesus answered, "You say that I-am (a) king. I have-been-born into this and unto this I-have-come into the world, in-order-that I-might-testify to-the truth. Everybody [the] being of the truth hears the voice of-me." And having-said, he-went-out again to the Jews and says to-them, "I find no-fault in him. 39And/But (a) custom is to-you that I-(should)-release one-(man) to-you at the Passover. So do-you-want (that) I-release to-you the king of-the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Then they shouted again, saying, "Not this-(man), but [the] Barabbas." Now [the] Barabbas was (an) insurrectionist.</span>
