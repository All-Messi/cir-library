## John Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Having-said these-things, Jesus went-out with the disciples of-him beyond the wadi [the] Kedron, where there-was (a) garden, into which he and the disciples of-him went. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>And Judas the betrayer also knew the place because Jesus often went there with the disciples of-him. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then [the] Judas, having-taken the/a cohort and servants from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with torches and lamps and weapons.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Then Jesus, knowing all the-things coming on him, went-out and said to-them, <em>“Who</em><em>m are</em><em>-you-seek</em><em>ing</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They-answered him, <em>“Jesus the Nazarene.”</em> He-says to-them, <em>“I am (he).”</em> And Judas, the-one betraying him, also stood with them. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Then when he-said to-them, <em>“I am (he),” </em>they-went-away into the-things behind and fell to-the-ground. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Then again he-asked them, <em>“Whom are-you-seeking?”</em> And they/the-ones said, <em>“Jesus the Nazarene.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“I-said to you that I am (</em><em>Jesus).</em><em> </em><em>If then you-are-lookin</em><em>g-for me, let these [to]-go</em><em>”</em>—<strong><sup>9</sup></strong>in-order-that the word that he-spoke might-be-fulfilled [that], <em>“Whom you-have-given me—I-did┘not└lose any of them.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Then Simon Peter, having (a) sword, drew it and struck the servant of-the high priest, and cut-off the right [the] ear of-him. And (the) name to-the servant was Malchus. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Then [the] Jesus said to-[the] Peter, <em>“Put the sword into</em><em> the sheath</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The cup </em><em>that the Father has-given me—wi</em><em>ll-I┘not└drink it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Then the cohort and the tribune and the officers of-the Jews arrested [the] Jesus and bound him, <sup>13</sup>and led (him) to Annas first, for he-was (the) father-in-law of-[the] Caiaphas, who was high priest during-that [the] year. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Now Caiaphas was the-one having-advised the Jews that one man’s dying for the people was-better.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> And Simon Peter was-following [the] Jesus, and another disciple (was-following him). And that [the] disciple was known to-the high priest. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But [the] Peter stood at the gate outside. Then the [other] the disciple the-one known to-the high priest went-out and spoke to-the gatekeeper and brought┘[the] Peter└in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Then the/a servant-girl, the gatekeeper, says to-[the] Peter, <em>“You are not┘one of the disciples of-this [the] man </em><em>also,└</em><em>are-you?”</em><em> </em> That-one says, <em>“I-am not”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Now the servants and the officers had-been-standing, having-made (a) charcoal-fire, because it-was cold. And they-were-warming-themselves. And [the] Peter also was standing with them and warming-himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Then the high priest asked [the] Jesus about the disciples of-him and the teaching of-him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Jesus answered him, <em>“I </em><em>openly have-spoken to-the world.</em><em> I always taught in (the) synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble, and in secret I-said nothing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Why </em><em>are-you-asking</em><em> me?</em><em> </em><em>Ask the-ones having-heard what I-said to-them</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Behold, these know what-thin</em><em>gs I said.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> And he having-said these-things, one of-the officers standing-beside (him) gave [the] Jesus (a) slap, having-said, <em>“Do-you-answer the high priest so?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus answered him, <em>“If I-spoke </em><em>in-an-evil-way</em><em>, testify about the evil; but if well, why are-you-slapping me?” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then [the] Annas sent him-away bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they-said to-him, <em>“You are not┘also of the disciples of-him└are-you?</em><em>”</em><em> </em> That-one answered and said, <em>“I am not.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> One of the servants of-the high priest, being (a) kinsman whose [the] ear Peter cut-off, says, <em>“Did</em><em>-I┘not└</em><em>see</em><em> you in the garden with him?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Again then Peter denied, and immediately (a) rooster crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Then they-lead [the] Jesus from [the] Caiaphas into the Praetorium. And it-was early and they-themselves did┘not└enter into the Praetorium, in-order-that they-might┘not└be-defiled, but might-eat the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> (The) Pilate went out to them and says, <em>“What charge are-you-bringing [against]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em> this [the] man?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They-answered and said to-him, <em>“If this-one </em><em>were</em><em> not one-doing evil, we┘would not└have-delivered him to-you.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Then [the] Pilate said to-them, <em>“Take him yourselves and judge him according-to the </em><em>L</em><em>aw of-you.”</em><em> </em> The Jews said to-him, <em>“It-is┘not└lawful for-us to-exe</em><em>cute anybody”</em>—<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>(in-order-that the word of-[the] Jesus might-be-fulfilled that he-said signifying by-what-kind-of death he-would die).</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Then [the] Pilate entered again into the Praetorium and called [the] Jesus and said to-him, <em>“Are you the king of-the Jews?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“Of yourself are┘you└saying this-thing or did┘others└speak to-you about me?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> [The] Pilate answered, <em>“I am not┘(a) </em><em>Jew,└</em><em>am-I?</em><em> </em><em>[The] your</em><em> (the) nation and the high priests delivered you to-me.</em><em> </em><em>What did-you-do?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“[The] my [the] ‘kingdom’ is not of this [the] world.</em><em> </em><em>If [the] my [the] ‘kingdom’ were of this [the] world, [the] my [the] officers [would]</em><em><sup>ms </sup></em><em>be-struggling in-order-that I-migh</em><em>t</em><em>┘</em><em>not└</em><em>be-delivered to-the Jews.</em><em> </em><em>But now [the] my [the] ‘kingdom’ is not from-here.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> Then [the] Pilate said to-him, <em>“</em><em>You are (a) king, then┘, are you└not?”</em><em> </em> [The] Jesus answered, <em>“You say that I-am (a) king.</em><em> </em><em>I have-been-born into this and unto this I-have-come into the world, in-order-that I-might-testify to-the truth.</em><em> </em><em>Everybody [the] being of the truth hears the voice of-me.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> [The] Pilate says to-him, <em>“What is truth?”</em> And having-said, he-went-out again to the Jews and says to-them, <em>“I find no-</em><em>fault</em><em> in him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>And/But (a) custom is to-you th</em><em>at I-(should)-release one-(man)</em><em> to-you at the Passover.</em><em> </em><em>So do-you-want (that) I-release to-you the king of-the Jews?</em><em>”</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Then they shouted again, saying, <em>“Not this-(man)</em><em>,</em><em> but [the] Barabbas.”</em><em> </em>Now [the] Barabbas was (an) insurrectionist.</span>
