NAHUM

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1The Oracle of Nahum

The Book of the Vision of Nahum

Yahveh’s Anger Against Nineveh

2Yahveh is an exclusive God

that avenges with anger.

He carries out vengeance on his adversaries;

he stores up anger for his enemies.

3He doesn’t get mad quick,

but he does exert his power;

he doesn’t let the guilty go free.

He displays his power in storms and tornadoes;

clouds are dust beneath his feet.	Nah 1:1-3

4At his command seas and rivers dry up,

Bashan and Carmel wither,

Lebanon’s blossoms wilt.

5In his presence, mountains quake and hills melt;

earth trembles and its people perish.			Nah 1:4-5

6Who can withstand his indignation?

Who can endure his furious anger?

He pours out wrath like fire

and cracks rocks in pieces.

7Yahveh is good, a fortress in times of trouble;

he knows who takes refuge in him.

8But with an overwhelming flood

he brings his opponents to a complete end

and chases his enemies into the dark.	Nah 1:6-8

9Whatever you’re plotting against Yahveh

he’ll put an end to;

he doesn’t need to take revenge twice.

10His enemies, like tangled thornbushes and staggering people,

he’ll completely burn up like stubble.

11Who is this counselor of yours

that plots against Yahveh with bad advice?

12This is what Yahveh says,

“Though strong and numerous,

the Assyrians will perish and disappear.

Though I’ve let them punish you before,

I won’t let them do it again.

13I’ll break their yoke off your neck

and tear their shackles off your feet.”	Nah 1:9-13

14Yahveh has issued an edict about you, Assyria:

“No offspring will carry on your name;

I’ll remove idol and image

from the temples of your gods.

I’ll get your grave ready

because you’re contemptible.” 	Nah 1:14

15Over the mountains, a messenger is coming with good news,

someone that’s announcing peace!

Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows;

those wicked invaders will never attack you again.

I’ll completely destroy them.	Nah 1:15

Nineveh to Fall

2:1Attackers are advancing to crush you, Nineveh.

Man the ramparts, guard the road,

muster your forces, get ready.

2Yahveh is going to restore majesty to Jacob,

splendor to Israel;

because plunderers have stripped it

and cut the branches off its grapevines.	Nah 2:1-2

3The shields of the valiant flash red;

the soldiers wear scarlet uniforms;

the chariots glitter like steel

as they muster into formation;

they rattle their cypress spears.

4The chariots rush madly down the streets

and race wildly around the squares.

They shine like torches,

dashing here and there like lightning.

5The king orders his officers;

they scramble around in their haste

and hurry to the wall to set up defenses.

6But their enemy tears open the gates of the river

to undermine the palace.

7They strip it and loot it.

Its young women moan like pigeons

and beat their chests.	Nah 2:3-7

8Nineveh is like a leaking reservoir.

“Stop! Stop! deserting residents!”

but none of them even look back.

9Plunder the silver!

Plunder the gold!

Treasure without limit,

wealth of all kinds!

10The city is desolate and in ruins!

Hearts melt and knees knock!

Loins throb in pain; faces turn pale!			Nah 2:8-10

11Where’s that lion’s den now,

that feeding place for young lions,

where the lion brought its prey,

where its cubs stayed unthreatened,

12where it tore off enough for its cubs

and strangled prey for its lionesses?

It filled its lair with prey, with mutilated meat.

13Yahveh of Hosts says,

“I’m your enemy.

I’ll burn your chariots in smoke,

kill your young lions with a sword,

and leave you with no nations to prey on.

Your ambassadors won’t be bringing reports anymore.”

Nah 2:11-1

Woe to Nineveh

3:1Misfortune awaits bloody Nineveh,

filled with lies and pillage

and plunder without limit.

2Do you hear the crack of whips, rattling wheels,

galloping horses, rushing chariots!?

3Do you see cavalry charging,

swords flashing, spears gleaming,

many slain, piles of corpses,

countless bodies,

and people stumbling over them!?

4That’s all because of your continual prostitution,

that charming mistress of sorceries;

you sell nations by your prostitution,

countries by your sorceries.

5“I’m your enemy,” Yahveh of hosts says;

“I’ll pull your skirts up over your faces,

and show the nations your nakedness,

the kingdoms your disgrace.

6I’ll throw filth on you

make you disgusting,

make a spectacle out of you!

7Everybody that sees you will back away and say,

‘Nineveh lies in ruins!

Who’s going to grieve over her?’

Where will her comforters come from?”	Nah 3:1-7

8Are you any better than Thebes

that sat by the Nile

with water all around it,

with the river as its wall and rampart?

9Nubia was its strength,

Egypt too, with no limit;

Put and the Libyans allied with it.

10Yet Thebes was carried away into captivity.

Its little ones were dashed to pieces

at the head of every street;

they cast lots for its honorable men

and tied up its leaders with chains.			Nah 3:8-10

11You’ll get drunk too, Nineveh, go into a stupor,

and look for refuge from your enemy.

12Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit;

if you shake them, their figs fall into your mouth.

13Your troops are women!

Your gates stand wide open for your enemies;

fires consume your bars.	Nah 3:11-13

14Draw water for your siege!

Strengthen your fortifications!

Get in the clay pits to tread mortar!

Put it in brick molds!

15But fire will burn you up;

the sword will cut you down

and eat you up like locusts.

Though you have multiplied like crawling locusts

and propagated like grasshoppers,

16though your traders have come to outnumber the stars—

nevertheless, like crawling locusts

your enemy will strip your land and fly away.

17Though your guards are also like grasshoppers

and your marshals resemble locust swarms

settling in stone walls on a cold day,

when the sun comes up, they fly away,

nobody knows where.					Nah 3:14-17

18Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria;

your nobles lie dead on the ground.

Your people have scattered to the mountains,

and there’s nobody to round them up.

19There’s no relief for your injury;

your wound won’t heal.

Everybody that hears about your destruction

claps their hands.

Who hasn’t come under your endless cruelty?	Nah 3:15b-19
