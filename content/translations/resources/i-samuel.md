I SAMUEL

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

The Birth of Samuel

1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham Ben-Elihu (Ben-Tohu Ben-Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.

3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to Yahveh of hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But Yahveh had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to Yahveh’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”	1 Sam 1:1-8

9Hannah got up after the meal, while Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of Yahveh’s Tabernacle. 10She was distressed, and prayed and cried bitterly. 11She took a vow,

“Yahveh of hosts, if you’ll look on my grief and give me a son, I’ll give him to youY all his life. He’ll never shave his head.”

12Eli was watching her mouth as she prayed. 13Her lips were moving, but she wasn’t making any sound. Eli thought she was drunk.

14“How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away.”

15“No, my lord, I’m depressed. I haven’t drunk wine or alcohol. I’m pouring out my heart to Yahveh. 16Don’t consider me some worthless woman. I’ve been speaking out of my great anguish and distress.”

17“May God grant your petition.”

18“Be gracious to me.” So she went away and ate and wasn’t sad anymore.

19They got up early and worshiped in Yahveh’s presence and went back to Ramah. Elkanah had relations with Hannah, and Yahveh remembered her. 20In due time, she had a son and named him Samuel, “Because I’ve ‘asked’ Yahveh for him.”	1 Sam 1:9-20

Hannah Dedicates Samuel

21Elkanah went up with his whole family to offer the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. 22But Hannah wouldn’t go, “I won’t go till I’ve weaned him. Then I’ll present him to Yahveh to stay there.”

23Elkanah said, “Do what you think’s best. Wait till you’ve weaned him. May Yahveh confirm his word.”

She stayed and nursed him till she weaned him. 24Then she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, 1.1 bushel 1 ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She took him to Yahveh’s Tabernacle in Shiloh even though the child was so young. 25They butchered the bull and took the boy to Eli. 26She said,

“As sure as you’re alive, Sir, I’m the woman that stood here beside you, praying to Yahveh. 27I prayed for this boy, and Yahveh gave me what I asked for. 28I’ve dedicated him to Yahveh for as long as he lives.

He worshiped Yahveh there.	1 Sam 1:21-28

Hannah’s Prayer

2:1Then Hannah prayed,

“My heart celebrates in Yahveh;

you’ve honored me.

I speak boldly against my adversaries

because I celebrate over your salvation.

2There’s no one holy like Yahveh;

indeed, there’s no one besides you at all.

There’s no rock like our God.

3Don’t brag anymore with such pride,

because Yahveh is a God who knows;

he weighs what we do.

4The bows of the strong are shattered,

but the feeble increase strength.

5Those who were full are hiring themselves out for bread,

but those who were hungry are now full.

6Yahveh kills and makes live;

he takes down to Sheol and raises up.

7He makes people poor and rich;

he brings them low and honors them.

8He lifts the poor out of the dust;

he raises the needy off the trash pile

to seat them with nobles,

and inherit places of honor.

The pillars of the earth belong to him,

he’s set the world on them.

9He protects his holy people,

but silences the sinful in darkness

because people don’t prevail by their own power.

10Yahveh shatters those who contend with him,

and thunders in the sky against them.

He’ll judge the whole earth;

he’ll give strength to his king,

and elevate the one he’s anointed.”

11Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy served Yahveh in Eli’s presence.   1 Sam 2:1-11

Eli’s Wicked Sons

12Eli’s sons were worthless men that didn’t know Yahveh 13or the custom of priests with the people. When anybody was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork while the meat was boiling. 14He’d thrust it into the pan or kettle, caldron or pot. Everything the fork brought up, the priests would take. They did that to all the Israelites that came to Shiloh. 15Before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would say, “Give the priest meat for roasting. He won’t accept boiled meat from you, only raw.” 16If the man said, “They have to burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want,” he’d say, “Give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.” 17The young men were sinning greatly because they didn’t respect Yahveh’s offering.	   1 Sam 2:12-17

18Samuel was serving Yahveh as a boy wearing a linen ephod. 19His mother would make him a small robe and bring it to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the sacrifice. 20Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, “May Yahveh give you children from this woman to replace the one she dedicated to himY.” They went home, 21and Yahveh visited Hannah; she had three more sons and two daughters. Samuel grew up in Yahveh’s presence.

22Eli was old. He heard what his sons were doing—lying with the women that served at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 23He said,

“Why do you do the sinful things I’m hearing? 24Sons, the report is not good that I hear Yahveh’s people spreading around. 25If one man sins against another, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against Yahveh, who can intercede for him?”

But they ignored him in keeping with the fact that Yahveh wanted to put them to death. 26The boy Samuel was growing in height and favor with Yahveh and people. 	1 Sam 2:18-26

Warning About Eli’s Family

27Then a man of God came to Eli,

“Yahveh says, ‘I revealed myself to your ancestor’s house when they were in bondage to Pharaoh. 28I chose them from Israel’s tribes to be my priests, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod in front of me. I gave your ancestor the fire offerings of Israel. 29Why are you greedy about the sacrifices and offerings I’ve commanded. Why are you honoring your sons more than me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering my people make?’

30“So Yahveh God of Israel says, ‘I did say that your house and your father’s house would follow me forever, but I’m certainly not going to carry through on that now. I’ll honor the ones that honor me, and care less about the ones that despise me. 31The time’s coming when I’ll get rid of your strength and the strength of your ancestor’s house. There’ll never be an old man in your family. 32In distress you’ll see the prosperity I’ll put on Israel. 33But I won’t remove every man of yours from my altar and make your eyes fail from crying, make you grieve, and make the added number in your house die in their prime. 34This will be the sign about your sons Hophni and Phinehas: they’ll die the same day. 35But I’ll raise up a faithful priest to do what’s in my heart and soul. I’ll build him a lasting lineage, and he’ll follow my anointed ways. 36Everybody that’s left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so I’ll have something to eat.”’”	   1 Sam 2:27-36

The Call of Samuel

3:1The boy Samuel continued to serve Yahveh with Eli. A message from Yahveh rarely came at that time; visions weren’t frequent. 2Eli was lying down. (His eyesight had gotten bad.) 3Yahveh’s lamp hadn’t gone out yet, and Samuel was lying down in the Tabernacle where the Ark of God was. 4Yahveh called out to him. He said, “Yes?” 5He ran to Eli and said, “You called.” But he said, “I didn’t call; lie back down.” So he went and lay down. Yahveh called out again, “Samuel.” He got up and went to Eli, “You called.” But he answered, “I didn’t call you, son; lie back down.” 7Samuel didn’t know Yahveh yet, and Yahveh hadn’t revealed a message to him before. 8Yahveh called out to him the third time. He got up and went to Eli, “You called.” Eli surmised that Yahveh was calling the boy. 9He told him, “Go lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Yes, Yahveh; I’m listening.’” So he went and lay down.  	1 Sam 3:1-9

10Yahveh came and stood and called out like before, “Samuel!”

He said, “Yes, Yahveh, I’m listening.”

11He said,

“I’m about to do something in Israel that will make everybody’s ears ring. 12I’ll carry out against Eli everything I’ve said about his house from beginning to end. 13I told him I’m about to condemn his house forever for the sin he knew about. His sons have brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. 14I’ve sworn to his house that sacrifice and offering won’t atone for its great sin.”

15Samuel lay down till morning. He opened the doors of Yahveh’s Tabernacle, but he was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.

16Then Eli called him.

17“What did he say? Don’t hold it back from me. God do so to you and more if you keep back anything he said.”

18Samuel told him everything.

“It’s Yahveh. Let him do what he thinks is right.”

19Samuel grew, Yahveh was with him, and didn’t let any of his message fail. 20Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew he was confirmed as a prophet for Yahveh. 21Yahveh appeared again at Shiloh and revealed himself to Samuel in a message.	   1 Sam 3:10-20

The Philistines Capture the Ark

4:1Samuel’s word went out to all Israel.

[4:1]Israel had gone out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer. The Philistines camped in Aphek, 2and drew up in formation against Israel. When the battle spread, the Philistines defeated Israel and killed about 4,000. 3When the troops came to camp, Israel’s elders said,

“Why has Yahveh routed us in front of the Philistines? Let’s bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh so he can come among us and save us from our enemies.”

4The people sent to Shiloh and brought the Ark of the Covenant of Yahveh of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. Hophni and Phinehas were there with it.	 1 Sam 4:1-4

5When the Ark came into camp, Israel shouted so loud the earth shook. 6The Philistines heard it, “What does that loud shouting mean in the Hebrews’ camp?” When they learned that the Ark of Yahveh had come into camp, 7they were afraid,

“God has come into the camp. Nothing like this has ever happened before. 8Who can deliver us from these powerful gods? They’re the ones that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues. 9Take courage, Philistines, so you won’t become slaves to the Hebrews like they’ve been to you. Be men and fight!”

10They fought and defeated Israel, and every man fled home. There was a great massacre; 30,000 of Israel’s foot soldiers fell. 11The Philistines captured God’s Ark and killed Eli’s two sons.

1 Sam 4:5-11

The Death of Eli

12A man from Benjamin ran to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 13Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching because he was nervous about the Ark. When the man came into the town with the news, the whole town cried out. 14Eli heard the outcry and asked what it was about. The man hurried over to tell him. 15He was 98 and couldn’t see.

16The man told him, “I fled from the battle today.”

“How’d it go?”

17“Israel fled. The Philistines have slain a great number, including your two sons, and they’ve captured the Ark.”

18When he mentioned the Ark, Eli fell backward off his seat by the gate, broke his neck, and died. He was old and heavy. He’d judged Israel for 40 years.	 1 Sam 4:12-18

19His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant. When she heard that the Ark had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor, kneeled, and gave birth. 20About the time she died, the women attending her said, “Don’t be afraid; you’ve had a son.” But she didn’t respond. 21She named him Ichabod, “The ‘glory is gone’ from Israel because they’ve captured God’s Ark,” and because her father-in-law and husband had died. [22] 	1 Sam 4:19-22

The Philistines and the Ark

5:1The Philistines carried the Ark from Ebenezer to Ashdod 2to Dagon’s temple and set it up beside him. 3When people got up early the next morning, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of Yahveh. They put Dagon back in place. 4But when they got up early the next day, he’d fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of Yahveh, and his head and hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only his trunk was left. 5That’s why Dagon’s priests and everybody that goes in his temple still don’t step on his threshold in Ashdod.

1 Sam 5:1-5

6Yahveh heavily oppressed the people in Ashdod and around. He terrified them by striking them with tumors. 7When the men in Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The Ark of Israel’s God must not stay here. He’s heavily oppressing us and our god Dagon.” 8They gathered the Philistine lords, “What can we do with it?”

“Take it to Gath.”

So they did, 9but Yahveh oppressed the city and caused a panic. He struck the people, young and old, with tumors. 10They sent it to Ekron. The people there cried out, “They’ve brought the Ark here to kill us.” 11They gathered the lords of the Philistines, “Send it back where it belongs so it won’t kill us.” A deathly panic gripped the city. God heavily oppressed it. 12People that didn’t die developed tumors, and the outcry from the city rose to the sky.

1 Sam 5:6-12

The Ark Returns to Israel

6:1Yahveh’s Ark was in Philistine territory for seven months. 2They called for the priests and fortunetellers, “What should we do with it? Tell us how to send it back.”

3“Send it back with a guilt offering to Israel’s God. You’ll be healed, and you’ll find out why he keeps working against you.”

4“What guilt offering should we send him?”

“Five gold tumors and five gold mice, to match the number of Philistine lords. The same plague has struck you and your lords. 5So make images of your tumors and the mice that are ravaging the land and honor Israel’s God. Maybe he’ll lighten his oppression on you, your gods, and your land. 6Why harden your hearts like Pharaoh and the Egyptians did? After he’d mocked them, didn’t they end up letting the people go? 7Build a new cart and take two milk cows that have never worn a yoke. Yoke them to the cart but take their calves away from them. 8Put the Ark on the cart. In a box beside it put the gold figurines you’re returning to him as a guilt offering. Send it off, and 9watch it. If it goes on the road to Beth-shemesh in its own land, he’s the one that has done us this great harm. If not, we’ll know it happened by chance.”  	1 Sam 6:1-9

10They yoked two milk cows to the cart, shut up their calves at home, 11and put the Ark on the cart along with a box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors. 12The cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along one road without veering off, bawling as they went. The lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the outskirts of Beth-shemesh. 13The people there were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed. 14It came and stopped in a field that belonged to Joshua of Beth-shemesh. There was a large rock there. They split up the wood from the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Yahveh. 15Levites took down the Ark and the box and set them on the large rock. The men of Beth-shemesh offered sacrifices and burnt offerings that day. 16The five lords of the Philistines saw it and went back to Ekron.

17As a guilt offering to Yahveh, the Philistines returned one gold tumor each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 18The gold mice matched the number of fortified towns and unwalled villages that belonged to the five Philistine lords. The large rock they set the Ark by is still a witness in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.	 1 Sam 6:10-18

19Yahveh killed 70 men from Beth-shemesh because they looked in the Ark. The people mourned because he’d killed so many. 20Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who can stand against this holy God? Who will go up when he leaves us?” 21They sent messengers to Kiriath-jearim, “The Philistines have brought back the Ark of Yahveh. Come down and get it.” 7:1The men came and took it to Abinadab’s house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to take charge of it. 2It was there some 20 years, and Israel mourned after Yahveh. 	1 Sam 6:19-7:2

Samuel Judges Israel

3Then Samuel told Israel, “If you’re coming back to Yahveh with all your heart, put away the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Direct your heart to serve him only, and he’ll deliver you from the Philistines.” 4Israel got rid of the images of Baal and Ashtoreth and served Yahveh only.

5Samuel said, “Gather Israel to Mizpah, and I’ll pray to Yahveh for you.” 6They gathered there, drew water, and poured it out to Yahveh. They fasted that day and said, “We’ve sinned against Yahveh.” Samuel judged Israel at Mizpah.

7When the Philistines heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they went up to attack them. The people heard about it and were afraid. 8They told Samuel, “Don’t stop calling out to Yahveh our God for us to save us from the Philistines.” 9He offered up a suckling lamb as a whole burnt offering. He appealed to Yahveh for Israel, and he answered him. 10As he was offering it, the Philistines came to attack; but Yahveh thundered with a loud noise that threw them into a panic. 11Israel chased them and kept striking them down as far as below Beth-car. 		      										      1 Sam 7:3-11

12Then Samuel set up a “rock” between Mizpah and Shen. He called it Ebenezer because Yahveh had ‘helped’ them that far. 13The Philistines didn’t invade Israel again. Yahveh opposed them Samuel’s whole life. 14The towns they’d taken reverted to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel rescued its territory from them.  Israel and the Amorites were at peace too.

15Samuel judged Israel his whole life 16on a circuit each year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. 17Then he’d come back to his house in Ramah. He administered justice there as well and built an altar to Yahveh.	   1 Sam 7:12-17

Israel Demands a King

8:1When Samuel was getting older, he made his sons judges over Israel: 2Joel his firstborn, and Abijah. They judged in Beersheba, 3but they didn’t follow Samuel’s ways. They pursued dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.

4Israel’s elders gathered to Samuel at Ramah, 5“You’re getting old, and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint a king to govern us like the other nations. 6That displeased Samuel. He prayed to Yahveh, 7and Yahveh said,

“Listen to them. They’re not rejecting you as much as rejecting me from being their king. 8As they’ve done ever since I brought them out of Egypt—leaving me and serving other gods—so they’re doing to you. 9Give in to them but warn them solemnly how kings will rule.” 	1 Sam 8:1-9

Samuel Warns About Having Kings

10Samuel told the people everything Yahveh said.

11“Be aware that this is how a king will rule. He’ll take your sons and appoint them to his chariots, to be his cavalry, to run ahead of his chariots. 12He’ll appoint commanders of thousands and fifties, and some to plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make weapons and equipment for his chariots. 13He’ll take your daughters for perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 14He’ll take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his officials. 15He’ll take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards, and give it to his attendants. 16He’ll take your male and female servants and the best of your livestock and donkeys and put them to his work. 17He’ll take a tenth of your flocks, and you’ll be his slaves. 18You’ll cry out because you’ve chosen a king, but Yahveh won’t answer you on the matter.”

The LORD Grants Israel ‘s Request

19But the people wouldn’t listen. They said, “We want a king 20so we’ll be like other nations. He can govern us and lead us in battle.”

21When Samuel heard what they said, he repeated it to Yahveh.

22Yahveh said, “Give in to them and appoint them a king.”

Samuel told Israel, “Every one of you, go home.”	 1 Sam 8:10-22

Saul Chosen as King

9:1A wealthy man in Benjamin named Kish Ben-Abiel (Ben-Zeror Ben-Becorath Ben-Aphiah). 2had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There wasn’t a man in Israel more handsome than he was. He was head and shoulders taller than everybody.

3Kish’s donkeys were lost so he told Saul to take a servant and look for them. 4They went through the hill country of Ephraim, through the territory around Shalishah, Shaalim, and Benjamin, but couldn’t find them.

5When they came to the area around Zuph, Saul told his servant, “Let’s go back so my father doesn’t stop caring about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”

6But the servant said, “There’s a man of God in this town that people regard highly. Everything he says comes true. Let’s go there; maybe he can tell us about the trip we’re on.”

7Saul said, “If we go, what can we take him? We don’t have any bread left in our sacks; we don’t have a present. What do we have?”

8The servant answered, “I have a tenth of an oz a fourth of a shekel of silver. I’ll give it to him to tell us where to go.” (9Earlier in Israel, when someone went to ask God, they’d say, “Let’s go to the seer.” What they call a prophet they used to call a seer.)

10Saul said, “All right.” They went to the town where the man of God was. 	1 Sam 9:1-10

11As they went up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked them if the seer was there.

12“Yes, he’s up ahead of you. Hurry; he just now got here for a sacrifice the people have on the high place today. 13As soon as you go into town, you’ll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat till he comes to bless the sacrifice. Afterwards the ones that are invited will eat. Go up; you’ll meet him right away.”

14They went up to the town. As they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way to the high place.

15The day before Saul came, Yahveh had revealed to Samuel,

16“About this time tomorrow I’ll send you a man from Benjamin. Anoint him to rule over my people. He’ll save them from the Philistines. I’ve seen my people’s suffering; their outcry has come to me.”

17When Samuel saw Saul, Yahveh told him, “He’s the man I told you about.”

1 Sam 9:11-17

18He approached Samuel in the gate, “Where’s the seer’s house?”

19Samuel answered him,

“I’m the seer. Go on up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me. In the morning I’ll let you go and tell you everything that’s on your mind. 20Don’t worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago. They’ve been found. Who is to receive everything that’s desirable in Israel? Isn’t it you and your father’s family?”

21Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe in Israel? Isn’t my family the least important one in the tribe? Why did you say that?” 	1 Sam 9:18-21

22Samuel took him and his servant to the hall and put them at the head of the guests, about 30 people. 23Samuel told the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you to put aside.” 24The cook picked up the leg and upper portion and put them in front of Saul. Samuel said, “See what I kept back for you till the appointed time so you could eat with the guests.” Saul ate with Samuel that day.

25When they came down from the high place into town, a bed was unrolled for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep. 26At dawn Samuel called to him, “Get up so I can send you off.” Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out into the street.

27As they were going down to the outskirts of town, Samuel told Saul, “Have the servant go on ahead. When he’s past, stop a minute so I can tell you God’s message.”

1 Sam 9:22-27

Saul Anointed as King

10:1Samuel took a vial of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, and kissed him,

“Hasn’t Yahveh anointed you to rule his people? You’ll save Israel from their enemies round about. This will be the sign that Yahveh has anointed you ruler over his heritage. 2When you leave me today, you’ll meet two men by Rachel’s tomb in Benjamin at Zelzah. They’ll say, ‘The donkeys you went to look they’ve found. Now your father has stopped caring about them and is worrying about you, “What am I going to do about my son?”’ 3You’ll go on to the Oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 4They’ll greet you and give you two loaves of bread; accept them. 5After that, you’ll come to Gibeah-elohim, where the Philistine outpost is. As you come to the town, you’ll meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place, prophesying behind a harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre. 6The Spirit of Yahveh will come on you powerfully, and you’ll prophesy with them and become another man. 7When these signs meet you, do whatever you find to do, because God is with you. 8Go down to Gilgal ahead of me. I’ll come to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. Wait for a week till I come and show you what to do.” 	1 Sam 10:1-8

9When he turned to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and those signs happened that day. 10When they got to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God stirred him powerfully, and he prophesied with them. 11When everybody that knew him before saw how he prophesied with them, they said to one another, “What has come over Kish’s son? Is Saul among the prophets too?” 12A man at that place answered, “Who is their father?” It became a saying, “Is Saul among the prophets too?” 13When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.

14Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where’d you go?”

“To look for the donkeys. When we couldn’t find them, we went to Samuel.”

15“What did he tell you?”

16“That they’d been found.” He didn’t tell him anything Samuel said about the kingdom.

1 Sam 10:9-16

17Samuel called the people to Yahveh at Mizpah 18and told them,

“Yahveh God of Israel, says, ‘I brought you out of Egypt and delivered you from the Egyptians and the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ 19But today you’ve rejected the God who saved you from your calamities and distresses. You’ve said, ‘No, install a king over us.’ Present yourselves to Yahveh by tribes and by thousands.”

20Samuel brought the tribes forward, and Benjamin was taken by lot. 21He brought Benjamin forward by families, and the Matrite family was taken by lot. Finally, he brought the Matrite family forward one by one, and Saul Ben-Kish was taken by lot. But they couldn’t find him. 22They asked Yahveh again, “Did the man come here?” Yahveh said, “He hid in the baggage.” 23They ran and got him. When he stood among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.

24Samuel said to the people, “See who Yahveh has chosen? There’s none like him among you.”

The people shouted, “Long live the king!”

25Samuel told them the rights and duties of kings. He wrote them in a scroll and laid it up in Yahveh’s presence and sent everyone home. 26Saul went to his home in Gibeah, and brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him. 27But some worthless fellows said, “How can this fellow save us?” They scorned him and wouldn’t bring him a gift, but he didn’t react to them.	  1 Sam 10:17-27

Saul Defeats the Amonites

11:1Nahash the Ammonite went up to lay siege to Jabesh-gilead. The men there said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we’ll serve you.”

2But he said, “I’ll make one with you on this condition: I’ll gouge out your right eyes so you’ll be a disgrace in Israel.”

3The elders at Jabesh said, “Give us a week so we can send messengers all over Israel. If there’s nobody to deliver us, we’ll come out to you.” 4The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and gave that message for the people; they cried out loud.

5Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen and wondered why the people were crying. When they told him what the men from Jabesh had said, 6the Spirit of God came on him powerfully, and he became angry. 7He cut the yoke of oxen in pieces and sent them all over Israel by messengers, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and Samuel will have this happen to his oxen.” Dread from Yahveh fell on the people, and they came out united. 8He counted them in Bezek: 300,000 from Israel, 30,000 from Judah. 9They told the messengers, “Tell the people in Jabesh-gilead they’ll be delivered by the time the sun’s hot tomorrow.” The messengers went to tell them; they were relieved. 10They told Nahash, “We’ll come out to you tomorrow; you can do to us whatever you want to.” 11The next morning Saul put the people in three companies. They attacked the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites till the heat of the day. The survivors scattered till no two were together. 	1 Sam 11:1-11

The Kingdom Is Renewed

12Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said, ‘Will Saul rule us?’ Bring them here so we can execute them.”

13But Saul said, “We won’t execute anybody today. Yahveh delivered Israel today.”

14Samuel told the people, “Let’s go to Gilgal and set up the new kingdom.” 15They went and made Saul king in Yahveh’s presence. They offered peace offerings, and Saul celebrated with the people.	  1 Sam 11:12-15

Samuel’s Farewell Address

12:1Then Samuel told Israel,

“I’ve listened to you and appointed a king. 2Now here’s the king living among you, but I’m getting old and gray; my sons are with you. I’ve lived among you since I was young. 3Here I am. Accuse me in the presence of Yahveh and his anointed. Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Who’ve I defrauded or oppressed? Who’ve I taken a bribe from to blind me? I’ll return it to you.”

4They said, “You haven’t defrauded or oppressed us, or taken anything from anybody.”

5He said, “Yahveh and his anointed are witnesses that you haven’t found anything in my possession.”

They said, “They’re witnesses.”	 1 Sam 12:1-5

6Samuel told the people,

“Yahveh appointed Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors up from Egypt. 7Now, stand so I can remind you in his presence about the good things he did for you and your ancestors. 8When Jacob went to Egypt and your ancestors appealed to Yahveh, he sent Moses and Aaron to settle them here. 9But they forgot him. So he sold them to Sisera, commander of Hazor’s army, to the Philistines, to the king of Moab, and they fought them. 10They appealed to Yahveh, ‘We’ve sinned by leaving you and worshiping the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. But deliver us now from our enemies, and we’ll serve you.’ 11He sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and me to deliver you from enemies in every direction; so you’ve lived in security. 12When you saw Nahash threatening, you told me you wanted a king—although Yahveh your God was your king. 13Here’s the king you asked for and chose, and Yahveh has put over you. 14If you’ll respect, serve him, and regard his command, you and the king will be following him. 15If you disregard his command, he’ll oppose you like he did your ancestors. 16Take your stand right now and see this great thing he’ll do to you. 17Isn’t today wheat harvest? I’ll call out to him to send thunder and rain. You’ll see that he considered asking for a king a bad thing.”   	1 Sam 12:6-17

18Samuel called out to Yahveh, and he sent thunder and rain that day. The people feared him and Samuel.

19They told Samuel, “Pray for us so we won’t die. We’ve added to our sins by asking for a king.”

20Samuel said,

“Don’t be afraid. You have done the wrong thing, but don’t turn aside from serving Yahveh with all your heart. 21You’d be going after pointless things that can’t save. 22Because of his great name, Yahveh won’t abandon you. It pleased him to make you his people. 23I’ll never sin against him by not continuing to pray for you. I’ll instruct you in the right way. 24Just respect him and serve him sincerely. Think about the great things he’s done for you. 25If you still act sinfully, he’ll sweep away you and your king.”	  1 Sam 12:18-25

Saul Fights the Philistines

13:1Saul was 40 when he began to rule and ruled for 32 years. 2He chose 3,000 men from Israel, 2,000 to be with him in Michmash and the hill country around Bethel and 1,000 to be with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent the rest home. 3Jonathan struck the Philistine garrison in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the ram’s horn all over the land and said, “Hebrews, listen.” 4All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison and that Israel had become repulsive to the Philistines. So Saul called the people to Gilgal. 	1 Sam 13:1-4

5The Philistines came together to fight Israel with 3,000LXX chariots, 6,000 cavalry, and people like sand on a shore. They camped in Michmash east of Beth-aven. 6Israel saw they were in a predicament. (The people were hard-pressed.) They hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, cellars, cisterns. 7Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to Gad in Gilead. Saul stayed in Gilgal, and the people followed him trembling.

Saul’s Ill-Advised Sacrifice

8He waited for the week Samuel appointed, but Samuel didn’t come, and the people started leaving. 9So he told them to bring him the burnt offering and peace offerings. He offered the burnt offering. 10No sooner had he finished offering it than Samuel came. Saul went out to greet him, 11but Samuel said, “What have you done?” 	1 Sam 13:5-11a

Saul said,

“The people were leaving, you didn’t come by the appointed time, and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash. 12I said the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I haven’t asked for Yahveh’s blessing. I went ahead and offered the burnt offering.”

13Samuel told Saul,

“You’ve done something foolish. You haven’t kept the commandment Yahveh gave you. He would’ve made your kingdom secure permanently, 14but not now. He has looked for a man after his own heart to appoint as ruler over his people, because you haven’t done what he told you.”    	1 Sam 13:11b-14

15Then Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah. Saul counted the people with him, about 600 men. 16He, his son Jonathan, and the people with them were staying at Geba in Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 17Three raiding parties went out from the Philistines’: one toward Ophrah in the area around Shual, 18another toward Beth-horon, and the other toward the borderland that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim near open country.

19There weren’t any blacksmiths in Israel, so the Hebrews couldn’t make swords or spears. 20They had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen their forks, plowshares, picks, axes, and goads, and to fix their goad points. 21They charged the Israelites ¼ oz two-thirds of a shekel of silver for sharpening plowshares and picks and ⅛ oz a third of a shekel for sharpening forks, axes, and goads. 22The day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had swords or spears, just Saul and Jonathan. 23A Philistine contingent went out to secure the pass by Michmash.

1 Sam 13:15-23

Jonathan Defeats the Philistines

14:1One day Jonathan said to his young armor bearer, “Let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” He didn’t tell his father, 2who was staying with about 600 men on the outskirts of Gibeah around the pomegranate tree in Migron. 3Among Saul’s men was Ahijah wearing an ephod—Ben-Ahitub (Ichabod’s brother) Ben-Phinehas Ben-Eli, Yahveh’s priest at Shiloh. The people didn’t know Jonathan had gone. 4Between the passes Jonathan was planning to use to cross over to the Philistines outpost, there were steep cliffs on two sides named Bozez and Seneh. 5One went up to the north toward Michmash, the other one on the south toward Geba.

1 Sam 14:1-5

6Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Let’s go over to those uncircumcised Philistines. Maybe Yahveh will work for us. He’s not limited to saving by many or few.”

7“Do what you want. I’m with you.”

8Jonathan said,

“We’ll go let them know we’re here. 9If they say, ‘Wait till we come to you,’ we’ll stay put. 10If they say, ‘Come on up,’ we’ll go up. Yahveh will deliver them to us. That will be our sign.”

11When they let the outpost know they were there, they said, “The Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they’ve been hiding.” 12The men in the outpost shouted, “Come on up! We’ll show you a thing or two!” Jonathan told his armor bearer, “Come on; Yahveh will deliver them to Israel.” 13Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armor bearer behind him, and they fell to Jonathan. His armor bearer killed some behind him. 14That first slaughter was about 20 men on a half-acre. 15There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among the people. Even the garrison and raiding parties trembled, and the ground shook.     	1 Sam 14:6-15

16Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah saw the camp scattering, running here and there. 17Saul told the people with him, “Count and see who’s not here.” They counted, and Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. 18Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s Ark here.” At that time, it was with the people in Israel. 19While he was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew, so Saul told the priest not to worry about it then. 20Saul and his people rallied and joined the battle. The Philistines were killing one another in total chaos. 21The Hebrews that had been going around with the Philistine camp joined the people with Saul and Jonathan. 22When people hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also chased them in the battle. 23Yahveh delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread past Beth-aven.	 1 Sam 14:16-23

Saul’s Rash Vow

24The men in Israel were totally exhausted because Saul had put them under oath, “Accursed is the man that eats before evening, until I’ve avenged myself of my enemies.” So nobody had eaten anything. 25-26When they went into the forest, they’d found honeycomb on the ground, but nobody put any in his mouth out of respect for the oath. 27But Jonathan hadn’t heard about his father’s oath. He dipped the end of his staff in the honeycomb, and put some in his mouth, and he was refreshed. 28One of the people said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, ‘The man that eats today is under a curse.’” The people were exhausted. 29Jonathan said,

“My father has created a problem. See how I’ve been refreshed because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much more if the people had eaten freely from the spoils! As it is, the slaughter among the Philistines wasn’t that great.” 								  		  	  1 Sam 14:24-30

31They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were completely exhausted. 32After dark, they rushed ravenously on the spoil, butchered sheep, cattle, and calves on the ground, and ate them with the blood. 33People told Saul, “They’re sinning against Yahveh by eating meat with the blood.”

He said,

“You’ve acted deviously. Roll a large rock to me. 34Go out among the people and tell them to bring their ox or sheep, butcher it here and eat. Don’t sin by eating the meat with the blood.’”

The people that night brought their cattle or sheep and butchered them there. 35Saul built an altar to Yahveh, his first. 	1 Sam 14:31-35

36Then Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines at night and take spoil till daylight. Don’t leave one survivor.”

They said, “Do what you like.”

So the priests said, “Let’s draw near to God here.”

37Saul asked God, “Should we go down after the Philistines? Will you give them to Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.

38Saul said,

“Come here, you chiefs of the people, and find out how this sin happened today. 39As sure as Yahveh lives who delivers Israel, even if it’s Jonathan, he’ll die.”

But none of the people answered.

40Then he said to them, “You’re on one side; Jonathan and I are on the other.”

The people said, “Do what you like.”

41Saul told Yahveh, “Give a clear answer.” The lot fell on Jonathan and Saul.

42Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan.” The lot fell on Jonathan.

43He said to Jonathan, “What did you do?”

Jonathan told him, “I tasted some honey with the end of my staff. So kill me!”

44Saul said, “God do this to me and more also because you’ll surely die, Jonathan.”

45But the people said to Saul,

“Does Jonathan have to die who brought about this great deliverance? Far from it! As sure as Yahveh lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground; he’s worked with God today.”

The people rescued him. 46Saul quit chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went home.

1 Sam 14:36-46

Saul Fights Israel’s Enemies

47When Saul took over the kingship, he fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He inflicted punishment wherever he went. 48He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and delivered Israel from plunderers.

49Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua.

His daughters were Merab, the firstborn, and Michal.

50His wife was Ahinoam Bat-Ahimaaz.

The general of his army was Abner Ben-Ner, Saul’s uncle.

51His father was Kish;

Ner was son of Abiel.

52During Saul’s whole life, he was constantly at war with the Philistines. Whenever he saw a strong or brave man, he’d attach him to his staff.	1 Sam 14:47-52

The LORD Rejects Saul

15:1Then Samuel told Saul,

“Yahveh of Hosts sent me to anoint you king over his people. 2He says, ‘I’m going to settle up with Amalek for opposing Israel on their way up from Egypt. 3Strike him and destroy everything he has. Don’t spare him. Put to death man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey.’”

4Saul called in the people and counted them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 5He came to Amalek’s city and set up an ambush in the valley. 6He told the Kenites, “Get away from the Amalekites so I won’t be destroying you with them. You were kind to Israel when they came up from Egypt.”

The Kenites left. 	1 Sam 15:1-6

7Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt. 8He captured Agag the king and destroyed the people with the sword. 9But he and the people spared Agag and the best sheep, cattle, grain-fed animals, lambs, and everything that was good. They didn’t want to destroy them completely, just everything despised and worthless.

10A message from Yahveh came to Samuel, 11“I’ve changed my mind about having Saul as king. He’s not been doing what I tell him.”

Samuel was distressed and cried out to Yahveh all night. 12He got up early to meet Saul. He heard that Saul had gone to Carmel to set up a monument to himself and then went on down to Gilgal.” 	1 Sam 15:7-12

13Samuel came and Saul said to him, “Yahveh’s blessed you! I’ve done what you’ve said.”

14But Samuel asked, “What’s this bleating and bawling?”

15“They’ve brought them from the Amalekites. The people spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to Yahveh your God. The rest we’ve destroyed.”

16“Wait, let me tell you what Yahveh told me last night.”

“Tell me.”

17“Isn’t it true, though you felt inadequate, Yahveh made you the head over Israel? He anointed you king 18and sent you to kill off the Amalekites completely. 19Why didn’t you obey him, but rushed on the spoil and did what he considered bad.”

20“I did obey him; I went on his mission and brought back Agag the king and destroyed the Amalekites. 21But the people took some of the spoil—sheep and cattle, the best things devoted to destruction—to sacrifice to Yahveh at Gilgal.”

1 Sam 15:13-21

22Samuel said,

“Does Yahveh delight as much in burnt offerings and sacrifices

as he does in obedience?

Obedience is better than sacrifice,

listening than the fat of rams.

23Rebellion is like fortunetelling;

insubordination is like iniquity and idolatry.

Because you’ve refused to do what Yahveh said,

he’s rejected you from being king.”

24Saul said, “I’ve sinned against his command and what you’ve said. I was afraid of the people and listened to them. 25Pardon my sin and go back with me so I can worship Yahveh.”

26“I won’t go back with you. You’ve rejected hisY message, and he’s rejected you from being king.”	1 Sam 15:22-26

27As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. 28Samuel said,

“Yahveh has torn the kingdom from you today and given it someone better than you. 29The Glory of Israel doesn’t lie or change his mind. He’s not a mortal that he’d do that.”

30“I’ve sinned, but please honor me in front of the elders and my people. Go back with me so I can worship Yahveh your God.”

31Samuel followed him back, and Saul worshiped Yahveh.

32Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag.” Agag came to him relieved, “Bitter death must be past.”

33But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless.” He cut Agag to pieces in Yahveh’s presence at Gilgal.

34Then he went to Ramah, but Saul went home to Gibeah. 35Samuel never saw him again; he grieved over him. Yahveh changed his mind about having him be king. 	  1 Sam 15:27-35

David Anointed King

16:1Yahveh said to Samuel,

“How long are you going to grieve over Saul? I’ve set him aside from being king. Fill your horn with olive oil and go to Jesse of Bethlehem. I’ve selected a king from his sons.”

2Samuel said, “How can I go there? When Saul hears about it, he’ll kill me.”

“Take a heifer with you and say you’ve come to sacrifice to Yahveh. 3Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I’ll show you what to do. Anoint the one I specify.”

4Samuel went to Bethlehem. The city elders came trembling, “Are you coming in peace?”

5“Yes, I’ve come to sacrifice to Yahveh. Consecrate yourselves and go with me to the sacrifice.” He consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.    	1 Sam 16:1-5

6When they came in, Samuel looked at Eliab and thought, “Surely that’s Yahveh’s anointed.”

7But Yahveh said, “Don’t look at his height or appearance. I haven’t chosen him. I don’t see like people do. They look at appearance; IY look at hearts.”

8Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel.

He said, “Yahveh hasn’t chosen this one either.”

9Next, Jesse presented Shammah.

He said, “Yahveh hasn’t chosen this one either.”

10Jesse presented seven of his sons, but Samuel told Jesse, “Yahveh hasn’t chosen any of these. 11Are they all your young men?”

“There’s still the youngest. He’s tending sheep.”

“Send for him; we won’t sit down till he gets here.”

12He sent and brought him in, a barefaced young man with bright eyes and handsome features.

Yahveh said, “Anoint him; he’s the one.”

13Samuel took the horn of olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers, and the Spirit of Yahveh stirred him powerfully from then on. Samuel went to Ramah.	 1 Sam 16:6-13

David in Saul’s Service

14The Spirit of Yahveh left Saul, and a tormenting spirit from Yahveh started coming on him. 15His servants told him. “A tormenting spirit from God is coming on you. 16Have us look for a man that’s good at playing a harp so you’ll feel better.”

17So Saul said, “Bring me a man like that.”

18One young man answered, “I’ve seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem that’s a good musician as well as a brave man, a soldier, prudent in speech, and a handsome fellow. Yahveh is with him.”

19Saul sent messengers to Jesse, “Send me your son David that tends your flock.”

20Jesse took a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a jug of wine, and sent them to Saul with David. 21He went to Saul and became his attendant. Saul liked him and made him his armor bearer.

22Saul sent to Jesse, “Let David remain with me. I like him.” 23Whenever a tormenting spirit from God came over Saul, David would take his harp and play it. Saul would be refreshed and feel better. The tormenting spirit would go away.	 1 Sam 16:14-23

David and Goliath

17:1The Philistines gathered their army for battle at Socoh in Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. 2Saul and Israel came together, camped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle formation to meet them. 3The Philistines stood on the hill on one side of the valley, and Israel stood on the hill on the other side. 4A champion from Gath named Goliath came out from the Philistine camp. He was 9ft 9 6 cubits and a span, 5and wore a bronze helmet and scale armor that weighed 125 lbs 5,000 shekels. 6He had bronze greaves on his shins and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. 7His spear shaft was like a weaver’s beam; its spearhead weighed 15 lbs 600 shekels of iron. His shield bearer walked ahead of him. 8He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,

“Why do you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Philistine and you’re Saul’s servants? Choose a man and have him come down to me. 9If he can fight me and kill me, we’ll become your slaves. If I kill him, you’ll become our slaves. 10I defy the ranks of Israel. Give me a man, and we’ll fight.”

11When Saul and Israel heard him, they were really intimidated.  	1 Sam 17:1-11

12David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse in Bethlehem named Jesse. He had eight sons. Jesse was an old man in Saul’s day. 13His three oldest sons had followed Saul to battle: Eliab his firstborn, Abinadab, and Shammah. 14David, the youngest, 15went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem. 16The Philistine came forward morning and evening for 40 days and took his stand.

17Jesse told David,

“Take 1.1 bushels 1 ephah of this roasted grain and these 10 loaves and run to your brothers in camp. 18Take these 10 cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand. Look into the welfare of your brothers and bring back news about them. 19Saul, your brothers, and Israel’s army are fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah.”	  1 Sam 17:12-19

20David got up early and left the flock with a keeper, took the supplies, and went like Jesse said. He got to the camp as the army was moving out into battle formation, raising the battle cry. 21Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle formation, army against army. 22David left his things with the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line to greet his brothers. 23As he was talking to them, Goliath came up from the Philistines and said the same thing as before, and David heard it. 24When the Israelites saw him, they drew back, afraid. 	1 Sam 17:20-24

25They said,

“Have you seen this man that keeps coming up to defy Israel? The king will greatly enrich the man that kills him. He’ll give him his daughter and exempt his father’s family from paying taxes in Israel.”

26David asked the men standing by him,

“What will the king do for the man that kills this Philistine and takes disgrace away from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God?”

27They repeated their answer, “That’s what he’ll get.”

28Eliab heard him talking to the men, and his anger flared at David,

“What are you doing here? Who did you leave that little bunch of sheep with in the countryside? I know your insolence. You’ve come down to watch the battle.”

29But David said, “What have I done now? I just asked a question!” 30Then he turned to someone else and asked the same thing and got the same answer. 	1 Sam 17:25-30

31When what David said was heard, they told Saul, and he sent for him. 32David told him, “Nobody’s heart should fail over this Philistine. I’ll fight him.”

33“You can’t fight him; you’re just a boy. He’s been a soldier since he was your age.”

34“I’ve tended my father’s sheep. When a lion or bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 35I went after it and struck it and rescued the lamb from its mouth. When it attacked me, I grabbed its jaw and struck it and killed it. 36I’ve killed a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has taunted the armies of the living God. 37Yahveh that delivered me from a lion and a bear, will deliver me from this Philistine.”

“Go on. Yahveh be with you.” 		 1 Sam 17:31-37

38Saul dressed David in his clothes, put a bronze helmet on his head, and put his armor on him. 39David bound his sword over his armor and tried to walk because he wasn’t used to them. He told Saul, “I can’t go with these on. I’m not used to them.” He took them off. 40He took his staff and chose five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in his shepherd’s pouch. With his sling in hand, he went toward the Philistine.

41The Philistine came toward David behind his shield bearer. 42When he looked up and saw David, he sneered. He was just a handsome barefaced boy.    	  1 Sam 17:38-42

43The Philistine said, “Am I a dog that you come to me with sticks?” He cursed David by his gods. 44“Come here; I’ll give your body to the birds from the sky and the animals in the field.”

45David told the Philistine,

“You’re coming to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I’m coming to you in the name of Yahveh of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel that you’ve taunted. 46He’ll deliver you to me today. I’ll strike you down and take off your head. I’ll give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds and wild animals so the whole world will know there’s a God in Israel. 47This whole assembly will know that he doesn’t deliver by sword or spear. The battle is Yahveh’s. He’ll give youpl to us.”

48When the Philistine came to meet him, David ran fast toward the battle line to meet him. 49He put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine in the forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell on his face.	  1 Sam 17:43-49

50David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone. He struck him and killed him, but David didn’t have a sword. 51He ran and stood over the Philistine, drew his sword out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 52Israel and Judah rose up and raised the battle cry. They chased the Philistines to the mouth of the valley and the gates of Ekron. Slain Philistines lay along the road to Shaaraim, all the way to Gath and Ekron. 53Israel came back from chasing them and plundered their camps. 54David picked up the Philistine’s head and took it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent. 	  1 Sam 17:50-54

55When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, his general, “Whose son is he?

“By your life, king, I don’t know.”

56“Find out.”

57So when David came back from killing the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand.

58Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?”

“The son of Jesse from Bethlehem.”	1 Sam 17:55-58

Saul’s Jealousy of David

18:1When he’d finished talking to Saul, Jonathan was drawn to David and loved him as himself. 2Saul took him that day and didn’t let him go back home. 3Jonathan made a pact with him because he loved him as himself. 4Jonathan took off his robe and gave it to him, along with his armor, sword, bow, and belt. 5David went out wherever Saul sent him and was successful. Saul set him over the fighting men. The people and Saul liked that arrangement.

6When David came back from killing the Philistine, the women came out of the towns, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, celebration, and musical instruments. 7They sang as they played,

“Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands!”

8It made Saul mad. “They’ve attributed ten thousands to David, but thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?” 9He was suspicious of David after that.  	1 Sam 18:1-9

10The next day a tormenting spirit from God came powerfully over Saul, and he raved in the house while David was playing the harp as usual. Saul had a spear in his hand 11and threw it, thinking he’d pin David to the wall, but David dodged him twice. 12Saul was afraid of him, because Yahveh was with him, but he’d left Saul. 13Saul put him out away from him and appointed him as commander of a thousand.  David came and went with the people. [14-15] 16All Israel and Judah loved him.

David Marries Saul’s Daughter

17Then Saul told David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I’ll give her to you as a wife. Just be brave for me and fight Yahveh’s battles.” Saul was thinking, “I won’t be against him; the Philistines will.” 18David said, “Who am I and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” 19At the time she would have been given to David, she was given to Adriel of Meholah.  	  1 Sam 18:10-19

20Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David. They told Saul, and he liked that. 21He thought, “I’ll give her to him as a snare. The Philistines will oppose him.” Saul told David a second time, “You can be my son-in-law today.” 22He told his men, “Tell David privately, ‘The king likes you, and we do too. Go ahead and become his son-in-law.’” 23When Saul’s men told David that privately, he said, “Does it seem trivial to you to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m a poor man with no reputation.” 24Saul’s men reported what David said. 25Saul said, “Tell him the only dowry I want is 100 Philistine foreskins to avenge me of my enemies.” Saul thought he’d get David killed by the Philistines. 26When his men told David, he was glad to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline, 27David along with his men went and killed 200 Philistines and brought their foreskins to the king. So Saul gave him Michal. 28But when Saul saw that Yahveh was with him and all Israel loved him, 29he was more afraid of him and became his constant enemy.

30The commanders of the Philistines kept attacking. As often as they did, David had more success than any other officer Saul had; so he was greatly respected.	 1 Sam 18:20-30

Saul Tries to Kill David

19:1Saul told Jonathan and his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan really delighted in David. 2He told David,

“My father is trying to get you killed. Be on guard in the morning. Hide in a private place. 3I’ll go out and stand beside him in the field where you are and talk about you. If I find out anything out, I’ll tell you.”

4Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul,

“Don’t sin against David. He hasn’t sinned against you; what he’s done has benefited you. 5He took his life in his hands and struck the Philistine, and Yahveh brought about a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and were happy. Why sin against innocent blood by putting him to death?”

6Saul listened and swore, “As surely Yahveh lives, I won’t do it.”

7Then Jonathan called David and told him. He brought David to Saul, and he was with him like before.

8When war arose again, David went out and massacred the Philistines. They fled from him. 	1 Sam 19:1-8

9A tormenting spirit from Yahveh came on Saul as he was sitting at home with his spear in hand. David was playing his harp. 10Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he dodged, and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped that night.

11Saul sent troops to David’s house to watch him and put him to death in the morning. But David’s wife Michal told him, “If you don’t save your life tonight, you’ll be killed tomorrow.” 12She let David down through the window, and he got away. 13She took the household idol and laid it on the bed; she put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head and covered it with blankets. 14When Saul troops arrived, she said, “He’s sick.” 15Saul sent troops back, saying, “Bring him to me on his bed so I can put him to death.” 16When they went in, the household idol was on the bed with the pillow of goats’ hair under its head. 17Saul asked Michal, “Why did you lie to me and let my enemy escape?” Michal said, “He told me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”	1 Sam 19:9-17

18David escaped to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went to stay in Naioth. 19Saul heard that David was at Naioth in Ramah. 20He sent troops to take him, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on them and they prophesied too. 21When Saul learned about it, he sent some other troops, and they prophesied. He sent troops a third time, and they prophesied. 22Then Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big well in Secu and asked where Samuel and David were. One person said, “They’re at Naioth in Ramah.” 23He went on to Naioth, and the Spirit of God came on him. As he went, he kept prophesying till he got to Naioth. 24He, too, stripped off his clothes and prophesied in Samuel’s presence; he lay naked all day and all night. That’s why people say, “Is Saul among the prophets too?”	 1 Sam 19:18-24

Jonathan Warns David

20:1Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan, “What have I done? What am I guilty of? What sin did I commit to make your father try to kill me?”

2He said,

“Far from it! You’re not going to die. My father doesn’t do anything big or small without letting me know. Why would he keep that from me? It’s not so.”

3But David answered,

“Your father knows we’re friends and thinks, ‘Don’t let Jonathan find this out so it won’t grieve him.’ But as sure as Yahveh lives and you live, there’s just a step between me and death.”

4Jonathan said, “I’ll do for you whatever you say.” 	1 Sam 20:1-4

5David said,

“Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should sit at table with the king, but let me go so I can hide in the field till the evening of the third day. 6If he misses me, say, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to run to Bethlehem, his town; there’s a yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’ 7If he says, ‘Good!’ it’ll be well with me. But if he’s angry, then know that he intends to do something bad. 8Deal graciously with me; you’ve brought me into a sacred pact with you. But if I’ve done anything wrong, kill me yourself. Why take me to your father?”

9Jonathan said, “I’d never do that! If I knew that he’s determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”

10David asked, “How will I know if your father is angry?” 	   1 Sam 20:5-10

11Jonathan said, “Let’s go out to the field.”

12Jonathan told David,

“Yahveh God of Israel is witness! When I’ve sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day, if he’s well disposed toward you, won’t I send and let you know? 13But if he wants to harm you, Yahveh do so to me and more if I don’t let you know so you can get away. Yahveh be with you as he’s been with my father. 14If I’m still alive, show me Yahveh’s enduring love so I won’t die. 15Don’t remove your loyalty from my house permanently. When Yahveh gets rid of every enemy of yours, 16don’t remove my name from your house. May Yahveh take vengeance on your enemies.” 	1 Sam 20:11-16

17Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.

18Then Jonathan told him,

“Tomorrow is a new moon. He’ll miss you because your seat will be empty. 19On the third day, he’ll miss you for sure. Then go to where you hid when the matter was in hand and stay beside that rock pile over there. 20I’ll shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I was shooting at a target. 21I’ll send the boy and say, ‘Go find the arrows.’ If I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then come because as sure as Yahveh lives, it’s safe. 22But if I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on past you,’ then leave; Yahveh is sending you away. 23On the promises we’ve made, Yahveh stands with you and me permanently.”

1 Sam 20:17-23

24David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat. 25He sat by the wall as usual. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David’s place was empty.

26Saul didn’t say anything that day because he thought, “Something’s happened. He’s not clean; surely that’s it.” 27But the second day, the day after the new moon, David’s place was empty. Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal yesterday or today?”

1 Sam 20:24-27

28Jonathan answered him,

“David earnestly asked me to let him go to Bethlehem. 29He said, ‘Our family is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother insisted that I be there. If I’m pleasing to you, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That’s why he’s not at the king’s table.”

30Saul’s anger flared at Jonathan,

“You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, don’t I know you’ve chosen Jesse’s son to your own shame and the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 31As long as he’s alive, you and your kingdom will neither one be secure. Send and bring him to me. He has to die.”

32Then Jonathan answered Saul, “Why put him to death? What’s he done?”

33Saul threw his spear at him. So Jonathan knew he was determined to kill David. 34Jonathan got up from the table mad and didn’t eat anything the second day of the month because he grieved for David. His father had put him down.	  1 Sam 20:28-34

35The next morning, Jonathan and a boy went out to the field to the appointment with David. 36He told the boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow past him. 37When the boy came to where Jonathan had shot the arrow, he called after the boy, “Isn’t the arrow on past you?” 38Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry.” So he gathered up the arrows and came back to him. 39But he didn’t know anything; only Jonathan and David knew. 40Jonathan gave the boy his weapons and told him to take them into town. 41As soon as he’d gone, David got up from beside the rock pile and fell on his face and bowed three times. They kissed one another and cried till David composed himself. 42Then Jonathan said,

“Goodbye. we’ve sworn loyalty to one another in Yahveh’s name, ‘He will always be with you and me, with your descendants and mine.’”

He got up and left, and Jonathan went into town.	  1 Sam 20:35-42

David and the Bread of the Presence

21:1Then David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. He came cringing to meet David, “Why are you by yourself?”

2David told Ahimelech, “The king commissioned me with a matter, ‘Don’t let anybody know about it. I’ve directed my young men where to meet me later.’ 3What do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.”

4The priest answered him, “There’s no ordinary bread here; there’s consecrated bread if your young men have not been with women.”

5David answered,

“Women have certainly not been with us; that’s always the case on an expedition. The young men are holy even on an ordinary journey, much less today.”

6The priest gave him the Bread of the Presence, which is removed from Yahveh’s presence and replaced with fresh bread the same day. 	1 Sam 21:1-6

7Saul’s chief shepherd was there that day, detained in Yahveh’s presence: Doeg the Edomite.

8David asked Ahimelech, “Is there a spear or sword here? I didn’t bring either; the king’s matter was urgent.”

9The priest said,

“The sword of Goliath that you killed in the Valley of Elah is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to, take that. It’s the only one here.”

David said, “There’s none like that one. Let me have it.”	 1 Sam 21:7-9

10David fled that day from Saul to Achish, king of Gath. 11His officers asked him, Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Didn’t they sing about him in dances.

“‘Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands!’?”

12David took those comments to heart and was afraid of Achish. 13So he acted like he was crazy. He made marks on the doors of the gate, and let spit run down his beard. 14Achish told his men, “You can tell the man’s crazy. Why did you bring him to me? 15Am I short on crazy people? Will he come into my house?”	  1 Sam 21:10-15

David at the Case of Adullam

22:1David left and got to the cave near Adullam. When his brothers and father’s family heard, they came down. 2Everybody in distress, in debt, or discontented gathered to him till he became the captain of about 400 men.

3He went from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king, “Please let my parents stay with you till I know what God will do for me.” 4He left them with the king; they stayed with him the whole time David was in the fortress. 5The prophet Gad told David, “Don’t stay in the fortress. Go to Judah.” So David went to the Forest of Hereth.	 1 Sam 22:1-5

Saul Kills the Priests at Nob

6Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the hill with spear in hand and his officers standing about him. 7He told them,

“Listen, you Benjamites. Will Jesse’s son give you fields and vineyards? Will he make you commanders of thousands and hundreds 8that you’ve plotted against me? Nobody lets me know when my son teams up with Jesse’s son. None of you sympathize with me or let me know that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, like now.” 	     1 Sam 22:6-8

9Doeg, who was standing by Saul’s servants, said, “I saw Jesse’s son going to Nob, to Ahimelech Ben-Ahitub. 10He inquired from Yahveh for him, and gave him provisions and Goliath’s sword.”

11The king sent for Ahimelech the priest and all his father’s family, the priests at Nob. They came to him.

12Saul said, “Ben-Ahitub, 13why have you and Jesse’s son plotted against me by giving him bread and a sword, and inquiring from God for him, so that he has risen against me to lie in wait today?”

14Ahimelech answered,

“Who among your servants is as faithful as David, your son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, honored in your family? 15Is today the first time I’ve asked God for him? No! You need not accuse me or my father’s family of anything. I didn’t know anything about this.” 	1 Sam 22:9-15

16The king said, “You and your father’s family have to die.” 17He told the guard standing around him, “Kill Yahveh’s priests; their hand is with David. They knew he fled and didn’t let me know.”

But his men wouldn’t do it. 18So he told Doeg to fall on them. He killed 85 men that day who wore the linen ephod. 19He put Nob, the city of priests, to the sword—men and women, children and infants, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.

20But one of Ahimelech’s sons named Abiathar escaped to David 21and told him what Saul had done to Yahveh’s priests. 22David said,

“The day Doeg was there I figured he’d tell Saul. I’ve occasioned the death of everybody in your father’s family. 23Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The one that wants to kill you wants to kill me. You’ll be safe here.” 	1 Sam 22:16-23

David Saves the Town of Keilah

23:1People told David, “The Philistines are attacking Keilah and robbing the threshing floors.”

2David asked Yahveh, “Should I attack these Philistines?”

“Yes, save Keilah.”

3But David’s men said, “We’re afraid here in Judah. How much more at Keilah against the Philistines!”

4David asked Yahveh again.

“Go down to Keilah. I’ll deliver the Philistines to you.” 5David and his men went down and fought them, brought away their livestock, and killed a great number of them. So he delivered the people in Keilah.	 1 Sam 23:1-5

6When Abiathar fled to David at Keilah, he brought an ephod with him. 7Saul heard that David had gone there and said, “God has delivered him to me. He has shut himself in by entering a town with gates and bars.” 8Saul called the people to war, to go down to Keilah and lay siege to David and his men. 9David found out about his plot and told Abiathar to bring him the ephod.

10David said,

“Yahveh God of Israel, I’ve heard that Saul intends to come to destroy the town because of me. 11Please tell me if he’ll come down.”

“He will.”

12“Will the men in Keilah surrender me and my men to him.”

“Yes.” 	1 Sam 23:6-12

13David and his 600 men left and went wherever they could. When Saul found out he’d escaped from Keilah, he gave up the chase. 14David stayed in the strongholds and in the hill country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul looked for him every day, but God didn’t deliver David to him.

Saul Pursues David

15David learned that Saul had come out to try to kill him while he was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 16Jonathan went to David and encouraged him in God: 17“Don’t worry; my father won’t find you. He knows you’ll be king, and I’ll be next to you.” 18They made a pact in Yahveh’s presence. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.	 1 Sam 23:13-18

19People came up from Ziph to Saul at Gibeah and said,

“Isn’t David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the Hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? 20Come down and do whatever you want to. We’ll surrender him to you.”

21Saul said,

“Yahveh bless you for having mercy on me. 22Go make sure where his haunt is and who has seen him there. I’m told he’s awfully cunning. 23Learn where his hiding places are, come back with exact information, and I’ll go with you. If he’s in the land, I’ll search him out among the thousands in Judah.”

24They went to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men had moved into the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 25When Saul and his men went to look for him, people had told David, and he’d gone down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. 26Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. He was hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were surrounding him and his men to capture them. 27But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quick; the Philistines are raiding the land.” 28Saul quit chasing David and went to meet the Philistines. So they called the place The Rock of Escape [Sela Hammachleqot]. 29David went and stayed in the strongholds at En-gedi. 	1 Sam 23:19-29

David Spares Sual’s Life

24:1When Saul came back from chasing the Philistines, he heard that David was in the Wilderness of En-gedi. 2Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all over Israel and went to look for him and his men at the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 3He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave, and went in to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 4David’s men said, “This is the day Yahveh told you he’d deliver your enemy to you.” David got up and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly. 5Afterward, his conscience bothered him over it. 6He told his men, “Yahveh forbid that I should reach out against his anointed.” 7He dissuaded them with that comment and didn’t let them attack Saul. Saul got up and left the cave. 	1 Sam 24:1-7

8Afterward David went out and yelled, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground and prostrated himself. 9He said,

“Why listen to people that say I’m trying to harm you? 10You’ve seen that Yahveh delivered you to me today. Some said to kill you, but I took pity on you and wouldn’t reach out against Yahveh’s anointed. 11Now, father, look at the hem of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off its edge and didn’t kill you, know that I’m not leading a rebellion. I haven’t sinned against you even though you’re lying in wait to kill me. 12Yahveh judge between us. May he avenge me on you, but I won’t oppose you. 13As the ancient proverb says, ‘Sinfulness comes from the sinful.’ I won’t oppose you. 14What did you come out against? A dead dog? A single flea? 15Let Yahveh decide between us. May he argue my case and deliver me from you.”

16When David finished, Saul said,

“Is that you, David my son? 17You’re better than I am. You’ve been good to me while I’ve been bad to you. 18You’ve declared that you’ve done good to me, that Yahveh delivered me to you, but you didn’t kill me. 19If someone finds his enemy, will he let him get away? May Yahveh reward you with good for what you’ve done today. 20I know you’ll be king, and the kingdom will be firmly under your rule. 21Swear to me by Yahveh that you won’t kill my descendants or destroy my name from my father’s family.”

22David swore to him, and he went home. David and his men went up to the stronghold.

1 Sam 24:8-22

The Death of Samuel

25:1Samuel died and Israel gathered to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah.

David and Abigail

David went down to the Wilderness of Paran. 2aA man named Nabal in Maon had a business in Carmel. He was really rich with 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. (3His wife Abigail was intelligent and beautiful, but he was harsh and rude in his dealings, a descendant of Caleb.) 2bWhile he was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 4David heard about it in the open country. 5He sent ten young men and told them,

“Go to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name. 6Say, ‘Have a long life, peace to you, your household, and everybody you have. 7I’ve heard you have shearers. Your shepherds have been with us, and we’ve not insulted them or taken anything from them the whole time they were in Carmel. 8Ask your young men and they’ll tell you. So be gracious to my young men; we’ve come on a festive day. Please give Whatever you have on hand please give to them and to me.’”

1 Sam 25:1-8

9When David’s young men came, they told Nabal everything in David’s name and waited. 10But Nabal answered,

“Who’s David? Who’s Jesse’s son? Lots of servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 11Am I supposed to take my bread, water, and meat that I’ve butchered for my shearers, and give it to men I don’t know?”

12David’s young men retraced their steps and told him what Nabal said. 13David told them to put on their swords. David put on his sword, and about 400 men went up behind him while 200 stayed with the baggage.	   1 Sam 25:9-13

14One of the young men told Abigail,

“David sent messengers from the countryside to greet our master, and he scorned them. 15Yet the men were good to us. They didn’t insult us or take anything as we went around with them on the open range. 16They were a wall to us day and night the whole time we tended sheep together. 17Think what you should do; David’s planning to do something bad to our master and his household. Nabal is such a worthless fellow nobody can talk to him.”

1 Sam 25:14-17

18Abigail hurried and loaded donkeys with 200 loaves of bread, 2 wineskins of wine, 5 sheep already fixed, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. 19She told her young men, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow.” She didn’t tell her husband. 20As she was riding her donkey down under cover of the mountain, she met David and his men. 21David had said,

“For nothing I’ve guarded everything this man has on the open range so that he hasn’t missed anything. He’s paid me bad for good. 22God do so to me and more if by morning I leave him one male alive.”	 1 Sam 25:18-22

23-24When Abigail saw him, she hurried and dismounted. She fell on her face at his feet, bowed to the ground, and said,

“Put the blame on me, my lord. Please let me speak to you. 25Don’t pay any attention to this worthless fellow; he’s like his name Nabal, ‘a foolish man.’ I didn’t see the young men you sent. 26As sure as Yahveh lives and you live, since he’s restrained you from shedding blood to avenge yourself, may your enemies be like Nabal. 27Give this gift to the young men. 28Please forgive my sin. Yahveh will certainly make an enduring dynasty for you because you’re fighting his battles. There won’t be anything bad in you your whole life. 29If anybody attacks you, you’ll be in the bundle of the living with Yahveh your God. He’ll throw out the lives of your enemies as from the cup in a sling. 30When he keeps his promise and appoints you ruler over Israel, 31what’s happened won’t cause you grief for having shed blood unnecessarily to avenge yourself. When Yahveh deals well with you, remember me.”  	  1 Sam 25:23-31

32David told Abigail,

“Bless Yahveh God of Israel, who sent you. 33Bless you for your discretion. You’ve kept me from shedding blood to avenge myself. 34Nevertheless, as sure as Yahveh lives, who kept me from harming you, if you hadn’t come so soon, I wouldn’t have left Nabal one male by morning.”

35David accepted what she’d brought. “Go home on good terms. I’ve done what you asked.”	  1 Sam 25:32-35

36She went to Nabal. He was holding a feast in his house, celebrating like a king. He was half drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything till morning. 37When he’d sobered up, she told him everything. His heart died; he became like a stone. 38Some ten days later, Yahveh struck him, and he died.

39When David heard Nabal was dead, he said,

“Bless Yahveh, who pleaded the cause of his insult to me, and kept me from doing something bad. Yahveh has brought his wrongdoing back on him.”

Then David sent a proposal to Abigail to be his wife. 40When his servants came to her at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.” 41She got up and bowed to the ground, “I’ll wash his servants’ feet.” 42She got up quick and rode a donkey with her five maids attending her. She followed David’s messengers and became his wife. 43David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel; they both became his wives. 44Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti Ben-Laish from Gallim. 	1 Sam 25:36-44

David Spares Saul’s Life Again

26:1The people of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding on the Hill of Hachilah east of Jeshimon?” 2Saul went down to the Wilderness of Ziph with 3,000 chosen men to look for him. 3He camped on the Hill of Hachilah beside the road east of Jeshimon. David was staying in the open country. When he saw that Saul had come after him, 4he sent out spies to make sure that Saul was coming. 5He went to where Saul and his men had camped and saw where he lay beside Abner Ben-Ner, his general. The army was asleep around him.

6David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai Ben-Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai said, “I’ll go.” 7They went down at night. Saul was sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. 	1 Sam 26:1-7

8Abishai told David, “God has delivered your enemy to you. Let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke. I won’t strike him a second time.”

9But David said,

“Don’t destroy him. Who can kill Yahveh’s anointed and not be guilty? 10As sure as Yahveh lives, he’ll strike him, or he’ll die, or he’ll go down in battle. 11Yahveh forbid that I should kill him. Take the spear by his head and the jug of water, and let’s go.”

12David left with the spear and jug. Nobody saw or knew anything. Nobody woke up. A sound sleep from Yahveh had fallen on them all.	1 Sam 26:8-12

13David crossed back over to the other side and stood on top of the hill a good way off. 14He shouted to the army and to Abner, “Won’t you answer, Abner?”

Abner said, “Who are you, shouting to the king?”

15David asked him,

“Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why not protect the king? Someone came over to destroy him. 16What you’ve done isn’t good. As sure as Yahveh lives, you all need to die; you didn’t protect Yahveh’s anointed. See the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head.” 	1 Sam 26:13-16

17Saul recognized David’s voice, “Is that you, my son?”

David said,

“It’s me, my lord the king. 18Why are you chasing me? What have I done? 19If Yahveh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it’s people, they’re accursed by Yahveh because they’ve driven me out from Yahveh’s inheritance and told me to go serve other gods. 20Don’t let my blood fall to the ground away from Yahveh’s presence. You’ve come out to look for a single flea, like somebody hunting a partridge in the hills.”

21Saul said, “I’ve sinned. Go on back home. I won’t try to harm you again because you’ve valued my life today. I’ve played the fool and made a serious mistake.”

22David answered,

“The king’s spear! Have one of the young men come and get it. 23Yahveh will repay each man for his goodness and faithfulness. He delivered you to me, and I refused to reach out against you. 24As I highly valued your life today, so may Yahveh highly value my life and deliver me from all distress.”

25Saul said, “You’re blessed, son. You’ll accomplish a lot and certainly end up winning.”

David went on his way, and Saul went home.	  1 Sam 26:17-25

David Flees to the Philistines

27:1David said to himself, “Someday Saul is going to kill me. All I can do is escape to the Philistines. He’ll get tired of looking for me in Israel, and I’ll get away from him.” 2David and his 600 men crossed over to Achish Ben-Maoch, king of Gath. 3They lived with Achish, each with his family and David with his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 4Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, so he quit looking for him.

5Then David told Achish, “If I’m pleasing to you, have them give me a place in a town out in the country. Why should I live in the royal city with you?” 6Achish gave him Ziklag. It still belongs to Judah’s kings. 7He lived among the Philistines for a year and four months.

1 Sam 27:1-7

8David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; because they had lived in the land from ancient times, toward Shur all the way to Egypt. 9He attacked the land and didn’t leave a man or woman alive. He brought back to Achish the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing. 10Achish asked, “Where did you raid today?” David said, “In the Negev of Judah, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites.” 11David didn’t leave anyone alive to bring to Gath and said, “So they won’t say about us, ‘That’s been David’s practice ever since he lived among the Philistines.’” 12Achish believed David, “He has surely made himself repulsive to his people; he’ll serve me from now on.” 	1 Sam 27:8-12

Saul Consults the Medium at En-dor

28:1At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed camps to fight Israel. Achish told David, “You can be sure that you and your men will go out with me in the camp.”

2“All right, you’ll find out what I can do.”

“I’ll make you my bodyguard for life.”

3Samuel was dead, and Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, his own town. Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. 4The Philistines gathered and camped in Shunem, and Saul gathered Israel and camped at Gilboa. 5When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 6When he asked Yahveh, he didn’t answer him by dreams, Urim, or prophets. 7Saul told his advisors, “Find a medium so I can go ask through her.” They told him, “There’s a woman in En-dor.”   	1 Sam 28:1-7

8Saul disguised himself in different clothes and went to her with two men at night and said, “Conjure up for me and bring up the one I name.”

9“Surely you know Saul has expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why lay a trap to get me killed?”

10Saul swore by Yahveh, “As sure as Yahveh lives, you won’t be punished.”

11“Who do you want me to bring up?”

“Samuel.”

12When she saw Samuel, she cried out, “Why have you misled me? You’re Saul.”

13“Don’t be afraid; what do you see?”

“A god coming out of the ground.”

14“What’s he look like?”

“An old man, wearing a robe.”

Saul knew it was Samuel and bowed to the ground in homage. 	1 Sam 28:8-14

15Samuel said, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”

“I’m greatly distressed. The Philistines are waging war against me. God has left me and doesn’t answer me anymore by prophets or dreams. I’ve called you to tell me what I should do.”

16“Why ask me since Yahveh has become your adversary? 17He’s done what he said through me: he’s torn the kingdom from you and given it to David. 18As you didn’t carry out his fierce anger on Amalek, so he has done this to you today. 19He’ll deliver you and Israel’s army to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me!”	  1 Sam 28:15-19

20Saul fell headlong on the floor terrified. There wasn’t any strength in him; he hadn’t eaten anything all day and all night. 21The woman came and saw he was terrified. She said,

“I’ve done what you asked. I’ve taken my life in my hands and listened to you.  22Let me fix you some bread so you can have strength when you leave.”

23“I’ll don’t want anything.”

But she and his advisors kept urging him, so he gave in, got up off the floor, and sat on the bed.

24The woman had a grain-fed calf in the house. She hurried and butchered it, kneaded flour, and baked bread without yeast. 25She brought it to Saul and his men to eat. He got up and left.	  1 Sam 28:20-25

The Philistines Reject David

29:1The Philistines gathered their forces to Aphek while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 2The Philistine lords were moving forward by hundreds and thousands; David and his men were moving forward in the rear with Achish. 3The commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” Achish said, “Isn’t this David, Saul’s servant, that’s been with me these days, or years? I haven’t found a fault in him from the day he deserted to me till now.” 4But the commanders were mad,

“Make him go back to where you’ve assigned him. Don’t let him go down to battle with us and become our adversary during the fight. For how could he make himself acceptable to his lord? Wouldn’t it be with the heads of these men? 5Isn’t this David they sang about in the dances,

‘Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands!’?”	1 Sam 29:1-5

6Achish called David,

“As sure as Yahveh lives, you’ve been upright. Your conduct with me in the army is fine. I haven’t found anything bad in you since you came, but the other Philistine lords don’t want you here. 7Go back quietly so you won’t upset them.”

8David asked him, “What have I done? What have you found in me since I came to you, that I can’t go and fight my king’s enemies?”

9“You’re pleasing to me, like an angel of God, but the other commanders have said you can’t go into battle with us. 10Get up early with your servants and leave as soon as it gets daylight.”

11David and his men got up early to go back to the land of the Philistines. Then the Philistines went up to Jezreel.	   1 Sam 29:6-11

David’s Wives Are Captured

30:1When David and his men got home to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev, attacked Ziklag, and burned it. 2They took the women captive and everybody in it, big and small, but didn’t kill anybody. 3When David and his men got there, it had been burned, and their wives, sons, and daughters had been captured. 4They cried till they couldn’t cry anymore. 5David’s two wives had been taken, Ahinoam and Abigail. 6In addition, David was distressed because the people were talking about stoning him. They were bitter over losing their sons and daughters, but David took courage in Yahveh his God.

7He told Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, to bring him the ephod. 8He asked Yahveh, “Should I chase this band? Will I overtake them?”

“Yes, you’ll overtake them and rescue everyone.”

9He and his 600 men went to the Brook Besor, where the ones left behind remained. 10But David and 400 men pursued on. 200 stayed behind too exhausted to cross Brook Besor.

1 Sam 30:1-10

11They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David. They gave him bread and water, 12a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. He ate them and revived. He hadn’t eaten or drunk for three days. 13David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where are you from?”

“I’m a young man from Egypt, an Amalekite’s slave. My master left me behind when I got sick three days ago. 14We raided the Negev of the Cherethites that belongs to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag.”

15David said, “Will you bring me down to this band?”

He said, “Swear to me by God that you won’t kill me or turn me over to my master, and I’ll take you down to them.”	  1 Sam 30:11-15

David Defeats the Amalekites

16When he’d taken him down, they found them spread out all over the ground eating and drinking and dancing because of the large amount of spoil they’d taken from the Philistines and Judah. 17David slaughtered them from twilight till evening the next day. Not a man escaped, except for 400 young men that fled on camels. 18He recovered everything the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives. 19Nothing was missing, big or little, sons or daughters. He brought it all back. 20He’d captured the sheep and cattle the people drove ahead of the other livestock. They said, “This is David’s spoil.”	 1 Sam 30:16-20

21David came to the 200 men at Brook Besor that were too exhausted to go with him. They went out to greet him and the people that were with him. 22Then some ruffians among David’s men said, “They didn’t go with us. We’re not going to give them any of the spoil we’ve recovered. Every man can take his wife and children.”

23David said, “Brothers, don’t do that with what Yahveh’s given us. He protected us and delivered to us the band that attacked us. 24Who’d listen to you on this? The one that guards the luggage gets the same share as the one that goes to battle.”

25He made that an ordinance in Israel ever since.	 1 Sam 30:21-25

26When David got to Ziklag, he sent some spoil to the elders in Judah, his friends, and said, “A gift from the spoils of Yahveh’s enemies,” 27and to the people in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, Jattir, 28Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 29Racal, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, Kenites, 30Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 31Hebron—everywhere he and his men circulated. 	1 Sam 30:26-31

The Death of Saul

31:1The Philistines attacked Israel, and Israel fled and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malci-shua. 3The battle pressed Saul hard, and the archers seriously wounded him. 4He told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through so these uncircumcised Philistines won’t come and run me through and torture me.” But his armor bearer was afraid to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.  5When he saw that Saul was dead, he fell on his sword too and died with him. 6Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men that day. 7When the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and beyond the Jordan, saw that Israel had fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. The Philistines came and lived in them.

1 Sam 31:1-7

8The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa. 9They cut off his head, stripped off his weapons, and sent them all over Philistine territory to carry the good news to the temple of their idols and to the people. 10They put his weapons in the temple that held Ashtoreth’s images and fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 11When the people in Jabesh-gilead heard about it, 12brave men walked all night and took down the bodies of Saul and his sons. They went to Jabesh and burned them, 13buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted a week.	1 Sam 31:8-13
