<strong>(presented as from Peter’s defense in Jerusalem)</strong>



<strong><sup>11:1</sup>The apostles and brothers in Judaea heard that Gentiles had received God’s message. <sup>2</sup>When Peter went up to Jerusalem, members of the Circumcision took issue with him, <sup>3</sup>“You went in and ate with uncircumcised men.”</strong>

<strong>Peter explained step by step. <sup>10:1</sup>“A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius, from the Italian cohort, <sup>2</sup>is a devout God-fearer along with his whole house. <sup>30</sup>He gave considerable charitable gifts to the people and prayed to God constantly. </strong><strong><em>He</em></strong><strong> was keeping three p.m. prayer in </strong><strong><em>his</em></strong><strong> house. <sup>3</sup>In a vision he saw clearly an angel of God coming and standing in front of </strong><strong><em>him</em></strong><strong>, ‘Cornelius.’</strong>

<strong><sup>4</sup>“Cornelius looked at him and was afraid, ‘Yes, Sir?’</strong>

<strong><sup>31</sup>“God has heard your prayers and remembered your charitable gifts. <sup>32</sup>Send men to Joppa and summon Simon, called Peter. He’s staying with Simon, a tanner, whose house is next to the sea. <sup>11:14</sup>He’ll tell you what will save you and your household. <sup>10:7</sup>When the angel left, right away he called two household servants—his personal assistants, and a devout soldier. <sup>8</sup>He went through everything with them and sent them to Joppa.</strong>

<strong><sup>9</sup>“The next day, while they were getting close to the town, </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> went up on the housetop about noon to pray. 10</strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> was getting hungry. While they were fixing lunch, I saw a vision in a trance. </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> watched the sky open and a container like a big sheet was lowered to the earth by four corners. <sup>11:5</sup>It came to me. I stared into it, and saw four-footed animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds in it.</strong>

<strong>“</strong><strong><em>I </em></strong><strong>heard a voice, ‘Kill and eat them, Peter.’</strong>

<strong>“‘No, Sir, I’ve never eaten anything unclean.’</strong>

<strong>“The voice spoke out of heaven a second time, ‘Don’t </strong><strong><u>you</u></strong><strong> consider unclean what </strong><strong><u>God</u></strong><strong> has cleansed.’</strong>

<strong>“That happened three times, and the container went back up into the sky.</strong>

<strong><sup>10:17</sup>“While </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> was wondering what the vision could possibly mean, right then Cornelius’ three men from Caesarea were standing at the gate of the house where we were. <sup>18</sup>They called out, asking if Simon, called Peter, was staying there. <sup>19</sup>The Spirit said, ‘Three men are looking for you. <sup>20</sup>Go down and go with them, without scruples. I’ve sent them.’ </strong>

<strong><sup>21</sup>“</strong><strong><em>I </em></strong><strong>went down and said to them, ‘</strong><strong><em>I’m</em></strong><strong> the one you’re looking for. Why are you here?’</strong>

<strong><sup>22</sup>“They said, ‘Cornelius </strong><strong><em>is</em></strong><strong> a centurion, a good God-fearer, with a good reputation in the Jewish nation. A holy angel directed him to invite you to his house to hear what you have to say.’ <sup>23</sup>So </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> invited them in and put them up for the night.</strong>

<strong> “The next day </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> went with them, <sup>12</sup>and these six brothers from Joppa went along. <sup>24</sup>On the second day at about three o’clock </strong><strong><em>we</em></strong><strong> came into Caesarea <sup>12</sup>and went into the man’s house.</strong>

<strong><sup>24</sup>“Cornelius was expecting </strong><strong><em>us</em></strong><strong> and had called his relatives and close friends. <sup>25</sup>When </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> came in, he met </strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong> and fell down and worshiped </strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong>. 26</strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> raised him up, ‘Please stand up; </strong><strong><em>I’m</em></strong><strong> just a man too.’ <sup>27</sup>As </strong><strong><em>we</em></strong><strong> talked, </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> went on in and found a large group gathered.	</strong>

<strong><sup>28</sup></strong><strong><em>“I</em></strong><strong> told them, ‘You know a Jew’s not supposed to associate in a home with a foreigner.’ But God has shown me not to consider anybody unclean. <sup>29</sup>So without objecting, </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> came when you called. Why did you send for me?’</strong>

<strong>“Cornelius said, ‘Four days ago . . . a man in bright clothes </strong>told me to summon you. <strong><sup>33</sup>Thank you for coming. We’re here now in front of God to hear what the Lord’s commanded you.’ 34</strong><strong><em>I </em></strong><strong>said, </strong>

<strong>‘I perceive that God doesn’t play favorites with people. <sup>35</sup>But, in every nation he accepts the ones that respect him and live the way he wants them to. <sup>36</sup>He sent the message to the sons of Israel, preaching good news about peace through Jesus the Messiah, who is Lord over everybody. <sup>37</sup>You know what took place all over Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism John preached. <sup>38</sup>God anointed Jesus the Nazarene with the Holy Spirit and power. He went around doing good and healing people the devil oppressed, because God was with him. <sup>39</sup>We’re witnesses of what he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. The One they killed on a tree <sup>40</sup>God raised up the third day and presented him clearly, <sup>41</sup>not to everybody, but to witnesses he previously handpicked—to us who ate with him after his resurrection. <sup>42</sup>He sent us to testify to the People that he’s the One God appointed to judge the living and the dead. <sup>43</sup>The prophets testify that through him everybody who trusts in him receives forgiveness of sins.’</strong>

<strong><sup>44</sup>“While </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on <sup>10:15</sup>them as on us in the beginning. <sup>45</sup>The believers from the Circumcision who came with </strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong> were surprised that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Gentiles too. <sup>46</sup>They heard them speak in languages and praise God. <sup>16</sup>I remembered what the Lord said, ‘John immersed in water, but </strong><strong><u>you’ll</u></strong><strong> be “immersed” in the Holy Spirit.’ <sup>17</sup>If God gave them the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus the Messiah [</strong><strong><em>Christ</em></strong><strong>], who was I to oppose God? </strong>

<strong>	“</strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> responded, <sup>46</sup>‘Nobody can forbid water, can they, for baptizing these who have received the Holy Spirit like we did?’ </strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong> <sup>48</sup>commanded to baptize them into Jesus the Messiah. They asked </strong><strong><em>me</em></strong><strong> to stay for several days.”</strong>

<strong>	<sup>11:18</sup>When the apostles and brothers heard this, they backed off and glorified God. “Then to Gentiles too God has offered repentance to life.”</strong>
