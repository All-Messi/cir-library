COMPOSITE ACCOUNT OF PAUL’S CONVERSION

(as if told to Agrippa)

(Acts 9:1b-22; 22:4-16; 26:10-20;

common material; 3rd to 1st person)







“I persecuted The Way to death, binding and imprisoning men and women as the high priest and presbytery can confirm. That’s what I did in Jerusalem. Not only did I lock up many saints in prison with the authority of the chief priests; but when they were being put to death, I voted against them. When I punished them often in every synagogue, I tried to make them blaspheme. I was insanely furious and started persecuting them even to foreign cities.

“I went to the high priest and asked for letters to the brothers in the synagogues in Damascus so if I found any of The Way—men or women, I could bring them bound to Jerusalem to punish them. In that effort I traveled to Damascus with authority from the chief priests. As I got close to Damascus at about noon, King Agrippa, on the road suddenly I saw a light from the sky brighter than the sun shining around me and the ones with me. When we’d fallen to the ground, I heard a voice say in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It’s hard for you to keep kicking against the goads.’

“I said, ‘Who are you, Sir?’

“‘I’m Jesus the Nazarene that you’re persecuting.’

“The ones traveling with me stood speechless. They did see the light but didn’t see anybody; they heard the voice but couldn’t make out what the speaker was speaking to me.

“I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’

“‘Get up. I’ve appeared to you to appoint you as a witness of what you’ve seen and what I’ll show you. I’ll protect you from the People and from the Gentiles I’m sending you to. You’re to open their eyes so they’ll turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so they’ll receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by trusting in me.’ Go into Damascus. Someone will tell you what you should do.’

“‘I got up; and when I opened my eyes, I couldn’t see from the brilliance of that light. The ones with me took my hand and led me into Damascus. For three days I couldn’t see, and didn’t eat or drink anything.

“A disciple in Damascus named Ananias was devout according to the Law, a man that the Jews living there vouched for.

“The Lord said to him, ‘Ananias.’

“‘Yes, Lord.’

“‘Go to Straight Street and ask for Saul of Tarsus in the house of Judas. He’s praying, and he’s seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying hands on him so he can see.’

“Ananias answered, ‘Lord, I’ve heard from many people about this man—how many evil things he did in Jerusalem. He has authority here from the chief priests to bind everybody that calls on you.’

“The Lord said, ‘Go on; I’ve chosen him to carry my name in front of Gentiles, kings, and Israelites. I’ll show him how much he has to suffer for me.’

“Ananias went and entered the house, came and stood by me, laid hands on me, and said, ‘Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus that appeared to you on the road has sent me so you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit. Receive your sight.’ Immediately scales, as it were, fell from my eyes, and I could see again. I looked at him that very hour.

“He said, ‘Our ancestors’ God chose you ahead of time to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear his voice. You’re to testify for him to all people about what you’ve seen and heard. Now why wait? Get baptized and wash your sins away, calling on him.’ I got up and was baptized. After I got something to eat, I regained my strength.

“So, King Agrippa, I obeyed the heavenly vision. I was with the disciples in Damascus for a good while. Right away in the synagogues I started presenting Jesus as God’s Son. The ones that heard me were amazed, ‘Isn’t he the one that executed people in Jerusalem who called on this name, and has come here to lead them bound to the chief priests?’ I grew stronger and confounded the Jews in Damascus, proving that this is the Messiah.

“I’ve continued to declare in Jerusalem and Judaea, then to the Gentiles that people should repent toward God and do what fits with repentance.”
