Notes: Longer quotations include shorter parts within them quoted in other places. In the counting they are considered as one Old Testament passage quoted. Example: Jeremiah 31:31-34 and 31:31 and 31:34 are counted as one quoted Old Testament text.

Our listing we have extracted from the bold-face entries in the Greek text UBS 5th ed rev, 2014, including the wording of the Old Testament texts. In the back of that volume appears a listing of passage references, given both from Old to New (pp. 857-60) and from New to Old (pp. 860-63). Additionally, the publishers have included an “Index of Allusions and Verbal Parallels.”
