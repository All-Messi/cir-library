PROVERBS

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1Proverbs of Solomon Ben-David, King of Israel

2for knowing wisdom and instruction,

for understanding words that give insight,

3for receiving instruction in smart living,

goodness, justice, and equity;

4for giving prudence to the simple,

and knowledge and discretion to the young;

5for increasing learning in the wise

and gaining skill at understanding;

6for understanding proverbs and wise sayings,

riddles and profound speech.		Prov 1:1-6

7Respect for Yahveh is the first thing about being wise;

foolish people despise wisdom and instruction.

8Listen, son, to your father’s instruction;

don’t leave your mother’s teaching;

9they’ll be a crown for your head

and a garland for your neck.				Prov 1:7-9

10Son, if sinners tempt you, don’t give in to them.

11If they say, “Come on,

let’s lie in wait to shed blood

and ambush innocent people for fun.

12Let’s swallow them alive and whole like Sheol,

like people that go down to the Pit.

13We’ll get precious wealth

and fill our houses with plunder.

14Throw in your lot with us,

and we’ll share the take”—

15don’t go with them;

stay off that road.

16They hurry to do harm;

they rush to shed blood.				Prov 1:10-16

17There’s no point in spreading a net

while the bird’s watching.

18Sinners lie in wait for their own blood;

they ambush their own lives.

19That’s how it is with people that profit from violence;

it steals their own lives.				Prov 1:17-19

20Wisdom shouts in the street;

it raises its voice in the marketplace.

21It cries out from the top of the wall,

and says at the city gate:

22“How long, simpletons, will you like being simpletons,

and you scoffers delight in scoffing,

and you foolish people hate knowledge?

23Pay attention when I correct you;

I’ll pour out my spirit on you

and tell you what you need to know.

24I called and you wouldn’t listen;

I held out my hand, and you paid no attention.

25You ignored my advice;

you didn’t want me to correct you.

26So I’ll laugh at your misfortune

and mock you when panic strikes,

27when what you dread comes like a tornado,

when distress come crashing down on you.		Prov 1:20-27

28Then you’ll call out to me, and I won’t answer;

you’ll look for me, but not find me

29because you disregarded knowledge

and chose not to respect Yahveh.

30You wouldn’t accept my advice;

you despised being corrected;

31so you’ll eat the fruit of how you lived

founder on your own schemes.

32The waywardness of simpleminded people gets them killed;

the complacency of fools destroys them.

33But the ones that listen to me, live securely;

they’re at ease without dreading misfortune.”	Prov 1:28-33

2:1Son, if you accept what I say

and value my commandments,

2if you’re attentive to wisdom

and inclined to understanding,

3if you cry out for insight

and call out for comprehension,

4if you look for it like silver

and search for it like treasure—

5then you’ll understand the importance of reverence for Yahveh,

and find out what it means to know God.			Prov 2:1-5

6Yahveh gives wisdom;

knowledge and insight come from him.

7He stores up wisdom for godly people

and shields those who maintain integrity

8and guard justice.

He preserves his saints.

9Then you’ll understand goodness and justice,

equity and every proper course of action.

10Wisdom will come into your heart,

and knowledge will be pleasant to you.			Prov 2:6-10

11Discretion will come to you;

knowledge will watch over you

12to deliver you from the evil way,

from people that say perverse things,

13who leave the paths of godliness

to walk in the dark,

14who enjoy sinning

and revel in its perversity,

15whose paths are crooked,

whose ways are treacherous;

16to deliver you from immoral women,

from the seductive woman

17that leaves the husband of her youth

and forgets her covenant with God,

18whose house lies on the road to death,

whose footprints lead to the dead.

19No man that enters her house ever comes back;

they don’t reach the paths that lead to life.	Prov 2:11-19

20Follow the road good people take;

keep to the paths they follow,

21because the godly will live in the land;

the blameless will stay here.

22But sinners will be removed from the land;

the treacherous will be uprooted from their country.	Prov 2:20-22

3:1Son, don’t forget what I’ve taught you;

take my commandments to heart;

2they’ll add peace and length to your life.

3Don’t let kindness and truth slip away from you;

tie them around your neck;

write them on your heart.

4That way you’ll find blessing

and have a good reputation with God and people.

5Trust in Yahveh with all your heart;

don’t rely on your own perception.

6Acknowledge him in everything you do,

and he’ll make straight paths for you to follow.

7Don’t get the idea that you’re smart;

respect the LORD and turn your back on sin.

8It will heal your body and refresh your very bones.	Prov 3:1-8

9Honor Yahveh with your substance,

the firstfruits of your crops.

10Your barns will be full;

your vats will overflow with new wine. 			Prov 3:9-10

11Son, don’t reject Yahveh’s discipline

or give up when he corrects you;

12heY corrects the ones he cares about,

like a father that disciplines a son he delights in.

13They are blessed who find wisdom,

that gain insight.

14It’s more profitable than silver;

it brings greater gains than fine gold.

15It’s more precious than jewels;

nothing you desire can compare with it.

16Its left hand holds wealth and honor;

long life is in its right hand.

17Its ways are pleasant;

its paths are peaceful.

18It’s a life-giving tree for people that pick its fruit;

everybody that holds onto it is happy.			Prov 3:11-18

19Yahveh founded the earth with wisdom

and established the heavens with understanding.

20He broke up the depths with his knowledge,

and caused dew to settle from the sky.			Prov 3:19-20

21Son, keep sound wisdom and discretion nearby;

don’t let them out of your sight.

22They’ll refresh your soul

and adorn your neck.

23Then you’ll walk along your road

surefooted without stumbling.

24When you lie down, you won’t feel afraid;

when you go to bed, your sleep will be sweet.

25Don’t be afraid of sudden panic

or the ruin that sinful people may bring;

26because you’ll have confidence with Yahveh;

he’ll keep your foot out of the snare.			Prov 3:21-26

27Don’t withhold good from people that need it

when you can give it.

28Don’t tell them,

“Come back tomorrow, and you can have it.”

29Don’t devise misfortune against the one

that’s living safely beside you.

30Don’t be difficult with people

if they’ve done you no wrong.

31Don’t envy the violent

or choose to do what they do.

32Yahveh detests crooked people,

but he’s close to godly ones.

33HeY puts a curse on the house of the sinful,

but blesses the homes of the righteous.

34He scoffs at scoffers,

but is gracious to the humble.

35The wise inherit honor;

the foolish get disgrace.				Prov 3:27-35

4:1Listen to my instruction, children;

pay attention and learn.

2I’ll give you helpful guidance;

don’t abandon it.

3When I was my father’s son,

my mother’s tender only boy,

4he taught me,

“Hold fast to what I say;

keep my commandments and live.

5Gain wisdom! Get insight!

don’t forget it or leave it.

6Keep it with you, and it’ll protect you;

love it, and it’ll watch over you.

7This is the main thing about wisdom: get it;

whatever else you get, get that.

8Value it highly, and it’ll elevate you;

it will bring you honor if you embrace it.

9It will put a beautiful wreath on your head

and present you with a splendid crown.”		Prov 4:1-9

10Accept what I’m telling you, son,

and you’ll live a long time.

11I’ve directed you in the way of wisdom,

and led you in godly paths.

12When you walk, you won’t be hampered;

when you run, you won’t stumble.

13Latch hold of instruction and don’t let it go;

guard it, and it will determine your destiny.	Prov 4:10-13

14Don’t follow the road that sinners travel

or walk the path of perverse people.

15Avoid it; don’t pass by it;

turn and go the other way.

16They can’t sleep unless they mistreat someone;

they lose sleep unless they can trip somebody up.

17They eat the bread of wickedness,

and drink the wine of violence.

18But the path of goodness is like dawn’s early light;

it shines brighter and brighter till it’s fully day.

19The way of sinners is like darkness;

they don’t know what they’re stumbling over.

20Pay attention to me, son;

listen to what I’m telling you;

21don’t let it out of your sight;

keep it inside you.

22It gives life to those who find it

and health to their whole body.

23Watch over your heart diligently,

because the springs of life flow out of it.

24Put away a deceitful mouth;

put devious lips far from you.

25Look straight ahead;

fix your gaze in front of you.

26Keep your eye on the path you’re walking,

and all your ways will be safe.

27Don’t stray from them;

go the other way from sin.				Prov 4:20-27

5:1Pay attention to my wisdom, son;

listen to what I understand

2so you can use discretion

and express knowledge.

3An immoral woman’s lips drip honey;

her speech is more soothing than oil;

4but in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood,

as sharp as a two-edged sword.

5Her feet go down to death;

her steps lead to Sheol.

6She doesn’t ponder the path of life;

she wanders without realizing it.			Prov 5:1-6

7Listen to me, sons;

don’t turn aside from what I’m telling you.

8Stay away from her;

don’t go near her house,

9so you won’t be giving your vigor to others

and your years to someone cruel;

10so a stranger won’t be filled with your strength

and the fruit of your act go to an alien;

11and you groan at the end of life

because you’ve misused your body;

12and you say, “How I hated instruction!

my heart despised being corrected!

13I didn’t listen to my teachers,

or pay attention to my instructors!

14I’ve come to the point of total ruin

and have to face public disgrace.”		Prov 5:7-14

15Drink water from your own cistern,

fresh water from your own well.

16Should your spring be spilled

like water running down the street?

17Let it be for yours alone,

not for a stranger too.	Prov 5:15-17

18Let your fountain be blessed;

be happy with the wife of your youth.

19Like a lovely deer, a graceful doe,

be satisfied with her breasts;

be stimulated by her love.

20Son, why be stimulated by an immoral woman?

why embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21The LORD watches everyone

to see which direction they’re going.

22Their own iniquities capture the wicked;

they get caught in the web of their own sins.

23They die from ignorance

and get lost over foolishness.				Prov 5:18-23

6:1Son, if you sign for your neighbor

or give a pledge for a stranger,

2if you get snared by a promise you’ve made

or caught by what you’ve said,

3do this to deliver yourself:

since you’re at his disposal,

humble yourself and plead with him

to take away your obligation.

4Don’t sleep or slumber;

5deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hunter,

like a bird from a fowler.				Prov 6:1-5

6Go observe ants, lazy guy;

watch what they do and wise up.

7Though they don’t have a chief, an officer, or ruler,

8they prepare their food in the summer;

at harvest time they gather provisions for winter.

9How long will you lie around?

When will you get up from napping?

10“A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to rest”—

11your poverty will come on you like a bandit;

your need will attack you like an armed man. 	Prov 6:6-11

12A worthless, wicked man is one

that goes around lying,

13that winks with his eye,

signals with his feet,

gestures with his fingers,

14that plots in his mind

and constantly stirs up conflict.

15Tragedy will come crashing down on him;

all at once he’ll be crushed beyond recovery.		Prov 6:11-15

16Six things the LORD despises;

no, make that seven that disgust him:

17arrogant eyes,

lying tongues,

blood-shedding hands,

18plotting hearts,

feet in a hurry to do harm,

19witnesses who perjure themselves

and people that stir up conflict between friends.	Prov 6:16-19

20Son, observe your father’s commands;

don’t leave your mother’s teaching.

21Tie them next to your heart;

hang them around your neck.

22They’ll guide you when you walk,

watch over you while you sleep,

and advise you when you wake up.

23A commandment is a lamp;

teaching is a light;

corrections that discipline lead to life.		Prov 6:20-23

24They keep your eyes off an immoral woman,

a loose woman with smooth talk.

25Don’t desire her beauty

or let her catch your attention with her eyes.

26A prostitute leaves a man with little to eat;

an immoral woman stalks his very life.

27Can a man carry fire in his arms

and not singe his clothes?

28Can he walk on hot coals

and not burn his feet?

29Can a man go to his neighbor’s wife

and not suffer for it?					Prov 6:24-29

30People don’t despise a thief

that steals because he’s hungry;

31but when he’s caught, he still needs to repay it seven times over;

even if he has to sell everything in his house to make it right.

32A man that commits adultery lacks good judgment;

he’s looking to destroy himself.

33He’ll find wounds and disgrace

and shame he can’t erase.

34Jealousy makes a husband furious;

he won’t restrain his revenge.

35He won’t accept ransom

or be content with your gifts.			Prov 6:30-35

7:1Take my advice, son;

treasure up my commandments inside you.

2Keep my commands so you can have a life;

guard my teachings like the pupil in your eye.

3Tie them on your fingers;

write them on your heart.

4Call wisdom your sister and insight your friend,

5so they can keep you away from the adulteress

that flatters with her words.				Prov 7:1-5

6At the window of my house

I looked out through the lattice

7and saw among the naïve

a young man with no sense.

8He was going down the street near her corner

on the way to her house,

9in the evening at dusk.

During the night after dark,

10a woman comes to meet him,

dressed like a prostitute, coy at heart.

11She’s loud and rebellious, not content to stay home—

12now in the streets, now in the squares,

lurking at every corner.				Prov 7:6-12

13She grabs him and kisses him,

and says to him with a brazen face,

14“It was time for me to offer peace offerings;

I paid my vows today.

15So I’ve come out to meet you,

to look for you eagerly, and I found you.

16I’ve decorated my couch with covers,

with colored linens from Egypt.

17I’ve sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18Come on, let’s drink our fill of love till morning;

let’s delight ourselves with love.

19My husband’s gone on a long trip;

20he’s taken a moneybag with him

and won’t be back till full moon.”			Prov 7:13-20

21She entices him with persuasion,

and seduces him with flattery.

22Finally he follows her like a bull to slaughter,

like a stag heading for a trap.

23An arrow pierces his liver;

like a bird swooping to a snare,

he doesn’t realize it will cost him his life.		Prov 7:21-23

24So pay attention to what I’m saying, sons.

25Don’t let your heart turn to its own ways

or stray into its own paths;

26doing that has thrown down so many victims

and slain them.

27Her house lies on the road to Sheol,

that descends to the den of death.				Prov 7:24-27

8:1Wisdom calls out,

and intelligence raises its voice.

2It takes its stand on high places,

where footpaths meet.

3It shouts at the city gates,

4“I’m calling out to you;

my voice is aimed at everyone.

5Learn prudence, simple ones;

gain wisdom, foolish people.

6Listen, so I can tell you nobler things;

important things come from me.			Prov 8:1-6

7I tell the truth

because I detest sinfulness.

8Everything I say is good;

there’s nothing devious in it.

9What I say makes sense to anyone that has insight;

it’s right to those who learn.

10Take instruction rather than silver;

receive knowledge instead of gold

11because wisdom is worth more than jewels;

nothing you want compares with it.			Prov 8:7-11

12“I, wisdom, and good judgment live together;

I discover knowledge and discretion.

13Respecting Yahveh means hating sin,

pride and arrogance,

corrupt behavior and perverse speech.

14I offer advice about wise living

and provide insight and strength.

15Kings reign by me,

and rulers decree justice.

16Officials and nobles govern by me,

as does everyone that judges justly.

17I love the ones that love me,

that diligently search me out.

18I have wealth and honor to offer,

lasting riches and goodness.

19My fruit has more value than pure gold;

my yield outperforms the finest silver.

20I walk in the way of goodness,

on the paths of justice,

21to endow with wealth the ones that love me.	Prov 8:12-21

22“Yahveh created me at the very beginning,

before anything else he did in ancient times.

23I was in place from everlasting,

from the beginning of time on earth.

24I came before there were any oceans

or any springs abounded with water,

25before the mountains were born

or any hills existed,

26before he made soil and fields

and dust on the ground.				Prov 8:22-26

27I was there when he put the heavens in place,

and drew the horizons around the ocean;

28when he set the sky above

and established the fountains in the deep;

29when he set the shorelines for the seas

so water couldn’t cross their boundaries;

when he marked out the foundations for the earth.

30I stood beside him like a general contractor,

serving as his daily delight,

celebrating with him,

31rejoicing in the world he was making,

and delighting in humankind.				Prov 8:27-31

32“So now, my children, listen to me

because I bless those who keep my ways.

33Obey instruction in order to be wise;

don’t neglect it.

34Blessed are those who pay attention to what I say,

who watch at my gates each day

and wait at my doorpost.

35The ones that find me find life

and gain Yahveh’s blessing.

36But those who miss out on me hurt themselves;

The ones that hate me love death.”			Prov 8:32-36

9:1Wisdom has built her house;

She’s carved its seven columns.

2She’s done her butchering, mixed her wine,

and set her table.

3She’s sent her maids

to call out from the heights of the city:

4“Whoever is naïve, turn in here!”

She says to the one that lacks good judgment,

5“Come in and eat my food;

drink the wine I’ve mixed.

6Abandon your foolish ways and start having a life;

conduct yourself with good judgment.”		Prov 9:1-6

7If you correct a scoffer, you’ll be abused;

if you reprove sinners, you’ll get insulted.

8Don’t reprove scoffers; they’ll hate you.

reprove the wise, and they’ll love you.

9Instruct the wise, and they’ll be wiser still;

teach the good, and they’ll be better yet.

10Respect for Yahveh is basic to wisdom;

knowing the Holy One clarifies your thinking.

11It’ll multiply your days

and add years to your life.

12If you’re wise, you’re wise for yourself;

if you scoff at wisdom, it’ll be to your detriment.		Prov 9:7-12

13A foolish woman is loud;

she’s naïve and ignorant.

14She sits in the doorway of her house

or takes a seat on the high places in town.

15She calls out to those who are going by,

who are following straight paths:

16“Whoever is naïve, turn in here,”

she claims to the one that doesn’t know any better.

17“Stolen water is refreshing;

bread eaten in secret tastes good.”

18But they don’t know that the dead are there,

that her guests lie in Sheol.				Prov 9:13-18

10:1Proverbs of Solomon

A wise son makes a happy father,

but a foolish one grieves his mother.

2Ill-gotten gain doesn’t gain you anything,

but goodness delivers you from death.

3Yahveh won’t let good people go hungry;

he thwarts what the wicked want.

4A lazy hand makes for poverty;

a diligent one produces wealth.

5They who gather crops in the summer are smart;

those who sleep at harvest time are shameful.

6Blessings come to the good,

but the sinful harbor violent intentions.		Prov 10:1-6

7Good people leave blessed memories behind,

but sinful people’s names rot away.

8The wise in heart accept commands,

but babbling fools come to ruin.

9If you live with integrity, you’ll live with confidence,

but people soon find out if you’re crooked.

10The one that winks causes trouble;

babbling fools come to ruin.

11Good people’s words are life-giving fountains;

What sinners harbor discord.

12Hatred stirs up conflict,

but love atones for all sins.

13Wisdom comes from people that have insight;

but a rod is for the back of fools.

14The wise store up knowledge,

but ruin is at hand for foolish people.			Prov 10:7-14

15For the rich, wealth is a fortress;

For the poor, poverty is their ruin.

16Life is good people’s pay;

punishment is bad people’s payback.

17Listening to instruction puts you on the route to life;

abandoning correction gets you lost.

18Hiding hatred makes you a liar;

spreading slander makes you a fool.

19Talking too much makes you likely to sin;

so be wise and limit what you say.

20The words of good people are like fine silver;

what sinners say isn’t worth repeating.	Prov 10:15-20

21What good people say feeds many;

foolish people starve to death from ignorance.

22Yahveh’s blessing makes you rich,

and he doesn’t add sorrow to it.

23Sin is fun for fools;

so is wisdom for the wise.

24What sinners fear tends happen;

what good people want they tend to receive.

25After a windstorm passes, sinners have been blown away,

but the godly have a firm foundation.

26To those who hire them,

lazy people irritate like vinegar on teeth

and smoke in the eyes.	Prov 10:21-26

27Respecting Yahveh lengthens your life,

sinfulness cuts it short.

28Good people’s hopes result in happiness,

but the expectations of the sinful fade away.

29Yahveh’s way is your fortress if you’re godly,

but it destroys sinners.

30Good people won’t be displaced,

but the sinful will be expelled from their land.

31The mouth of good people overflows with wisdom,

but the perverse tongue of the wicked will be cut off.

32The good say what’s acceptable,

but the sinful say perverse things.			Prov 10:27-32

11:1 Yahveh detests a false balance;

he delights in accurate weights.

2Dishonor follows pride;

but wisdom lies with the humble.

3The integrity of the wise gives them direction;

the dishonesty of the treacherous destroys them.

4Wealth won’t help you when judgment comes,

but goodness delivers you from death.

5Goodness smooths the way for the blameless,

but the sinful collapse under the weight of their own sin.

6Their goodness delivers the godly,

their greed snares deceivers.				Prov 11:1-6

7When sinners die, their aspirations die as well;

hope perishes with the godless.

8Good people leave trouble behind,

but sinners head right for it.

9The godless destroy their neighbors with their mouths,

but knowledge lets the righteous escape.

10A city celebrates when things go well for the godly;

there’s also happy shouting over the demise of the sinful.

11The godly are a blessing that builds up a city;

the mouths of sinners tear it down.

12Belittling you neighbor doesn’t help anybody;

be silent and just let it rest.

13Gossips go around telling secrets;

reliable people keep private matters private.

14Without wise leaders a nation falls;

victory comes from having many advisors.	Prov 11:7-14

15Standing good for a stranger’s debt

means you’re likely to pay it;

avoid guaranteeing it and stay safe.

16A gracious woman earns respect;

a violent man just gets rich.

17Kindness repays you;

cruelty destroys you.

18Sinners get rich by deception;

people that sow goodness make a legitimate living.

19Steadfast goodness promotes life;

chasing after evil gets you killed.

20Yahveh detests the perverse in heart;

he delights in those blameless in their living.

21Sinful people will certainly suffer for it,

but the children of the just will be rescued.

22A beautiful woman with no discretion

is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.	Prov 11:15-22

23The godly look forward to good things;

the sinful are simply waiting for wrath.

24Give liberally and grow richer;

withhold what you should give

and be in need.

25The generous prosper;

those who refresh other people will be refreshed.

26People curse the one that hoards grain

but bless the one that sells it to people that need it.

27Whoever seeks the good finds favor,

and trouble comes to the one that’s looking for it.

28People that rely on their wealth will fall;

but the godly will flourish like green leaves.	Prov 11:23-28

29Bring trouble on your family,

and you’ll inherit the wind;

the foolish serve the wise.

30Good people become a tree of life,

the wise win friends.

31If the righteous are rewarded on earth,

how much more godless sinners!	Prov 11:29-31

12:1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge;

whoever hates to be corrected stays ignorant.

2Yahveh gives grace to the good,

but condemns those who concoct evil.

3Sinfulness brings instability,

but godliness grows deep roots.

4A good wife is her husband’s crown,

but one that embarrasses him is like cancer in his bones.

5You can trust the thinking of the righteous,

but the advice of sinners is treacherous.

6The words of sinners are like a murderous ambush,

but the words of the godly rescue people.	Prov 12:1-6

7The sinful are overthrown and disappear,

but the godly stand firm.

8People are commended for using good sense;

people with perverted minds are despised.

9The humble who work as servants are better off

than those who honor themselves and go hungry.

chasing after fantasies shows poor judgment.

but the goodly produce their own things.	Prov 12:7-12

good people avoid trouble like that.

14Good people gain satisfaction

from the effects of their words;

their actions also return to reward them.

15Fools think their way is the right way;

but the wise are willing to listen.

19A truthful tongue lasts a lifetime,

but lying lips don’t endure.

but advisors of peace have joy.

21Harm tends not to fall on good people;

sinners are always in trouble.

22Yahveh detests liars

but delights in reliable people.

foolish people talk too much.

24The diligent rule;

the lazy end up enslaved.	Prov 12:19-24

there’s no death there.	Prov 12:25-28

but scoffers don’t pay attention to correction.

2From the influence of your words,

people respond willingly;

4Lazy people want but don’t get;

the diligent have a rich supply.

but sinners act disgracefully.

6Goodness protects the blameless;

sinfulness undermines the sinful.	Prov 13:1-6

another pretends to be poor but is wealthy.

8The rich can pay a ransom to save their lives,

but the poor don’t get kidnapped for ransom.

9The light of the godly shines bright,

but the lamp of the sinful flickers out.

what we work for increases.

but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.	Prov 13:7-12

for avoiding the snares of death.

but a treacherous mind creates hardship.

16Prudent people act with insight;

fools flaunt their foolishness.

but a faithful envoy can bring detente.

18We risk poverty and shame by neglecting self-discipline;

honor comes to us if we value correction.	Prov 13:13-18

but fools hate to quit sinning.

20When you live with the wise you become wise;

companions of fools will suffer with them.

but injustice sweeps it all away.

a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

2We show respect for Yahveh by pursuing godliness;

4A manger stays clean where there are no oxen,

but abundant crops come in by their strength.

you won’t learn anything from them.

mere talk produces poverty.

24The wise wear their wealth like a crown;

the foolish dress in their own foolishness.	Prov 14:19-24

25A truthful witness saves lives,

but a false witness is a traitor.

26Those who respect the LORD feel confident;

their children have a reliable refuge.

27Respecting Yahveh provides a fountain of life

so people can avoid the snares of death.

28A growing population speaks well for a king;

what’s the point of a prince without subjects?

29Wise people control their temper;

short-tempered people show their lack of good sense.

but it’s not evident among fools.

sin’s a disgrace to any people.

35A king favors a servant that acts wisely,

but he lashes out at one that disgraces him.	Prov 14:31-35

15:1A gentle answer deflects anger;

harsh words make tempers flare.

2The wise dispense knowledge;

fools expound foolishness.

3Yahveh sees everything;

he watches the evil and the good.

4Gentle words are a tree of life,

but perverse talk breaks people’s spirit.

but those attentive to correction become prudent.

but the earnings of the sinful bring trouble.	Prov 15:1-6

the hearts of fools have nothing to offer.

but delights in the prayers of the righteous.

how much more our hearts!

12Scoffers don’t like people that rebuke them;

so they stay away from the wise.	Prov 15:7-12

13A cheerful heart makes a happy face,

but a sad heart breaks the spirit.

14The mind of the wise is hungry for insight,

but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.

15Negative people have nothing but bad days,

but with a happy heart they enjoy a continual feast.

16It’s better to have a little with reverence for Yahveh

than to have a lot with turmoil attached.

17A plate of vegetables with someone you love tastes better

than a roast from a grain-fed cow with someone you don’t like.

18Hot-tempered people stir up quarrels,

but controlling anger calms contentions. 	Prov 15:13-18

but the wise walk on a straight path.

22Without advice plans go awry,

but with many advisors they succeed.

23Everyone enjoys giving a good answer,

and a timely word delights those who hear it!

24The path of the wise leads upward

away from Sheol below.	Prov 15:19-24

25Yahveh tears down the house of the proud

but protects the widow’s home.

26Yahveh detests evil plans

but delights in pure words.

27Those greedy for gain bring trouble home;

those who refuse bribes live in peace.

sinners blurt out evil without thinking.

but he listens to the prayers decent people offer.

30A cheerful look makes the heart happy;

good news refreshes us deep inside.	Prov 15:25-30

31If you listen to constructive correction,

you’ll live among the wise.

16:1We have intentions,

but Yahveh provides the proper course of action.

2Our ways may seem pure to us,

but Yahveh weighs our motives.

and you’ll succeed.

4Yahveh has a purpose for everything,

even for sinners in troubled times.

and makes sure they’re punished.

respecting Yahveh avoids evil.	Prov 16:1-6

7When we please Yahveh,

he even makes our enemies live in peace with us.

8A little with goodness is better

than a lot with dishonesty.

9You can make your plans,

but Yahveh directs the steps you’ll take.

10A king needs to make inspired decisions;

he can’t afford to err in his judgments.

11Yahveh requires accurate scales and balances;

he sets the standard for every weight in the bag.

12An evil king is especially detestable;

a throne needs to be based on goodness.	Prov 16:7-12

13Godly words delight a king;

he loves people that tell the truth.

14A king’s anger is a death sentence;

the wise will appease it.

15There’s life in a king’s countenance;

his blessing is like clouds that bring spring rain.

16Getting wisdom is better than getting gold!

Choose insight above silver.

17The road of the upright leads away from evil;

those who watch where they’re going preserve their life.

18Pride goes before destruction,

and an arrogant spirit before a fall.	Prov 16:13-18

19Better to nurture a humble spirit

than share plunder with the proud.

20By attending to Yahveh’s word, we find what’s good;

he blesses us who trust in him.

21The wise in heart we consider insightful;

their pleasant words seem more persuasive.

22Wisdom is a fountain of life to the wise,

but foolishness disciplines fools.

23The wise think carefully about what they say,

which adds power to their comments.

24Pleasant words are like honeycomb,

sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.	Prov 16:19-24

25There’s a way that seems right,

but it leads to death.

26The workers’ appetite works for them

because their hunger drives them on.

what they say is like a scorching fire.

28Perverse persons spread conflict;

slanderers alienate friends.

29Violent people tempt their friends

and lead them off in the wrong direction.

30Those who wink devise perverse things;

they who purse their lips bring about evil.	Prov 16:25-30

31A gray head is a crown of honor

gained by a good life.

32Those who are slow to lose their temper

are stronger than the powerful;

the ones that rule their spirit

are better than troops that capture a city.

33We cast lots in the lap,

but Yahveh determines how they fall.	Prov 16:31-33

17:1A dry morsel eaten in peace tastes better

than a feast in a house full of conflict.

2A wise servant will rule a shameful son

and share in the inheritance among brothers.

3Fire refines silver and a furnace purifies gold,

but Yahveh assays the heart.

4Wrongdoers pay attention to gossip;

liars latch onto slander.

5People that mock the poor insult their Maker;

those who rejoice over their misfortune will get their just due.

6Grandchildren are the crown of old age;

parents are the pride of their children.	Prov 17:1-6

7Fine speech doesn’t fit with being a fool;

much less is lying appropriate for leaders.

8A bribe is a lucky charm in its owner’s sight;

whoever uses it prospers!

9Forgiving fosters love,

but dwelling on faults alienates friends.

10A rebuke penetrates deeper into thoughtful people

than 100 blows affect a fool.

11Rebellious people are looking for trouble;

so a cruel messenger will confront them.

12Facing a bear robbed of her cubs

is safer than confronting a fool for his folly.	Prov 17:7-12

13Misfortune never leaves the house of anyone

that repays a good deed with a bad one.

14Starting an argument is like opening a floodgate;

so stop a quarrel before it starts.

15Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent

are equally detestable to Yahveh.

16Why spend money on educating fools

when they don’t care about learning?

17A friend loves despite the circumstance;

adversity forges friendship.

18It’s not good judgment

to guarantee another person’s debt.	Prov 17:13-18

19Loving sin amounts to loving conflict;

trusting in tall walls invites invasion.

20A crooked heart doesn’t prosper;

a lying tongue calls for retaliation.

21The parents of a fool feel discouraged;

there’s no joy in life for the father of a fool.

22A happy heart is good medicine;

a broken spirit weakens health.

23Sinners accept secret bribes

to pervert the course of justice.

24Sensible people find wisdom nearby;

fools think they’ll find it far away.	Prov 17:19-24

25Foolish children are a grief to their father

and bring bitterness to the one that gave them birth.

26It’s wrong to punish the godly for their godliness

or flog noble people for being noble.

27Wise people speak with restraint;

cool heads display better insight.

28Even fools, people consider wise

as long as they keep their mouth shut;

people suppose fools are smart when they close their lips.

Prov 17:25-28

18:1Unfriendly people pursue selfish ends;

and don’t use common sense.

2Fools don’t delight in learning,

only in telling what they think.

3When sinners come, contempt comes with them;

and with dishonor comes disgrace.

4Wise thoughts are deep water;

wisdom is the spring for a babbling brook.

5Don’t cater to bad people

or deprive the good of justice.

6Fools’ lips instigate conflict;

their mouths are asking for a slap.	Prov 18:1-6

7The mouths of fools bring about their ruin;

their lips serve as snares to them.

8Rumors are like delicious morsels;

they just work their way down inside you!

9People that aren’t productive

are relatives of those who destroy.

10Yahveh’s name is a strong tower;

escape to it for safety.

11The wealth of the rich is their fortified city;

in their imagination it’s like a high wall.

12Pride goes before destruction;

humility precedes honor.	Prov 18:7-12

13Popping off an answer before listening to the question

is foolish and shameful.

14The human spirit can survive a sick body,

but who can endure a broken spirit?

15The wise search for knowledge;

the prudent acquire it.

16Generosity opens doors

and connects you with important people.

17The first to argue a case in court

sounds convincing till someone cross-examines.

18Casting lots ends contentions;

it settles disputes between powerful contenders.	Prov 18:13-18

19Winning back an offended brother

is harder than conquering a fortified city;

arguments become like the barred gates of a fortress.

20What the mouth says satisfies the inner self;

what the lips express brings satisfaction.

21The tongue wields the power of life and death;

those who love it will reap its consequences.

22A man that finds a wife finds something good

and obtains Yahveh’s blessing.

23The poor ask for help;

the rich answer roughly.

24Someone with lots of “friends” may come to ruin,

but there’s a friend that sticks closer than a brother.	Prov 18:19-24

19:1The honest poor are better off

than dishonest fools.

2It’s not good to not know;

enthusiasm doesn’t compensate for ignorance.

3When people’s foolishness brings them to ruin,

they blame Yahveh.

4Wealth draws lots of friends

that desert you if poverty comes.

5False witnesses will get their just due;

perjurers won’t get off free.

6Many ask for generous people’s blessing;

everybody makes friends with bighearted people.	Prov 19:1-6

7Relatives of the poor despise them,

and their friends leave!

Appealing to them won’t bring them back.

8People that gain wisdom care about themselves;

they prosper who cherish understanding.

9False witnesses won’t go unpunished;

liars perish.

10Living in luxury isn’t fitting for a fool,

much less for a slave to rule over princes.

11Discretion gives you control over anger;

you learn to delight in overlooking sin.

12A king’s anger is like a lion’s roar;

his blessing falls like dew on grass.	Prov 19:7-12

13A foolish child destroys a father;

a nagging wife is like constant dripping.

14Houses and wealth people inherit from parents,

but a prudent wife comes from Yahveh.

15Laziness lulls people to sleep;

shiftless people go hungry.

16Those who keep the commandments keep their life;

people that are careless about their way will lose it.

17Those gracious to the poor lend to Yahveh;

he’ll reward them for the good they do.

18Discipline your children while there’s hope

so you won’t ruin their lives.	Prov 19:13-18

19Let angry people suffer the consequences;

bail them out, and you’ll have it to do again.

20Listen to advice and respond to discipline

so you can gain wisdom for later on.

21People make their plans,

but Yahveh’s counsel is what prevails.

22Loyalty makes everyone better;

poor people are better at it than liars.

23Respecting Yahveh leads to life;

you can sleep in peace without worrying about misfortune.

24Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate,

but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.	 Prov 19:19-24

25Punish scoffers so the simpleminded can learn prudence;

reprove the wise and they’ll be wiser still.

26Children that mistreat their parents

are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.

27If you stop paying attention to discipline, child,

you’ll never learn what you need to know.

28A worthless witness makes mockery of justice;

a sinful mouth eats sin.

29Penalties are designed for scoffers,

and scourging for the backs of fools.	Prov 19:25-29

20:1Wine is a mocker, beer is a brawler;

whoever errs in them is not wise.

2A king’s anger is like a lion’s growl;

stirring it up forfeits your life.

3Staying away from conflict honors you;

any fool can fight.

4Anyone too lazy to plow

will beg for food at harvest time.

5A purpose in your heart is like deep water,

but you can draw it out with thoughtful effort.

6Many claim to be loyal,

but who can find someone that’s actually loyal?	Prov 20:1-6

7How blessed the children are

whose parents carry themselves with integrity.

8A king on a just throne

winnows evil with his eyes.

9Who can say, “I’ve cleansed my heart;

I’m pure from sin”?

10Yahveh detests false weights and measures.

11Even kids mark themselves by what they do

if their actions are pure and good.

12The hearing ear and seeing eye—

Yahveh made them both.	Prov 20:7-12

13Don’t love sleep too much; you’ll end up poor;

keep your eyes open, and you’ll have enough to eat.

14“It’s no good,” buyers say;

but when the seller’s gone, they brag about the bargain.

15Gold and precious stones abound,

but knowledge has more value.

16Take his cloak who signs for a stranger;

hold him in pledge for foreigners.

17Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet,

but afterward it feels like gravel in your mouth.

18Make plans in consultation with the other players;

wage war with guidance.	Prov 20:13-18

19Gossips tell secrets;

so don’t associate with people that talk too much.

20Curse father and mother,

and your lamp will go out when it gets dark.

21Inheritance gained too early in life

won’t be a blessing in the end.

22Don’t say, “I’ll get even with him”;

wait and let Yahveh do it.

23Yahveh detests false weights;

dishonest scales don’t please him.

24Yahveh orders our steps;

so how can we fully understand our way?	Prov 20:19-24

25You set a trap for yourself by making a rash vow to God

and only thinking about it after you’ve vowed.

26A wise king winnows sinners

and drives the threshing wheel over them.

27The human spirit is Yahveh’s lamp;

it searches out the inner self.

28Loyalty and truth keep a king in office;

he holds onto his throne by goodness.

29A young man’s strength is his glory;

an old man’s glory is his gray hair.

30Punishment cleanses evil away;

discipline purifies the heart.	Prov 20:25-30

21:1A king’s heart in Yahveh’s hand

is like a stream he can direct where he wants.

2Your own way seems right to you,

but Yahveh weighs your heart.

3Yahveh wants goodness and justice

more than sacrifice.

4Arrogant eyes and a proud heart

are wicked people’s lamp—and sin.

5Diligent planning gives you an advantage;

getting in a hurry gets you poverty.

6Getting rich by lying is a dissipating vapor

that ends in death.	Prov 21:1-6

7Sinful people’s violence sweeps them away

because they refuse to do what’s right.

8A guilty person’s road is full of curves,

but the conduct of the pure makes a straight path.

9It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop

than inside the house with a contentious woman.

10Evil people desire evil

and don’t show compassion to anyone.

11Punishing scoffers makes them wise;

instructing the wise makes them wiser still.

12Good people watch out for the sinful

and turn them to ruin.	Prov 21:7-12

13If you shut out the cry from the poor,

you’ll cry out yourself and not be heard.

14A secret gift calms anger;

a present turns it away.

15Good people enjoy carrying out justice;

justice distresses sinners.

16If you stray from understanding,

you’ll end up among the dead.

17People that love pleasure become poor;

they who love wine and comfort never get rich.

18Sinners are ransoms for the righteous;

the unfaithful replace the good.	Prov 21:13-18

19It’s better to live in the desert

than with a contentious, “complainy” woman.

20Precious treasure and oil are in the houses of the wise,

but foolish people waste them.

21Pursue goodness and loyalty,

and you’ll arrive at life, goodness, and honor.

22The wise scale the walls of the powerful

and bring down the fortress they trust in.

23Watch your mouth and guard your tongue,

and you’ll stay out of trouble.

24“Scoffers” is the name for proud, haughty people

that conduct themselves with arrogance.	Prov 21:19-24

25Lazy people’s desires end up killing them

because they refuse to work.

26The greedy never get enough

while the godly give liberally.

27God despises sinners’ sacrifices,

especially when they bring them with selfish motives.

28False witnesses perish,

but good listeners testify forever.

29Sinners bluff,

but the godly think before they act.

30No wisdom, insight, or counsel

can prevail against Yahveh.

31A horse is trained for battle,

but victory comes from Yahveh.				Prov 21:25-31

22:1A good name means more than great wealth;

being blessed is better than having silver and gold.

2The rich and the poor have this in common:

Yahveh made them both.

3Prudent people see evil and avoid it;

but the simpleminded rush on ahead and suffer for it.

4Wealth, honor, and life are rewards

for humility and reverence for Yahveh.

5Briers and snares lie along the path of perverse people;

those who watch what they’re doing avoid such things.

6Train up children in the way they should go;

and when they’re older, they won’t stray from it.	Prov 22:1-6

7The rich rule the poor;

borrowers become servants to lenders.

8Those who sow sin reap disaster,

and their fury won’t subdue the opposition.

9Generous people will be blessed

because they give some of their food to the poor.

10Get rid of scoffers, and contention leaves too;

conflict and dishonor stop.

11The one that loves a pure heart

and has gracious speech becomes a king’s friend.

12Yahveh preserves knowledge

and overthrows what unreliable people say.	Prov 22:7-12

13Lazy people claim, “There’s a lion outside;

I’ll surely get killed in the streets!”

14An immoral woman’s mouth is a deep pit;

the one Yahveh curses falls into it.

15Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a kid,

but discipline drives it out.

16Those who oppress the poor to get ahead—

or regale the rich—come to poverty themselves.

Prov 22:13-16

17Listen to the wise

and apply your mind to my instruction;

18it will be pleasant if you retain it

so you’re ready to pass it on.

19I’m teaching you today

so you’ll trust in Yahveh.

20Haven’t I written helpful things

about advice and knowledge,

21to make you sure of the truth

so you can report correctly to the one that sent you?

22Don’t rob the poor, who can’t resist,

or try to crush them in court;

23Yahveh will argue their case

and sentence to death those who’ve robbed them.	Prov 22:17-23

24Don’t associate with people prone to anger

or go around with hotheaded types;

25you’ll pick up their habits

and entangle yourself in a net.

26Don’t give pledges or sign for debts.

27If you can’t pay,

why let someone take your bed from under you?

28Don’t remove the ancient boundary markers

that your ancestors have set.

29Do you see people skilled at their work?

They’ll serve kings, not just ordinary people.	Prov 22:24-29

23:1When you’re dining with a ruler,

consider carefully what he sets in front of you.

2Put a knife to your throat

if you have a big appetite.

3Don’t crave very many of his delicacies;

they may be there to test you.

4Don’t wear yourself out trying to get wealthy;

quit concerning yourself with riches.

5When you stare at wealth, it disappears;

it grows wings like an eagle and flies to the sky.	Prov 23:1-5

6Don’t eat with stingy people

or crave their delicacies;

7what they think to themselves is what they really are:

they may tell you to eat up and drink,

but they don’t mean it!

8You’ll vomit the morsel you’ve eaten

and waste your compliments.

9Don’t speak where fools can hear you;

they’ll despise the wisdom of what you say.

10Don’t move an ancient boundary marker

or trespass in the fields of the fatherless,

11because their Rescuer is powerful;

he’ll sue you in court.

12Apply your heart to instruction

and your ears to knowledge.					Prov 23:6-12

13Don’t withhold discipline from your children;

punishment won’t kill them.

14Use a switch on them

and deliver their souls from Sheol.

15Son, if your heart’s wise, mine will be glad;

16I’ll be happy when you become an honest man.

17Don’t envy sinners;

always live in reverence for Yahveh.

18There most certainly is a future;

your hopes won’t be disappointed.

19Listen and be wise;

direct your heart on the right course.	Prov 23:13-19

20Don’t pal around with heavy drinkers or big eaters;

21drunks and gluttons end up poor,

and laziness will dress them in rags.

22Listen to your father;

don’t look down on your mother when she’s old.

23Buy truth and don’t sell it;

get wisdom, instruction, and insight.

24Parents delight in well-behaved children;

mature offspring make them happy.

25Make father happy;

let her enjoy life who gave you birth.	Prov 23:20-25

26Give me your heart, son;

observe my ways.

27A prostitute is a deep pit;

an immoral woman is a narrow well.

28She lurks around like a robber

and makes men unfaithful.	 Prov 23:26-28

29Who has misfortune? Who is sad?

Who has to cope with conflict?

Who complains?

Who is wounded for no reason?

Whose eyes are bloodshot?

30Those who linger long over wine,

who look around for mixed wine.

31Don’t gaze at wine when it’s red,

when it sparkles in the cup,

when it goes down smoothly.

32Afterward it strikes like a serpent;

it bites like a viper.

33You’ll have hallucinations

and say crazy stuff.

34You’re like somebody asleep, bobbing on the ocean

or swaying on the rigging of a ship.

35“They strike me, but it doesn’t hurt;

they beat me, but I don’t feel it.

When I wake up,

I’ll want another drink.”	Prov 23:29-35

24:1Don’t envy bad people

or want to be around them;

2their minds devise violence;

their lips stir up trouble.

3Wisdom builds a house;

intelligence establishes a home;

4knowledge fills its rooms with precious, pleasant wealth.

5The wise are strong;

knowledge increases their strength;

6they wage war with effective strategy;

they win the victory because of their many advisors.

7Wisdom is out of the reach of fools;

they have nothing to say in the city gate.

8People call them schemers who plot misfortune;

9devising foolishness is sin;

scoffing is detestable.	Prov 24:1-9

10If adversity makes you weak,

you’re not very strong to start with.

11Rescue those unjustly sentenced to death;

save those who are staggering to their execution.

12If you try to excuse yourself by claiming ignorance,

won’t he know better than that who weighs your heart?

Doesn’t he know you that keeps your soul?

Won’t he render to you what you deserve?

13Son, eat honey; it’s good;

honeycomb tastes sweet.

14Understand that wisdom is like that to your soul;

if you find it, you’ll have a bright future,

and your hope won’t fade away.	Prov 24:10-14

15Don’t lie in wait at godly people’s house, you wicked;

don’t raid their resting place.

16Good people fall seven times and get up again;

but for sinners, one disaster is more than enough.

17Don’t be glad when your enemies stumble

or celebrate when they fall.

18Yahveh won’t be pleased;

he’ll turn his anger away from them.

19Don’t worry about sinners or envy them;

20they have no future; their lamp will flicker out.	Prov 24:15-20

21Son, revere Yahveh, respect the king,

and don’t associate with unstable people;

22their disaster will rise up unexpectedly,

and ruin you with them.

23These are sayings of the wise:

Showing partiality in judgment is unjust.

24Anyone that tells sinners they’re good,

people will curse and nations abhor.

25But those who rebuke sinners will receive delight;

blessing will come to them.

26Giving an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.	Prov 24:21-26

27Finish your work in the field first;

then come and build your house.

28Don’t testify against someone for no reason

or deceive by what you say.

29Don’t say, “I’ll do to him what he’s done to me;

I’ll render to him his deeds in return.”

30I went past a lazy person’s field,

past the vineyard of someone without common sense.

31Thistles had taken it over;

nettles covered the ground;

its walls were broken down.

32I thought about what I saw;

I looked and learned:

33“A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to rest.”

34Your poverty will descend on you like a raider;

your need will attack you like an armed robber.	Prov 24:27-34

25:1

More of Solomon’s Proverbs That the Men of Hezekiah,

King of Judah, Transcribed

2It’s God’s privilege not to reveal things

it’s a king’s responsibility to figure them out.

as the sky is high and the earth is deep.

6Don’t claim a privileged position in a king’s presence

or put yourself in a place designated for nobles.

7It’s better to be told to come up higher

than to be put down lower

in the presence of a prince.

What you’ve seen

8don’t rush to court over;

what will you do at the end of the trial

if the one you accuse puts you to shame?

9When you’re arguing with your neighbor,

don’t betray another person’s confidence;

10people may find out and accuse you of gossiping,

and you won’t regain your good reputation.	Prov 25:6-10

11Words fitly spoken in the proper place

are like golden apples in a silver setting.

12A wise correction to an attentive ear

is like a gold earring or jewelry.

13An employer’s reliable messenger

refreshes like cold snow at harvest time.

14People that brag falsely about what they’ll do

are like clouds and wind without rain.

15Patience can persuade a prince;

a soft tongue can break a bone.

16Have you found honey?

Don’t eat too much of it and make yourself sick.

17Don’t visit your friends too often;

they’ll get tired of you.

18Someone that slanders

is like a club, a sword, a sharp arrow.	Prov 25:11-18

19Depending on undependable people in hard times

is like chewing with a broken tooth

or walking on a sprained ankle.

20Singing to a heavy heart

is like removing your coat on a cold day

or pouring vinegar on lye.

21If your enemies are hungry, feed them;

if they’re thirsty, give them a drink;

22you’ll be dumping hot coals on their head,

and Yahveh will reward you.	Prov 25:19-22

23A north wind brings rain;

a back-biting tongue brings angry looks.

24It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop

than inside a house with a contentious woman.

25Good news from a distant land

is like cool water to a weary soul.

26Good people that cave in to sinful people

are like trampled springs and polluted wells.

27Don’t eat too much honey;

don’t seek your own honor.

28Someone that’s out of control

is like an unwalled city; it’s open to attack.	Prov 25:23-28

26:1Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,

honor is out of place on a fool.

2Like a flitting sparrow, like a fluttering swallow,

an undeserved curse doesn’t land on its intended victim.

3A whip is for a horse,

a bridle is for a donkey,

a rod is for the back of a fool.

4Don’t answer fools’ arguments;

you’ll dignify them with a response.

5Answer fools’ arguments;

otherwise, they’ll think they’ve won.

6Trusting a fool to deliver a message

is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison. 	Prov 26:1-6

7A proverb in the mouth of a fool

is like legs hanging from the lame.

8Honoring a fool

is as dangerous as putting a stone in a sling.

9A proverb in the mouth of a fool

is like a thorn in the hand of a drunk.

10Whoever hires a fool or passerby

is like an archer that shoots at random.

11A fool that repeats his folly

is like a dog that returns to its vomit.

12There’s more hope for fools

than for people that think they’re smart.	Prov 26:7-12

13Lazy people claim there’s a lion in the road!

There’s surely a lion in the public square!

14Like a door swinging on its hinges,

lazy people turn on their beds.

15Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate

but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.

16Lazy people think their smarter

than seven wise advisors.

17A passerby that meddles in other people’s conflict

is like someone taking a dog by the ears.	Prov 26:13-17

18-19Someone that lies

and says, “Just kidding,”

is as dangerous as a maniac

that’s shooting flaming arrows.

20For lack of wood a fire goes out;

where there’s no gossip, quarreling dies down.

21Contentious people spark conflict

like charcoal on hot embers or wood on fire.

22Rumors are like delicious morsels;

they work their way down deep inside you!

23Warm lips and a base heart

are like silver glaze on a clay pot.	Prov 26:18-23

24People disguise disdain with words

while storing up deceit in their heart;

25don’t trust them when they pretend to be kind to you,

because they have seven evils in their minds;

26though they coat their disdain with lies,

it’ll eventually come out for all to see.

27You dig a pit for others, only to fall in it yourself;

you roll a boulder uphill only to have it roll back and crush you.

28A lying tongue despises its victims;

a flattering mouth brings ruin.	Prov 26:24-28

27:1Don’t brag about tomorrow;

you don’t know what’s going to happen.

2Let somebody else praise you, not your own mouth;

a stranger, not your own lips.

3A rock is heavy and sand weighs a lot,

but a fool’s resentment outweighs either one.

4Anger and wrath are bad enough,

but jealousy is even worse.

5Open rebuke is better than secret love.

6A friend’s wounds may be sincere,

but an enemy’s kisses deceive.	Prov 27:1-6

7A person that’s full hates honey;

one that’s famished thinks bitter tastes sweet.

8If you wander away from home,

you’re like a bird that wanders off from its nest.

9Oil and perfume make you feel good,

and a friend’s advice is sweet.

10Don’t abandon a friend, yours or your father’s;

that way, if misfortune comes,

you won’t have to impose on your brother’s house;

a near neighbor is better than a distant brother.

11Be wise and make me happy, child,

so I can answer critics that try to disgrace me.

12The prudent foresee danger and take precautions;

the simpleminded plunge ahead and pay the price.	Prov 27:7-12

13Get security from someone that guarantees a foreigner’s debt;

get a deposit for a promiscuous woman.

14Loudly blessing a friend in the morning

will be taken as an enemy’s curse.

15A contentious wife is like a steady rain;

16whoever tries to restrain her

may as well try to restrain the wind

or hold onto something with an oily hand.	Prov 27:13-16

17Like iron sharpens iron,

one person sharpens another.

18If you tend a fig tree, you'll eat its fruit;

if you aid your master’s interests, you’ll be rewarded.

19As water reflects a face,

the heart reflects the real person.

20Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;

neither are people’s wants.

21A crucible is for silver, and a furnace is for gold;

a person is put to the test by flattery.

22Though you grind fools in a mortar

with a pestle like crushed grain,

you won’t separate them from their foolishness.	Prov 27:17-22

23Keep tabs on the condition of your flocks;

pay close attention to your herds,

24because wealth doesn’t last forever,

and a crown isn’t permanent.

25When the hay’s all in

and new growth starts to appear

and the grass on the hillsides is in the barn,

26lambs will provide wool for your clothes,

and your goats will be worth enough to buy a field;

27you’ll have enough goats’ milk for yourself,

your family, and your servant girls.	Prov 27:23-27

28:1Sinners run when no one’s chasing,

but the good are as bold as lions.

2When a country sins, lots of leaders vie for control;

but wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability.

3The poor that oppress the poor

are like a driving rain that destroys crops.

4Those who leave the Law commend the sinful,

but those who keep it contend with them.

5Bad people don’t understand justice,

those who look to Yahveh understand it.

6Being poor and honest

is better than being rich and dishonest.	Prov 28:1-6

7Young people that keep the Law are wise offspring,

but companions of gluttons humiliate their parents.

8Whoever increases wealth by charging high interest,

gathers it for the one that’s kind to the poor.

9When people quit listening to the Law,

even their prayers become offensive.

10They who mislead the godly

fall into their own pit,

but the honest inherit good things.

11The rich may think they’re smart,

but poor people with insight can see through them.

12When the godly triumph, everybody’s glad;

but when the sinful take over, people leave. 		Prov 28:7-12

13Concealing your sins won’t make you prosper,

but confessing and abandoning them will foster mercy.

14How blessed they are who fear doing wrong,

but those who harden their hearts are headed for trouble.

15An evil ruler is as dangerous to poor people

as a roaring lion or a charging bear.

16A leader that oppresses isn’t using good judgment;

anyone that hates unjust gain prolongs life.

17Corrupt leaders, loaded down with the guilt of human blood,

will be fugitives till death; nobody will take their side.

18People that live with integrity will be rescued,

but those who are perverse will suddenly fall.	Prov 28:13-18

19The man that plows his ground will have plenty to eat,

but one that follows fantasies will be poor in the midst of plenty.

20Reliable people receive many blessings,

but those who want to get rich quick get into trouble.

21Showing partiality is never good;

yet some would sin to get a piece of bread.

22A miser hurries to get rich

and doesn’t realize that want will overtake him.

23Someone that rebukes finds more approval

than someone that flatters.

24People that steal from their parents,

and claim it’s not sin,

are no better than murderers.	Prov 28:19-24

25Arrogant people stir up conflict,

but those who trust in Yahveh prosper.

26People are foolish to trust in themselves;

it’s the ones that live wisely that stay safe.

27If you give to the poor, you’ll never be poor;

but if you close your eyes to poverty, you’ll be cursed.

28When corrupt leaders rise to power, people go into hiding;

when they meet disaster, the godly flourish. 	Prov 28:25-28

29:1If you stiffen your neck after repeated correction,

you’ll suddenly be broken beyond recovery.

2When good people rule, people are happy;

when corrupt leaders take over, the citizens groan.

3A son that loves wisdom makes his father happy,

but one that visits prostitutes squanders his wealth.

4A good king creates a stable country,

but one that accepts bribes ruins it.

5Flattering your friends

spreads a net for them to step in.

6Bad people’s sins become their downfall,

but the righteous can sing and celebrate.	Prov 29:1-6

7The godly care about the rights of the poor;

sinful people don’t care about such things.

8Scoffers can set a city in an uproar,

but the wise defuse anger.

9When the wise argue with the foolish,

the foolish get mad or mock; there’s no quiet response.

10Bloodthirsty people hate anybody that’s blameless,

but the godly are concerned about other people’s lives.

11Fools lose their temper;

the wise keep it in check.

12If a ruler is willing to listen to lies,

his advisors become corrupt.	Prov 29:7-12

13The poor and the oppressor have this in common:

Yahveh makes both of them able to see.

14If a king judges the poor fairly,

his throne will be permanently secure.

15Discipline gives children wisdom,

but kids that get their way are an embarrassment to their mother.

16When corrupt leaders get control, sin multiplies;

but the godly will see them fall.

17Correct your children,

and they’ll bring you comfort and delight.

18Where there’s no revelation, people cast off restraint;

but those who keep the Law stay happy.	Prov 29:13-18

19Words alone won’t correct a slave;

though he understands, he won’t respond.

20There’s more hope for a fool

than for someone that’s rash with words

21A slave pampered from childhood

will turn out to be a rebel.

22Angry people stir up conflict;

hotheads commit a lot of sins.

23Pride brings humiliation;

humility lifts up to places of honor.

24Helping a thief puts you in jeopardy:

you’ve taken an oath against perjury,

but you can’t tell the truth in court.	Prov 29:19-24

25Fearing other people entraps you;

trusting Yahveh makes you secure.

26People look to rulers for approval,

but justice comes from Yahveh.

27The wicked despise the righteous,

and the righteous despise them back.	Prov 29:25-27

30:1The Words of Agur Ben-Jakeh, an Oracle

Agur says to Ithiel and Ucal:

2Surely I’m too stupid to be human;

I don’t have common sense.

3I haven’t mastered wisdom;

I don’t know the Holy One.

4Who but God goes up to the sky and back down

or grasps the wind in his fist?

Who wraps up the ocean in his cloak

or sets the boundaries of land?

What’s his name? What’s his son’s name?

Tell me if you know!	Prov 30:1-4

5Every message from God proves true;

he’s a shield for those who take refuge in him.

6Don’t add to what he says;

otherwise, he’ll reprove you

and expose you as a liar.

7I ask you for two things before I die:

8first, keep me from being deceived*;

second, don’t give me poverty or wealth;

just give me what I need;

9so, on the one hand, I won’t be full and deny you, saying,

“Who needs Yahveh?”

or, on the other hand, lack what I need and steal to get it,

and so profane the name of my God.

10Don’t slander a slave to his master,

or he’ll curse you and you’ll pay for it.	Prov 30:5-10

11Some curse their father

and don’t bless their mother.

12Some consider themselves pure,

but they’re unwashed and filthy.

13Some—how lofty their eyes!

how high their brows!—

14some have teeth like swords

and fangs like knives;

they devour the poor and needy. 				Prov 30:11-14

15A leech has two daughters

that cry, “More, give me more.”

Three things are never satisfied,

no, make that four that never say, “That’s enough”:

16Sheol,

a barren womb,

desert ground,

and a blazing fire	Prov 30:15-16

17The eye that mocks father or scorns mother

the ravens in the valley will pluck out,

the vultures will eat.

18Three things are too amazing for me,

no, make that four I don’t understand:

19how an eagle flies in the sky,

how a snake slithers on a ledge,

how a ship moves on the ocean,

and how a man is drawn to a maiden.

20An adulterous woman “consumes” a man,

“wipes her mouth,” and says,

“I haven’t done anything wrong.”			Prov 30:17-20

21Under three things the ground trembles,

no, make that four, it can’t endure:

22a slave that becomes king,

a well-fed fool,

23an unloved woman that gets a husband,

and a maid that replaces her mistress.

24Four things are small but especially wise:

25ants aren’t strong,

but they store up their food in the summer;

26rock badgers aren’t powerful,

but they make their homes in the rocks;

27locusts don’t have a king,

but they march out in ranks;

28lizards are easy to catch with your hands,

yet they’re in kings’ palaces.	Prov 30:21-28

29Three things are stately in their stride,

no, four that walk with majestic bearing:

30a lion, powerful and unafraid among the animals;

31a strutting rooster,

a billy goat,

and a king leading his army.

32If you’ve been foolish by acting proud

or putting other people down,

cover your mouth in shame.

33As churning cream makes butter

and punching a nose makes it bleed,

so stirring up anger causes quarrels.	Prov 30:29-33

31;1The Words of King Lemuel

The Oracle His Mother Taught Him

2Please listen, son,

son of my womb, son of my vows;

3don’t waste your strength

on the kind of women that destroy kings.

4Lemuel, it’s not for kings to guzzle wine

or for rulers to get addicted to alcohol;

5the fear is that they’ll forget the Law

and not give justice to the oppressed.

6Give alcohol to the dying

and wine to those in pain;

7let them drink and forget their condition,

and not remember their suffering anymore.

8Speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves;

9judge justly and defend the poor and needy.		Prov 31:1-9

Tribute to a Worthy Woman

10Who can find a capable wife of noble character?

She’s worth more than jewels.

11Her husband can rely on her,

and he’ll not lack anything of value.

12She’ll do him good her whole life.

13She looks for wool and linen,

and enjoys working with her hands.

14Like a merchant ship,

she brings her food from a distance.

15She gets up before daylight to feed her family

and assign the day’s jobs to her maids.

16She inspects a field and buys it,

and plants a vineyard from her earnings.	Prov 31:10-16

17She wraps her waist with strength

and makes her arms strong.

18She makes sure her efforts are profitable,

and her lamp doesn’t go out at night.

19She reaches for the distaff,

and her hands hold the spindle.

20She reaches out to the poor and needy.

21She’s not worried when it snows

because she has dressed her family in scarlet.

22She wears purple and fine linen

and makes her own bedclothes.				Prov 31:17-22

23The community knows her husband in the city gates,

where he sits among the leaders of the land.

24She makes sashes and linen garments

to sell to the merchants.

25She dresses in strength and dignity

and smiles at the future.

26She speaks wisely and teaches kindly.

27She takes care of her household

and doesn’t idle away her time.

28Her children grow up and bless her;

her husband, too, and praises her:

29“Lots of women do nobly,

but you excel them all.”

30Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,

but praise a woman that respects Yahveh.

31Reward her for what she does,

and let her work speak for her in the community.	Prov 31:23-31
