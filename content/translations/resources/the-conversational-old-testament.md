THE CONVERSATIONAL OLD TESTAMENT

GENESIS

The Whole Creation

1:1In the beginning God created earth and sky.

2Earth was unformed and empty, and open water lay in the darkness. God’s Spirit was moving over the ocean. 3God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4He saw the light was good and separated it from darkness. 5He called light “day” and darkness “night.” Morning and evening made day one.

6God said, “Let an expanse separate the water 7below it from the water above it.” It happened. 8He called the expanse “sky.” Morning and evening made day two.

9God said, “Let the water below the sky gather in one place and dry land appear.” It happened. 10He called the dry part “land” and called the water “ocean.” He saw it was good. 11He said, “Let the land sprout vegetation—plants with seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds after their kind.” It happened. 12The land sprouted vegetation—plants with seeds like themselves and trees that bore fruit with seeds in them. 13He saw it was good. Morning and evening made day three. 	Gen 1:1-13

14God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night and to mark days, years, and seasons. 15Let them shine on the earth.” It happened. 16He made two big lights, the bigger one to govern the day and the smaller one to govern the night. He made the stars too. 17God put them in the sky to shine on the earth, 18to separate light from darkness, and to preside over day and night. He saw it was good. 19Morning and evening made day four.

20God said, “Let the water teem with animals, and let birds fly in the sky above the land.” 21He created large ocean animals and every animal that moves in the water after their kind and the birds that fly after their kind. He saw it was good. 22He blessed them, “Reproduce and fill the water in the oceans, and let birds multiply on the land.” 23Morning and evening made day five.

Gen 1:14-23

24God said, “Let the ground produce animals that reproduce after their kind: cattle, small animals, living things.” It happened. 25He made living things from the ground after their kind, cattle after their kind, and every small animal that moves around on the ground after its kind. He saw it was good.

26God said,

“Let’s make people in our image—like us. Let’s make them responsible for the fish, the birds, the cattle, the earth, and everything that moves around on the ground.”

27So he created people in his own image, created them male and female, 28and blessed them, “Reproduce, populate the earth, and preside over it. Be responsible for the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, and the animals on the ground. 29-30Green plants that yield seed and trees that bear fruit I’ve given you and the animals for food.” It happened. 31He saw that everything he’d made was very good. Morning and evening made day six.

2:1-2The seventh day God had finished creating the earth and sky and everything in them, and he rested from his work. 3He blessed the seventh day and set it aside because he’d finished working that day.								     	     Gen 1:24-2:3

The Creation of Mankind

4This is what the LORD God did when he created the earth and sky. 5Shrubs and plants hadn’t sprouted yet, because he hadn’t made it rain and there wasn’t anybody to cultivate the ground. 6A mist was coming up from the ground to water it. 7Then he formed a man out of the “ground,” breathed into him, and made him alive. The man became a living, breathing being.

8The LORD God planted an orchard in the East in Eden and put the man there. 9From the ground he made trees grow that looked nice and were good for producing food. In the orchard he planted the tree of life and the tree for knowing good and bad. 10A river flowed out of Eden to water the orchard. Then it separated into four rivers: 11-12the Pishon, that flows around the land of Havilah, where there’s fine gold, bdellium, and onyx; 13the Gihon, that flows around Cush; 14the Tigris, that flows east of Assyria; and the Euphrates.	Gen 2:4-14

15The LORD God put the man in the orchard to trim it and take care of it. 16He told him,

“You’re free to eat the fruit from any tree in the orchard 17except the one that gives the knowledge of good and bad. If you eat its fruit, you’ll die.”

18The LORD God said, “It’s not good for the man to be by himself. I’ll make him a helper that corresponds to him.” 19Out of the ground he’d formed every land animal and bird. He brought them to the man to see what he’d call them. Whatever he called them became their name. 20He named the cattle, birds, and wild animals; but he didn’t find a helper that corresponded to him.	Gen 2:15-20

21So the LORD God put him into a deep sleep, took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it. 22He formed a woman from the rib and brought her to him. 23The man said,

“This is bone from my bones,

flesh from my flesh.

She’ll be called ‘woman,’

because she was taken out of ‘man.’”

24That’s why a man is to leave his parents and unite with his wife, and they’ll become one physical identity. 25The man and his wife were both naked, but they weren’t self-conscious.

Gen 2:21-25

The Fall

3:1The snake was more devious than any other wild animal the LORD God had made. It asked the woman, “Did God really tell youpl not to eat the fruit of any tree in the orchard?”

2She said, “We’re free to eat the fruit of any tree 3but the one in the middle of the orchard. God said not to eat its fruit or touch it. We’ll die.”

4The snake said, “You’repl not going to die! 5God knows that when youpl eat its fruit, it’ll open yourpl eyes, and you’lpll be like gods, knowing good and bad.”

6When she saw that the tree was good for food, looked nice, and was desirable for making a person wise, she ate some of its fruit and gave it to her husband, and he ate some. 7Their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together to make loin cloths.	 Gen 3:1-7

Punishments for Sin

8When they heard God walking in the orchard in the evening, they hid among the trees. 9HeY called out for the man, “Where are you?”

10The man said, “When I heard you walking in the orchard, I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”

11“Who told you you were naked? Did you eat some fruit from the tree I told you not to?”

12“The woman you made to be with me gave me some, and I ate it.”

13The LORD God asked her, “What did you do?”

“The snake lied to me, and I ate the fruit.”	Gen 3:8-13

14The LORD God told it,

“Because you’ve done that,

you’re more accursed than any cattle

or animals in the field.

You’ll slither around on your belly

and eat dust your whole life.

15I’ll put hostility

between you and the woman,

between your offspring and hers.

Her offspring will crush your head,

and you’ll bruise her offspring’s heel.”			      Gen 3:14-15

16He told the woman,

“I’ll significantly increase

your pain in childbirth.

Though you’ll bear children in pain,

you’ll still desire your husband,

and he’ll have authority over you.”

17He told the man,

“Because you’ve listened to your wife

and eaten fruit from the tree I told you not to,

the ground is cursed.

Your whole life you’ll work to eat from it.

18-19It’ll grow thorns and thistles for you;

you’ll eat by sweating

till you go back to the ground.

You were taken from dust,

and you’ll go back to it.”	Gen 3:16-19

20Adam called his wife Eve because she was the mother of everyone that’s “lived.” 21The LORD God made clothes for them out of skin. 22HeY said, “People have become like one of us, knowing good and bad. Now, to keep them from taking fruit from the tree of life, eating it, and living forever . . . .” 23He sent them out of the orchard to cultivate the ground he’d taken them from. 24He stationed cherubs east of the Orchard in Eden, and a flaming sword that pointed in every direction to block access to the tree of life.  	Gen 3:20-24

Cain Murders Abel

4:1Adam had relations with Eve, and she had Cain. She said, “I’ve ‘produced’ a man with the LORD’s help.” 2She also had Abel. Abel herded sheep; Cain cultivated the ground. 3In time, Cain brought some produce to offer to the LORD. 4Abel brought some firstborn from the best in his flock. The LORD regarded Abel and his offering favorably, 5but not Cain and his offering. It made Cain mad.

6The LORD God asked him, “What are you mad about? Why are you sad? 7Won’t you feel happy if you do well? If you don’t, sin’s making its den at your door. It wants you, but you have to overrule it.”

8Cain told Abel about it. While they were in the field, Cain attacked him and killed him.      	Gen 4:1-8

9The LORD God asked him, “Where’s your brother?”

“I don’t know. I’m not his shepherd, am I?”

10“What’ve you done? His blood is crying out to me from the ground. 11You’re cursed from the ground that soaked up his blood that you shed. 12When you cultivate it, it won’t produce like it did. You’ll roam around and be on the run in the world.”

13Cain said,

“I can’t take such punishment! 14You’ve driven me away from the ground, you’re withdrawing from me, and I’ll be roaming around and on the run in the world. Whoever finds me will kill me!”

15The LORD told him, “Whoever kills you I’ll pay back seven times as much.” He put a mark on him so nobody would kill him. 16He went away from the LORD and settled in Nod, east of Eden.	        Gen 4:9-16

17Cain had relations with his wife, and she had Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son. 18Enoch was father of Irad, father of Mehujael, father of Methushael, father of Lamech.

19Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. 20Adah had Jabal, the forerunner of nomads and herdsmen. 21His half-brother Jubal was the forerunner of musicians that play lyres and flutes. 22Zillah had Tubalcain, the forerunner of artisans in bronze and iron. His sister was Naamah.

23Lamech told his wives,

“Adah and Zillah, listen;

wives of Lamech, listen to what I’m saying.

I killed a man for wounding me,

a young man for striking me.

24If Cain was avenged 7 times over,

Lamech will be avenged 77 times.”

25Adam had relations with his wife again, and she had a son she named Seth, because “God gave me an ‘offspring’ to replace Abel that Cain killed.” 26Seth had a son he named Enosh.

People began to call on the LORD.	Gen 4:17-26

5:1Adam’s Descendants

God created people to be like himself. 2He made them male and female, blessed them, and called them human.

3Adam lived 130 years and had a son in his own image like himself. He named him Seth. 4He lived 800 years after that and had sons and daughters. 5Altogether he lived 930 years and died.

6Seth lived 105 years and had Enosh. 7He lived 807 years after that and had sons and daughters. 8Altogether he lived 912 years and died.	Gen 5:1-8

9Enosh lived 90 years and had Kenan. 10He lived 815 years after that and had sons and daughters. 11Altogether he lived 905 years and died.

12Kenan lived 70 years and had Mahalalel. 13He lived 840 years after that and had sons and daughters. 14Altogether he lived 910 years and died.

15Mahalalel lived 65 years and had Jared. 16He lived 830 years after that and had sons and daughters. 17Altogether he lived 895 years and died.

18Jared lived 162 years and had Enoch. 19He lived 800 years after that and had sons and daughters. 20Altogether he lived 962 years and died.	Gen 5:9-20

21Enoch lived 65 years and had Methuselah. 22Then Enoch walked with God 300 years after that and had sons and daughters. 32Altogether he lived 365 years. 24He walked with God and wasn’t there because God took him.

25Methuselah lived 187 years and had Lamech. 26He lived 782 years after that and had sons and daughters. 27Altogether he lived 969 years and died.

28Lamech lived 182 years and had a son. 29He named him “Noah,” “He’ll ‘relieve’ us of our labor from the ground the LORD cursed.” 30Lamech lived 595 years after that and had sons and daughters. 31Altogether he lived 775 years and died.

32Noah was 500 years old and had Shem, Ham, and Japheth.	 Gen 5:21-32

Evil Multiplies

6:1When people were multiplying and having daughters, 2the sons of God saw they were beautiful and took as many wives as they wanted.

3The LORD God said, “My breath won’t remain in humans as long because they’re physical. They’ll come to live 120 years.”

4There were important men then and later when the sons of God had relations with women and had children. They became powerful men of old, men of renown. 5God saw that people had become so wicked that every motive was evil. 6He was grieved from having made them. 7“I’ll wipe them out along with the animals, crawling things, and birds.” 8But Noah was pleasing to him.	Gen 6:1-8

9Noah’s Generations

Noah was a good man, blameless in his time, one that followed God. 10He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11The world had become corrupt and full of violence. [12]

13God told Noah,

“It’s obvious that I need to wipe people out. They’ve filled the world with violence. I’m going to destroy them along with the world. 14Build an ark out of gopher wood, build rooms in it, and coat it with pitch inside and out. 15Make it 450 x 75 x 45ft tall. 16Put a window in it 1½ft from the top and a door in the side of it. Build 3 floors in it. 17I’m going to bring a flood on the world to destroy everything that breathes, everything on land. 18But I’ll make a covenant with you. Get in the ark with your wife, sons, and their wives. 19Take a male and female from every kind of animal to keep them alive; 20birds, animals, and crawling things will come to you. 21Gather as much food as you and the animals will eat.”

22Noah followed his instructions.	Gen 6:9-22

The Great Flood

7:1Then the LORD told Noah,

“Get in the ark with your family. I’ve seen that you’re good. 2Take every clean animal by sevens, male and female. Take every ceremonially unclean animal by twos, male and female. 3Take birds by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive. 4A week from now, I’ll make it rain for 40 days and nights, and wipe out every living thing I’ve made.”

5Noah followed his instructions.	Gen 7:1-5

6Noah was 600 years old when the flood came. 7He, his wife, sons, and their wives went into the ark because the flood was coming. 8Ceremonially clean and unclean animals, birds, and small animals 9went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female—like God told him.

10After a week the flood started. 11In Noah’s 600th year, on the seventeenth day, second month, the fountains in the great deep burst open, and the flood gates in the sky opened. 12Rain fell for 40 days and nights.	Gen 7:6-12

13Noah, his wife, his sons, and their wives went into the ark the same day. 14So did every wild animal, all the cattle, every small animal that moves around on the ground, and every kind of bird after their kind. 15Two by two everything that breathes went into the ark to Noah—like God told him. 16The LORD closed the door behind him.

17The flood kept coming for 40 days. 18As it got deeper and deeper, the ark floated on it. 19-20Water covered the tall mountains everywhere by some 22ft. 21Land animals died—birds, cattle, wild animals, swarming things, people—22everything that breathed. 23Only Noah and what was with him in the ark were left. 24The water prevailed over the world for 150 days.

Gen 7:13-24

8:1God remembered Noah and the animals in the ark. He made wind blow over the whole world, and the water started to recede. 2The fountains in the deep and the floodgates in the sky closed, and the rain stopped. 3The water receded steadily for 150 days. 4On the seventeenth day, seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 5The water kept going down till the tenth month. The first day, tenth month, mountains became visible.       Gen 8:1-5

6After 40 days Noah opened the window of the ark, 7and sent out a raven that flew around till the water dried up. 8Then he sent out a pigeon to see if the water had gone down, 9but it didn’t find anywhere to land and came back. The water was still covering the ground. Noah held out his hand and brought the pigeon into the ark. 10After a week he sent it out again. 11It came back toward evening with a new olive leaf in its beak; so Noah knew the water had gone down. 12Another week later he sent it out again, and it didn’t come back.

13-14On the first day, first month, 601st year, the water had dried up. The twenty-seventh day, second month Noah took the roof off the ark and saw that the ground was dry. 15God told him 16to leavepl the ark 17and take the animals out so they could reproduce and multiply. 18Noah’s family went out, 19and the animals left the ark after their kind. 	Gen 8:6-19

Life After the Flood

20Noah built an altar to the LORD, took one from every ceremonially clean animal and bird, and offered burnt offerings on it. 21The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said to himself,

“I’ll never curse the ground again because of people’s evil motives from their youth up. I’ll never destroy every living thing again. 22As long as the world remains, there will be sowing time and harvest, heat and cold, summer and winter, day and night.”

9:1God blessed Noah and his sons,

“Reproduce and repopulate the world. 2Animals and birds will be afraid of you. I’ve made you responsible for what moves on the ground and for the fish in the ocean. 3You can eat anything that lives and moves as well as the green plants, 4but don’t eat the blood with the meat. 5I’ll demand your life from every animal and everyone 6that sheds someone’s blood. They will have their blood shed because I made people in my image. 7Reproduce and repopulate the world abundantly.” 	Gen 8:20-9:7

8God told Noah and his sons,

9“I’m establishing a covenant with you, your descendants, 10and the living things that left the ark: 11I’ll never again get rid of people and animals and destroy the world with a flood. 12-13My rainbow in the clouds represents that covenant for all generations: 14when I bring clouds over the earth, the rainbow 15will remind me of my covenant.” [16-17]

18Noah’s sons that came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; Ham was Canaan’s father. 19Noah’s sons began to repopulate the world.	 Gen 9:8-19

20Noah began to cultivate the ground and planted a vineyard. 21He drank the wine and got drunk and uncovered himself in his tent. 22Ham saw him naked and told his brothers outside. 23Shem and Japheth held a cloak over their shoulders, walked backwards, and looked away so they wouldn’t see him naked.

24When Noah woke up from his wine, he found out what his youngest son had done. 25He said,

“Accursed be Canaan. He’ll be the lowest of servants to his brothers. 26Bless the LORD, Shem’s God. Canaan will serve Shem. 27May God give Japheth an extensive inheritance. He’ll live in Shem’s tents, and Canaan will serve him.”

28Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 29Altogether he lived 950 years and died. 	 Gen 9:20-29

The Table of Nations

10:1The Generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

Noah’s Sons and Their Descendants

2Japheth was the father of Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.

3Gomer was the father of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

4Javan was the father of Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

5Those descendants spread inland from the coasts into their nations, each by language and clan.

Gen 10:1-5

6Ham was the father of Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

7Cush was the father of Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.

Raamah was the father of Sheba and Dedan.

8Cush was also the father of Nimrod, who became prominent in the world, 9a great hunter before the LORD. It became an expression, “Like Nimrod, a great hunter before the LORD.” 10His kingdom stretched across Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar. 11From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 12and Resen, a big city between Nineveh and Calah.

13Mizraim became the father of the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 14Pathrusim, Casluhim (ancestors of the Philistines), and Caphtorim. 	Gen 10:6-14

15Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, Heth, 16the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, 17Hivites, Arkites, Simites, 18Arvadites, Zemarites, Hamathites. Afterwards the Canaanite clans spread out 19from Sidon—on the way to Gera—as far as Gaza across to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim as far as Lasha.

20Those were Ham’s descendants by clan, language, territory, and nation. 	Gen 10:15-20

21Shem, Japheth’s older brother, became the ancestor of Eber’s descendants. 22Shem’s sons were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.

23Aram’s sons were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

24Arpachshad became the father of Shelah, father of Eber.

25Eber had two sons.

One was Peleg; in his time the earth divided. Joktan was his brother, 26and father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. 30They lived from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the eastern hill country.

31Those were Shem’s descendants by clan, language, territory, and nation.

32Those were the clans of Noah’s descendants by genealogy, language, and nation. Nations spread out from them after the flood.				   	     Gen 10:21-32

The Confusion of Languages

11:1The whole world was speaking the same language. 2As people spread east, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. 3They said, “Let’s make bricks and fire them thoroughly.” They used brick for stone and tar for mortar. 4“Let’s build a city and a tower that reaches the sky. Let’s make a name for ourselves so we won’t get scattered out all over the world.”

5The LORD came down to see the city and tower they were building,

6“They’re one set of people with the same language. They’re starting to do this, and they’ll be able to do anything they want to.  7Let’s confuse their language so they can’t understand each other.”

8The LORD scattered them across the world, and they stopped building their city. 9They called the city Babel because that’s where the LORD “confused” the language of the world. 	Gen 11:1-9

10Shem’s Generations

Shem was 100 years old when Arpachshad was born, two years after the flood. 11He lived 500 years after that and had sons and daughters.

12Arpachshad had lived 35 years when Shelah was born. 13He lived 403 years after that and had sons and daughters.

14Shelah had lived 30 years when Eber was born. 15He lived 403 years after that and had sons and daughters.

16Eber had lived 34 years when Peleg was born. 17He lived 209 years after that and became the father of sons and daughters.	Gen 11:10-17

18Peleg had lived 30 years when Reu was born. 19Peleg lived 209 years after that and had sons and daughters.

20Reu had lived 32 years when Serug was born. 21He lived 207 years after that and had sons and daughters.

22Serug had lived 30 years when Nahor was born. 23He lived 200 years after that and had sons and daughters.

24Nahor had lived 29 years when Terah was born. 25He lived 119 years after that and had sons and daughters.

26Terah had lived 70 years when Abram, Nahor, and Haran were born.		     Gen 11:18-26

27Terah’s Generations

Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran father of Lot. 28Haran died before his father Terah in Ur of the Chaldeans, where he was born.

29Abram and Nahor married. Abram’s wife was Sarai; Nahor’s wife was Micah, daughter of Haran and sister of Iscah. 30Sarai couldn’t have children. 31Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, and left Ur to settle in Canaan. They made it as far as Haran and lived there. 32Terah died in Haran at age 205. 	Gen 11:27-32

The Call of Abram

12:1The LORD told Abram,

“Leave your country, your relatives, your father’s family,

and go to the land I’ll show you.

2I’ll make you into a big nation, bless you,

and give you a great reputation so you’ll be a blessing.

3I’ll bless the ones that bless you and curse the ones that curse you.

In you I will bless all the families in the world.”

4Abram left when he was 75. 5He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, everything they owned, and the persons they’d gained in Haran. They got to Canaan, 6and Abram traveled through it as far as Shechem, to the Oak of Moreh. Canaanites were living in the land.	 Gen 12:1-6

7The LORD appeared to Abram, “I’m going to give your descendants this land”; so he built an altar to him. 8He went on from there to the mountain east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to the LORD and called on him. 9He kept on migrating toward the Negev.

Abram and Sarai in Egypt

10A severe famine arose in the land; so he went on down to Egypt to stay awhile. 11When he got close to Egypt, he told Sarai, “You’re a beautiful woman. 12When the Egyptians see you, they’ll say you’re my wife and kill me. 13Say you’re my sister so they will treat me well.” 	   			   	      		      		     	      	Gen 12:7-13

14When Abram got to Egypt, the Egyptians did see she was really beautiful. 15Pharaoh’s officials praised her to Pharaoh and took her to his palace. 16He treated Abram well out of regard for her, and gave him sheep, cattle, donkeys, male and female servants, and female donkeys and camels.

17But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of her. 18Pharaoh called Abram, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 19Why did you say she was your sister; so I took her for my wife? Here’s your wife; take her and get out.” 20Pharaoh told his men to escort him away with his wife and everything he had.	Gen 12:14-20

Abram and Lot Separate

13:1Abram, his wife, Lot, and everything he had, went up from Egypt to the Negev. 2He was wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold. 3From the Negev he traveled back to the place between Bethel and Ai where he’d pitched his tent before. 4He went to the altar he’d built there and called on the LORD.

5Lot had flocks, herds, and tents too, 6and the land couldn’t support them both. They had too many possessions, 7and conflict kept breaking out between their herdsmen. There were Canaanites and Perizzites in the land as well. 8Abram told Lot,

“Let’s not have conflicts between us or our herdsmen; we’re relatives. 9The whole land lies open to you. Separate from me. If you go left, I’ll go right; or vice versa.”

10Lot could see that the Jordan valley was well-watered—like the LORD’s orchard, like Egypt on the way to Zoar. (That was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). 11So Lot chose the Jordan valley and moved east. 12Abram settled in Canaan; Lot settled in the towns in the valley and moved his tents as far as Sodom. 13The men in Sodom were especially wicked. 	Gen 13:1-13

14After Lot separated from Abram, the LORD said,

“Look around in every direction. 15I’m going to give your descendants permanently the land you see. 16I’ll make them like dust; if you could count it, that’s how many there’d be. 17Travel around all over it.”

18Abram moved and settled by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre at Hebron and built an altar to the LORD.	   Gen 13:14-18

Abram Rescues Lot

14:1Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim 2fought Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Adman, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (Zoar). 3Those 5 joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Dead Sea Sea). 4They’d served Chedorlaomer for 12 years, then revolted. 5That year, he and his allied kings came and defeated the Rephaim in Asheroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 6and the Horites in Mount Seir, as far as El-paran by the open country. 7Then they turned back to En-mishpat (Kadesh) and conquered the Amalekites and Amorites in Hazazon-tamar. 8The kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (Zoar) pitched battle against them in the Valley of Siddim—95 kings against 4. 10The valley was full of tar pits. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them. The ones that survived escaped to the hills. 11The four kings took the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and left. 12They also took Lot and what he had because he was living in Sodom.

Gen 14:1-12

13One man escaped to tell Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner, Abram’s allies. 14When Abram heard they’d captured his nephew, he mustered 318 trained men born in his house, and pursued them all the way to Dan. 15He divided his men against them at night. He and his forces defeated them and chased them all the way to Hobah, north of Damascus. 16He brought back the goods, Lot, and Lot’s possessions, along with the women and other captives.	Gen 14:13-16

Melchizedek Blesses Abram

17When he got back from defeating Chedorlaomer and his allies, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (the King’s Valley). 18Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, brought out bread and wine 19and blessed Abram, “May you be blessed by God Most High, owner of earth and sky, 20who delivered your enemies to you.” Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

21The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the captives and keep the goods.”

22Abram said,

“I’ve sworn to the LORD God Most High, owner of earth and sky, 23that I won’t take a thread, a sandal thong, or anything else that’s yours. I don’t want you to claim you made me rich. 24I’ll only take what the young fighting men have eaten, and the share that belongs to Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.”	 Gen 14:17-24

The LORD’s Covenant with Abram

15:1After that, a message from the LORD came to Abram in a vision, “Don’t worry, Abram; I’m your shield. You’ll have a great reward.”

2Abram asked,

“LORD God, what will you give me? I don’t have any children; Eliezer of Damascus is my heir. 3Since you haven’t given me any offspring, a man born in my household will inherit.”

4A message from the LORD came to him,

“He won’t inherit. Your heir will come from your body.” 5He took him outside, “Look at the sky and count the stars if you can. That’s how many descendants you’ll have,”

6Abram trusted him, and the LORD considered him good because of it.

7God said, “I’m the LORD who brought you out of Ur in Chaldea to give you this land.”

8“What guarantee do I have of that?”

9“Bring me a three-year-old heifer, goat, and ram, and a turtledove and young pigeon.”

10He brought them, cut them in half—except for the birds—and laid the halves across from each other. 11Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but he shooed them away.

Gen 15:1-11

12As the sun was going down, he fell into a deep sleep, and an eerie darkness came over him. 13God told him,

“Your descendants will be foreigners in a country that enslaves them and oppresses them for 400 years. 14I’ll judge that nation, and your descendants will come out with lots of possessions. 15You will pass on to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 16In the fourth generation, they’ll come back here. The sinfulness of the Amorites hasn’t climaxed yet.”

17After sundown, it was pitch dark. A fire pot and flaming torch passed between the halves of the carcasses. 18That day the LORD made a covenant with Abram,

“I’ll give your descendants this land from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River, along with 19the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 20Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim, 21Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”   	Gen 15:12-21

The Birth of Ishmael

16:1Sarai, Abram’s wife, hadn’t had any children. She had an Egyptian maid named Hagar. 2Sarai told Abram, “The LORD has kept me from having children. Sleep with my maid. Maybe I can have children through her.” Abram took her advice. 3That happened after Abram had lived in Canaan for 10 years. 4He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting her mistress. 5Sarai told Abram,

“You’re responsible for the way she’s acting toward me. I gave you my servant; but when she saw she was pregnant, she started disrespecting me. The LORD decide between you and me.”

6Abram said, “She’s under your authority. Deal with her as you see fit.”

Sarai was so rough on her that she ran away. 	Gen 16:1-6

7The angel of the LORD found her by a spring in the desert on the way to Shur. 8“Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where have you come from? Where are you going?”

“I’m getting away from my mistress.”

9The angel told her,

“Go back and submit to her. 10I’ll multiply your descendants till they’ll be too many to count. 11You’ll have a son. Call him Ishmael because ‘the LORD has listened’ to your plight. 12He’ll be like a wild donkey, opposed to everybody and by everybody. He’ll live east of his relatives.”

13She called the LORD Elroi because she said, “I’m still alive after ‘I saw him.’” 14So the well was called Beer-lahai-roi between Kadesh and Bered. 15Hagar gave Abram a son he named Ishmael. 16He was 86 when she had him.  	 Gen 16:7-16

Abram Renamed Abraham

17:1When Abram was 99, the LORD appeared to him, “I’m God Almighty [El-Shaddai]. Follow me faithfully, 2and I’ll multiply you many times over.” 3Abram fell on his face, and God told him,

4“This is my side of the covenant with you: you’ll be the ancestor of many nations. 5Your name won’t be Abram anymore; it’ll be Abraham because I’ll make you ‘the ancestor of many nations.’ 6I’ll make you really numerous. Nations will descend from you; kings will come out of you. 7With you and your descendants I’ll establish my permanent covenant to be your God. 8I’ll give you and your descendants an ongoing possession—Canaan, where you’ve lived as a nomad. 	Gen 17:1-8

Circumcision as the Covenant Sign

9-10“This is your and your descendants’ side of the covenant: circumcise every male among you 11as a covenant sign between us. 12Circumcise them when they’re eight days old. Circumcise a servant that’s not your descendant whether born in your house or bought from a foreigner. 13Circumcision will be the ongoing, physical covenant sign in sons and servants. 14Any uncircumcised male will be excluded from the community because he hasn’t observed the terms of my covenant.	 Gen 17:9-14

Sarai Renamed Sarah

15“Your wife’s name won’t be Sarai anymore; it’ll be Sarah. 16I’ll bless her and give you a son by her. She’ll be the mother of many nations; kings will come from her.”

17Abraham fell on his face and “laughed” to himself,

“Can a man that’s 100 years old become a father? Can Sarah have a baby when she’s 90? 18If only Ishmael would live under your blessing!”

19God said,

“No, Sarah will have a child. Name him Isaac. I’ll make a permanent covenant with him and his descendants. 20I’ve listened to you about Ishmael. I’ll bless him and make him really numerous, the father of 12 princes, a large nation. 21But my covenant will be with Isaac that Sarah will have next year.”

22When God finished talking, he ascended. 23That same day Abraham circumcised Ishmael, the male servants born in his house, and the ones he’d bought—like God said. 24He was 99 when he was circumcised; 25Ishmael was 13. [26-27]	Gen 17:15-27

The Birth of Isaac Promised

18:1The LORD appeared to Abraham by the grove of oaks that belonged to Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the heat of the day. 2He looked up and saw three men standing a little way off. He ran to meet them and bowed to the ground,

3“Sir, if yousg please, 4let me bring some water so you can wash your feet and rest under the tree. 5I’ll bring a loaf of bread so you can refresh yourselves. Then you can go on.”

“All right.”

6Abraham hurried to Sarah in the tent, “Quick! Get three measures of fine flour ready, knead it, and make bread cakes.” 7He ran to the herd and took a choice, tender calf, and gave it to a servant to fix quickly. 8He took yogurt, milk, and the veal he’d fixed and set it in front of them. He stood there under the tree while they ate. 	Gen 18:1-8

9Then they asked, “Where’s Sarah?”

“In the tent.”

10He said, “I’ll come back next year at this time, and Sarah will have a son.” She was listening at the entrance to the tent behind him. 11Abraham and Sarah were getting old. She was too old to have children.

12Sarah laughed to herself, “At this age, am I really going to have that delight? My husband [lord] is old too.”

13The LORD asked Abraham,

“Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child when I’m so old?’ 14Is there anything I can’t do? Like I said, at this time next year Sarah will have a son.”

15Sarah denied it, “I didn’t laugh.” (She was afraid.)

“Oh yes, you did.”     	 Gen 18:9-15

Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

16The men got up and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham was walking with them to see them off. 17The LORD said,

“Should I keep from Abraham what I’m about to do?  18He’ll certainly become a large, strong nation, and bless every nation. 19I’ve chosen him to command his children and household after him to keep my way by doing what’s good and just, so I can bring on him what I’ve promised.”

20He told Abraham, “The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah is extreme. Their sin is awful. 21I’m going down to see if they’re as bad as their outcry. If not, I’ll know.”	 Gen 18:16-21

22The other men turned and started toward Sodom while Abraham was still standing in front of the LORD. 23Abraham came and said,

“Will you sweep away the good with the bad? 24Supposing there are 50 good people in the city; won’t you spare it for their sake? 25Surely you wouldn’t kill the good with the bad and treat them alike! Surely not! Won’t the Judge of the whole world do what’s right?”

26The LORD said, “If I find 50 good people in Sodom, I’ll spare the whole place.”

Gen 18:22-26

27Abraham answered, “I’ve dared to speak to you though I’m only dust and ashes, 28Suppose there are 45, will you destroy the whole city because of 5?”

“I won’t destroy it if I find 45.”

29“Suppose there are 40?”

“I won’t do it for the 40.”

30“Lord, don’t be angry. I’ll ask again: suppose you find 30 there?”

“I won’t do it if I find 30 there.”

31“I’ve dared to speak to the Lord; suppose there are 20?”

“I won’t destroy it for the 20.”

32“Lord, don’t be angry, and I’ll speak just one more time. Suppose there are 10?”

“I won’t destroy it for the 10.”

33As soon as he’d finished talking to Abraham, he left, and Abraham went back. 	Gen 18:27-33

The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

19:1The two angels went to Sodom in the evening as Lot sat in Sodom’s gate. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed to the ground. 2“Sirs, turn aside to my house, wash your feet, and spend the night. You can get up early and go on.”

“No, we’ll spend the night in the square.”

3But he urged them strongly, so they went to his house. He fixed them a meal and baked flat bread, and they ate. 4Before they went to bed, men from all over the city surrounded the house—young and old. 5They called out to Lot, “Where are the men that came tonight? Bring them out so we can rape them.”

6But Lot went out and shut the door behind him,

7“Brothers, don’t be wicked. 8Look, I have two daughters that haven’t slept with men. Let me bring them out, and you can do to them whatever you like. Just don’t do anything to those men, since they’ve come under my roof.”

Gen 19:1-8

9“Get out of the way.” Besides, they said, “This foreigner has come in already acting like a judge. We’ll treat you worse than them.” They pressed toward Lot to break down the door. 10But the angels reached out and pulled him in and shut the door. 11They struck the men blind, big and small; so they wore themselves out groping around for the door.

12The two angels said to Lot,

“Who else do you have here? Bring out any son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever else you have in the city. 13We’re about to destroy this place; their outcry has become so great before the LORD that he has sent us to destroy it.”					      		      	      Gen 19:9-13

14Lot went out to tell his daughters’ fiancés, “Get up! Get out of here! The LORD is going to destroy the city.” But they acted like he was joking. 15When it started to get daylight, the angels urged Lot, “Get up! Take your wife and two daughters so you won’t get swept away in the punishment of the city.” 16He hesitated, so the angels grabbed his hand and his wife’s and daughters’ hands. The LORD had mercy on him and took him outside the city.

17Then one of them said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look back or stay anywhere in the valley. Escape to the mountains so you won’t be swept away.”

18Lot said,

“No, Sir! 19I’m pleasing to you, and you’ve shown me great kindness by saving me; but I can’t escape to the mountains. The disaster would overtake me, and I’d die. 20That town is near enough to run to. Isn’t it small? Let me escape there to save my life.”

21“All right, I won’t overthrow it. 22Hurry and get on over there! I can’t do anything till you do.” The town was Zoar.	Gen 19:14-22

23The sun had climbed high by the time Lot got to Zoar. 24Then the LORD rained fire and sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah. 25He overthrew those towns, the whole valley, its people, and what grew there. 26But Lot’s wife, behind him, looked back, and became a pillar of salt.

27Abraham got up early and went to where he’d stood with the LORD. 28He looked down toward Sodom, Gomorrah, and the valley, and saw smoke coming up as from a furnace. 29When God destroyed the towns in the valley, he remembered Abraham and got Lot away from his house.	     Gen 19:23-29

Lot and His Daughters

30Lot went up from Zoar and stayed in the mountains with his two daughters. He was afraid to keep staying in Zoar. They were living in a cave. 31The older daughter told the younger one,

“There’s not a man around to come into us in the normal way. 32Let’s get our father drunk on wine and lie with him so we can preserve our family through him.”

33They got him drunk that night, and the older one went in and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down or got up. 34The next day the older one said, “Last night I lay with my father. Let’s get him drunk again tonight. You go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family.” 35They got their father drunk that night too, and the younger daughter lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down or got up. 36So both daughters got pregnant from their father. 37The firstborn had a boy she named Moab (ancestor of today’s Moabites). 38The younger daughter had a boy too and named him Ben-ammi (ancestor of the Ammonites).	Gen 19:30-38

Abraham and Abimelech

20:1Abraham moved toward the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur, living for a while in Gerar. 2He said of Sarah, “She’s my sister”; so Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took her. 3But God came to him in a dream at night, “You’re a dead man. The woman you’ve taken is married.”

4Abimelech hadn’t come near her, and he said,

“Lord, will you kill a blameless nation? 5Didn’t he say she was his sister, and she say he was her brother? I’ve done this in integrity and innocence.”

6God said to him in the dream,

“I know. I’ve kept you from sinning against me and didn’t let you touch her. 7Give the man his wife. He’s a prophet; he’ll pray for you, and you’ll live. If you don’t, you can be sure you and everybody you have will die.” 	Gen 20:1-7

8Abimelech got up early and called his officials and told them. They were really afraid. 9He called Abraham,

“What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you that you brought a serious sin on me and my kingdom? That shouldn’t be done. 10What made you do it?”

11“I thought, there’s no respect for God here. They’ll kill me for my wife. 12Besides, she really is my sister, my father’s daughter, but not my mother’s. 13When God had me wander from my father’s family, I told her to show me kindness wherever we went by saying I was her brother.”  	Gen 20:8-13

14Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, cattle, male and female servants, and gave Sarah back to him. 15He said, “My land is open to you. Settle anywhere you like.” 16He told Sarah, “I’ve given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver to exonerate you to everybody with you and anywhere else.

17Abraham prayed and God restored Abimelech, his wife, and maids so they could have children again. 18The LORD had closed the wombs in his household because of Sarah.

Gen 20:14-18

The Birth of Isaac

21:1The LORD kept his promise to Sarah. 2She became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time God had indicated. 3He named him Isaac 4and circumcised him the eighth day like God said. 5Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born. 6Sarah said,

“God made me ‘laugh.’ Everybody that hears about this will laugh too. 7Who would’ve told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I’ve borne him a son in his old age.”	 Gen 21:1-7

Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away

8The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a big feast the day he was weaned. 9Sarah saw Hagar’s son making fun of Isaac 10and told Abraham, “Get rid of her and her son. He’s not going to inherit with my son.” 11Abraham agonized over it, 12but God told him,

“Don’t agonize over the boy and your maid. Take Sarah’s advice. Your lineage will descend through Isaac, 13but I’ll make a nation out of the maid’s son too because he’s your descendant.”

14Abraham got up early and gave Hagar bread and a skin of water. He put them on her shoulder, gave her the boy, and sent her away. She wandered in the desert around Beersheba. 15When the water in the skin was gone, she left him under a bush 16and sat down about a bowshot away, “Don’t let me watch him die.” She cried out loud. 17God heard the boy crying, and his angel called to Hagar from the sky, “What’s wrong, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. God has heard the boy. 18Go get him up and hold him by the hand; I’ll make a big nation out of him.” 19God caused her to notice a well. She went and filled the skin with water and gave him a drink. 20-21God was with him. He grew up and lived in the Wilderness of Paran and became an archer. His mother took a wife for him out of Egypt. 	      	      	      	      			      	      Gen 21:8-21

Treaty with Abimelech

22At that time, Abimelech and Phicol, commander of his army, said to Abraham,

“God’s with you whatever you do. 23So swear by him here that you won’t deal falsely with me or my descendants. The kindness I’ve shown you please show me and the land where you’ve lived.”

24“I swear it.”

25But Abraham complained to him about the well his servants had seized.

26Abimelech said, “I don’t know who did that. I hadn’t heard about it.”

27Abraham gave Abimelech sheep and cattle, and the two made a treaty. 28Abraham also set aside 7 ewe lambs. 29Abimelech asked, “What are they for?”

30“Take them as a sign of agreement that I dug this well.” 31He called the place Beersheba because the two of them took an “oath” at that “well.” 32Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistine territory. 33Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there and called on the LORD, the eternal God. 34He lived in Philistine territory quite a while.	Gen 21:22-34

Abraham Tested

22:1After this, God tested Abraham, “Abraham.”

“Yes”

2“Take Isaac, that you love, your only son, and go to the area around Moriah. Offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain where I tell you.”

3Abraham got up early, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men and Isaac. He split wood for the burnt offering and left for the place God told him.

4On the third day, Abraham saw it in the distance. 5He told his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I are going up there to worship and come back.” 6Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac and carried the fire and knife by hand; so the two of them walked on together.

7Isaac said, “Dad.”

“Yes?”

“There’s fire and wood, but where’s the lamb for the burnt offering?”

8“God will provide it, Son”; so the two of them walked on together.	   Gen 22:1-8

9They came to where God had told him. Abraham built an altar, arranged the wood, bound Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. 10He took a knife to kill him, 11but the angel of the LORD called from the sky, “Abraham!”

12“Yes?”

“Don’t do anything to him. I know now that you respect me; you haven’t withheld your only son from me.”

13Then Abraham looked up and noticed a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He took it and offered it for a burnt offering in place of his son. 14He called the place The LORD Will Provide [Yahveh-jireh], as it’s still said, “In the ‘LORD’s’ mountain he‘ll ‘provide.’”	 Gen 22:9-14

15The angel called to Abraham again from the sky,

16“I’ve sworn by myself 17to multiply your descendants like stars in the sky and sand on the shore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies 18and bless all nations because you’ve obeyed me.”

19Abraham returned to his young men, and they went back to Beersheba to live.

Nahor’s Sons

20After that, Abraham heard,

“Milcah has also had children to your brother Nahor: 21Uz his oldest, Buz his brother; Kemuel, father of Aram; 22Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph; and Bethuel 23[Rebekah’s father]—those eight. 24Nahor’s concubine Reumah had Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.”	 Gen 22:15-24

The Death of Sarah

23:1Sarah lived 127 years 2and died in Kiriath-arba (Hebron) in Canaan. Abraham went in to mourn for her and cry. 3Then he got up from beside his dead and said to the descendants of Heth, 4“I’m a foreigner among you. Let me have a place to bury my dead.”

[5] 6“Listen, Sir, you’re a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best grave we have. None of us will refuse you his grave.”

7Abraham stood up and bowed to the local people,

8“If you’ll let me bury my dead, approach Ephron son of Zohar for me, 9to let me have the Cave of Machpelah at the end of his field. Will he let me buy it at full price for a burial place among you?” 	Gen 23:1-9

10Ephron was sitting there and answered Abraham in front of everyone that was going in his city gate, 11“No, Sir; listen. In my people’s presence, I’ll give you the field and the cave that’s in it. Bury your dead.”

12Abraham bowed 13and told him, “I’ll pay you the price for the field. Accept it so I can bury my dead there.”

14He answered, 15“Listen, a piece of land worth 10 lbs 400 shekels of silver—what’s that between us? Bury your dead.”

16Abraham listened and weighed out 10 lbs 400 shekels of silver, merchant’s standard. 17Ephron deeded the field, its trees, and the cave 18to Abraham in front of everyone in his city gate. It became a possession among the descendants of Heth. 19Abraham buried Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah east of Mamre (Hebron) in Canaan. [20]	        Gen 23:10-20

A Wife for Isaac

24:1Abraham was getting older, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. 2He told his oldest servant that managed everything he owned,

“Put your hand under my thigh 3and swear by the LORD God of earth and sky that you won’t choose a wife for my son from the Canaanites where I’m living. 4Go to my relatives in my country to find him a wife.”

5“What if she doesn’t want to come back with me? Should I take your son there?”

6“Make sure you don’t! 7The LORD God in heaven took me from my father’s family in the land where I was born. He swore to me he’d give my descendants this land. He’ll send his angel ahead of you. Choose a wife for my son from there. 8If she doesn’t want to come with you, you’ll be free from this oath. Just don’t take my son back there.”

9The servant put his hand under Abraham’s thigh and swore to him.   	Gen 24:1-9

10The servant took 10 camels and left with lots of his master’s good things and went to Nahor’s city in Mesopotamia. 11He had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well in the evening when the women came out to draw water. 12He said,

“LORD, my master’s God, make me successful today and be kind to my master. 13I’m standing by the well, and the daughters of men in the city are coming out to draw water. 14The girl I ask to let her jar down so I can have a drink, and she says, ‘Take a drink. I’ll water your camels too’—may she be the one you’ve chosen for Isaac. That way I’ll know you’ve been gracious to my master.”

15Before he’d finished talking, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was a daughter of Bethuel, son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. 16The girl was beautiful, a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came back up. 17The servant hurried over to her, “Let me have a drink from your jar.” 	Gen 24:10-17

18“Take a drink, Sir.” Right away she lowered her jar and gave him a drink. 19Then she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, till they finish drinking.” 20She emptied her jar into the trough and hurried back to the well to draw water for his camels. 21In the meantime, the man was gazing at her silently to know if the LORD had made his journey successful. 22When the camels finished, he took a gold ring weighing .2 oz a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing 4 lbs ten shekels of gold, 23and asked, “Who’s your father? Does he have room for us to stay?”

24“Bethuel son of Milcah, Nahor’s wife. 25We have plenty of straw and feed, and room for you to stay.”

26The man bowed low in worship to the LORD 27and said, “Bless the LORD God of Abraham, who hasn’t abandoned his kindness and truthfulness toward my master. He has guided me to my master’s relatives.”      	   	   	     		     	    	     Gen 24:18-27

28The girl ran to tell her mother’s household. 29Rebekah’s brother Laban rushed out to meet the man at the spring. 30When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and heard her tell what the man had told her, he went to him standing with his camels. 31“Come in, blessed by the LORD! Why stand out here? The house is ready, and there’s room for your camels.”		  	     		    					     Gen 24:28-31

32He went in. Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and feed. He brought water to wash the feet of Abraham’s servant and the ones that were with him. 33But when Laban brought him food, Abraham’s servant said, “I won’t eat till I’ve told you my business.”

“Go ahead.”

34“I’m Abraham’s servant. 35The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so he’s become wealthy in flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants and maidservants, camels and donkeys. 36His wife Sarah had a son when she was old, and Abraham has willed everything to him. 37He made me swear, ‘Don’t choose a wife for my son from the Canaanites where I live. 38Go to my father’s family to find him a wife.’ 39I said, ‘What if she doesn’t want to come back with me?’ 40He said, ‘The LORD I serve will send his angel with you to make your journey successful. 41You’ll be free from my oath if you get to my relatives and they won’t give her to you.’ 	Gen 24:32-41

42“I came to the spring today and said, ‘LORD, God of Abraham, make my journey successful. 43I’m standing by the spring. The young woman who comes out to draw water, and I say, ‘Let me have a drink from your jar,’ 44and she says, ‘Take a drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too’—may she be the woman you’ve chosen for my master’s son.’ 45Before I’d finished talking to myself, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder and went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, ‘Let me have a drink.’ 46Right away she lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Take a drink. I’ll water your camels too.’ I took a drink, and she watered them.  	Gen 24:42-46

47“Then I asked her whose daughter she was. She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son that Micah had.’ I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 48I bowed in worship and blessed my master’s God, who had guided me on the right road to choose the daughter of my master’s relative for his son. 49Tell me now if you’re going to deal graciously and honestly with my master. If not, let me know so I can decide what to do.”

50Laban and Bethuel said,

“Since the thing comes from the LORD, there’s nothing for us to say. 51Rebekah’s here; take her and go. She can be the wife of your master’s son, like the LORD has said.”	Gen 24:47-51

52When Abraham’s servant heard it, he bowed to the ground in front of the LORD. 53He brought out silver and gold articles, and clothes for Rebekah, and gave precious things to her brother and mother. 54He and his men ate and spent the night. When they got up, he said, “Let me go to my master.”

55Her brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, maybe ten. Then she can go.”

56He said, “Let me leave so I can go to my master.”

57They said, “We’ll call her and see what she says.”

58“Will you go with this man?”

“Yes.”

59They sent away their sister and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men. 60They blessed Rebekah,

“May you, our sister, become thousands of ten thousands.

May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies.”

61Rebekah got up with her servant girls and mounted the camels the man had with him. He took her and left.	Gen 24:52-61

62Isaac had come from a trip to Beer-lahai-roi because he was living in the Negev. 63He had gone out to meditate in the field toward evening and looked up and saw camels coming. 64Rebekah saw him and got down from the camel. 65She asked the servant, “Who is the man walking in the field to meet us?”

“He’s my master.”

She put on her veil.

66The servant told Isaac what all he’d done. 67Isaac took Rebekah into his mother’s tent, and she became his wife. He loved her, and she was a comfort to him after his mother died.

Gen 24:62-67

The Death of Abraham

25:1Abraham married another wife, Keturah. 2She had Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

3Jokshan had Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.

4Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.

Those descended from Keturah.

5Abraham willed everything to Isaac. 6He gave gifts to his concubines’ sons before he died and sent them east away from Isaac. 7Abraham lived 175 years 8and died at a good old age, satisfied with life; and passed on to his people. 9-10Isaac and Ishmael buried him with Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah, in the field Abraham had bought from Ephron, east of Mamre. 11After Abraham died, God blessed Isaac, who continued to live in Beer-lahai-roi.    	Gen 25:1-11

12Ishmael’s Generations

(Abraham’s Son by Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s Maid)

13, 16Ishmael’s sons in the order of birth, by villages and camps, 12 princes by tribes: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 17Ishmael lived 137 years and passed on to his relatives. 18His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt on the road to Assyria, away from his relatives.	 Gen 25:12-18

19Isaac’s Generations

20Isaac was 40 when he married Rebekah. 21He prayed for her because she wasn’t having children. The LORD answered him, and she became pregnant, 22but the children struggled with each other inside her. She said, “Why am I this way?” She went to ask the LORD. 23He said,

“You have two nations in your womb;

two nations will come from your body.

One will be stronger than the other;

the older will serve the younger.”

24When it came time to deliver, she had twins. 25The first was born red all over like a “hairy” piece of clothes. They named him Esau. 26His brother was born “holding” onto Esau’s “heel”; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 when she had them.	Gen 25:19-26

27When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob stayed around home, living in tents. 28Isaac liked Esau because he had a taste for game; Rebekah liked Jacob. 29One day when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the countryside famished. 30He told Jacob, “Let me have some of that ‘red’ stew. I’m starving.” (So he was called Edom.)

31“Sell me your birthright first.”

32“I’m about to die. What good’s a birthright?”

33“Swear to me first;” so he swore to him and gave him his birthright. 34Then Jacob gave him bread and lentil stew. He ate it, got up, and left. 	Gen 25:27-34

Isaac and Abimelech

26:1Another famine came over the region besides the one in Abraham’s time. Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech, king of the Philistines. 2The LORD appeared to him,

“Don’t go down to Egypt. 3Stay here, and I’ll be with you and bless you. I’ll give your descendants these lands and keep the oath I swore to your father. 4I’ll multiply your descendants like stars in the sky. Your seed will bless all the nations in the world 5because Abraham obeyed me, kept my charges, commandments, statutes, and laws.”

6So Isaac lived in Gerar. 7When the men there asked about his wife, he said, “She’s my sister.” He was afraid to say, “My wife,” afraid the men would kill him on account of Rebekah; she was beautiful. 8When he’d been there a long time, Abimelech looked out the window, and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah. 9He called him, “She has to be your wife! Why say she was your sister?”

“For fear that I’d die on account of her.’”

10Abimelech said, “What have you done to us? One of the men might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.” 11Abimelech charged everybody, “I’ll execute whoever touches this man or his wife.”	 Gen 26:1-11

12Isaac sowed grain, and the same year it yielded 100 times as much as he planted. The LORD blessed him, 13and he kept getting richer and richer till he was extremely wealthy. 14He had flocks, herds, and such a large household that the Philistines got jealous. 15They filled the wells his father’s servants had dug. 16Abimelech told Isaac, “Go away from us. You’re too big to be around us.” 17Isaac left and settled down in the Valley of Gerar.

18He dug again the wells they’d dug in Abraham’s time. The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. He named them the same as his father did. 19But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well with flowing water, 20the herdsmen at Gerar “quarreled” with his herdsmen, “That’s our water!” so he named the well Esek. 21They dug another well, and they “quarreled” over that one too; so he named it Sitnah. 22He moved and dug another well. They didn’t quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth because he said, “Finally, the LORD has made ‘room’ for us to prosper here.”	Gen 26:12-22

23He went up to Beersheba, 24and the LORD appeared to him that night, “I’m your father’s God. Don’t be afraid; I’m with you. I’ll bless you and multiply your descendants out of regard for Abraham.” 25He built an altar and called on the LORD. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.

26Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his advisor and Phicol his commander. 27Isaac asked them,

“Why did you come to me? You despise me and drove me away.”

28“We can see the LORD’s been with you, so we said, ‘Let’s take an oath between us now.’  Let us make a treaty with you: 29you won’t harm us like we haven’t done anything but good to you and sent you away on good terms. You’re the LORD’s blessed.”

30He held a feast for them, and they ate together. 	  Gen 26:23-30

31In the morning they got up early and exchanged oaths. Isaac saw them off, and they left on good terms. 32The same day, Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the “well” they’d dug, “We found water.” 33So he called it Shibah. The town’s name is still Beersheba.

34When Esau was 40, he married two Hittite wives: Judith daughter of Beeri and Basemath daughter of Elon. 35They were a grief to Isaac and Rebekah.   	  Gen 26:31-35

Isaac Blesses Jacob

27:1When Isaac grew old, his eyesight was bad. He called for his older son Esau.

“Yes?”

2“I’m getting old, and I don’t know how long I’ll live. 3Take your bow and quiver, and hunt game for me. 4Make the kind of dish I like and bring it to me so I can eat it and bless you before I die.”

5Rebekah overheard it. When Esau went out into the countryside to hunt, 6she told Jacob,

“I overheard your father tell your brother, 7‘Bring me some game and make me a tasty dish. I’ll bless you in the LORD’s presence before I die.’ 8Listen, son. 9Bring me two choice kids from the flock so I can make a dish your father likes. 10Then take it to him so he can bless you before he dies.”   	Gen 27:1-10

11“I’m not hairy like Esau. 12My father may feel me. I’ll be a liar in his mind and bring a curse on myself, not a blessing.”

13“That curse be on me. Just do what I’m telling you. Go get them.”

14He got them and she made a meal Isaac liked. 15Then she took Esau’s best clothes, which were in the house, and put them on her younger son. 16She put the kids’ skins on his hands and neck, 17and gave Jacob the tasty food and bread she’d made.     	 Gen 27:11-17

18He went to his father and said, “Father.”

“Yes, who are you, son?”

19“Esau your firstborn. I’ve done like you said. Sit up and eat my game so you can

bless me.”

20“How did you get it so quick?”

“The LORD our God helped me.”

21“Come here so I can feel if you’re really Esau.”

22Jacob went up to him, and he felt him, “It’s Jacob’s voice but Esau’s hands.” 23He didn’t recognize him because his hands were hairy like Esau’s; so he blessed him. 24“Are you really Esau?”

“Yes.”

25“Bring it to me, and I’ll eat your game so I can bless you.” He took it to him, and he ate it. He took him wine to drink too. 26Then he said, “Come and kiss me, son.” 27He went and kissed him. When he smelled his clothes, he blessed him,

“You smell like a field the LORD has blessed.

28Now may God give you dew from the sky,

fertility from the ground,

and abundant grain and new wine.

29May nations serve you;

may they bow to you.

Have authority over your relatives;

may your mother’s sons bow to you.

Cursed be the ones that curse you;

blessed be those who bless you.”	Gen 27:18-29

30No sooner had Isaac finished blessing him and he’d left than Esau came in from hunting. 31He made delicious food too and took it to his father, “Sit up, Father, and eat your son’s game so you can bless me.”

32Isaac said, “Who are you?”

“Esau, your firstborn.”

33Isaac shook terribly “Then who was it that hunted game and brought it to me to eat and I blessed him? Yes, and he’ll stay blessed.”

34When Esau heard it, he let out a bitter cry, “Bless me too, father!”

35“Your brother came and deceived me and took your blessing.”

36Esau said, “Isn’t ‘Jacob’ a good name for him? He’s ‘usurped’ my position twice. He took my birthright; now he’s taken my blessing. Haven’t you kept a blessing for me?”

37“I’ve put him over you and given him his relatives as servants. I’ve sustained him with grain and new wine. What’s left that I can do, son?”

38“Don’t you even have one blessing for me, father?” Esau cried out loud.

39Isaac said,

“You’ll live away from fertile ground

and dew from the sky.

40You’ll live by your sword

and serve your brother.

But when you break free,

you’ll break his yoke from off your neck.”	  Gen 27:30-40

41Esau held a grudge against Jacob because his father had given Jacob the blessing. He said under his breath, “The days for mourning my father’s death are coming. Then I’ll kill Jacob.”

42When his threat reached Rebekah, she called Jacob,

“Your brother is consoling himself with the thought of killing you. 43Run off to my brother in Haran. 44Stay with him 45till your brother’s anger wears off. Then I’ll send for you. Why should I mourn for both of you the same day?”

46Rebekah told Isaac, “I’m as grieved as I can be over these Hittite women. If Jacob marries a woman like them, what good will my life be to me?” 	  Gen 27:41-46

Jacob Sent to Laban

28:1Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and charged him,

“Don’t marry a Canaanite. 2Go to Paddan-aram, to Bethuel your mother’s father, and choose a wife from Laban your uncle. 3May God Almighty [El-Shaddai] bless you and make you numerous so you’ll become a group of nations. 4May he give you and your descendants Abraham’s blessing so you’ll receive the land where you’ve lived as a nomad, the land God gave Abraham.”

5Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean.

Esau Marries an Ishmaelite

6Esau saw that Isaac had blessed him, sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife, and charged him not to marry a Canaanite. 7He saw that Jacob had obeyed his parents 8and that Isaac didn’t like Canaanite women. 9So he went to Ishmael and—besides the wives he had—married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath/Bashemath, sister of Nebaioth. 	Gen 28:1-9

Jacob’s Dream

10Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. 11After sundown he stopped for the night and lay down with a stone under his head. 12He dreamed that a ladder was set up on the earth with its top in the sky. God’s angels were climbing up and down on it. 13The LORD stood at the top of it and said,

“I’m the LORD God of Abraham and your father Isaac. I’ll give you and your descendants the ground you’re lying on. 14They’ll be like the dust on the ground and spread out in every direction. In you and your descendants, I will bless all the families in the world. 15I’ll protect you wherever you go, and bring you back here. I won’t leave you till I’ve done what I’ve promised.”

16Jacob woke up and said, “The LORD is certainly here, and I didn’t know it.” 17He was afraid, “This place is awesome! It’s nothing but ‘God’s house’ and heaven’s door.”  	Gen 28:10-17

18He got up early and took the stone that was under his head, set it up as a marker, and poured olive oil on it. 19He called the place Bethel (named Luz before) 20and vowed, “If God protects me on this trip, gives me food and clothes, 21and brings me back to my father’s family safely, then the LORD will be my God. 22This stone will be ‘God’s house,’ and I’ll give him a tenth of what he gives me.”    	     Gen 28:18-22

Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel

29:1Jacob continued on his trip to the country in the east. 2Up ahead he saw a well in a pasture where they watered the flocks. Three flocks of sheep were lying by it, and it had a big stone over it. 3When all the flocks got there, they’d roll the stone off the well, water the sheep, and put it back. 4Jacob asked them, “Brothers, where are you from?”

“Haran.”

5“Do you know Laban son of Nahor.”

“Yes.”

6“How is he?”

“He’s good. That’s his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep.”

7Jacob said, “It’s still the middle of the day, not time to herd the livestock. Why aren’t you watering the sheep and taking them to pasture?”

8“We can’t water them till all the flocks get here, and they roll the stone off the well.”

9While he was still talking to them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep. 10When Jacob saw her and Laban’s sheep, he went and rolled the stone off the well and watered Laban’s flock. 11He kissed Rachel and cried out loud. 12He told her he was Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father. She ran to tell her father.	 Gen 29:1-12

13When Laban heard it, he rushed to meet Jacob, hugged him, kissed him, and took him to his house. Jacob told him what all had happened. 14Laban said, “For sure, you’re my flesh and bone.” Jacob stayed with him a month.

15Laban said, “Because you’re my relative doesn’t mean you have to work for nothing. What do you want for pay?”

16Laban had two daughters, Leah, the older one, and Rachel. 17Leah had less beautiful eyes, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 18Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I’ll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”

19Laban said, “It’s better to give her to you than to anybody else. Stay on with me.” 20Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, but they seemed like just a few days because he loved her so much.	Gen 29:13-20

21Then Jacob told Laban, “Give me my wife so I can sleep with her. I’ve completed my time.” 22Laban gathered the men in the place and made a feast. 23In the evening he brought Leah to him, and Jacob slept with her. 24Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to Leah as a servant. 25In the morning, it was Leah! Jacob said to Laban, “What’ve you done to me? Didn’t I work for you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?”

26But Laban said, “It’s not the custom here to marry off the younger before the firstborn. 27Complete the bridal week for this one, and we’ll give you the other one too for another seven years’ work.”

28Jacob completed her week, and Laban gave him Rachel as a wife. 29He also gave his servant Bilhah to Rachel as her maid. 30Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved her more than Leah and worked for Laban for seven more years. 	Gen 29:21-30

Jacob’s Children

31The LORD saw that Leah wasn’t loved, and opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 32Leah had a son she named Reuben, “Because the LORD has ‘seen’ my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.” 33She had another son, “Because the LORD has ‘heard’ that I’m not loved, he gave me this son too”; so she named him Simeon. 34She had another son, “This time my husband will be ‘attached’ to me, because I’ve borne him three sons”; so she named him Levi. 35She became pregnant again and bore Jacob a son and said, “This time I’ll ‘praise’ the LORD”; so she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.	     	     Gen 29:31-35

30:1When Rachel saw she wasn’t having children, she became jealous of her sister and told Jacob, “Give me children, or I’m going to die!”

2Jacob’s anger flared, “I’m not God, am I? He’s the One that‘s kept you from having children!”

3“Here’s my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her so I can have children through her”; 4so she gave him Bilhah as a wife. 5She became pregnant and had a son. 6Rachel said, “God has ‘vindicated’ me. He’s heard me and given me a son”; so she named him Dan. 7Rachel’s maidservant had a second son. 8So Rachel said, “I’ve ‘wrestled’ hard with my sister and won”; so she named him Naphtali.	Gen 30:1-8

9When Leah saw she’d stopped having children, she gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. 10Zilpah had a son. 11Leah said, “How ‘fortunate!’” so she named him Gad. 12Zilpah had a second son. 13Leah said, “I’m happy, and women will call me ‘happy’”; so she named him Asher.

14During wheat harvest Reuben found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 15But she said, “Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? Would you take my son’s mandrakes too?” 16When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, “You have to sleep with me; I’ve certainly hired you with my son’s mandrakes”; he slept with her that night. 17God listened to Leah, and she had a fifth son. 18Leah said, “God has paid me my ‘wages’ because I gave my maid to my husband”; so she named him Issachar. 19She had a sixth son, 20“God has endowed me with a good gift. Now my husband will ‘live with’ me; I’ve had six sons for him”; so she named him Zebulun. 21Later she had a daughter she named Dinah. 22God remembered Rachel, listened to her, and opened her womb. 23So she had a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 24She named him Joseph, “May the LORD give me ‘another’ son.”

Gen 30:9-24

Jacob’s Prosperity

25At the time when Rachel had Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me go now so I can return to my own country. 26Let me have the wives and little ones I’ve worked for. You know the work I’ve done for you.”

27But Laban said to him, “If it pleases you, stay. I’ve seen that the LORD has blessed me because of you. 28Name your wages; I’ll pay it.”

29But Jacob said,

“You know how I’ve worked for you and how your livestock fared with me. 30You didn’t have much before I came, but it has increased to a big herd. The LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But when will I provide for my own family?”

31Laban asked, “What do you want me to give you?”

Jacob said,

“Don’t give me anything. Do this, and I’ll go on shepherding your flock: 32let me go through your entire flock today and take out every speckled and spotted sheep, black lamb, and speckled and spotted goat. That’ll be my pay. 33So my honesty can answer for me later when you figure my pay, consider stolen each one with me that’s not speckled and spotted among the goats or black among the lambs.”

34“All right.”	Gen 30:25-34

35That day, Jacob took out the striped and spotted male goats, the speckled and spotted female goats, the ones with white on them, and the black sheep. He gave them to his sons to take care of. 36Laban put three-days’ distance between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. 37Then Jacob took fresh poplar, almond, and plane stakes, and peeled white stripes around them. 38He set the peeled stakes in front of the flocks by the watering troughs where the flocks drank, and they mated when they came to drink. 39So the flocks mated by the stakes, and brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted young. 40Jacob separated the lambs and had the flocks face the striped and the black in Laban’s flock. He set his own herds apart and didn’t put them with Laban’s. 41In addition, whenever the stronger ones in the flock were mating, Jacob would put the stakes by the troughs so the flock could see them so they’d mate by the stakes. 42But when the flock was weak, he didn’t put them there; so the weaker ones were Laban’s, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s. 43Jacob became really prosperous with large flocks, with camels, donkeys, and male and female servants.	Gen 30:35-43

Jacob Flees from Laban

31:1Jacob overheard Laban’s sons say, “Jacob has taken everything our father had and created that wealth.” 2He saw that Laban’s attitude had changed. 3The LORD told him, “Go back to the land of your ancestors and relatives. I’ll be with you.”

4Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to his flock in the pasture. 5He told them,

“Your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but my father’s God has been with me. 6You know I worked hard for him, 7but he cheated me and switched my pay ten times. But God didn’t let him hurt me. 8If he said, ‘The speckled will be your pay,’ the flock brought forth speckled. If he said, ‘The striped will be your pay,’ the flock brought forth striped. 9That’s how God took your father’s livestock and gave them to me. 10At the time when the flock was mating, I looked up and saw in a dream that the male goats were striped, speckled, and mottled. 11Then God’s angel said in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Yes?’ 12‘Look up and see that the male goats that are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled, because I’ve seen what Laban’s been doing to you. 13I’m the God in Bethel, where you anointed a marker and took a vow to me. Now leave this country and go back where you were born.”

14Rachel and Leah answered,

“Do we still have any inheritance in our father’s family? 15Doesn’t he treat us like foreigners? He’s sold us and completely used up our purchase price. 16The wealth God has taken from him clearly belongs to us and our children; do what God has told you.”	Gen 31:1-16

17Then Jacob put his wives and offspring on camels, 18and drove away the livestock and property he’d accumulated in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in Canaan. 19When Laban went to shear his flock, Rachel stole his household idols. 20Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving. 21He left with everything he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed toward the hill country in Gilead.	Gen 31:17-21

22Three days later, Laban heard Jacob had left. 23He took some of his relatives and chased him for a week. He caught up with him in the hill country in Gilead. 24God came to Laban in a dream at night, “Don’t say anything to Jacob good or bad.” 25Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his relatives also camped there. 26Laban said to Jacob,

“What have you done, deceiving me and taking my daughters like captives of the sword? 27Why did you leave secretly so I couldn’t send you away with joy and songs, with tambourine and harp? 28You didn’t let me kiss my sons and daughters. You’ve done foolishly. 29I can do you harm, but your father’s God told me last night not to say anything to you good or bad. 30Okay, you’ve gone away because you longed for your father’s family, but why steal my gods?”

31Jacob answered him,

“I left secretly because I was afraid you’d take your daughters away from me by force. 32The one you find your gods with will die. In front of everybody, point out what’s yours in my belongings and take it.”

Jacob didn’t know Rachel had stolen them.	Gen 31:22-32

33Laban went to Jacob’s tent, Leah’s tent, the two maids’ tent, but didn’t find them. He left Leah’s tent and went to Rachel’s. 34She’d put the household idols in a camel’s saddle and sat on them. Laban rummaged through the tent but didn’t find them. 35She told her father, “Don’t be mad at me for not getting up. The way of women is on me.” He looked around but didn’t find them.	 Gen 31:33-35

36Jacob fussed at Laban,

“What’s my transgression? What’s my sin that you’ve hotly chased me? 37You’ve rummaged through everything. What have you found from your household goods? Set it here in front of my relatives so they can decide between us. 38For the 20 years I’ve been with you, your ewes and female goats haven’t miscarried. I haven’t eaten the rams from your flocks. 39I didn’t bring you what wild animals tore apart; I took the loss myself. You required from me what was stolen day or night. 40That’s how I was: in the daytime the heat consumed me; at night the frost kept me awake. 41I worked 14 years for your two daughters and 6 for your flocks. You switched my pay ten times. 42If the God of my grandfather Abraham, the one Isaac fears, hadn’t been on my side, you would’ve sent me away with nothing. He’s seen my mistreatment and hard work, and he rendered judgment last night.”	     Gen 31:36-42

43Laban answered him,

“By rights, the daughters belong to me, the little ones and flocks too, everything you’re looking at is mine. But what can I do about my daughters and their children now? 44Let’s make a treaty, a witness between us.”

45Jacob set up a stone marker. 46He told his relatives to gather up some rocks; they made a cairn of rocks and ate a covenant meal beside it. 47Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha; Jacob called it Galeed. 48Laban said, “This ‘mound’ serves as a ‘witness’ between us”; so they named it Galeed 49(also called Mizpah) because he said,

“May the LORD ‘watch over’ us while we’re apart. 50If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, though no one is with us, God is ‘witness’ between us. 51This ‘cairn’ 52signifies that neither of us will go past it to harm the other. 53The God of Abraham, Nahor, and their father judge between us.”

Jacob swore out of respect for his father Isaac. 54He offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his relatives to eat and spent the night there. 55In the morning, Laban got up early, kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and went home.	Gen 31:43-55

Jacob Travels to Meet Esau

32:1As Jacob was going along, angels from God met him. 2When he saw them, he said, “This is God’s ‘camp’”; so he named the place Mahanaim.

3He sent messengers to his brother Esau in Seir (Edom).

4“Tell Esau that his servant Jacob says, ‘I’ve lived temporarily with Laban till now. I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male and female servants. 5I’ve sent to tell you so I’ll be pleasing to you.’”

6The messengers came back to Jacob and said, “We went to Esau; he’s coming to meet you with 400 men.” 7Jacob was terribly afraid and distressed. He divided the people, the flocks, herds, and camels into two companies. 8“If Esau attacks one drove, the other can escape.”

9He said,

“God of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac, the LORD who told me to go back to my country and my relatives, and you’d make me prosper, 10I don’t deserve the kindness and faithfulness you’ve shown me. I crossed this Jordan with just a staff. Now I’ve become two companies. 11Protect me from Esau. I’m afraid he might attack me and the mothers of my offspring. 12You did say, ‘I’ll make you prosper and make your descendants like sand on the shore that can’t be counted.’”	Gen 32:1-12

13He spent the night there. Then he chose from what he had with him a gift for Esau: 14200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 1530 milking camels and their colts, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys. 16He gave them to his servants, “Go on ahead and space out the droves.” 17He told the first drove, “When Esau meets you and asks who they belong to and where you’re going, 18say, ‘They belong to Jacob. They’re a gift to you. Jacob is behind us.’” 19He told the second and third drove, and everybody that followed the droves, 20“Tell Esau when you meet him, ‘Your servant Jacob is behind us too.’” He said, “I’ll appease him with the gift first. Then when I see him, maybe he’ll accept me.” 21His gift passed on ahead while he spent that night in the camp. 	Gen 32:13-21

Jacob Wrestles with a Man

22He got up that night and took his 2 wives, 2 maids, and 11 children, and crossed the Jabbok ford. 23He sent them across the stream along with what he had. 24He was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till dawn. 25When the man saw he hadn’t won, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. 26Then the man said, “Let me go; it’s getting daylight.”

“I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”

27“What’s your name?”

“Jacob.”

28“It won’t be Jacob anymore. It’ll be Israel; you’ve ‘wrestled with God’ and men and prevailed.”

29“Tell me your name.”

“Why are you asking?” That’s where he blessed him.

30Jacob named the place Peniel; “I’ve seen ‘God face to face,’ but I’m still alive.” 31The sun was coming up as he crossed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 32Israelites still don’t eat the sinew that’s on the hip socket, because the man struck the sinew on Jacob’s hip socket.

Gen 32:22-32

Jacob Meets Esau

33:1Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his 400 men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two maids. 2He put the maids and their children in front, Leah and her children next, Rachel and Joseph last. 3He went on ahead of them and bowed to the ground seven times as he got closer to his brother. 4Then Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged him, and kissed him. They cried together. 5Esau looked up and saw the women and children, “Who are these?”

“Children God has graciously given me.”	Gen 33:1-5

6The maids came with their children and bowed. 7Leah came up with her children and bowed. Last, Joseph and Rachel came and bowed.

8Esau asked, “What do you mean by all this?”

Jacob said, “To please you.”

9But Esau said, “I have plenty, brother. Keep what you have.”

10“No, if I’m pleasing to you, accept my present; I look up to you like someone looks up to God, and you’ve received me graciously. 11Take the gift I’ve brought you; God has been generous with me; I have plenty.”

He kept urging him, so he took it.

12Esau said, “Let’s travel on. I’ll go ahead of you.”

13But he told him,

“You know the children are young, and I’m concerned about the flocks and herds that are nursing. If they’re driven hard for a day, they’ll die. 14Go on ahead. I’ll go at the pace of the livestock and children till I come to you in Seir.”

15“Let me leave some of my people.”

“What’s the need? Be gracious to me on this.”

16Esau went back that day to Seir. 17Jacob traveled to Succoth, built a house, and made “corrals” for his livestock; so the name of the place became Succoth.

18Jacob went safely to Shechem in Canaan and camped by the city. 19The piece of land where he’d pitched his tent, he bought from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of silver. 20He built an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel [El the God of Israel]. 	Gen 33:6-20

Dinah and the Shechemites

34:1Leah’s daughter Dinah went out to visit the daughters in the area. 2When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the territory, saw her, he took her and lay with her. 3He was deeply attracted to her, and loved her, and spoke tenderly to her. 4Shechem spoke to his father, “Get me this young girl for a wife.” 5Jacob heard that he’d defiled Dinah, but his sons were with his livestock in the pasture; he kept quiet till they came in. 6Then Hamor went to speak to Jacob. 7Jacob’s sons came in from the pasture when they heard. They were grieved and mad, because Shechem had done such an awful thing in Israel. Something like that shouldn’t be done. 	Gen 34:1-7

8But Hamor said to them,

“My son longs for your daughter. Let him marry her. 9Intermarry with us. 10That way you’ll live with us, and the country will be open to you. Live, carry on business, and buy property in it.”

11Shechem also told her father and brothers, “If I’m pleasing to you, I’ll give whatever you say. 12Ask me whatever bridal price and gift, and I’ll give it, but let me marry the girl.”

13But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father with deception because Shechem had defiled their sister,

14“We can’t give our sister to someone that’s not circumcised. That would be offensive to us. 15There’s only one way we’ll consent. If you’ll become like us by circumcising every male among you, 16we’ll intermarry with you and live with you as one people. 17If you won’t be circumcised, we’ll take our daughter and go.”	Gen 34:8-17

18Their proposal seemed agreeable to Hamor and Shechem. 19The young man didn’t delay doing what they asked because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. He was more respected than anybody else in his father’s family. 20He and Hamor went to their city gate and said,

21“These men are peaceful with us. Let them live in the land and do business here. The land is big enough for them. Let them intermarry with us. 22Only on this condition will they agree to live with us and become one people: every male among us must be circumcised like they are. 23Won’t their livestock, property, and animals be ours? Let’s agree with them, and they’ll live with us.”

24Everybody that went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and Shechem, and every male was circumcised.	Gen 34:18-24

25On the third day, when the men in Shechem were very sore, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took a sword apiece and attacked the city by surprise and killed every male. 26They killed Hamor and Shechem, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and left. 27Jacob’s sons came on the slain and looted the city because they’d defiled their sister. 28They took their flocks, herds, donkeys, what was in the city and in the countryside. 29They captured and looted their wealth, took their little ones, their wives, and everything in the houses. 30Jacob told Simeon and Levi,

“You’ve created a problem for me and made me repulsive to the Canaanites and Perizzites here. We only have a few men. They’ll gather against me and destroy me and my household.”

31They said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”	Gen 34:25-31

Jacob Returns to Bethel

35:1God told Jacob,

“Go up to Bethel and live and build an altar to me. I’m the One that appeared to you when you were running from Esau.”

2Jacob told his household and everybody with him,

“Put away your foreign gods, purify yourselves, and change clothes. 3Let’s go to Bethel. I’m going to build an altar to God there, who answered me in my distress and was with me wherever I’ve gone.”

4They gave Jacob their foreign gods and earrings, and he buried them under a terebinth tree near Shechem.

5As they moved along, a deep dread hovered over the towns around them, and they didn’t pursue Jacob’s sons. 6So Jacob and his people were able to reach Luz (Bethel) in Canaan. 7He built an altar, and called the place El-Bethel, because “God” revealed himself to him there when he was running from his brother. 8Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and Jacob buried her below Bethel under the oak named Allonbacuth [Oak of Weeping]. 	Gen 35:1-8

9God appeared to Jacob again after he came from Paddan-aram and blessed him.

10“You’re Jacob,

but you won’t be called Jacob anymore.

Your name will be Israel.

11I’m God Almighty [El-Shaddai].

Have children and multiply.

A group of nations will come from you;

kings will descend from you.

12I’ll give you and your descendants

the land I promised Abraham and Isaac.”

13God ascended from him, 14and Jacob set up a stone marker “where God” had spoken to him. He poured out a liquid offering on it, poured olive oil on it, 15and named the place Bethel.

Gen 35:9-15

The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac

16They moved on from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel started to have contractions and suffered hard labor. 17The midwife said, “Don’t be afraid; you have another son.” 18As her life was draining away, she named him Benoni; but his father called him Benjamin. 19Rachel died and was buried along the road to Ephrath. 20Jacob set up a marker over her grave that’s still there. 21Jacob kept traveling and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder. 22While he was living there, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel found out about it.	Gen 35:16-22

Jacob had 12 sons.

23by Leah: Reuben, his firstborn, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun;

24by Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;

25by Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali; and

26by Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher.

His 12 sons were born in Paddan-aram.

27Jacob went to see his father Isaac at Mamre near Kiriath-arba (Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived temporarily. 28Isaac lived 180 years, 29breathed his last, and passed on to his people. He’d lived to a ripe age, and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.	Gen 35:22b-29

36:1Esau’s (Edom’s) Generations

2Esau married Canaanite women: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 3and Basemath/Mahalath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 4Adah had Eliphaz; Basemath had Reuel, 5Oholibamah had Jeush, Jalam, and Korah—all born in Canaan.

6Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, household, livestock, cattle, and goods he’d gained in Canaan, and moved to a territory away from Jacob. 7Their livestock had become too much for the land to support them both. 8-9Esau, ancestor of the Edomites, lived in the hill country of Seir.

Rulers of Edom

31The kings that ruled in Edom before any king ruled in Israel:

37:1Jacob lived in Canaan, where his father had lived as a nomad. 	   Gen 36:31-37:1

2Jacob’s Dreams

When Joseph was still a youth of 17, he was pasturing the flock with his half-brothers, including the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. He brought his father a bad report about what they were doing. 3Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because he was born when Israel was old. He made him a tunic with many colors in it. 4His brothers saw that their father loved him more than them, so they despised him and wouldn’t speak to him in a civil way.

5Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they despised him more, 6“Let me tell you a dream I had. 7We were tying up bundles in the field. My bundle stood up straight and yours gathered around and bowed to mine.” 8His brothers asked, “You’re think you’re going to reign over us? You’re going to rule us?” They hated him even more for his dreams and what he said.

9He told his brothers another dream he had, “The sun, moon, and 11 stars were bowing down to me.” 10He told his father too, who scolded him, “What’s a dream like that mean? Are your brothers, your mother, and I really going to bow to you?” 11His brothers resented him, but his father wondered what it might mean.  	  Gen 37:2-11

Joseph Sold by His Brothers

12His brothers went to pasture their father’s flock at Shechem. 13Israel told Joseph, “Your brothers are pasturing at Shechem? Go join them.” 14He told him to bring him word how they and the flock were doing. He sent him from the Valley of Hebron to Shechem. 15A fellow found him walking in the countryside and asked him, “What are you looking for?”

16“My brothers. Where are they pasturing the flock?”

17“They’ve moved on from here. I heard them say they were going to Dothan.”

Joseph trailed them to Dothan. 	   Gen 37:12-17

18When they saw him in the distance, they said,

19“Here comes the dreamer! 20Let’s kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns. We can say a wild animal ate him. Then let’s see what comes of his dreams!”

21But Reuben heard about their scheme and came to his rescue, “Let’s not kill him. 22Don’t shed blood. Throw him into this cistern in the open country, but don’t lay hands on him.” He intended to rescue him and get him back to his father. 23When Joseph got to his brothers, they stripped off his multi-colored robe 24and put him in an empty cistern.	   Gen 37:18-24

25They sat down to eat. When they looked up, a caravan of Ishmaelite traders was coming from Gilead with camels carrying aromatic gum, salve, and myrrh—headed for Egypt. 26Judah said to his brothers, “What’s in it for us if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 27Let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, not hurt him. He’s our brother, our own flesh.” They agreed. 28Then some of the Midianite traders (Ishmaelites) went by; they pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them for 20 pieces of silver. They took him to Egypt. 	Gen 37:25-28

29Reuben went back to the cistern, and Joseph wasn’t in it. He tore his clothes! 30He went to his brothers, “The boy’s not there. What am I going to do?” 31They took Joseph’s tunic and slaughtered a male goat. They dipped the robe in its blood 32and took it to their father,

“We found this. See if it’s your son’s robe.”

33He examined it, “It’s his. A wild animal has torn him to pieces and eaten him!”

34Jacob tore his clothes and put burlap around his waist and mourned for him many days. 35His sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, “I’ll go down to Sheol mourning for him.” His father cried over him. 36Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the bodyguard.	     Gen 37:29-36

Judah and Tamar

38:1About that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to visit an Adullamite named Hirah. 2He saw the daughter of a Canaanite named Shuamas. He married her and slept with her. 3She had a son he named Er, 4another he named Onan, 5and one he named Shelah. That happened at Chezib.

6Judah took a wife named Tamar for Er his firstborn. 7But Er did what the LORD considered sin, so he took Er’s life. 8Judah told Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her. Raise up offspring for your brother.” 9Onan knew the offspring wouldn’t be his; so when he slept with her, he ejected his semen on the ground so he wouldn’t provide offspring for his brother. 10That displeased the LORD; so he took his life too. 11Judah told Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s family till my son Shelah grows up.” (He told himself, “I’m afraid he’ll die like his brothers.”) Tamar went and lived in her father’s family.	Gen 38:1-11

12After quite a while, Shua’s daughter, Judah’s wife, died. After the time of mourning, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah with his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13Tamar found out that her father-in-law was going there to shear his sheep. 14She took off her widow’s clothes, put on a veil, wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She’d seen that Shelah had grown up, but Judah hadn’t given her to him as a wife. 15When Judah saw her, he thought she was a shrine prostitute, because she’d covered her face. 16He turned aside to her by the road, and said, “Let me sleep with you.”

“What will you give me?”

17“I’ll send you a kid from the flock.”

“Will you give me a pledge till you send it?”

18“What pledge do you want?”

“Your seal and cord, and the staff that’s in your hand.”

He gave them to her and slept with her, and she got pregnant. 19She got up and left, took off her veil, and put her widow’s clothes back on.	Gen 38:12-19

20When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite to get back the pledge, he couldn’t find her. 21He asked the men there, “Where’s the shrine prostitute that was by the road at Enaim?”

“There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.”

22So he went back, “I couldn’t find her. The men said there hasn’t been any shrine prostitute there. 23Judah said, “Let her keep them so they don’t ridicule us. I did send this kid, but you couldn’t find her.”	Gen 38:20-23

24About three months later, Judah was informed, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has served as a shrine prostitute and got pregnant.”

Judah said, “Bring her out and burn her!”

25While she was being brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, “I’m pregnant by the man that owns these things. See whose signet ring, cords, and staff they are.”

26Judah recognized them, “She’s better than I am, because I didn’t give her to my son Shelah.” He never slept with her again.

27When it was time for her to deliver, she was carrying twins. 28As she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife tied a red thread on it, “This one came out first.” 29But he pulled his hand back and his brother came out. The midwife said, “What a ‘breach’ you’ve made for yourself”; so he was named Perez. 30Afterward his brother was born with the “red” thread on his hand. He was named Zerah. 	Gen 38:24-30

Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife

39:1The Ishmaelite traders had taken Joseph down to Egypt, and sold him to Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, captain of the bodyguard. 2The LORD was with him, so he became successful in his master’s house. 3His master saw the LORD was with him to make everything he did succeed. 4He was pleased with Joseph and made him his personal servant. Joseph oversaw his household and everything he owned. 5From the time he made him overseer, the LORD around his house, everything in it and in the field. 6So he left everything in his charge. With him present, he didn’t concern himself with anything except what to eat. 	      	     	      Gen 39:1-6a

Joseph was good looking. 7His master’s wife looked at him with lust and said, “Lie with me.” 8But he refused,

“With me here, my master doesn’t concern himself with anything in the house. He’s put me in charge of everything. 9There’s nobody higher than me, and he hasn’t withheld anything from me except you because you’re his wife. How could I do such a thing and sin against God?”

10She hounded Joseph day after day, but he wouldn’t give in to her. 11One day he went into the house to work; none of the other men were inside. 12She grabbed his cloak, “Lie with me!” He left his cloak in her hand and ran outside. 13When she saw his cloak in her hand, 14she yelled to the other men in her household,

“Look, he brought us a Hebrew to abuse us. He came in to rape me. 15When I screamed, he ran out and left his cloak beside me.”

16She left his cloak lying beside her till her husband came home. 17Then she told him, “The Hebrew slave you brought us came in to abuse me. 18When I screamed, he left his cloak and fled outside.”	  	  						    		    Gen 39:6b-18

19When she said, “That’s what your slave did to me,” he was mad 20and put him in jail with his prisoners. 21The LORD was with Joseph and made him a favorite of the chief jailer. 22He committed the prisoners to his charge and made him responsible for whatever happened there. 23The chief jailer didn’t supervise anything under his charge. The LORD prospered whatever Joseph did.					  	     	     	     	     	     Gen 39:19-23

The Cupbearer and the Baker

40:1After that, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended him. 2Pharaoh was furious 3and jailed them in the captain of the bodyguard’s house, where Joseph was. 4The captain put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them for some time. 5The cupbearer and baker both had a dream the same night, each man’s dream with its own meaning.

6When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw how dejected they looked.

7“Why are you so down?”

8“We’ve had a dream nobody can interpret.”                                                       	 Gen 40:1-8

9The chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream,

“I saw a vine 10that had three branches. It blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. 11I had Pharaoh’s cup in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into it and gave it to him.”

12Joseph said,

“The three branches represent three days. 13In three days Pharaoh will put you back in office. You’ll hand him the cup like before. 14Just keep me in mind when that happens and get me out of this house. 15I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I haven’t done anything here that warranted putting me in the dungeon.” 	  Gen 40:9-15

16When the chief baker saw he’d interpreted sensibly, he told Joseph, “I dreamed I saw three baskets of white bread on my head. 17The top basket had all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and birds were eating it.”

18Joseph said,

“The three baskets represent three days. 19In three days Pharaoh will take off your head and impale you on a pole, and birds will peck away at your body.”

20Three days later, on his birthday, Pharaoh held a banquet for all his officials. He called up the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 21He gave the cupbearer his office back; he gave the cup to Pharaoh. 22He impaled the baker like Joseph had interpreted, 23but the cupbearer didn’t remember to mention Joseph.	Gen 40:16-23

Pharaoh’s Dreams

41:1Two years later, Pharaoh dreamed he was standing by the Nile. 2Seven healthy, well-fed cows came up from the river and started grazing on the marsh grass. 3Seven scrawny, bony cows came up 4and ate the seven healthy, well-fed ones. Then he woke up.

5He went back to sleep and had another dream. Seven heads of filled-out, good grain grew on a single stalk. 6Seven thin, wind-scorched grain heads sprouted up 7and swallowed the filled-out heads. Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream. 8In the morning, the dreams haunted him. He sent for Egypt’s astrologers and wise men. He told them the dreams, but no one could figure out what they meant. 	Gen 41:1-8

9The cupbearer said to Pharaoh,

“I remember my own sins today. 10You were furious with us and confined me and the chief baker in the captain of the bodyguard’s house. 11We both had a dream the same night. 12A Hebrew young man was with us there, a servant to the captain. We told him the dreams, and he interpreted them for us. 13Things came about like he said. You gave me back my office but impaled the chief baker.”

Gen 41:9-13

14Pharaoh called for Joseph, and they hurried and brought him out of the dungeon. He shaved and changed clothes and went to Pharaoh. 15Pharaoh told him, “I’ve had a dream that no one can interpret. I’ve heard that you can interpret dreams.”

16“It’s not me. God will give you a sensible answer.”

17Pharaoh told Joseph,

“I dreamed I was standing on the bank of the Nile. 18Seven healthy, well-fed cows came up from the river and started grazing on the marsh grass. 19Seven unhealthy, scrawny, boniest cows I’d ever seen anywhere in Egypt, 20came up and ate the first seven cows. 21Yet when they’d eaten them, you couldn’t tell it. They were as scrawny as before. Then I woke up.

22“I also dreamed about seven filled-out, good grain heads that grew on a single stalk. 23Seven withered, thin, wind-scorched grain heads sprouted up, 24and swallowed the seven good heads. When I told the astrologers the dream, none of them could explain it to me.” 	Gen 41:14-24

25Joseph told him,

“Your dreams both mean the same thing. God has told you what he’s going to do. 26The seven good cows and seven good ears represent seven years. 27The seven bony, scrawny cows that came up after them and the seven thin heads scorched by the east wind represent seven years of famine. [28] 29Seven abundant years are coming on Egypt. [30] 31The seven-year famine that follows will ruin the land. It’ll be severe enough to erase the memory of previous abundance. 32Repeating the dream emphasizes that God is determined to do it. He’ll make it happen soon. 33Now you can look for a discerning man to appoint over Egypt. 34He can appoint land managers and exact a fifth of the crop during the seven abundant years. 35They can gather the food during those years, store it up in cities under your authority, and guard it. 36It can remain in reserve for the seven famine years so the land won’t perish from the famine.  	Gen 41:25-36

Joseph Made Ruler of Egypt

37The plan made sense to him and his officials. 38He asked, “Can we find anyone else like this who has a divine spirit in him?” 39Pharaoh told Joseph,

“Since God has informed you about this, there’s nobody more discerning and wise than you. 40You’ll be over my house, and my people will pay you homage. Only in regard to the throne will I have more authority than you. 41I’ve set you over Egypt.”

42Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph’s finger, dressed him in fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. 43He had him ride in his second chariot, and they declared ahead of him, “Bend the knee!” 44Pharaoh told him, “I’m Pharaoh, but without your permission nobody will lift hand or foot anywhere in Egypt.” 45Pharaoh named him Zaphenath-paneah and gave him as a wife Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 	Gen 41:37-45

46Joseph was 30 when he stood in front of Pharaoh. He went out from Pharaoh all over Egypt. 47During the seven abundant years, the ground produced abundantly. 48He gathered food during those years and put it in each city from its own fields. 49He stored up so much grain that he stopped trying to measure it—like sand on the seashore.

50Before the first famine year, Asenath bore Joseph two sons. 51He named the first son Manasseh, “God has ‘made me forget’ my problems and my father’s family.” 52He named the second son Ephraim, “God has made me ‘productive’ in the country where I suffered adversity.”

53The seven abundant years came to an end, 54and seven famine years set in—like Joseph had said. The famine spread over all the surrounding countries, but Egypt had food. 55The entire country was famished, and the people appealed to Pharaoh for food. He told them to go to Joseph and do what he said. 56When the famine had spread over the whole region, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. 57People from all over the region came to Egypt to buy grain from him because the famine was severe everywhere.	 Gen 41:46-57

Joseph’s Brothers Come to Egypt

42:1Jacob found out that Egypt had grain and said to his sons, “Why are you just looking at one another? 2I’ve heard that Egypt has grain. Go down and buy some so we can stay alive.” 3Ten of Joseph’s brothers went down, 4but Jacob didn’t send Joseph’s full brother Benjamin with them; he was afraid something would happen to him. 5His sons went with other people from Canaan because the famine wore on in Canaan too.

6Joseph governed the country and was the one that sold people the grain. His brothers came and bowed to the ground. 7When he recognized them, he disguised himself and was gruff with them, “Where are you from?”

“Canaan; we came to buy food.”

8They didn’t recognize him. 9He remembered his dreams about them, and said, “You’re spies. You’ve come to look for weak places in our country.”

10“No, my lord; we’ve come to buy food. 11We’re honest men, not spies.”

12“No, you’ve come to look for weak places in our country!”

13“We’re 12 brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest is with our father and one has died.”

14“The truth is, you’re spies. 15I’ll check out your claims. By Pharaoh’s life, you won’t leave here unless your youngest brother comes! 16One of you, go back to get him while the others stay here confined so I can verify what you claim.”

17He put them in prison together for three days. 	Gen 42:1-17

18The third day, he said,

“Do this and live; I respect God: 19if you’re telling the truth, one of you can remain in custody. The rest can take grain for your households. 20Bring your youngest brother, and you won’t die.”

That’s what they did.

21They said to one another, “We’re guilty about our brother. We saw his distress when he pleaded with us, but we didn’t care. That‘s why this distress has come on us.”

22Reuben answered, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen. Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”

23They didn’t know Joseph understood them; there had been a translator between them. 24He turned the other way and got tears in his eyes. But when he turned back around and spoke to them, he had Simeon bound right in front of them. 25He gave orders to fill their bags with grain, put each man’s money back in his sack, and give them supplies for the return trip.

Gen 42:18-25

26They loaded their donkeys with grain and left. 27When one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey where they stopped for the night, he saw his money in the top of the sack. 28He told his brothers, “My money’s been put back in my sack!” Their hearts sank, and they turned to one another shaking, “What’s God done to us?”

29When they got to Canaan, they told their father what had happened,

30“The lord of the land was gruff with us and accused us of being spies. 31But we told him, ‘We’re honest men, not spies. 32We’re 12 brothers. One’s dead and the youngest is with our father in Canaan.’ 33The man said, ‘Here’s how I’ll find out if you’re telling the truth: leave one of your brothers. Take the grain for your households and go. 34Bring your youngest brother to me so I can tell you’re not spies. I’ll release your brother, and you can do business here.’” 	Gen 42:26-34

35When they emptied their sacks, every man’s bag of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their money, they were scared. 36Jacob said, “You’ve deprived me of my children: Joseph’s gone, Simeon’s gone, and you want to take Benjamin! Everything’s going against me!”

37Reuben told him, “You can put my two sons to death if I don’t bring him back. Put him in my care.”

38But Jacob said, “He’s not going. His brother’s dead; he’s the only one left. If something happens to him on the trip, you’ll send my gray hair down to Sheol in grief.”

Gen 42:35-38

Joseph’s Brothers Return to Egypt

43:1The famine continued to be severe. 2When they’d eaten their grain from Egypt, their father said, “Go back and buy us a little food.”

3But Judah told him,

“The man strictly warned us that we wouldn’t see him unless our brother came with us. 4If you send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food. 5If you don’t, we won’t go.”

6Israel said, “Why did you do me such a bad turn by telling the man you had another brother?”

7They said,

“He questioned us closely about us and our relatives, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We were just answering his questions. Could we possibly know he’d say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”

8Judah said,

“Send the boy with me, and we, you, and your children will live. 9I’ll be his guarantee. Hold me responsible. If I don’t bring him back, you can blame me permanently. 10If we hadn’t delayed, we could have gone back twice.”	Gen 43:1-10

11Israel told them,

“If it has to be that way, in your bags take some of the best things our land produces. Take them to the man as a gift—some salve, honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts, almonds. 12Take twice the money that someone put back in your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake. 13Take your brother too. 14May God Almighty [El-Shaddai] grant you mercy so he’ll release your other brother and Benjamin. If I grieve, I grieve.”

15They took the gift, twice the money, and Benjamin, and went down to meet Joseph.

Gen 43:11-15

16When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his palace overseer, “Bring them into the house, butcher an animal, and prepare for them to eat with me at noon.” [17].

18They were afraid, “Because of the money brought back the first time, he’s taking us in to arrest us and make slaves out of us and our donkeys.” 19They went and talked to the overseer at the entrance to Joseph’s house,

20“Sir, we really did come down the first time to buy food. 21When we stopped at a place to stay and opened our sacks, each man’s money was in the top of the sack. We’ve brought it back. 22We’ve brought other money to buy food this time. We don’t know who put our money back in our sacks before.”

23“Don’t worry. Your and your father’s God put your treasure in your sacks. I handled it.”

Then he brought Simeon out. 24He took the brothers into Joseph’s house, gave them some water to wash their feet, and fed their donkeys some hay. 25They got their gift ready for when Joseph came at noon; they’d heard they were to eat a meal there. 	     Gen 43:16-25

26When he came home, they brought their gift into the house and bowed to the floor. 27He asked them how they were doing, “How’s your elderly father? Is he still alive?”

28“He’s alive and well.” They bowed again in homage.

29He looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, “Is this your youngest brother you told me about? God be gracious to you, son.”

30He hurried out because he was deeply moved over his brother, and looked for a place to cry. He went back to his room and cried, 31then washed his face and came back. He controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.” 32they served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians that ate with him by themselves. (Egyptians wouldn’t eat with Hebrews. That would have been demeaning.) 33They were sitting, the firstborn according to his birthright, the youngest according to his youth. They looked at one another amazed. 34He took portions to them from his own table; Benjamin’s portion was 5 times any of theirs. They ate with him as much as they wanted.      	Gen 43:26-34

Joseph’s Silver Cup

44:1Then he told his palace overseer, “Fill their sacks with as much as they can transport. Put each man’s money in his sack, 2and put my silver cup with the money in the top of the youngest man’s sack.”

3At daylight they sent them away with their donkeys. 4They’d just got out of the city when Joseph told his palace overseer, “Follow them. When you catch up with them, say, ‘Why repay good with bad? 5Isn’t this what my lord drinks out of and uses for fortunetelling? You’ve done wrong.’” 6He caught up with them and told them that.

7“Why say something like that? We wouldn’t do that. 8We brought back the money we found in our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 9Kill whoever you find it with, and we’ll be your slaves.”

10“All right. The one that has it will be my slave. The rest of you will go free.”

11They hurried and lowered their sacks to the ground and opened them. 12He searched from the oldest to the youngest and found the cup in Benjamin’s sack. 13They tore their clothes and loaded their donkeys and went back to the city. 	Gen 44:1-13

14When Judah and his brothers got to Joseph’s house, he was still there. They prostrated themselves on the floor. 15He asked, “What’ve you done? Don’t you know a man like me can tell fortunes?”

16Judah said, “What can we say? How can we explain this? God has found out our sin. We’re your slaves, we and the one he found the cup with.”

17He said, “I wouldn’t do that. The one the cup was with will be my slave. The rest of you can go up to your father in peace.”	Gen 44:14-17

18Judah came up to him and said,

“May I say something to you? Don’t be mad; you’re equal to Pharaoh. 19You asked us if we had a father or brother. 20We told you we had an elderly father and a young brother that was born when our father was old. He’s the only one left from his mother, and his father loves him (a full brother of his is dead).”

21“Bring him down so I can see him.”

22“The boy can’t leave his father. His father would die.”

23“Unless he comes with you, you won’t see me again.”

24“We went up and told him what you said.

25“Later, he told us to come back and buy more food.

26“But we said, ‘We can’t. If our youngest brother’s not with us, we won’t be able to see the man.’

27“You know my wife had two sons. 28One of them went out and must have been torn to pieces by wild animals. I haven’t seen him since. 29If you take this one and something happens to him, you’ll send my gray hair down to Sheol in grief.” 	Gen 44:18-29

30-31“If I go back and he sees the boy’s not with us, he’ll die. His life is wrapped up in the boy’s life. We’ll send his gray hair down to Sheol in grief. 32I became a guarantee for the boy, I said I’d bear the blame permanently if I didn’t bring him back. 33Let me stay in his place so he can go with his half-brothers. 34How could I go up to my father if he’s not with me? I’d see how hard it would be on him.” 	Gen 44:30-34

Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers

45:1Joseph couldn’t control himself in front of everybody that was standing there. He cried out, “Everybody out!” Nobody was with him when he introduced himself to his brothers. 2He cried so loud the Egyptians heard it, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it. 3He told his brothers,

“I’m Joseph. Is my father still alive?”

They were so overwhelmed by his presence they couldn’t answer him.

4Then he said, “Come closer.”

“I’m Joseph that you sold into Egypt. 5Don’t grieve or be angry with yourselves. God sent me ahead of you to save you. 6The famine has been in the land for two years. There won’t be any plowing or harvesting for five more years. 7God sent me ahead to preserve you as a remnant here and keep you alive by a great rescue. 8It wasn’t so much you as God. He’s made me like a father to Pharaoh, manager over his household and ruler over Egypt. 9Hurry back and tell my father his son Joseph says, ‘God has made me lord over Egypt. Come down to me right away. 10You’ll live in the territory of Goshen near me—you, your children, grandchildren, flocks and herds, everything you own. 11I’ll take care of you there so your household and possessions won’t perish. The famine’s going to last five more years.’ 12You and my brother Benjamin can see I’m telling you this directly. 13Tell my father about my splendor in Egypt and everything you’ve seen. Hurry and bring him down here.”

14Then he embraced Benjamin and cried, and Benjamin cried and embraced Joseph. 15Joseph kissed his brothers and cried on them. Afterward they talked. 	Gen 45:1-15

16When Pharaoh’s household heard that Joseph’s brothers had come, they were happy. 17Pharaoh said,

“Tell them to load their animals and go to Canaan, 18get their father and households, and come to me. I’ll give them the best land in Egypt. They’ll eat off the rich land. 19Have them take wagons for their wives and little ones, and bring their father. 20Tell them not to worry about their personal belongings; they’ll have the best in Egypt.’”	Gen 45:16-20

21Joseph gave them wagons and supplies for their trip. 22He gave each of them a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin 300 pieces of silver and 5 changes of clothes. 23He sent his father 10 donkeys loaded with the best things Egypt had to offer and 10 female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for his father’s trip back. 24He sent them off, “Don’t quarrel on the trip.” 25They went up to Canaan 26and told their father, “Joseph’s still alive! He’s actually the ruler of Egypt!” He was stunned! He couldn’t believe it! 27When they told him what Joseph had said and he saw the wagons he sent to take him back, he revived. 28“Joseph must still be alive! I’ll go see him before I die.”  	          Gen 45:21-28

Joseph Brings His Brothers to Egypt

46:1Israel set out with everything he had. He went to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2God spoke to him in a vision at night,

“Jacob, Jacob.”

“Yes?”

3“I’m God, your father’s God. Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt. I’ll make a big nation out of you there. 4I’ll go down with you and bring you back. Joseph will close your eyes.”

5He left Beersheba. His sons hauled him, their little ones, and wives in the wagons Pharaoh sent. 6-7They took him, his sons, grandsons, daughters, and granddaughters, their livestock and property they’d gained in Canaan, and went to Egypt.	Gen 46:1-7

8The names of Jacob’s sons that went to Egypt

Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn: 9his sons Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi

10Simeon: his sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar—and Shaul, the son of a

Canaanite woman

11Levi: his sons Gershon, Kohath, Merari

12Judah: his sons Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, Zerah (Er and Onan died in Canaan.)

Perez’s sons: Hezron and Hamul

13Issachar: his sons Tola, Puvvah, Iob, and Shimron

14Zebulun: his sons Sered, Elon, Jahleel

15The descendants of Leah that she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram with his daughter Dinah, were 34.

16Gad: his sons Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli

17Asher: his sons Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah (and their sister Serah)

Beriah’s sons: Heber and Malchiel.

18The descendants of Zilpah that Laban gave his daughter Leah, were 16.

19Joseph: his sons Manasseh and Ephraim, 20born to him in Egypt by Asaneth,

daughter of Potiphera, priest of On

21Benjamin: his sons Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim,

Huppim, and Ard

22The descendants of Rachel born to Jacob were 14.

23Dan: his son Hushim

24Naphtali: his sons Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem

25The descendants of Bilhah that Laban gave his daughter Rachel, were 7.

2666 direct descendants of Jacob went to Egypt (not including his daughters-in-law) 27plus Joseph’s two sons born there. 70 people in Jacob’s household ended up in Egypt.	Gen 46:8-27

28Jacob sent Judah on ahead so Joseph could give them directions to Goshen. 29Joseph prepared his chariot and went there to meet his father. When he met him, he hugged him and cried on his shoulder a long time. 30Israel told him, “Now I can die! I’ve seen you’re still alive!”

31Joseph told his brothers and his father’s family,

“I’ll go tell Pharaoh you’ve arrived from Canaan 32with your herdsmen, flocks and herds, and everything you have. 33When he calls you and asks what your occupation is, 34tell him you and your ancestors have always been herdsmen. Say that so you can live in Goshen; shepherds have low status in Egypt.”  	Gen 46:28-34

Jacob’s Family Settles in Goshen

47:1Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, their flocks and herds, and everything they own have come from Canaan to Goshen.” 2He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 3Pharaoh asked,

“What’s your occupation?”

“We and our ancestors have been shepherds. 4We’ve come here to live a while. There’s no pasture in Canaan because the famine’s severe. Would you let us live in Goshen?”

5-6Pharaoh told Joseph,

“Egypt is at your disposal. Settle your father and brothers in the best land—in Goshen. If you know any capable men among them, have them manage my livestock.”

7Joseph brought Jacob and introduced him to Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8Pharaoh asked, “How old are you?”

9“130. My years have been few and unpleasant, not as many as my ancestors’.” 10He blessed Pharaoh and went out.

11Joseph settled his father and brothers, and gave them a possession in Rameses, the best land in Egypt. 12He provided his father, brothers, and Jacob’s household with food in proportion to how many children they had.	      Gen 47:1-12

Joseph and the Famine in Egypt

13There wasn’t any food in the whole region because the famine was so severe. Egypt and Canaan were starving. 14Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan for the grain people bought, and brought it to Pharaoh’s house. 15When the money was gone in Egypt and Canaan, the Egyptians came to Joseph, “Give us food. Why should we die in front of you? Our money’s gone.” 16Joseph said, “Trade your livestock for food.” 17So they brought their livestock, and he gave them food in exchange for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys that year.

18At the end of the year, they came and said,

“We won’t hide it from you that we’ve spent all our money, and the livestock belong to you. We don’t have anything left except our bodies and land. 19Why should we and our land die in front of you? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed so we can stay alive, and the land won’t be desolate.”	 Gen 47:13-19

20Joseph bought the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was so severe. The land became Pharaoh’s. 21He moved the people to the cities from all over Egypt. 22He didn’t buy the priests’ lands because they lived off their allotments from Pharaoh. 23Joseph told the people,

“I’ve bought you and your land for Pharaoh today. Here’s seed so you can sow the land. 24At harvest, give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours for planting and for feeding your household and little ones.”

25They said, “You’ve saved us! Be gracious to us, my lord, and we’ll be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 26Joseph made it a statute about land in Egypt that’s still in force: Pharaoh would have a fifth. The priests’ land was all that didn’t become Pharaoh’s.  	Gen 47:20-26

27Israel kept living in Goshen, acquired property, and became very numerous. 28Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, 147 years in all. 29When the time came to die, he called Joseph,

“Do me a favor. Put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth. Don’t bury me in Egypt. 30When I lie down with my ancestors, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.”

“I’ll do that.”

31“Swear to me.”

He swore to him.

Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed. 	Gen 47:27-31

Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh

48:1After this, they told Joseph, “Your father is failing.” So he took his sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him. 2When they told Jacob, “Joseph’s here,” Israel gathered his strength and sat up in bed. 3He told Joseph,

“God Almighty [El-Shaddai] appeared to me in Luz and blessed me: 4‘I’ll make you countless, a group of nations. I’ll give your descendants this land as a permanent possession.’ 5Your two sons born in Egypt before I came will be considered mine alongside Reuben and Simeon. (6Your later offspring will be yours.) They’ll inherit with their brothers. 7When I was coming from Paddan, sadly, Rachel died in Canaan on the way before we got to Ephrath (Bethlehem). I buried her there.”	           			           	           				           Gen 48:1-7

8When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?”

9“They’re the sons God gave me here.”

“Bring them to me so I can bless them.”

10Israel’s sight was so weak from age he could hardly see. Joseph brought them, and he kissed them and hugged them. 11He told Joseph, “I never expected to see you, and God has let me see your children too!” 12Joseph took them from his knees and bowed to the ground. 13Joseph took Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right. 14But Israel put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, crossing his hands, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. 15He blessed Joseph,

“God in whose presence my forefathers Abraham and Isaac lived,

God that’s been my shepherd my whole life,

16the angel that redeemed me from every misfortune,

bless the boys.

May I and my forefathers live on in them,

and they become a large number.”	 Gen 48:8-16

17When Joseph saw his father put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him. He took hold of his father’s hand to move it to Manasseh’s head, 18“Not that way, father. This is the firstborn. Put your hand on his head.”

19But his father refused, “I know, son; I know. He’ll become numerous too. But his younger brother will be more numerous. Many nations will descend from him.” 20He blessed them that day,

“By you Israel will pronounce blessing and say,

‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!’”

He put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.

21Then he told Joseph,

“I’m about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to where your ancestors lived. 22I’m giving you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the Amorite with my sword and bow.” 	Gen 48:17-22

Jacob Blesses His Sons

49:1Jacob called for his sons, “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you.

2Gather together, sons of Jacob

listen to your father Israel.”

3“Reuben, my firstborn,

my strength and the first issue of my virility,

preeminent in dignity and power,

4uncontrolled like water.

You won’t have preeminence

because you defiled your father’s bed;

you got on my marriage couch.”	Gen 49:1-4

5“Simeon and Levi are brothers;

their swords are violent tools.

6Let my soul not join their council;

let my honor not agree with their assembly;

because in their anger they killed people,

in their unrestraint they lamed oxen.

7Cursed be their fierce anger,

their cruel wrath.

I’ll disperse them in Jacob

and scatter them in Israel.”	Gen 49:5-7

8“Judah, your brothers will praise you;

your hand will be on your enemies’ neck;

your father’s sons will bow to you.

9Judah is a lion’s whelp;

son, you’ve risen up from the prey.

He crouches and lies down like a lioness;

who dares to rouse him?

10The scepter won’t leave Judah,

or the ruler’s staff from between his feet

till Shiloh comes.

The nations will obey him.

11He ties his foal to a grapevine,

his donkey colt to the best vine.

He washes his clothes in wine,

his robes in the juice from grapes.

12His eyes are stained from wine;

his teeth are white from milk.”	Gen 49:8-12

13“Zebulun will live by the lake;

he’ll be a haven for boats;

his border will extend toward Sidon.”

14“Issachar is a strong donkey,

lying between the sheepfolds.

15When he sees how good his resting place is

and how pleasant his land is,

he’ll bend his shoulder to carry burdens

and submit to forced labor	Gen 49:13-15

16“Dan will judge his people,

as one of the tribes in Israel.

17He’ll be a snake along the road,

a pit viper in the path

that bites a horse’s heels,

so its rider falls off backward.

18I wait for your salvation, LORD.”

19“Raiders will raid Gad,

but he’ll raid back.”	Gen 49:16-19

20“Asher will eat tasty food

and produce food fit for kings.”

21“Naphtali is an untamed doe

that bears beautiful fauns.”

22“Joseph is a fruitful limb,

a fruitful bough beside a spring;

its branches extend out over the wall.

23The archers bitterly attacked him,

shot at him, and harassed him;

24but his bow stayed strong,

and his arms maintained their endurance

because of the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob

(from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),

25because your father’s God helps you,

because the Almighty blesses you

with blessings of the deep that lies below,

blessings of the animals and the womb.

26Your father’s blessings

have surpassed his ancestors’ blessings

up to the utmost boundary of the everlasting hills.

May they be on Joseph’s head,

the distinguished one among his brothers.”		Gen 49:20-26

27“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.

He eats prey in the morning

and divides spoil at dusk.”

Jacob’s Death and Burial

28That’s what their father told his sons when he blessed them, each with an appropriate blessing. 29Then he charged them,

“I’m about to pass on to my people. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in Machpelah east of Mamre, in Canaan, in the cave Abraham bought for a burial site. 31They buried Abraham and his wife Sarah there. They buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah there. That’s where I buried Leah.” [32] 	Gen 49:27-32

33When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into bed, breathed his last, and passed on to his people. 50:1Joseph fell on his father’s face and cried and kissed him. 2He told the physicians to embalm him. 3The embalming took 40 days, and the Egyptians mourned him 70 days.  	Gen 49:33-50:3

4After the time of mourning, Joseph told Pharaoh’s advisors,

“If I’m pleasing to you, tell Pharaoh 5my father had me swear, ‘I’m about to die. Bury me in the grave I dug for myself in Canaan.’ Let me go up and bury him. Then I’ll be back.”

6Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury him like he had you swear.”      	Gen 50:4-6

7-8So Joseph went up to bury him. Pharaoh’s officials, the senior members of his household, the senior officers of Egypt, Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s family went with him. They left only their little ones, flocks, and herds in Goshen. 9A large company of chariots and cavalry also went up. 10When they came to Atad’s threshing floor, not far from the Jordan, they mourned greatly. Joseph observed a week of mourning. 11When the Canaanites saw the mourning, they said, “This is extreme ‘mourning’ for ‘Egyptians’”; so they named it Abel-mizraim. 12His sons did for him what he’d said. 13They carried him to the Cave of Machpelah east of Mamre, which Abraham had bought for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite along with the field. 14After he’d buried him, Joseph and the whole company went back to Egypt.

Gen 50:7-14

Joseph Reassures His Brothers

15When Joseph’s brothers thought about the fact that their father was dead, they said “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for what we did to him?” 16They sent him a message, “Before our father died, he charged us 17to tell you, ‘Forgive your brothers’ sin; they did wrong.’ Forgive the servants of your father’s God.” Joseph cried when they spoke to him. 18Then his brothers came and prostrated themselves, “We’re your servants.” 19But Joseph said,

“I’m not God, am I? 20You meant to harm me, but he turned it out for good to bring about saving lots of people. 21Don’t worry. I’ll keep taking care of you and your little ones.”

He reassured them and dealt with them graciously. 	   Gen 50:15-21

Joseph Reassures His Brothers

22Joseph and his father’s family stayed in Egypt. 23He saw three generations of Ephraim’s descendants and claimed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh as his own. 24He told his brothers, “I’m about to die, but God will take care of you, and take you up to the land he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 25He had the sons of Israel swear, “Take my bones up from here.” 26Joseph died at 110; his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.

Gen 50:22-26

EXODUS

1:1Israel’s descendants and their households that went to Egypt with Jacob: 2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 3Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 4Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher: 570 people (though Joseph was already there)

6That whole generation died, 7but Israel’s descendants multiplied and became so numerous they filled the country.	Ex 1:1-7

The Israelites Oppressed

8In time, a new king came to power in Egypt who didn’t know Joseph. 9He told his people, “There are too many Israelites, and they’re too strong. 10Let’s deal with them wisely so, if there’s war, they won’t join our enemies and leave.” 11They appointed taskmasters and subjected the Israelites to hard labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they mistreated them, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians were afraid of them [13] 14and made their lives miserable, making bricks and mortar and laboring in the fields. 	  Ex 1:8-14

15The king told the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah, 16“When you’re helping the Hebrew women on the birth stool, kill the boys.” 17But the midwives respected God and let them live. 18The king called them in and asked, “Why have you let the boys live?”

19“Hebrew women aren’t like Egyptian women. They deliver quickly before midwives can get there.” 20God was good to the midwives, and the people kept multiplying. 21Because the midwives respected God, he gave them families of their own. 22Pharaoh kept telling his people to throw the boys in the Nile but keep the girls.	Ex 1:15-22

The Birth of Moses

2:1A descendant from Levi married a woman from Levi, 2and she had a son. When she saw he was such a handsome baby, she hid him for three months. 3When she couldn’t hide him anymore, she got a papyrus reed basket and covered it with tar. She put him in it and set it in the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 4His sister stood a distance away to see what would happen to him. 5Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the Nile with her attendants. As she walked along the river, she saw the basket in the reeds and had her maid bring it to her.

6When she opened it, she saw the baby crying and felt sorry for him, “This is one of the Hebrews’ babies.”

7Then his sister asked her, “Do you want me to call a Hebrew nurse for you?”

8“Go ahead.”

She went and called his mother.

9Pharaoh’s daughter said, “Nurse him for me, and I’ll pay you.” 10He grew and she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses because she ‘pulled him out’ of the water.	Ex 2:1-10

Moses Flees from Egypt

11When Moses grew up, he went out to his relatives and looked at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. 12He looked around and saw nobody was there; he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13He went out the next day, and two Hebrews were fighting. He asked the one that started it, “Why are you hitting your friend?”

14“Who made you a ruler or judge over us? Are you going to kill me like you did that Egyptian?”

Moses was afraid, “Clearly, people know what I did.”

15When Pharaoh heard about it, he tried to execute Moses, but he fled to Midian.

Ex 2:11-15

He sat down by a well. 16The priest in Midian had seven daughters that came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father’s flock. 17Some other shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and helped them and watered their flock. 18When they went to their father Reuel/Jethro, he asked,

“How did you get back so soon today?”

19“An Egyptian protected us from the shepherds. He even drew water for the flock.”

20“Where is he? Why did you leave him behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”

21Moses was willing to live with the man, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah. 22She had a son he named Gershom, “Because I’ve been a ‘foreigner’ in a foreign country.”	 Ex 2:16-22

23After a long time, that king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under the slavery. They cried out and their call for help went up to God. 24He heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 25He took notice of them; he knew who they were.

Ex 2:23-25

Moses and the Burning Bush

3:1Moses was pasturing Jethro’s/Reuel’s flock and led it to the west side of the open country around Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God. 2The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing bush. Moses looked up and saw the bush on fire, but it didn’t burn up. 3He said, “I have to go over and see this curious thing. Why isn’t it burning up?” 4When the LORD saw him coming to look, he called from the bush,

“Moses!”

“Yes?”

5“Don’t come any closer. Take your sandals off. You’re standing on sacred ground. 6I’m the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”

Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.

7“I’ve seen my people’s suffering in Egypt and paid attention to their outcry because of the taskmasters. 8I’ve come down to deliver them and bring them out to a good land with lots of room, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. 9I’ve seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10Go; I’ll send you to Pharaoh so you can bring my people out of Egypt.”

11“Why me?”

12“I’ll be with you. This will be the sign that I’ve sent you: when you’ve brought them out, you’ll worship me at this mountain.” 	Ex 3:1-12

13Moses said, “So I’m going to the Israelites to say their ancestors’ God has sent me. What if they ask me what your name is? What will I tell them?”

14“I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, ‘I AM sent me, 15Yahveh God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ That’s my name forever, the name all generations will remember me by. 16Get the elders in Israel together and tell them that Yahveh, your ancestors’ God, appeared to you and said, ‘I’m concerned about youpl and what they’re doing to you in Egypt. 17I’ll take you away from the sufferings to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 18They’ll listen.

“Go to the king of Egypt with the elders and say, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day journey into the open country and sacrifice to him.’ 19He won’t let you go unless he’s forced to. 20I’ll strike Egypt with my miracles. Then he’ll let you go. 21I’ll make the Egyptians favorable to you so when you leave, you won’t leave empty-handed. 22Every woman needs to ask her neighbor and the woman that lives in her house, to give her silver and gold items, and articles of clothing. Put them on your sons and daughters. That’s how you’ll ‘plunder’ the Egyptians.” 	Ex 3:13-22

Signs for Moses

4:1Moses answered, “What if they don’t believe me, ‘The LORD hasn’t really appeared to you!’?”

2“What’s in your hand?”

“A staff.”

3“Throw it on the ground.”

He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses jumped back.

4But the LORD said, “Grab its tail.” He caught it, and it turned back into a staff in his hand. 5“They’ll believe that the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has appeared to you. 6Put your hand into your chest.” He did; when he took it out, it was leprous like snow. 7“Put it in again.” He did, and it became like the rest of him.

8“If the first sign doesn’t convince them, the second may. 9If neither one does, dip some water out of the Nile and pour it on dry ground. It’ll become blood.”	Ex 4:1-9

10Moses said, “Lord, I’ve never been good with words before, or lately since you’ve spoken to me. I stammer and stutter.”

11“Who made people’s tongues? Who makes people mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Isn’t it me, the LORD? 12Go on; I’ll be with your mouth and tell you what to say.”

13“Lord, send the message by whoever else you want to.”

14The LORD’s anger flared at Moses,

“Don’t you have a brother, Aaron the Levite? He speaks fluently. Besides, he’s coming out to meet you; he’ll be glad to see you. 15Give him my message. I’ll be with you and him and tell you what to do. 16He’ll speak to the people for you. He’ll be your mouth, and you’ll be like God to him. 17Take this staff and perform the signs with it.”	Ex 4:10-17

Moses Returns to Egypt

18Moses went back to Jethro/Reuel and said, “Let me go so I can go to my relatives in Egypt and see if they’re still alive.”

“Have a safe trip.”

19The LORD told Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt. The men that were trying to kill you are dead.”

20Moses put his wife and sons on a donkey and left with God’s staff.

21The LORD told him,

“When you get to Egypt, perform the wonders for Pharaoh that I’ve made you able to do, but I’ll harden his heart so he won’t let the people go. 22Then tell him that the LORD says, ‘Israel is my son, my firstborn. 23I’ve told you to let him go so he can serve me,’ but you’ve refused. So I’ll kill your son, your firstborn.’”

24At a place where they stayed on the way, the LORD met him and threatened to put him to death. 25Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet. She said, ‘You’re a bloody groom 26(because of the circumcision)!” So God let him alone.      Ex 4:18-26

27The LORD told Aaron, “Go meet Moses in the open country.” He met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. 28Moses told him what the LORD had sent him to do. 29They gathered Israel’s elders, 30and Aaron told them everything the LORD had told Moses. Moses performed the signs for the people, 31and they believed. When they heard the LORD cared about them and had seen their adversity, they bowed low in worship.	Ex 4:27-31

Moses and Aaron Speak to Pharaoh

5:1After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, “The LORD, Israel’s God, says to let his people go so they can celebrate a festival to him in the open country.”

2Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD that I should obey him? I don’t know him. I’m not going to let them go.”

3They said,

“The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day’s journey into open country to sacrifice to the LORD our God so he won’t fall on us with disease or sword.”

4The king said,

“Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to pull the people away from their work? Get back to work! 5Look at how many there are, and you want them to stop working!”

Making Bricks Without Straw

6That same day Pharaoh told the taskmasters and their foremen,

7“Don’t give them straw anymore to make bricks. They can gather their own straw! 8But don’t reduce their quota. They’re lazy, so they’re crying out, ‘Let us go sacrifice to our God.’ 9Give them more work so they won’t get false ideas in their heads.” 	Ex 5:1-9

10The taskmasters and their foremen went out to the people, “Pharaoh says he’s not going to give you straw anymore. 11Get your own wherever you can find it, but your quota will stay the same. 12The people scattered out across Egypt to gather stubble. 13The taskmasters pressed them, “Make your daily quota like when you had straw.” 14What’s more, Pharaoh’s taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen that they’d set over them, “Why haven’t you completed your required amount yesterday or today?”	     Ex 5:10-14

15The Israelite foremen came and appealed to Pharaoh, “Why are you treating us like this? 16We don’t have any straw, but they keep telling us to make bricks! They’re beating us, but it’s your own people’s fault.”

17“You’re lazy, very lazy. That’s why you want me to let you go sacrifice to the LORD. 18Get to work. You won’t be given any straw, but you still have to make your quotas.”

19The foremen saw they were in trouble. 20When they left him, they met Moses and Aaron, waiting for them. 21They said, “The LORD condemn you! You’ve made us offensive to Pharaoh and his officers! You’ve put a sword in their hand to kill us!” 	Ex 5:15-21

22Moses went back to the LORD and said,

“Why hurt the people? Why send me? 23Since I spoke to Pharaoh in your name, he’s been hurting them more. You haven’t delivered them at all.”

Promise of Deliverance

6:1The LORD told Moses,

“Now you’ll see what I’ll do to Pharaoh. He’ll have to let them go. I’ll make him send them out of his country. 2I’m Yahveh. 3I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as ‘God Almighty’ [El-Shaddai]. I didn’t make myself known to them by my name ‘Yahveh.’ 4I made a covenant with them to give them Canaan, where they were living as nomads. 5I’ve heard the Israelites’ groaning because the Egyptians are holding them in slavery, and I’ve remembered my covenant. 6Tell the Israelites, ‘I’ll take you out from under Egyptian bondage and redeem you with power and great acts of judgment. 7I’ll take you to be my people and be your God. You’ll know I’m the LORD your God who brought you out from under the burdens the Egyptians put on you. 8I’ll take you to the land I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’”

9Moses told the people, but they wouldn’t listen. They were beat down by the cruel slavery.

Ex 5:22-6:9

10The LORD said to Moses, 11“Go tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave his country.”

12But Moses said, “They haven’t listened to me. Why would Pharaoh listen to me? I’m not a good speaker.”

13The LORD gave Moses and Aaron a charge for Pharaoh and the people of Israel about getting the Israelites out of Egypt. 	Ex 6:10-13

14The Heads of Families

The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi

15The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohab, Jachin, Zohar—and Shaul, the son

of a Canaanite woman

16The sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, Merari. Levi lived

137 years.

17The sons of Gershon: Libni, Shimei

18The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.

19The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi

20Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed. She had Aaron and

Moses. Amram lived 137 years.

21The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri

22The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri

23Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of

Nahshon. She had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph

25Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of

Putiel. She had Phinehas.

26It was the same Aaron and Moses that the LORD told, “Take the Israelites out of Egypt according to their armies.” 27They were the ones that spoke to Pharaoh about taking them out.    	Ex 6:14-27

28That day the LORD told Moses, 29“I’m the LORD. Tell Pharaoh everything I tell you.”

30But Moses said, “I’m not a good speaker. How will he listen to me?”

Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Snake

7:1The LORD told him,

“I’m making you like God to him, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 2Say what I tell you, and Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let Israel leave his country. 3But I’ll harden his heart so I can multiply my signs and wonders. 4When he won’t listen to you, I’ll lay my hand on Egypt and take out my people with tremendous acts of judgment. 5The Egyptians will know I’m the LORD.”

6Moses and Aaron did what he said. 7Moses was 80 and Aaron was 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.	Ex 6:28-7:7

8The LORD told Moses and Aaron, 9“When Pharaoh says to work a miracle, throw down your staff, and it’ll become a snake.” 10They went to Pharaoh. Aaron threw down his staff for him and his officers to see, and it became a snake. 11Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. 12Each one threw down his staff, and it turned into a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up theirs. 13Pharaoh’s heart was still hardened, and he wouldn’t listen.         	 Ex 7:8-13

The Plague of Blood

14The LORD told Moses,

“Pharaoh is stubborn and refuses to let the people go. 15In the morning, go meet him on the bank of the Nile. Take the staff that turned into a snake 16and say, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews sent me, “Let my people go to serve me in the open country,” but you’ve ignored me. 17This is how you’ll know I’m the LORD: I’ll strike the water in the Nile with my staff, and it’ll turn to blood. 18The fish will die, and it’ll stink. The Egyptians won’t be able to drink it.”’”

19Then the LORD said to Moses,

“Have Aaron hold his staff out over the water in Egypt’s rivers, canals, pools, and reservoirs so it will turn to blood. There will be blood everywhere in Egypt, even in wood and stone containers.” 	Ex 7:14-19

20Moses and Aaron did that. He struck the water in the Nile with his staff for Pharaoh and his officers to see, and the water turned to blood. 21The fish in the Nile died, and it stunk. The Egyptians couldn’t drink it. There was blood everywhere in Egypt. 22But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he wouldn’t listen.

23Pharaoh returned to his palace without concerning himself with that either. 24The Egyptians dug along the Nile for water because they couldn’t drink the water in it. 25A week went by.	Ex 7:20-25

The Plague of Frogs

8:1The LORD said to Moses,

“Go tell Pharaoh the LORD says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you don’t, he’ll strike the whole country with frogs. 3The Nile will teem with them. They’ll come up into your house, your bedroom, your bed, your officials’ houses and on your people, in your ovens and kneading bowls. [4]’”

5Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to hold his staff out over the rivers, canals, and pools, and make frogs come up all over the ground.”  6Aaron held his hand out over the water, and frogs came up and covered the whole country. 7The magicians did the same thing with their magic, and made frogs come up on the ground everywhere in Egypt.   	 Ex 8:1-7

8Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, “Ask the LORD to take the frogs away; I’ll let the people go sacrifice to him.”

9Moses asked, “When should I ask for the frogs to leave you and your houses, and be only in the Nile?”

10“Tomorrow.”

“All right; so you can know there’s nobody like the LORD our God, 11the frogs will leave everywhere except in the Nile.”

12Moses left Pharaoh and called out to the LORD about the frogs. 13The LORD did what he asked; the frogs died in the houses, courts, and fields. 14They piled them up and the country reeked. 15When Pharaoh saw relief, he hardened his heart and wouldn’t listen. 	Ex 8:8-15

The Plague of Gnats

16The LORD told Moses, “Tell Aaron to strike the dust on the ground with his staff so it becomes gnats everywhere in Egypt.” 17He struck it, and it became gnats everywhere in Egypt. 18The magicians tried with their magic to bring gnats, but they couldn’t. There were gnats on people and animals. 19The magicians told Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh hardened his heart and wouldn’t listen.	Ex 8:16-19

The Plague of Flies

20The LORD told Moses,

“Get up early and present yourself to Pharaoh when he comes out to the water. Tell him the LORD says to let his people go so they can serve him. 21If you don’t, he’ll send swarms of flies on you, your officers, your people, and in your houses. They’ll infest the Egyptians’ houses and cover the ground. 22But he won’t send them on Goshen, where his people live. You’ll know he’s in the land. 23He’ll distinguish his people from yours tomorrow.’”

24The LORD did that. Huge swarms of insects were in Pharaoh’s palace and his officers’ houses. They covered the ground everywhere in Egypt. 25Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, “Go sacrifice to your God inside the country.” 	Ex 8:20-25

26But Moses said, “That won’t work. We’d be sacrificing to the LORD our God what’s detestable to Egyptians. Wouldn’t they stone us? 27We have to go a three-day’s journey into the open country and sacrifice to the LORD like he said.”

28Pharaoh said, “I’ll let you go so you can sacrifice to the LORD your God in the countryside. But you can’t go very far. Pray for me.”

29Moses said, “I’m leaving; I’ll pray to the LORD that the swarms of insects will leave tomorrow. But you must not lie again and not let the people go sacrifice to him.”

30Moses left and prayed to the LORD, 31and he took the swarms away completely. 32But Pharaoh hardened his heart that time too and wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 8:26-32

The Plague on Livestock

9:1The LORD told Moses,

“Go tell Pharaoh, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews says to let his people go so they can serve him. 2If you keep holding them, 3he’ll bring a severe plague on your livestock in the pasture—horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks. 4But he’ll distinguish Israel’s livestock from Egypt’s. Nothing will die that belongs to the Israelites.’”

5The LORD set a time, “I’ll do that in the country tomorrow.” 6The next day he did it. Livestock in Egypt died, but none of the Israelites’ livestock died. 7Pharaoh sent to find out that not a one of the Israelites’ livestock died, but he hardened his heart and wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 9:1-7

The Plague of Boils

8The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

“Take handfuls of ashes out of a kiln and throw them up in the air in front of Pharaoh. 9They’ll become fine dust all over Egypt, and make boils break out with sores on people and animals everywhere in the country.”

10They took ashes out of a kiln and stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses threw them up in the air, and they made boils break out in sores on people and animals. 11The magicians couldn’t withstand Moses because of the boils. They came on the magicians as well as all the Egyptians. 12The LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t listen.       	Ex 9:8-12

The Plague of Hail

13The LORD told Moses,

“Get up early, present yourselves to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘The LORD God of the Hebrews says, “Let my people go so they can serve me. 14This time I’ll send my plagues on you, your officers, and your people so you can know there’s nobody on earth like me. 15If I’d struck you and your people with a deadly plague, you wouldn’t be here 16 to see my power and to make myself known all over the world. 17You still rise up against my people and won’t let them go. 18About this time tomorrow, I’ll send heavy hail beyond anything Egypt has ever had. 19Bring inside whatever livestock you have in the pasture. People and animals will die that are not inside.”’”

20Pharaoh’s officers that respected the LORD made their servants and livestock get under shelter. 21Those who didn’t pay attention left them out in the open. 	  Ex 9:13-21

22The LORD told Moses, “Hold your hand toward the sky so hail will fall on the people, animals, and plants out in the open everywhere in Egypt.” 23He pointed his staff at the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the ground. 24There was really severe hail and lightning flashing continually in the hail, like nothing that had ever happened in Egypt since it became a nation. 25The hail struck everything that was out in the open everywhere in Egypt—people, animals, plants in the field, and shattered the trees. 26Only in Goshen, where the Israelites lived, there wasn’t any hail.           	Ex 9:22-26

27Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, “I’ve sinned this time. The LORD is right; my people and I are wrong. 28Pray to him. We’ve had enough of his thunder and hail. I’ll let you go for good.”

29Moses told him,

“As soon as I leave the city, I’ll spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder and hail will stop, and you’ll know the world belongs to the LORD. 30But I’m sure you and your officers still won’t respect him.”

31(The hail ruined the flax and barley crops because the barley had headed out and the flax had budded. 32It didn’t ruin the wheat and spelt, which ripen later.) 33Moses left Pharaoh and the city and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder, hail, and rain quit pouring down. 34When Pharaoh saw it stop, he and his officers sinned again and hardened their hearts. 35He wouldn’t let the people go.	Ex 9:27-35

The Plague of Locusts

10:1Then the LORD told Moses,

“Go to Pharaoh; I’ve hardened his and his officers’ hearts so I can perform these signs among them 2and you can tell your sons and grandsons how I mocked the Egyptians with my signs, and so you can know I’m the LORD.”

3Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh,

“The LORD God of the Hebrews says, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself toward me? Let my people go so they can serve me. 4If you don’t, I’ll bring locusts to your realm tomorrow. 5They’ll cover the ground so thick you can’t see it. They’ll eat what the hail didn’t ruin, every tree that sprouts in your field. 6Your houses, your officers’ houses, every Egyptian’s house will be full of them—something your fathers and grandfathers have never seen.’”

He turned and left. 7Pharaoh’s officials said, “How long will that man hold us hostage? Let the men go so they can serve the LORD their God. Can’t you see that Egypt’s destroyed?”

8Pharaoh brought Moses and Aaron back, “Go serve the LORD your God! Who are going?”

9Moses said, “We’ll all go with our flocks and herds to hold a festival to the LORD.”

10-11Pharaoh said, “Oh, no! The LORD help you if I ever let you and your little ones go! Don’t tempt me; you have ulterior motives. The men among you can go serve the LORD. That’s what you’ve been asking for.”

Pharaoh drove them out. 	Ex 10:1-11

12Then the LORD told Moses, “Hold your hand out over Egypt; locusts will come up on the land and eat the plants the hail left.” 13He held his staff out over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow all that day and night. In the morning, it brought the locusts, 14and they landed everywhere. There had never been so many, and there never would be again. 15They covered the ground till it was black. They ate every plant and fruit tree the hail had left. There wasn’t anything green on the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt.

16Pharaoh hurried and called for Moses and Aaron, “I’ve sinned against you and the LORD your God. 17Forgive me just this once and pray to him to remove this death from me.”

18Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. 19He shifted the wind to a strong west wind that blew the locusts into the Red Sea. Not a one was left in Egypt. 20But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let the people go. 	Ex 10:12-20

The Plague of Darkness

21Then he told Moses, “Lift your hand toward the sky; it’ll be so dark you can feel it.” 22Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and a dense darkness covered Egypt for three days. 23People couldn’t see each other, it was so dark. Nobody got up from where they were for three days, but the Israelites had light in their houses.

24Pharaoh called to Moses, “Go serve the LORD. Just leave your flocks and herds here. Even your little ones can go with you.”

25But Moses said,

“You need to let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to the LORD our God.  26Our livestock has to go with us. Not a hoof will stay here. We’ll take some of them to serve the LORD. We don’t know what we’ll serve him with till we get there.”

27But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go. 28He told Moses, “Get out of here! I’m warning you, don’t ever see me again. The day you do you’ll die!”

29“You’re right. I’ll never see you again.”	Ex 10:21-29

Plague on the Firstborn

11:1The LORD told Moses,

“I’m going to bring one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he’ll let you go. When he does, he’ll drive you out completely. 2Tell each man and woman to ask their neighbors for silver and gold articles.”

3The LORD gave the Egyptians a favorable attitude toward the people. Furthermore, Pharaoh’s officers and the people in general respected Moses a lot.  	Ex 11:1-3

4Moses said, “The LORD says, ‘About midnight I’ll go out into Egypt, 5and all firstborn will die—the firstborn of Pharaoh on his throne, the firstborn of the slave girl behind the millstones, the firstborn among the livestock. 6There’ll be such an outcry everywhere in Egypt as has never been heard or will be. 7But among the Israelites, not even a dog will bark at people or animals. You’llsg see how the LORD distinguishes Israel from Egypt.

8‘Yoursg officials will come and bow to me and say, “Leave, you and your people.” Then I’ll leave.’”

He left Pharaoh really mad.

9The LORD told Moses, “Pharaoh won’t listen; so I’ll multiply my wonders in Egypt.” 10Moses and Aaron performed those wonders for him, but the LORD hardened his heart, and he wouldn’t let the people go.	 Ex 11:4-10

The Passover Instituted

12:1The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

2“This month will be the first month of your year. 3Tell the assembly of Israel that on the tenth of this month, each family is to take a lamb according to their families. 4If a family is too small for a lamb, that family and a nearby neighbor can take a lamb the size the number of people can eat. 5It needs to be an unblemished male a year old. Take it from the sheep or goats. 6Keep it till the fourteenth of the month.

“The whole community is to kill it in the evening. 7Put some of its blood on the doorposts and lintel of the house where you eat it. 8Eat the meat that same night, roasted with fire. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 9Don’t eat any of it raw or boiled. Roast the head, legs, and entrails. 10In the morning, burn what’s left over. 11Eat it in a hurry, dressed, with sandals on your feet and staff in hand. It’s the LORD’s Passover. 12I’ll go all over Egypt that night and strike down the firstborn people and animals. I’ll execute judgment on Egypt’s gods. I’m the LORD. 13The blood on your houses will be a sign. When I see it, I’ll ‘pass over’ you. No plague will fall on you when I strike Egypt.  	Ex 12:1-13

14“Today will serve as a memorial day for you. Celebrate it as a festival to the LORD, a permanent ordinance. 15Eat bread without yeast for a week. On the first day, take the yeast out of your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first till seventh day will be excluded from Israel. 16On the first day, hold a holy assembly. On the seventh day, hold another one. Don’t work on those days except for what needs to be eaten by each person that only you can fix. 17Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread throughout your generations; that’s the day I brought your hosts out of Egypt. 18In the first month, eat bread without yeast from the fourteenth in the evening till the twenty-first in the evening. 19For a week, no yeast can be in your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it will be excluded from the community of Israel, foreign or native. 20Eat bread without yeast in all your houses.” 	Ex 12:14-20

21Moses called Israel’s elders,

“Butcher a Passover lamb for each family. 22Dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that’s in the basin and apply it to the lintel and doorposts. Don’t anyone go outside till morning. 23The LORD will pass through to strike down the Egyptians. When he sees the blood on the lintel and doorposts, he’ll pass over and not let the destroyer come in to strike you. [24] 25When you go into the land the LORD gives you, observe this rite. 26When your children ask you what it means, 27tell them it’s a Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who “passed over” the Israelites’ houses when he struck the Egyptians.”

The people bowed low in worship 28and did what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.

Ex 12:21-28

29At midnight the LORD struck the firstborn in Egypt—the firstborn of Pharaoh on the throne, the firstborn of captives in the dungeon, the firstborn livestock. 30Pharaoh, his officers, and all the Egyptians got up during the night. There was a great outcry in Egypt; every home had someone die.

The Exodus

31He called for Moses and Aaron during the night,

“Get up! Get away from my people, you and the Israelites! Go worship the LORD like you’ve said. 32Take your flocks and herds. Go and bless me too.”

33The Egyptians urged the people to leave right away, “We’ll all be dead!”

34The people took their dough before it had yeast put in it, together with their kneading bowls tied up in the cloaks on their shoulders. 35The Israelites had done what Moses said and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold articles, and for clothes. 36The LORD had given the Egyptians a favorable attitude toward them, so they let them have what they asked for. That’s how they “plundered” the Egyptians.	 Ex 12:29-36

37The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot plus women and children. 38A mixed crowd of non-Israelites went with them along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. 39The dough they brought out of Egypt they baked into flat cakes of bread without yeast. It had no yeast in it because they were driven out and couldn’t delay. They hadn’t prepared supplies.

40The Israelites lived in Egypt 430 years. 41At the end of 430 years to the day, the hosts of the LORD left Egypt. 42It’s a night Israelites observe to him throughout their generations for bringing them out of Egypt.	Ex 12:37-42

Instructions for Passover

43The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

“This is the ordinance about the Passover: no foreigner can eat it, 44but every man’s slave purchased with money can eat it after you’ve circumcised him. 45No hired hand can eat it. 46Eat it in a single house. Don’t take any of the meat out of the house or break any of its bones. 47The whole community of Israel is to celebrate it. 48If a foreigner that lives with you wants to celebrate it, all the males that belong to him need to be circumcised. Then he can come to celebrate it. He’ll become a citizen of the country, but no uncircumcised person can eat it. 49The same law applies to a native and foreigner among you.”

50The Israelites did what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron. 51That same day, he brought them out of Egypt.	Ex 12:43-51

Dedication of the Firstborn

13:1The LORD told Moses, 2“Set aside every firstborn human and animal.”

3Moses told the people,

“Think back to today to when you came out of slavery in Egypt. With a strong hand the LORD took you out of here. Don’t eat anything with yeast in it. 4Today in the month Abib, you’re about to leave. 5When the LORD takes you to the territory of the Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Hivite, and Jebusite—the land he swore to your ancestors he’d give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—observe this rite in this month. 6Eat bread without yeast for a week. The seventh day, observe a feast to the LORD. 7Don’t have anything with yeast in it among you or in your territory. 8Tell your son that day, ‘It’s because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9It will serve as a sign to you on your hand, a reminder on your forehead, that the Law of the LORD may be in your mouth, because he brought you out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 10Keep this ordinance every year at its scheduled time.   	Ex 13:1-10

11“When the LORD takes you to the territory of the Canaanites, 12devote to him every woman’s male firstborn and the first male firstborn male of every animal you own. They belong to himY. 13But use a lamb to redeem every firstborn donkey. If you don’t redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn son.

14“When your son asks what this means, tell him, ‘With a great demonstration of power, the LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt. 15When Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, the LORD killed every firstborn male of people and animals in Egypt; so I sacrifice the firstborn males to the LORD, but I redeem every firstborn son.’ 16It will serve as a reminder on your hand and bands on your forehead that the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a tremendous demonstration of power.”	 Ex 13:11-16

Crossing the Sea

17When Pharaoh did let the people go, God didn’t lead them on the road toward the Philistines, even though it was closer. He said, “They may change their minds when they see war, and head back to Egypt.” 18He led them through open country to the Red Sea, and they went up in martial array from Egypt. 19Moses took Joseph’s bones with him because he’d made the Israelites solemnly swear, “It’s certain that God take care of you, so carry my bones with you when you leave.” 20They set out from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of open country. 21The LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud during the day, and in a pillar of fire at night to give them light. That way they could travel day or night. 22He never took away the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire.	Ex 13:17-22

14:1The LORD said to Moses,

2“Tell the Israelites to turn around and camp at Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea across from Baal-zephon. 3Pharaoh will say you’re wandering aimlessly; the open country has boxed you in. 4That’s how I’ll harden his heart, and he’ll chase you. He and his army will honor me, and the Egyptians will know I’m the LORD.”

That’s what they did.

5When the king found out they’d left, he and his officials changed their minds, “What have we done, letting them leave from serving us?” 6He got his chariot ready and took his troops: 7600 select chariots as well as all the rest of Egypt’s chariots and their officers. 8As the Israelites were leaving boldly, 9the Egyptians chased them with Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, cavalry, and troops. They caught up with them camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth across from Baal-zephon.     	Ex 14:1-9

10As Pharaoh got close, the Israelites saw the Egyptians marching after them. They panicked and cried out to the LORD. 11They asked Moses,

“Was it because there weren’t any graves in Egypt that you’ve brought us out to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt? 12Didn’t we tell you to just let us serve the Egyptians? It would’ve been better to serve them than die in the desert.”

13But Moses told them,

“Don’t be afraid! Stand by and watch the LORD deliver you. The Egyptians you see today you’ll never see again. 14He’ll fight for you while you just watch.” 	Ex 14:10-14

15Then the LORD told Moses,

“Why call out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. 16Lift up your staff and hold your hand out over the sea to separate it. The Israelites will go through it on dry seabed. 17I’ll harden the Egyptians’ hearts so they’ll go in after you; Pharaoh, his army, chariots, and cavalry. 18The Egyptians will know I’m the LORD when Pharaoh, his chariots, and cavalry honor me.”

19God’s angel that had been going ahead of Israel, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front to in back. 20The cloud and the darkness stood between the camps of Egypt and Israel; yet it gave light at night so they wouldn’t come close to each other all night.

Ex 14:15-20

21Then Moses held his hand out over the sea, and the LORD pushed it back with a strong east wind all night. He separated the water and dried up the seabed. 22The Israelites went through the sea on dry seabed with the water like a wall on their left and right. 23 Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went in after them. 24Just before dawn, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud and threw them into confusion. 25He made their chariot wheels wobble so they were hard to drive. The Egyptians shouted, “Retreat! The LORD’s fighting for Israel!”   	Ex 14:21-25

26The LORD told Moses, “Hold your hand out over the sea so the water will wash back over the Egyptians, their chariots, and cavalry.” 27The sea washed back to its normal position at daybreak while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it. He overthrew them in the sea. 28The water washed back over the chariots and cavalry. Not a one in Pharaoh’s entire army remained who followed the Israelites into the sea. [29] 30Israel saw them dead on the shore. 31When they saw the great power the LORD had used against the Egyptians, they feared him and trusted him and Moses.         	Ex 14:26-31

Moses’ Song of Triumph

15:1Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:

“I’ll sing to the LORD because he’s triumphed gloriously;

he’s thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.

2The LORD is my strength and song;

he is my salvation.

He’s my God, and I’ll praise him,

my ancestors’ God, and I’ll honor him.

3He’s a soldier;

his name is the LORD.

4He has thrown Pharaoh’s chariots and army into the Red Sea;

his elite officers have drowned.

5The depths covered them;

they sank like rocks.

6Your right hand, LORD, was majestic in its power;

it shattered the enemy.

7In your extreme excellence, you overthrew your opponents.

You sent out your burning anger

that consumed them like chaff.

8At the blast of your nostrils, the water piled up;

liquid water stood in a heap;

the depths of the sea congealed.

9The enemy said, ‘I’ll pursue,

I’ll overtake, I’ll divide up spoil;

I’ll satisfy my desire against them;

I’ll draw out my sword and destroy them.’

10You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;

they sank like lead in deep water.

11Who is like you, majestic in holiness,

awesome in praises, working wonders?

12You reached out your hand,

and the earth swallowed them.

13In your kindness you led the people you redeemed;

in your strength you guided them to your sacred abode.

14The nations have heard and tremble;

anguish has gripped the people in Philistia.

15The chiefs in Edom are scared;

the leaders in Moab tremble;

the people in Canaan melt away.

16Panic and dread have fallen on them;

by your great power they’re as still as stone,

until your people pass over,

until the people pass over that you’ve bought out.

17You’ll take them and plant them in the mountain

in your permanent possession,

where you’ve made yourself a place to live.

18The LORD will reign forever.”	  		                    Ex 15:1-18

19Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, and the LORD washed the water back over them; but the Israelites walked through on dry seabed. 20Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine and went out with the women with tambourines and dancing.

21She lined out a song to them,

“Sing to the LORD because he has triumphed gloriously;

he threw the horse and its rider into the sea.”	Ex 15:19-21

22Moses led the Israelites from the Red Sea to the Wilderness of Shur. They traveled three days without finding water. 23When they got to Marah, the water was too “brackish” to drink. That’s why it was called Marah. 24The people complained to Moses, “What are we going to drink?” 25He called out to the LORD, and he showed him a tree. Moses threw it in the water and made it drinkable. The LORD made a statute and regulation to test them.

26“If you sincerely pay attention to me, do what I consider right, listen to my commandments, and keep my statutes, I won’t put any disease on you that I put on the Egyptians, because I’m your healer.”

27They came to Elim with its 12 springs and 70 date palms, and camped there beside the water.

Ex 15:22-27

Manna and Quail

16:1The fifteenth day, second month after they left Egypt, they went from Elim to the Wilderness of Sin, between Elim and Sinai, 2They criticized Moses and Aaron in the desert, 3“If only the LORD had killed us in Egypt when we sat by pots of meat and ate bread till we were full. You’ve brought us out to this empty place to starve to death.” 	Ex 16:1-3

4The LORD told Moses,

“I’ll rain bread from the sky, and they can go out each day and pick up a day’s supply. That will test whether they’ll follow my law: 5On the sixth day, they’ll prepare twice as much as on other days.”

6Moses and Aaron told them,

“In the evening you’ll know the LORD brought you out of Egypt. 7In the morning you’ll see his glory. He hears you complaining about him. Why are you complaining to us? 8The LORD will give you bread in the morning and meat in the evening. You’re complaining to him more than to us.”

9Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community to come into the LORD’s presence; he’s heard their complaining.” 10As Aaron spoke to them, they looked toward the open country, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 11He told Moses, 12“I’ve heard them complaining. Tell them they’ll eat their fill of bread in the morning and meat in the evening. They’ll know I’m the LORD their God.”          	          	              			          		          Ex 16:4-12

13That evening quail came and covered the camp. In the morning, there was a coating of dew around the camp. 14When it evaporated, a fine flakey residue like frost lay all over the countryside. 15When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another what it was.

Moses told them,

“It’s the bread the LORD has given you to eat. 16He has commanded everyone to gather as much as they’ll eat, .11 bushel 1 omer for each one in their tent.”

17Some gathered a lot, some a little. 18When they measured it with .11 bushel 1 omer, the ones that had gathered a lot didn’t have any left over. The ones that had gathered a little had enough. Everybody gathered enough to eat. 19Moses told them not to leave any of it till morning. 20But some did, and it bred maggots and spoiled. Moses was mad at them. 21They gathered it each morning. When the sun got hot, it evaporated. 	Ex 16:13-21

22On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much, .22 bushel 2 omers apiece. When the leaders of the community came and told Moses, 23he said,

“The LORD said, ‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath observance, a holy Sabbath to me. Bake what you’ll bake and boil what you’ll boil. What’s left over set aside till morning.’”

24They did that, and it didn’t spoil or breed maggots.

25Moses said, “Eat it today; it’s a Sabbath to the LORD. 26Gather it six days; there won’t be any the seventh day.”

27Some people did go out anyway, but they didn’t find any.

28“How long will you refuse to follow my instructions? 29The LORD gave you the Sabbath; he’ll provide bread for two days on the sixth day. Stay home the seventh day.”

30The people rested that day. 		Ex 16:22-30

31Israel called it manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like honey-flavored wafers. 32-33Moses told Aaron,

“The LORD has said to keep .11 bushel 1 omer of it in a jar so later generations can see what he fed us in the desert. Set it in front of the LORD.”

34Aaron put it in front of the Testimony. 35The Israelites ate it for 40 years, till they came to the border of Canaan, where people lived. (36An omer is .11 bushels .1 ephah.)	Ex 16:31-36

Water from the Rock

17:1Then the LORD told the community to travel from the Wilderness of Sin and camp at Rephidim. They didn’t have any water and 2complained to Moses, “Give us some water.”

“Why are you complaining to me and testing the LORD?”

3But they were thirsty, “Why bring us up from Egypt to let us, our little ones, and our livestock die from thirst?”

4Moses called out to the LORD, “What am I going to do with them? They’re about ready to stone me.”

5“Go stand in front of them. Take some of the elders and the staff you used to strike the Nile. 6I’ll stand in front of you on the rock at Horeb/Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for them to drink.”

Moses did that. 7He named the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites “quarreled” with him and put the LORD on trial, “Is the LORD among us or not?”	 Ex 17:1-7

Defeating the Amalekites

8Amalek came to attack Israel at Rephidim, 9so Moses told Joshua, “Choose men and go fight Amalek. Tomorrow, I’ll station myself on the hill with God’s staff in my hand.” 10Joshua did that; Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; when he let it come down, Amalek prevailed. 12But his hands got heavy; so they put a boulder under him to sit on; Aaron and Hur supported his hands. His hands were steady till sundown. 13Joshua outfought Amalek and his people with the sword.

14Then the LORD told Moses, “Write this in a scroll to remember. Tell Joshua I’ll completely wipe out the memory of Amalek.” 15Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner [Yahveh-nissi]. 16He said, “The LORD has sworn he’ll be at war with Amalek endlessly.”	Ex 17:8-16

Jethro Visits Moses

18:1Jethro/Reuel, priest in Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard what all God had done for Moses and his people in bringing them out of Egypt. 2He’d taken Moses’ wife Zipporah after Moses sent her away 3with her two sons Gershom (because he said, “I’ve been a ‘foreigner’ in a foreign land”) 4and Eliezer (because he said, “My father’s ‘God helped’ me and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword”). 5-6Jethro/Reuel came to Moses with his wife and two sons, where Moses camped at the mountain of God. He sent word that he was bringing them. 7Moses went out to meet him, bowed and kissed him. They asked each other how they were doing and went into the tent. 8Moses told him what all the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, the hardships they’d had on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them. 9Jethro/Reuel was overjoyed at the LORD’s goodness to Israel. 10He said,

“Bless the LORD that delivered you from Pharaoh and the Egyptians’ control. 11Now I know he’s greater than all other gods. He proved it when they dealt arrogantly against the people.”

12Jethro/Reuel brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with the elders to eat a meal with him in God’s presence. 	     				        	        Ex 18:1-12

13The next day Moses sat judging the people. They stood around him from morning till evening. 14When Jethro/Reuel saw what he was doing, he asked,

“What are you doing? Why sit to judge so many people by yourself from morning to evening?”

15“They come to me to ask God. 16When they have a dispute, I decide between them and teach them God’s laws and statues.”

17“That’s not good. 18You and the people will both wear out. Your job’s too big. 19Here’s some advice and God be with you. Be the people’s representative to God and bring the disputes to him. 20Then teach them the laws and statutes, how they’re supposed to act and what they’re supposed to do. 21Select capable men that respect God, truthful men that hate dishonest gain. Make them leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 22Let them judge lesser matters. They can bring major disputes to you. It’ll be easier on you; they’ll help you bear the burden. 23If you do that—and God agrees—you’ll hold up under the work, and the people will go home satisfied.”

24Moses took his advice 25and chose capable men to lead thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 26They judged on a regular basis and dealt with smaller issues. More difficult disputes they took to Moses. 27Moses said goodbye to Jethro/Reuel, and he went back home. 	Ex 18:13-27

At Mount Sinai

19:1The same day of the third month after Israel left Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. 2They’d set out from Rephidim and came to camp at the mountain. 3Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain,

“Tell Jacob’s house, 4‘You’vepl seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me. 5If you’ll obey me and keep my covenant, you’ll be my special possession among the nations. The whole world belongs to me, 6but you’ll be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.’”	 Ex 19:1-6

7Moses called the elders and told them. 8They answered together, “We’ll do everything the LORD said.” Moses went back to tell him.

9He told Moses, “I’ll come to you in a dark cloud so the people can hear when I speak to you and believe in you permanently.

10“Go consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 11and be ready on the third day. That day I’ll come down on Mount Sinai where they can see. 12Set upf boundaries and say, ‘Don’t go up on the mountain or touch it. Executef whoever touches it. 13Don’t touchf them; stonef them or shootf them. Human or animal won’t live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, the people are to come to the mountain.”

14Moses came down from the mountain, consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 15He told them to be ready the third day and not to have relations with women. 	Ex 19:7-15

16The third morning, thunder and lightning came. A dark cloud came over the mountain accompanied by a loud bugle blast. The people in the camp trembled. 17Moses brought them out of the camp to meet God at the foot of the mountain. 18Smoke covered Mount Sinai because the LORD came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. 19When the bugle blast got louder and louder, Moses spoke to God, and he answered him with thunder. 20He came down on Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the top of it.

21“Go down and warn the people not to break through to stare and many of them perish. 22Have the priests that come near to me consecrate themselves so I don’t flare out against them.”

23Moses told the LORD, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, because you warned us to set boundaries around it and consecrate it.”

24The LORD said, “Go down and bring Aaron up. Don’t let the priests or the people break through to come up to me, or I’ll flare out against them.”

25Moses went down and told them.	Ex 19:16-25

The Ten Commandments

20:1Then God spoke,

2I am the LORD your God who brought you out of slavery in Egypt.

3Do not havef any god but me.

4Do not makef any carved image, any likeness of what is in the sky, on the ground, or in the water 5to worship or serve. I am an exclusive God. I visit the consequences of parents’ sins on their descendants for three or four generations that hate me. 6I am kind to thousands who love me and obey me.	 Ex 20:1-6

7Do not usef my name LORD as a byword. I will punish whoever does that.

8Remember to set the Sabbath day aside. 9Workf six days, 10but on the seventh day rest to me, the LORD your God. Do not workf that day—you, your son or daughter, male or female servant, livestock, or foreigner living among you. 11In six days I made earth and sky, the ocean and everything in them, and rested the seventh day. I have blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.

12Honor your parents so you will live a long time in the land I give you.

13Do not commit murderf.

14Do not commit adulteryf.

15Do not stealf.

16Do not lief about other people.

17Do not covetf someone else’s house, his wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey—anything that is his.”	 Ex 20:7-17

18When people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the bugle sound and smoking mountain, they trembled and stood back a long way. 19They told Moses, “You speak to us, and we’ll listen. Don’t have God speak to us—so we won’t die.” 20Moses told them, “Don’t be afraid. God has come to test you, to make you respect him and not sin.” 21They stood a long way off while Moses approached the dark cloud where God was.	 Ex 20:18-21

The Proper Use of Altars

22The LORD told him to tell Israel,

“You’ve seen that I’ve spoken to you from the sky. 23Don’t makef other gods, silver or gold. 24Makef an altar out of dirt for me for sacrificing your burnt offerings, peace offerings, sheep and cattle. Everywhere I make my name remembered, I’ll come to you and bless you. 25If you build a stone altar for me, don’t buildf it with cut stones. You’ll desecrate it if you use a tool on it. 26Don’t climbf steps to my altar so you won’t show your nakedness on it.	 Ex 20:22-26

Laws About Slaves

21:1“Present these ordinances to the people.

2“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he’ll serve six years and go free on the seventh without pay. 3If he came alone, he’ll go out alone. If he has a wife, they’ll go out together. 4If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and the slave will go out alone. 5But if the slave says he loves his master, his wife and children, and won’t leave them to be a free man, 6his master is to take him to the judges—to the door or doorpost—and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he’ll serve him permanently.  	Ex 21:1-6

7“If a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she’s not to go free as the male slaves do. 8If she’s not pleasing to her master who designated her for himself, he is to let her be bought back. He can’t sell her to a foreigner; he’d be treating her unfairly. 10If he marries another woman, he can’t reduce her food, clothing, or conjugal rights. 11If he won’t do these things for her, she’ll go out without being paid for. 9If he designates her for his son, he is to treat her like a daughter.  	Ex 21:7-11

12“Execute anyone that assaults and kills someone. 13If it was an accident, I’ll designate a safe place the slayer can flee to. 14But take even from the horns of my altar anyone that does premeditated murder.

15“Executef anybody that hits father or mother.

16“Executef kidnappers whether they hold in possession or sell the one they kidnapped.

17“Executef anybody that cusses at father or mother.	 Ex 21:12-17

18“If men are fighting and one strikes the other with a stone or his fist and he doesn’t die, but is laid up, 19if he gets up and walks around outside with his staff, then don’t punishf the one that hit him. He’ll pay for the man’s loss of time and take care of him till he fully recovers.

20“If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies, punish him. 21If the slave survives a day or so, there’s no punishment; he’s his property.

22“If men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she miscarries without further injury, fine him as her husband requires and the judges determine. 23But if there’s further harm, punishf life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

Ex 21:18-25

26“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he’ll free the slave for the eye. 27If he knocks out his male or female slave’s tooth, he’ll free the slave for the tooth.

28“If an ox gores a man or woman to death, stone it, don’t eat it, and don’t punish the owner. 29But if it has gored before and its owner knew it and didn’t pen it up, if it kills somebody, stone the ox and execute the owner. 30If a ransom is demanded from him, he’ll give whatever the relatives demand for loss of life. 31If it gores a son or daughter, the same rule applies. 32If it gores a male or female slave, the owner has to give the slave’s master 12 oz 30 shekels of silver. Stone the ox.

Ex 21:26-32

Laws About Restitution

33“If someone digs a pit without covering it up and an ox or donkey falls in it, 34the pit’s owner has to pay the animal’s owner for the loss, and the dead animal becomes his.

35“If one man’s ox kills another man’s ox, sell the live ox, divide the sale price, and divide the dead ox between them. 36If it was previously known to gore and its owner didn’t pen it up, the owner will pay ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.	 Ex 21:33-36

22:1“If someone steals a cow or sheep, slaughters it or sells it, he has to pay five cows for one cow and four sheep for one sheep. 3bIf he doesn’t have anything, sell the thief for the theft. 4If what was stolen is found alive in the thief’s possession—cow, donkey, or sheep—the thief will pay double.

2If a thief gets caught breaking in at night and is struck and dies, the slayer won’t be held guilty of murder.  3aIf the theft happens during the day, the slayer will be guilty of murder.

5“If you overgraze a field or vineyard and let an animal loose that grazes in someone else’s field, you’ll pay compensation from the best of your own field and vineyard.

6“If your fire gets away from you and spreads to someone else’s thorn bushes, stacked grain, standing grain, or field, you’ll pay for damages.	 Ex 22:1-6

7“If you give someone money or goods for safekeeping, and it’s stolen from that person’s house, if caught, the thief will pay double. 8If no thief is caught, the judges will investigate if the other person took it.

9“For any breach of trust—for cow, donkey, sheep, clothing, or anything else a person owns—both parties will go to the judges. The one the judges find guilty will pay double to the other.

10“If you give someone a donkey, cow, sheep, or other animal for safekeeping and it dies, gets hurt, or wanders off unnoticed, 11the two of you will swear in the LORD’s presence that neither has taken it. You’ll accept the judge’s verdict, no compensation required. 12But if it was stolen, the thief will pay its owner for it. 13If wild animals got it, the remains are evidence, no compensation required.    	Ex 22:7-13

14“If you borrow something that gets injured or dies while its owner’s absent, you’ll make full compensation. 15If its owner’s present, you won’t make compensation. If you rented it, it came for the rent.

Laws About Social Justice

16“If a man seduces a virgin that’s not engaged and lies with her, he has to pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 17If her father refuses to give her to him, he’ll still pay money equal to the dowry for virgins.

18“Don’t let a sorceress live.

19“Execute whoever has sexual relations with an animal.

20“Execute whoever sacrifices to any god but the LORD.

21“Don’t wrong or mistreat a foreigner; you were foreigners in Egypt.

Ex 22:14-21

22“Don’t abuse a widow or orphan in any way. 23If you do and the person cries out to me, 24my anger will flare. I’ll kill you with the sword and make yoursg wives widows and your children orphans.

25“If you lend money to the poor among my people, don’t charge interest.

26If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, give it back before sundown. 27That may be the only covering your neighbor has to sleep in. When your neighbor cries out to me, I’ll listen because I’m gracious.

28“Don’t curse God or a ruler of your people.

29“Don’t put off giving your offerings from your crops or vintage.

“Give me your firstborn sons. 30Do the same with your cattle and sheep. After it’s with its mother for a week, give it to me on the eighth day.

31“You’ll be holy people to me; so don’t eat any animal torn to pieces in the pasture by wild animals. Feed it to the dogs. 	Ex 22:22-31

23:1“Don’t pass on false rumors, join sinners in giving malicious testimony, 2or follow the crowd in doing something bad. In a dispute, don’t join other people to pervert justice. 3Don’t be partial toward a poor person in a dispute.

4“If you run onto your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering around, return it. 5If you see a donkey that belongs to someone that hates you lying helpless under its load, free it.			 Ex 23:1-5

6“Don’t pervert justice for your needy neighbor in a dispute.

7“Avoid making false charges. Don’t execute an innocent or good person. I won’t acquit you.

8“Don’t take a bribe; it blinds the clear-sighted and undercuts what good people are trying to do.

9“Don’t oppress a foreigner; you know what it’s like to be one; you were foreigners in Egypt.

Laws About Sabbaths and Festivals

10“Plant and harvest your ground for six years. 11Let it lie fallow the seventh year so the needy among your people can eat what grows volunteer. Whatever they leave, the wild animals can have. Do the same thing with your vineyard and olive trees.

12“Work six days. On the seventh, stop working so your ox and donkey can rest, so the son of your female slave and the foreigner that’s with you can refresh themselves. 13Pay attention to everything I’ve told you.

“Don’t even say the names of other gods.	 Ex 23:6-13

14“Celebrate three festivals to me each year. 15Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. Eat bread without yeast for a week at the scheduled time in the month Abib, the month you came out of Egypt. Nobody is to come to me empty-handed. 16Observe the Festival of the Harvest, the first part of the harvest from what you sow. Observe the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year at harvest time. 17Three times a year all males are to appear in front of the Lord GOD.

18“Don’t offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast. The fat from my feast is not to remain till morning. 19Bring the best of the first harvest from your ground to the house of the LORD your God.

“Don’t boil a kid in its mother’s milk.	 Ex 23:14-19

Conquest of Canaan Promised

20“I’ll send an angel to take you safely to the place I’ve designated. 21Be sure to obey him. He won’t pardon your sins because he wears my name. 22If you sincerely obey him in everything I say, I’ll be an enemy to your enemies, an adversary to your adversaries. 23My angel will take you to the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Canaanite, Hivite, and Jebusite; and I’ll destroy them.	 Ex 23:20-23

24“Don’t worship and serve other gods or do what they do. Overthrow them completely and break their sacred pillars to pieces. 25Serve the LORD your God, and he’ll bless your bread and water, and keep you from getting sick. 26There won’t be any miscarriages or barrenness in your country, and you’ll have long lives. 27I’ll spread fear in front of you, and throw into confusion the people you invade, and make your enemies flee. 28I’ll send hornets ahead of you to drive out the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites. 29I won’t drive them out in a single year; the land would grow wild and wild animals would take over. 30I’ll drive them out little by little till you gain possession of it all and make it productive.

31“I’ll set your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea beside the Philistines, from the desert to the River Euphrates. I’ll deliver the people to you to drive out. 32Don’t make any treaty with them or their gods. 33Don’t let them live in your country and end up making you sin against me. If you serve their gods, they’ll be a snare to you.” 	Ex 23:24-33

The Covenant Confirmed

24:1Then the LORD told Moses, “Come up to me and worship at a distance—you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders. 2Yousg alone will approach me; the others and the community can’t approach me.”

3Moses recounted to the people the LORD’s ordinances, and they answered together, “We’ll do what he’s said.”

4Moses wrote them down. Then he got up early and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with 12 pillars for the 12 tribes. 5He sent young men to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as peace offerings. 6Moses put half of the blood in basins and sprinkled the other half on the altar. 7He read the covenant to the people. They said, “We’ll do what the LORD has said.” 8Moses sprinkled the blood on them, “This is the blood of the covenant the LORD has made with you.”       				Ex 24:1-8

9Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders; 10and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what looked like an expanse of sapphire as clear as the sky. 11Yet he didn’t reach out against the nobles of Israel; they looked at him and ate and drank.

12The LORD told Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here. I’ll give you the stone tablets with the Law I’ve commanded and written to instruct them.” 13Moses and Joshua his assistant went up on the mountain of God. 14But he told the elders, “Wait here till we get back. Aaron and Hur are with you. If anybody has a legal problem, go to them.” 15Then he went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered it. 16The LORD’s brightness rested on Mount Sinai for six days. On the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the cloud. 17To the people of Israel the LORD’s brightness looked like a flagrant fire on the mountain. 18Moses went into the cloud as he climbed the mountain and was there for 40 days. 	Ex 24:9-18

Contributions for the Tabernacle

25:1The LORD said to him,

2“Tell the Israelites to take up an offering for me as their hearts move them: 3gold, silver, and bronze; 4blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen, goat hair, 5rams’ skins dyed red, dolphin skins, acacia wood, 6olive oil for lighting, spices for anointing oil and fragrant incense, 7onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and pouch.  8Have them build a sanctuary so I can live among them. 9Build the Tabernacle and its furniture like I show you.

That makes 6 branches coming out of the lampstand. 36The whole thing will be one piece of hammered pure gold. 37Make its lamps so they shine forward. 38Its snuffers and their trays will be pure gold. 39Make it from 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold, with all its utensils. 40Be sure to make them in the design I showed you on the mountain.

The Priestly Garments

28:1“From the Israelites, have your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar come to you to serve as priests. 2Make holy vestments for Aaron, glorious and beautiful. 3Talk to skilled artisans that I’ve given wisdom for making them and consecrate them for performing service to me. 4Make these vestments for Aaron and his sons: a pouch, ephod, robe, tunic made out of checkered work, a turban, and a sash. 5The artisans are to use gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and fine linen.	 Ex 28:1-5

6“They’re to make the ephod out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 7It will have 2 shoulder pieces joined to its 2 ends. 8The skillfully woven band on it will have the same design and material. 9Take 2 onyx stones and engrave the names of Israel’s sons on them, 106 per stone in their birth order. 11Like a jeweler engraves a signet, engrave the 2 stones with their names, and set them in delicate gold settings. 12Put the 2 stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod. Aaron will carry them on his two shoulders as a memorial of the people of Israel. 13Make delicate gold settings 14and 2 pure gold chains. Make them out of twined cordage and put the corded chains on the delicate settings.  	 Ex 28:6-14

15“Make a Pouch of Judgment, an artisan’s work. Make its design match the ephod—with blue, purple, scarlet material, and finely twined linen. 16It will be 9ins 1 span square and folded double. 17Mount four rows of gemstones on it: a ruby, topaz, and emerald on the first row; 18a turquoise, sapphire, and diamond on the second; 19a jacinth, agate, and amethyst on the third; 20and a beryl, onyx, and jasper on the fourth—all set in delicate gold decorations. 21Set the precious stones in the birth order of Israel’s 12 sons. Engrave their names as on a seal. 22On the pouch put pure gold chains of twined cordage. 23Put 2 gold rings on the 2 ends of the pouch, 24and put the 2 gold cords on the rings. 25Put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 decorative settings and attach them to the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 26Make 2 gold rings and put them on the 2 ends of the pouch, on the edge of the inner side of the ephod. 27Make 2 gold rings and put them at the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front close to where it joins together, above the skillfully woven band. 28Use a blue cord to tie the rings of the pouch to the ephod rings, so it will be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch won’t come loose from the ephod. 29Aaron will carry the names of Israel’s sons in the Pouch of Judgment over his heart when he goes into the Holy Place, for a memorial in front of the LORD continually. 30Put the Urim and Thummim in the pouch.	Ex 28:15-30

31“Make the whole ephod robe blue 32with an opening for the head in the middle. Around the opening put an edging made of woven work—as with a coat of mail—so it won’t tear. 33-34All around the hem, put pomegranates made out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and alternate gold bells with them. 35Aaron will wear it when he performs service, and other people can hear it tinkling when he goes in and leaves the Holy Place in case he dies while he’s in front of the LORD.	    Ex 28:31-35

36“Make a pure gold plate and engrave it ‘Holy to the LORD’—as on a seal. 37Use a blue cord to fasten it to the front of the turban. 38Aaron will always wear it on his forehead to take away the sin from all holy gifts the Israelites consecrate, to make them acceptable to the LORD. 39Weave the tunic out of checkered work of fine linen and make a turban and sash out of fine linen.

Ex 28:36-39

40“For Aaron’s sons make tunics, sashes, and caps, bright and beautiful. 41Put them on him and his sons; anoint, ordain, and consecrate them to serve me as priests. 42Make linen pants to cover their bare skin, pants that reach from their waist to their thighs. 43They’ll wear them in the Tent of Meeting and when they go to the altar to perform service in the Holy Place so they won’t incur guilt and die—a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants.	 Ex 28:40-43

Consecration of the Priests

29:1“This is how you’re to consecrate them as priests to me: take a young bull, two rams without blemish, 2bread without yeast, and cakes mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with oil and made out of fine wheat flour. 3Put them in a basket and bring them with the bull and two rams. 4Take Aaron and his sons to the door and give them a bath. 5Put on Aaron the tunic, ephod robe, ephod, chest pouch, and skillfully woven band of the ephod. 6Put the turban on his head, and the holy crown on the turban. 7Then pour the anointing oil on his head. 8Put tunics on his sons. 9Put sashes around him and his sons and tie the caps on them. They’ll exercise the priesthood by permanent statute. 	Ex 29:1-9

10“Then take the bull to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 11and slaughter it. 12Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger. Pour out the rest at the base of the altar. 13Take the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that’s on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar. 14Burn the meat, hide, and manure outside the camp as a sin offering.		 Ex 29:10-14

15“Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on one ram’s head. 16Slaughter it and sprinkle its blood around the altar. 17Then butcher it, wash its entrails and legs, and put them on the altar with the pieces and head. 18Offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar—a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma.

19“Have Aaron and his sons put their hands on the other ram’s head. 20Slaughter it, put some of its blood on Aaron and his sons’ right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. Sprinkle the rest around on the altar. 21Take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, his sons, and their vestments. That will consecrate them and their vestments. 22Take the fat from the ram—fat from its tail, fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh (it’s a ram for ordination)—23one cake of bread, one cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that sits in front of the LORD. 24Put them in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave offering in front of the LORD. 25Take them and offer them up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering for an aroma pleasing to the LORD.  	Ex 29:15-25

26“Then take the breast of Aaron’s ram for the ordination, and wave it as a wave offering; it will be your portion. 27Consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering that was waved and offered from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and the one that was for his sons. 28It will be for Aaron and his sons their permanent portion from the Israelites. It’s a heave offering from the Israelites’ peace offerings, that is, their heave offering to the LORD.

29“Aaron’s holy vestments will go to his descendants so they can be anointed and ordained in them. 30For one week his descendant that succeeds him as priest will wear them when he enters the Tent of Meeting to perform service in the Holy Place.	 Ex 29:26-30

31“Take the ram for the ordination and boil its meat in a holy place. 32At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons will eat the ram’s meat and the bread in the basket. 33They’ll eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration. A layman can’t eat them because they’re holy. 34Burn any meat or bread that’s left over till morning.	Ex 29:31-34

35“This is how you’ll ordain Aaron and his sons over the course of a week. 36Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, to purify the altar when you atone for it. Anoint it to consecrate it. 37For 7 days atone for the altar to consecrate it. Then it will be most holy; whoever touches it will be holy.

Ex 29:35-37

38“Offer on the altar two one-year-old lambs each day, 39one in the morning and another in the evening. 40Mix 4½ pecks 1 ephah of fine flour with 3pts ¼ hin of pressed olive oil and 3pts ¼ hin of wine for a liquid offering for the lamb. 41Offer the other lamb in the evening, like the grain offering in the morning, with its liquid offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 42It will be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in front of me. I’ll meet you there and speak to you. 43I’ll meet there with the descendants of Israel, and it will be consecrated by my glory. 44I’ll consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, as well as Aaron and his sons to minster as priests to me. 45I’ll live among the descendants of Israel and be their God. 46They’ll know I’m the LORD their God who brought them out of Egypt to live among them. 	Ex 29:38-46

The Altar of Incense

30:1“Make an altar out of acacia wood as a place to burn incense: 218 x 18 x 36in with horns in one piece with it. 3Overlay it with pure gold on its sides, top, and horns; make a molding around it. 4On two sides put two gold rings under its molding on opposite ends for carrying it. 5Make the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 6Put the altar in front of the curtain that’s near the Ark of Testimony—in front of the mercy seat that’s on top of the Ark—where I’ll meet you. 7-8Aaron will burn fragrant incense on it every morning and evening and trim the lamps. Burn incense to me continuously throughout your generations. 9Don’t offer foreign incense, burnt offering, or meal offering on this altar. Don’t pour any liquid offering on it. 10Throughout your generations, Aaron will make atonement on its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering. It’s most holy to me.	 Ex 30:1-10

Atonement Money

[11] 12“When you take a census of the Israelites, each one will give a ransom for himself to the LORD so there won’t be any plague among them. 13-14Each person that’s counted from 20 years up will give .2 oz a half-shekel of the sanctuary as a contribution to the LORD (20 gerahs to a shekel). 15Rich and poor will contribute the same .2 oz a half-shekel of to make atonement. 16Give it for the service of the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to the LORD.   	Ex 30:11-16

Bronze Basin for Washing

[17] 18“Make a bronze laver with a bronze base, put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 19Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet from it 20when they go into the Tent of Meeting so they won’t die when they approach the altar to offer up in smoke a sacrifice by fire to me.  21That will be an ongoing statute for Aaron and his descendants.	 Ex 30:17-21

Anointing Oil

[22] 23“Take the finest spices: 12½ lbs 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 6¼ lbs 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 2412½ lbs 500 shekels of cassia, and 1½ gallons hin of olive oil. 25From them, make a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, a perfumer’s work. 26With it, anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, 27the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28the altar of burnt offering and its instruments, and the laver and its stand. 29Consecrate them so they’ll be holy. Whatever touches them will be holy. 30Anoint Aaron and his sons to consecrate them for performing service to me as priests. 31Tell the Israelites, ‘This will be an anointing oil holy to me throughout your generations. 32Don’t make any oil in the same proportions or pour it on anybody else. It’s holy, reserved for you. 33Whoever mixes any oil like it or puts any of it on a layman, will be excluded from the community.’” 	Ex 30:22-33

Anointing Oil

34“Take the spices stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense in equal amounts 35to make incense, a perfumer’s work—salted, pure, and holy. 36Beat some of it very fine and put part of it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I’ll meet you. It will be most holy to you. 37Any incense you make for yourselves can’t have the same proportions. My incense will be exclusively for the LORD. 38Whoever makes any perfume like it will be excluded from the community. 	Ex 30:34-38

Bezalel and Oholiab

31[:1] 2“I’ve specifically called Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 3I’ve filled him with my spirit in wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship

4to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver, and bronze,

5in cutting stones for settings and

carving in wood.

6I’ve appointed with him Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan. In the hearts of everybody that’s skilled, I’ve put the skill to make everything:

7the Tent of Meeting,

the Ark of Testimony,

the mercy seat on top of it,

the furniture in the tent,

8the table and its utensils,

the pure gold lampstand with its utensils,

the altar of incense,

9the altar of burnt offering with its utensils,

the laver with its stand,

10the holy woven vestments for Aaron and his sons for carrying out

their priesthood,

11the anointing oil,

and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place.

They’re to make them the way I told you.	 Ex 31:1-11

The Sabbath

[12] 13“Tell the Israelites to observe my Sabbaths. They’re a sign between you and me throughout your generations so you can know I’m the LORD who sanctifies you. 14The Sabbath is set aside for you. Execute anybody that profanes it. Exclude from the community whoever works on it. 15Work for six days, but the seventh day will be a complete rest set aside to me. 16Israelites will observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a continuing covenant. 17It’s a permanent sign between them and me, because I made earth and sky in six days, but stopped working on the seventh day and was refreshed.”

18When God finished speaking to him on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the Testimony that God wrote with his own finger.	 Ex 31:12-18

The Golden Calf

32:1When Moses hadn’t come down from the mountain for a long time, the people gathered around Aaron and said, “Make us a god to go ahead of us. We don’t know what’s happened to this Moses that brought us out of Egypt.”

2Aaron said, “Take the gold earrings off of your wives, sons, and daughters, and bring them to me.” [3] 4He took them, and with a graving tool shaped a molten calf.

They said, “This is your god, Israel, that brought you out of Egypt!”

5When Aaron saw it, he built an altar in front of it and made a proclamation, “Tomorrow will be a feast to the LORD.” 6They got up early, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. The people sat down to gluttony and got up to revelry.  	Ex 32:1-6

7The LORD told Moses,

“Go down right now. The people have corrupted themselves. 8They’ve turned aside so soon from what I commanded them. They’ve made a molten calf and worshiped it, sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, Israel, that brought you out of Egypt!’ 9These are stubborn people. 10Let me alone so my anger can burn against them and destroy them. I’ll make a great nation out of you.”

11Moses asked the LORD his God,

“Why does your anger burn against the people you brought out of Egypt with such power? 12Why should the Egyptians be able to say you brought them out to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the earth? Turn from your furious anger and change your mind about harming them. 13Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, the servants you swore to by yourself, ‘I’ll multiply your descendants like stars in the sky, and this land I’ve talked about I’ll give your descendants as a permanent inheritance.’”

14So the LORD changed his mind about harming them.	 Ex 32:7-14

15Moses went down the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the Testimony, engraved on both sides 16with God’s writing. 17When Joshua heard the people shouting, he told Moses it sounded like war in the camp.

18But Moses said, “That’s not the shout of triumph or defeat.  I hear singing.”

19As soon as he got close to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing, and his anger flared. He threw the tablets down and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. 20He took the calf they’d made, burned it, and ground it to powder. He scattered it on the water and made the people drink it.	 Ex 32:15-20

21Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to get you to bring such a great sin on them?”

22“Don’t be furious with me. You know they’re prone to evil. 23They told me, ‘Make us a god to go ahead of us. We don’t know what’s happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt.’ 24I told them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off.’ They gave it to me; I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.”	 Ex 32:21-24

25Moses saw that the people were out of control (Aaron had let them get out of control to be ridiculed by their enemies). 26So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!” Levi’s descendants went to him,

27He said,

“The LORD God of Israel, says, ‘Every one of you, put a sword on your thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp. Each man, slay your brother, friend, or neighbor.’”

28The Levites did that and slew about 3,000 men that day. 29Then Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves to the LORD (because every man has been against his son and brother) so he can bless you today.”	 Ex 32:25-29

30The next day, Moses told the people, “You’ve committed a serious sin. I’m going up to the LORD. Maybe I can atone for you.” 31He went back to the LORD, and said,

“The people have committed a serious sin by making a god out of gold. 32But if you will, forgive them. If not, erase me out of your scroll!”

33The LORD told him,

“The ones that have sinned against me are the ones I’ll erase out of my scroll. 34Go lead them where I said. My angel will go ahead of you. When I punish, I’ll punish them for their sin.”

35The LORD struck the people because of what they’d done with the calf Aaron made.

Ex 32:30-35

33:1The LORD told Moses,

“Leave here and go to the land I swore I’d give the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 2I’ll send an angel ahead of you to drive out the Canaanite, Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. 3Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. I won’t go up with you, because you’re stubborn, so I won’t destroy you on the way.”

4When the people heard that discouraging word, they went into mourning; nobody put on jewelry. 5The LORD had told Moses, “Tell them, ‘You’re being stubborn. If I’d go up among you for a moment, I’d destroy you. So take off your jewelry so I’ll know what I’m to do with you.’” 6They didn’t wear jewelry from Mount Horeb/Sinai on.	 Ex 33:1-6

The Tent of Meeting

7Moses would pitch a tent a good distance outside the camp—what he called The Tent of Meeting. Anybody that wanted to consult the LORD would go out to it. 8Whenever Moses went out, everybody would stand at the entrance of his tent and watch him till he went into the tent. 9Then the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance, and the LORD would talk to him. 10When people saw the pillar, they would worship at their own tents. 11The LORD would speak to Moses directly, the way you talk to a friend. When Moses would come back to the camp, his assistant Joshua son of Nun, a young man, would stay behind at the tent. 	Ex 33:7-11

Moses Sees the Glory of the LORD

12Then Moses told the LORD,

“You tell me to bring the people up, but you haven’t let me know who you’ll send with me. You’ve said you knew me by name, and you’ve been gracious to me. 13Let me know your ways so I can know you and please you.  Consider this nation your people.

14“My presence will go with yousg, and I’ll give you rest.”

15“If you don’t go with us, don’t take us away from here. 16How can your people and I know we’re being pleasing to you? Isn’t it by having you with us so we can tell the difference between ourselves and other people?” 	Ex 33:12-16

17“I’ll do what you’ve asked, because you’re pleasing to me, and I know you by name.”

18“Show me your glory.”

19“I’ll make my goodness pass by in front of you, and show you who I am. I’ll decide who to give grace to and who to show mercy to. 20But you can’t see my face. Nobody can see me and live! 21Here’s a place beside me; stand on that rock. 22While my glory is passing by, I’ll put you in a crevice in the rock and cover you with my hand till I’m past. 23Then I’ll take my hand away, and you can see my back; but you won’t see my face.”	 Ex 33:17-23

The New Stone Tablets

34:1The LORD told Moses,

“Carve out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I’ll write on them what was on the tablets you shattered. 2Be ready by morning. Come up to the top of Mount Sinai and present yourself 3alone. Nobody can be on the mountain. Flocks and herds can’t graze by it.”

4He carved two stone tablets like the first ones, got up early, and took them up to Mount Sinai. 5The LORD came down in a cloud and stood there with him as he called on the LORD. 6He passed by Moses and proclaimed,

“The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness;7who shows kindness to thousands; forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin; yet doesn’t leave guilty people unpunished, and visits the consequences of parents’ sins on their descendants for three or four generations!”

8Moses immediately bowed to the ground in worship.

9“LORD, if I’m pleasing to you, go along with us, even though we’ve been so stubborn. Pardon our sin and take us as your own.”	  Ex 34:1-9

10God said,

“I’ll make a covenant. I’ll perform miracles for the people that haven’t been done in any nation. The people you live with will see my working; it’ll be terrifying. 11Be sure to observe what I’m commanding you today; and I’ll drive out the Amorite, Canaanite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite in front of you.

12“Don’t make any treaty with the people where you’re going. That would be a snare among you. 13Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles. 14(Don’t worship any other god, because I am an ‘exclusive’ God. Exclusive is my name.) 15Destroy those things so you won’t be making treaties with them, carrying on prostitution with their gods, sacrificing to them, eating their sacrifices with them—16so you won’t be taking their daughters for your sons, and their daughters carry on prostitution with their gods and get your sons to do it.

17“Don’t make molten gods.”	Ex 34:10-17

18“Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For a week at the specified time in the month Abib, eat bread without yeast like I told you. That’s the month you came out of Egypt.

19“The first male offspring belongs to me, including the first male offspring of your cattle and sheep. 20With a lamb, redeem the first offspring of a donkey. If you don’t redeem it, break its neck. Redeem firstborn sons. None of them are to appear in front me empty-handed.”  	Ex 34:18-20

21“Work six days, but rest on the seventh, even during plowing time and harvest.

22“At year’s end, celebrate the Festival of Weeks, that is, the first part of the wheat harvest, the Festival of Ingathering.

23“Three times a year, males are to appear in my presence. 24I’ll drive out nations in front of you and enlarge your territory. Nobody is to covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear in my presence.

25“Don’t offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast or leave the Passover sacrifice over till morning.

26“Bring the first of your ground’s produce to my house.

“Don’t boil a kid in its mother’s milk.

27“Write those things down; with them I’m making a covenant with you and Israel.”

28Moses was there with the LORD for 40 days and didn’t eat bread or drink water. The LORD wrote the terms of the covenant on the tablets: The Ten Commandments. 	Ex 34:21-28

The Glowing Face of Moses

29When Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (with the tablets in hand), he didn’t realize his face was glowing because he’d been speaking with the LORD. 30When Aaron and the Israelites saw his face glowing, they were afraid to get close to him. 31He called out to them, and Aaron and the rulers in the community came back to him. 32He told them to do everything the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai. 33When he finished talking, he put on a veil. 34Whenever he went to speak to the LORD, he’d take it off till he came out to report what the LORD had said. 35The people would see his face glowing, and he’d put the veil back on till he went in to speak to the LORD again.	 Ex 34:29-35

Sabbath Regulations

35:1Moses gathered the community and said,

“The LORD has commanded these things: 2‘You can work for six days, but set the seventh day aside to him as a complete rest. Whoever works on it will be executed. 3Don’t start a fire in your houses on the Sabbath.’”  	Ex 35:1-3

Materials for the Tabernacle

4Moses told them,

“The LORD has commanded 5to take an offering for him from everybody that’s willing to contribute:

gold, silver, and bronze;

6blue, purple, and scarlet material;

fine linen;

goat hair, 7ram skins dyed red, dolphin skins;

acacia wood;

8olive oil for lighting,

spices for anointing oil and fragrant incense;

9onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and chest pouch.

Ex 35:4-9

10‘The artisans need and make everything I’ve commanded:

11the Tabernacle,

its tent and covering,

its hooks and boards,

its bar, posts, and bases;

12the Ark and its poles;

the mercy seat,

the dividing curtain;

13the table, its poles, utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;

14the lampstand for the light and its utensils, lamps, and olive oil;

15the altar of incense, its poles, anointing oil, and fragrant incense;

the curtain across the Tabernacle entrance;

16the altar for burnt offerings with its bronze grating, poles,

utensils, basin, and stand;

17the curtains for the court,

its posts and bases,

the screen for the entrance to the court;

18the pegs for the Tabernacle and the court and their cords;

19the woven vestments for performing service in the Holy Place, the holy vestments for Aaron the priest and his sons.’”

Ex 35:10-19

20The community left. 21Everyone whose heart and spirit stirred him brought a contribution for the work on the Tent of Meeting, its service, and holy vestments.

22Men and women brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, bracelets, and gold articles; and offered them to the LORD.

23People that had blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen; goats’ hair, ram skins dyed red, and dolphin skins brought them.

24People that could contribute silver or bronze brought it.

Men that had acacia wood brought it for any work of the service.

25-26Skilled women brought blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen, and goats’ hair they’d spun.

27Rulers brought onyx stones and stones for setting the ephod and chest pouch.

28They brought spices and olive oil for the light, anointing oil, and fragrant incense.

29Israelite men and women that were moved to bring material for the work the LORD commanded, brought it to him as a free-will offering.	 Ex 35:20-29

Bezalel and Oholiab

30Moses told the people,

“The LORD has appointed Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur from the tribe of Judah. 31He has filled him with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and craftsmanship 32to make designs for working in gold, silver, and bronze; 33for cutting stones for settings, carving wood, and doing all the creative work. 34He and Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, are willing to teach these skills. 35God has given them the skill to engrave, design, embroider, and weave blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine linen. 36:1Bezalel, Oholiah, and every person skilled by the LORD are to perform their work as commanded.”

Ex 35:30-36:1

2Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and their artisans to begin the work. 3They received from him the contributions for building the sanctuary. [4] 5They told him, “The people are bringing more than we need.” 6He circulated a message throughout the camp that they didn’t need to contribute anything more. [7]	Ex 36:2-7

8Bezalel and his artisans made the Tabernacle with 10 curtains from finely twined linen and from blue, purple, and scarlet material with cherubs, 9each one 42 x 6ft. 10He joined the 2 sets of 5 curtains, 11and made blue loops along the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 12He made 50 loops in each curtain and set the curtains across from each other. 13He made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains with them so the Tabernacle formed a unit.

14Then he made curtains out of goats’ hair for a tent over the Tabernacle—11 in all. 15Each one was 45 x 6ft. 16He connected 5 curtains to make one set and connected the other 6 curtains to make a second set. 17He made 50 loops each on the edge of the outside curtain in both sets. 18He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together. 19He made the covering of the tent out of rams’ skins dyed red with a covering of goatskins over it.   	Ex 36:8-19

20He made the upright boards out of acacia wood, 21each one 15ft x 27in. 22Each board had a mortise and tenon so they’d fit together. 23He made 20 boards for the south side 24with 40 silver bases under the 20 boards. 25-26He did the same for the north side. 27He made 6 boards for the back, the west end of the Tabernacle. 28He made 2 boards for the corners of the Tabernacle in the back; 29they were double underneath. Together they were complete to the top—to the first ring. He did the same for the other corner. 30There were 8 boards with their 16 bases—2 under each board.	 Ex 36:20-30

31He formed bars out of acacia wood, 5 for each side of the Tabernacle 32and 5 for the back of it. 33The middle bar passed through the center of the boards from one end of the Tabernacle to the other. 34He overlaid the boards with gold, shaped their rings out of gold to hold the bars, and made the bars out of gold—an artisan’s work.

35He made the curtain out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen decorated with cherubs. 36He shaped 4 posts out of acacia wood, overlaid them with gold, and cast 4 silver bases for them. 37For the door to the tent, he fashioned a screen woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material and finely twined linen. 38He formed its 5 posts with their hooks and overlaid their tops and bands with gold; their bases were bronze.  	Ex 36:31-38

The Ark

37:1Bezalel made the Ark out of acacia wood: 45 x 27 x 27ins high. 2He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, made a gold border around it, 3and cast 4 gold rings for it, 2 on each side. 4He shaped poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold 5and put them in the rings for carrying it.

6He formed a mercy seat out of pure gold: 45 x 27in. 7It had 2 hammered gold cherubs for the ends of the mercy seat, 8and were one piece with it. 9Their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat and facing each other.  	Ex 37:1-9

The Table

10Then he made the table out of acacia wood: 36 x 18 x 27in high. 11He overlaid it with pure gold, put a molding around it, 12formed a rim for it a hand’s width, and a gold molding for the rim. 13He cast 4 gold rings for the bottom 4 corners 14close to the rim for holding the poles that carried the table. 15He shaped the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 16 Out of pure gold he fashioned the utensils for the table: dishes, pans, bowls, and jars for pouring liquid offerings.	 Ex 37:10-16

The Lampstand

17He formed the lampstand out of pure hammered gold with its base, shaft, cups, bulbs, and flowers as one piece. 18There were 6 branches, 3 coming out of each side. 19It had cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb, and a flower on each branch. 20On the lampstand there were 4 cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs, and its flowers. 21There was a bulb under each of the three pairs of branches coming out of the lampstand. 22Their bulbs and branches were one piece with the lampstand; the whole thing was a single hammered work of pure gold. 23Out of pure gold he formed its 7 lamps with its snuffers and trays. 24He fashioned it and its utensils out of 75½ lbs a talent of pure gold.	 Ex 37:17-24

The Altar of Incense

25He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood: 18 x 18 x 36in high. Its horns were one piece with it. 26He overlaid its top, sides, and horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 27For each side under its molding he made two gold rings to hold the poles for carrying it. 28He fashioned the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 29He made the holy anointing oil and pure fragrant incense out of spices—an incense maker’s work.	 Ex 37:25-29

The Altar of Burnt Offering

38:1Then he built the altar for burnt offering out of acacia wood: 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high. 2He formed horns on its four corners one piece with it and overlaid it with bronze. 3He made bronze utensils for the altar: pails, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and fire pans. 4He fashioned a bronze grating under the edge of the altar that reached halfway up, 5and cast 4 rings for the 4 ends of the grating to hold the poles. 6He formed the poles out of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, 7and inserted them into the rings for carrying it. He made it hollow with planks.

Basin for Washing

8He created the laver out of bronze with a bronze base, from the mirrors of the women that served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.	Ex 38:1-8

The Courtyard

9Then he built the court. For the south side he made curtains out of finely twined linen 150ft long. 10There were 20 posts with 20 bronze bases with hooks on the posts and silver bands. 11The north side was 150ft long with 20 posts, 20 bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts. 12The west side was 75ft long with 10 posts, 10 bases, and silver hooks and bands for the posts. 13The east side was 75ft long. 14The curtains on one side of the entrance were 22½ft long with 3 posts and 3 bases. 15The other side was the same. 16He made the curtains out of finely twined linen. 17The bases for the posts were bronze; their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.

18The screen for the court entrance was woven out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 19The 4 posts and their bases were bronze, their hooks were silver with silver overlay on the tops and bands on the posts. 20The pegs for the Tabernacle and the court were bronze.	 Ex 38:9-20

Inventory of Materials

21Those are the items for the Tabernacle of Testimony that Moses commanded for the Levites’ service, as recorded by Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 22Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD told Moses. 23Working with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, an engraver, artisan, and weaver in blue, purple, and scarlet material; and fine linen. 	Ex 38:21-23

24All the gold for the work on the sanctuary, including the wave offering, was 2,208 lbs 29 talents and 730 shekels of the sanctuary. 25The silver from the community was 7595 lbs 100 talents and 1,775 shekels of the sanctuary, 26a beka per head, for each one that passed by that was 20 years old and up: 603,550 men. 27The 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver went for casting the bases of the sanctuary and the curtain: 100 bases for the 7550 lbs 100 talents, 75½ lbs one talent per base. 28The 18 lbs 1,775 shekels of silver, Bezalel went for the hooks and rings of the posts and to overlay the tops of them. 29The bronze for the wave offering was 5345 lbs 70 talents and 2400 shekels. 30With the bronze he made bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its grating, the utensils for the altar, 31the bases and pegs for around the court, for the entrance to the court, and the pegs of the Tabernacle.

Ex 38:24-31

The Priestly Garments

39:1From the blue, purple, and scarlet material, they made finely woven vestments for Aaron to perform service in the Holy Place—like the LORD commanded Moses.

2He made the ephod out of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 3They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads that were woven in with the blue, purple, and scarlet material; and the fine linen—an artisan’s work. 4They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod—attached at the two upper ends. 5The skillfully woven band on it had the same workmanship: gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen.  6They made the onyx stones, set in delicate gold ornamentation. They engraved the onyx stones like the engravings on a signet, showing the names of Israel’s sons. 7He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for them.	Ex 39:1-7

8He made the pouch to match the ephod, an artisan’s work. It too was made of gold; blue, purple, and scarlet material; and finely twined linen. 9The pouch was square—9ins on a side when folded double. 10They mounted 4 rows of stones on it:

row 1 had ruby, topaz, and emerald;

11row 2 had turquoise, sapphire, and diamond;

12row 3 had jacinth, agate, amethyst;

13row 4 had beryl, onyx, and jasper—

mounted in delicate gold settings. 14The stones corresponded to the names of Israel’s sons. The 12 names corresponded to the engravings of a signet, each the name of one tribe. 15They made chains like cords on the pouch, twined cordage in pure gold. 16They made 2 delicate gold settings and 2 gold rings and put the 2 rings on the ends of the pouch. 17They put the 2 gold cords in the 2 rings. 18They put the other 2 ends of the cords on the 2 delicate settings and put them on the shoulder pieces at the front of the ephod. 19They made 2 gold rings and placed them on the inner edge of the pouch ends next to the ephod.

20They made 2 gold rings for the bottom of the 2 shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod. 21They bound the pouch to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so it could be on the woven band of the ephod, and the pouch wouldn’t come loose from the ephod.   	Ex 39:8-21

22Then he made the robe of the ephod out of blue woven work. 23The opening of the robe was in the center at the top, like the opening of a coat of mail with a binding around its opening so it wouldn’t tear. 24They made pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet material; and twined linen, [25] 26and alternated them with pure gold bells and pomegranates around the hem.

Ex 39:22-26

27They prepared tunics out of finely twined linen for Aaron and his sons. 28They made the turban, decorated caps, and the pants out of finely twined linen. 29They wove the sash out of finely twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet material.

30They shaped the plate for the holy crown out of pure gold and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet: Holy to the LORD. 31They fastened a blue cord to it and attached it to the top of the turban.

32That completed the work on the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites did everything the LORD told Moses. 	Ex 39:27-32

Moses Inspects the Work

33They brought the Tabernacle to Moses:

the tent and its furnishings, its clasps, boards, bars, posts, and bases;

34the covering made of ram skins dyed red and goatskin leather;

the screening curtain;

35the Ark of Testimony, its poles, and the mercy seat;

36the table, its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;

37the pure gold lampstand, its arrangement of lamps, utensils, and olive oil for its lights;

38the gold altar, anointing oil, and fragrant incense;

the curtain for the door to the tent;

39the bronze altar, its bronze grating, poles, and utensils;

the laver and its stand;

40the curtains for the court, its posts and sockets,

the screen for the entrance to the court, its cords, and pegs;

the equipment for the service of the Tabernacle for the Tent of Meeting;

41the woven holy vestments for Aaron and his sons to serve as priests in the Holy Place.

42The Israelites did everything like the LORD told Moses. 43Moses examined their work and blessed them.	Ex 39:33-43

Setting Up the Tabernacle

40:1Then the LORD told Moses,

2“The first day, first month, set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 3Put the Ark of Testimony in it and screen it off with the curtain.

4Take the table in and arrange what goes on it;

take the lampstand in and mount the lamps.

5Place the gold altar for incense in front of the Ark of Testimony, and

set up the curtain across the door to the Tabernacle.

6Put the altar of burnt offering in front of the door to the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.

7Set the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.

8Set up the court around it and hang the curtain across the entrance.

9Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate it and its furnishings to be holy.

10Anoint the altar for burnt offering and the utensils to consecrate the altar. The altar will be the most holy item.

11Anoint the laver and its stand to consecrate it.

12Then take Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and bathe them. 13Dress Aaron in the holy vestments and anoint him to consecrate him so he can serve as a priest to me. 14Bring his sons and put tunics on them. 15Anoint them like you anointed him. Their anointing will appoint them as an ongoing permanent priesthood.”

16Moses did everything the LORD told him. 	Ex 40:1-16

17The first day, first month, second year, he set up the Tabernacle:

18laid its bases, set up its boards, inserted its bars, and set up its posts; 19he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering on it;

20put the Testimony in the Ark, attached the poles to it, put the mercy seat on top of it, 21took it into the Tabernacle, and screened it off;

22put the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the Tabernacle outside the curtain, 23and arranged the bread on it in front of the LORD;

24placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, across from the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, 25and lit the lamps in front of the LORD;

26put the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain, 27and burned fragrant incense on it; 	Ex 40:17-27

28set up the curtain for the door to the Tabernacle, 29set the altar for burnt offering in front of the door, and offered the burnt offering and meal offering on it;

30put the laver between the Tent of Meeting and the altar with water in it for washing; 31out of it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet 32when they went into the Tent of Meeting to approach the altar;

33set up the court around the Tabernacle and the altar and hung a curtain across the court entrance.

So Moses finished the work.

The Glory of the LORD

34Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the LORD’s glory filled the Tabernacle. 35Moses couldn’t go into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the LORD’s glory filled it. 36During their travels, whenever the cloud rose up from the Tabernacle, the Israelites would move out. 37If it didn’t rise up, they’d stay till it did. 38The cloud was on the Tabernacle during the day; fire was in it at night where Israel could see it.	 Ex 40:28-38

LEVITICUS

Burnt Offering from the Flock

1:1The LORD called to Moses from the Tent of Meeting and told him,

2“When you take an offering to the LORD, take it from the herd or flock. 3For a burnt offering from the herd, offer a male without defect. Offer it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 4and put your hand on its head to make it acceptable to atone for you. 5Slaughter the young bull, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, will offer up its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.  6Skin the burnt offering and butcher it. 7The sons of Aaron will put fire on the altar, arrange wood on the fire, 8and arrange the pieces, head, and fat on the wood. 9But you’ll wash its entrails and legs, and the priest will offer it up in smoke for a burnt offering,	 Lev 1:1-9

10“If your burnt offering is a sheep or goat from the flock, it’ll be without defect. 11Slaughter it on the north side of the altar in front of the LORD, and the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 12Then butcher it with its head and fat, and the priests will arrange the pieces on the wood on the altar. 13You’ll wash the entrails and legs, and the priest will offer it up in smoke for a burnt offering on the altar, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.	 Lev 1:10-13

Burnt Offering of Birds

14“If it’s a burnt offering of birds, bring an offering of a turtledove or young pigeon. 15The priest will take it to the altar, wring it neck, and offer it up in smoke. He’ll drain out its blood on the side of the altar, 16take away its crop and feathers, and cast it on the east side of the altar toward the place for the ashes. 17Then he’ll tear it by its wings—but not cut it in two—and offer it up in smoke on the altar. It’s a burnt offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.  	Lev 1:14-17

Grain Offerings

2:1“A grain offering to the LORD will consist of fine flour with olive oil and frankincense added. 2Take it to the sons of Aaron the priests. The priest will take a handful of the mix and offer it up in smoke on the altar as God’s portion, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 3The rest is for Aaron and his sons, something most holy of the offerings to the LORD by fire.	 Lev 2:1-3

4“When you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it’ll be flat cakes of fine flour mixed with olive oil or wafers with no yeast in them, basted with olive oil. 5If you make it on a griddle, make it out of fine flour without yeast and mixed with olive oil. 6Break it up into pieces and pour the oil on it. 7If you make your grain offering in a pan, make it out of fine flour mixed with olive oil. 8When you bring a grain offering like that, present it to the priest at the altar. 9He’ll take out God’s portion and offer it up in smoke by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 10The rest is for Aaron and his sons, something most holy from the offerings to the LORD by fire.	Lev 2:4-10

11“Don’t put yeast or honey in grain offerings. 12For an offering of the first part of the harvest, bring it to the LORD, but it’s not to rise up as a pleasing aroma on the altar. 13Season grain offerings with salt to put the salt of your God’s covenant in them.

14“If you bring a grain offering of the first part of the harvest, bring heads of crushed new growth roasted in fire, 15and put olive oil and incense on them. 16The priest will offer them up in smoke as God’s portion. 	Lev 2:11-16

Peace Offerings

3:1“If you’re offering a peace offering, offer from the herd a male or female without defect. 2Put your hand on its head and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 3From the sacrifice the priest will present an offering by fire to the LORD: the fat around and on the entrails, 4the two kidneys in the loins and their fat, and the lobe of the liver that he’ll remove with the kidneys. 5The sons of Aaron will offer up in smoke the burnt offering that’s on the wood over the fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.	Lev 3:1-5

6“If your peace offering comes from the flock, offer a male or female without defect. 7If it’s a lamb, 8put your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. The sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 9From the sacrifice he’ll remove the entire fat tail close to the backbone, the fat that’s around and on the entrails, 10the two kidneys in the loins with their fat, and the lobe of the liver that he’ll remove with the kidneys. 11The priest will offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD.

Lev 3:6-11

12“If your offering is a goat, 13put your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. The sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 14From it the priest will present an offering by fire to the LORD: the fat around and on the entrails, 15the two kidneys in the loins with their fat, and the lobe of the liver that he’ll remove with the kidneys. 16The priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire for a pleasing aroma.

“The fat belongs to the LORD. 17It’s an ongoing permanent statute everywhere: don’t eat fat or blood.”e’ll put his hand on its head and slay it in front of the tent of meetin; the sons of Aaron will sprinkileHhHadfkdkdlslsm sdc ;c

Lev 3:12-17

Sin Offerings

4:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“If an anointed priest sins unintentionally 3and brings guilt on the people, he needs to offer to the LORD a bull without defect as a sin offering. 4He is to take it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, put his hand on its head, and slaughter it. 5The anointed priest will take some of its blood to the Tent of Meeting, 6dip his finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of the LORD in front of the sanctuary curtain. 7He’ll put some of it on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense, and pour the rest at the base of the altar that’s at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 	Lev 4:1-7

8“He’ll remove from the bull the fat of the sin offering: the fat around and on the entrails, 9the two kidneys in the loins with their fat, and the lobe of the liver, which he’ll remove with the kidneys 10(like it’s removed from the herd animal in the sacrifice for peace offerings), and the priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering. 11But everything else—the bull’s hide, meat, head, legs, entrails, and refuse—12he’ll take to a ceremonially clean place outside the camp where they pour ashes and burn it on wood.	Lev 4:8-12

13“If the whole community sins without realizing it, 14when it does become known, the assembly will offer a bull for a sin offering and take it to the Tent of Meeting. 15The elders of the community will put their hands on its head and slaughter it in front of the LORD. 16The anointed priest will take some of its blood to the Tent of Meeting, 17dip his finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain. 18He’ll put some on the horns of the altar and pour the rest at the base of the altar that’s at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 19He’ll offer up its fat in smoke on the altar, 20and do with the bull what he did with the bull for the sin offering. The priest will atone for the assembly, and they’ll be forgiven. 21Then he’ll take the bull outside the camp and burn it like he did the first bull. It’s a sin offering for the assembly.	 Lev 4:13-21

22“When a leader unintentionally does something the LORD forbids 23and then realizes it, he’s to bring a male goat without a defect, 24put his hand on its head, and slaughter it where they slaughter the burnt offering to the LORD; it’s a sin offering. 25The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for a burnt offering. He’ll pour the rest at the base of the altar, 26and offer up its fat in smoke on the altar as with the fat of a peace offering. The priest will atone for him, and he’ll be forgiven.	 Lev 4:22-26

27“If any of the common people sin unintentionally 28and then realize it, they’ll bring a female goat without defect. 29They’ll put a hand on its head and slaughter it at the place for the burnt offering. 30The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for a burnt offering. He’ll pour the rest at the base of the altar. 31He’ll remove its fat as with a peace offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar for an aroma pleasing to the LORD. The priest will atone for them, and they’ll be forgiven.  	Lev 4:27-31

32“If they bring a lamb for a sin offering, it’s to be a female without defect. 33They’ll put their hand on its head and slaughter it where they slaughter the burnt offering. 34The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour the rest at the base of the altar. 35Then he’ll remove its fat as with a peace offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar. The priest will atone for them, and they’ll be forgiven.	 Lev 4:32-35

Sins Requiring Sin Offerings

5:1“If you receive a summons to testify about something you’ve seen or otherwise known and you don’t do it, you’re considered guilty. 2If you touch anything ceremonially unclean, even unintentionally—swarming things or the carcass of an unclean animal—you’re considered defiled. 3If you unintentionally touch such human uncleanness and then realize it, you’re considered defiled. 4If you swear rashly to do good or bad and come to realize it, you’re considered guilty. 5When you become guilty, report what you’ve done 6and bring a female lamb or goat as a guilt offering. The priest will atone for you.   	Lev 5:1-6

7“If you can’t afford a lamb, bring two turtledoves or young pigeons. 8The priest will offer one as a sin offering. He’ll wring its neck, but not pull it off. 9He’ll sprinkle some of its blood on the side of the altar and pour out the rest at the base of the altar—a sin offering. 10He’ll prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. The priest will atone for you, and you’ll be forgiven	Lev 5:7-10

11“If you can’t afford two turtledoves or young pigeons, take .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. Don’t put olive oil or incense on it; it’s a sin offering. 12Take a handful of it to the priest as God’s portion to offer up in smoke on the altar as a sin offering. 13The priest will atone for you in one of those ways and you’ll be forgiven. The rest is for the priest—like a grain offering.’”

Lev 5:11-13

Guilt Offering

14The LORD told Moses,

15“If you sin unintentionally against the LORD’s holy property, take a guilt offering to the LORD: a ram without defect according to your evaluation in silver shekels of the sanctuary. 16Pay compensation for your sin, add a fifth, and give it to the priests. The priest will atone for you with the ram, and you’ll be forgiven.	 Lev 5:14-16

17“If you sin unintentionally by doing anything the LORD forbids, you’re still considered guilty and will take your punishment. 18Take the priest a ram without defect according to your valuation for a guilt offering. The priest will atone for your unintentional sin, and you’ll be forgiven. 19It’s a guilt offering; the LORD has certainly considered you guilty.” 	Lev 5:17-19

6:1The LORD told Moses,

2“If you act unfaithfully against the LORD and deceive your companion—about a deposit, a security entrusted to you, something you stole or extorted from someone, 3have found that was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, or sin in any way like that—4then you need to return what you stole, what you got by extortion, what was entrusted to you, what lost thing you found, 5or anything you swore about falsely. Add a fifth and give it to the one it belongs to when you present your guilt offering. 6Then take to the priest your offering to the LORD, a ram without defect, as you evaluate for a guilt offering. 7The priest will atone for you to the LORD, and you’ll be forgiven.”    	Lev 6:1-7

Burnt Offering

8The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron and his sons,

9“This is the law for the burnt offering. The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night till morning. The altar fire will always be burning. 10The priest will put on his linen robe and underclothes, take up the ashes of the burnt offering, and place them beside the altar. 11Then he’ll change clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place. 12He’ll burn wood on the altar every morning, lay out the burnt offering on it, and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings. [13]   	Lev 6:8-13

Guilt Offering

14“This is the law for the grain offering. The descendants of Aaron will present it at the altar. 15One of them will take a handful of the fine flour from the grain offering with its olive oil and incense, and offer it up in smoke on the altar, a pleasing aroma, as God’s portion. 16Aaron and his sons will eat the rest. They’ll eat it as cakes without yeast in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 17It will not be baked with yeast. I’ve given it as their share of my offerings by fire. It’s most holy—like the sin offering and guilt offering. 18Any male descendant of Aaron can eat it. It’s a permanent ordinance among the offerings by fire to the LORD. Whoever touches them becomes holy.”   	Lev 6:14-18

19The LORD told Moses,

20“This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD the day he’s anointed: .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. 21Prepare it with olive oil on a griddle. Take it when it’s well stirred, 22and the anointed priest will offer it. By permanent ordinance it will all be offered up in smoke to the LORD. 23Likewise, completely burn every grain offering. Don’t eat any of it.”	 Lev 6:19-23

Sin Offering

24-25The LORD told Moses to say to Aaron and his sons,

25“This is the law for the sin offering. Where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will be slaughtered in front of the LORD. 26The priest that offers it will eat it in a holy place in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 27Anybody that touches it will become consecrated. If any of the blood splashes on a vestment, wash it off in a holy place 28and smash the clay pot it was boiled in. If it was boiled in a bronze container, scour it and rinse it in water. 29Any male priest can eat it; it’s most holy. 30Do not eat a sin offering that has any blood brought to the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; burn it.

Lev 6:24-30

Guilt Offering

7:1“This is the law for the guilt offering; it’s most holy. 2They’re to kill the guilt offering where they kill the burnt offering. The priest will sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 3Then he’ll offer its fat: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, 4the two kidneys in the loins with the fat that’s on them, and the lobe on the liver. 5The priest will offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD. 6Any male among the priests can eat it in a holy place. 7The same law applies to the guilt offering and sin offering. The priest that makes atonement with it will have it. 8The priest that presents anybody’s burnt offering also gets its skin. 9Every grain offering that’s baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle is for the priest that presents it. 10Every grain offering, dry or mixed with olive oil, will be for any of Aaron’s descendants.   	Lev 7:1-10

Fellowship Offering

11“This is the law for a peace offering. 12If you offer it as a thanksgiving, then along with it, offer cakes without yeast mixed with olive oil, wafers without yeast anointed with olive oil, and cakes of stirred fine flour mixed with olive oil. 13Present your offering with cakes of bread without yeast. 14Present one of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest that sprinkles the blood from the peace offerings.   	Lev 7:11-14

15“Eat the meat from a thanksgiving peace offering the day it’s offered. Don’t leave any of it till morning. 16If it’s an offering for fulfilling a vow or a freewill offering, eat it that day or the next. 17Burn any meat that’s left over till the third day. 18If you eat meat from it on the third day, you will not be accepted. It’s an offense that makes you guilty.	Lev 7:15-18

19“Don’t eat meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean; burn it. Otherwise, anybody that is clean can eat it. 20But an unclean person that eats the meat from a peace offering will be excluded from the community. 21Anybody that touches something unclean—human, animal, or something detestable—and then eats the meat from a peace offering, will be excluded from the community.”

Lev 7:19-21

22-23The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“Don’t eat the fat from an ox, sheep, or goat 24or from an animal that dies or wild animals tear apart. Put it to other uses. 25Whoever eats the fat of an animal offered by fire to the LORD will be excluded from the community. 26Don’t eat the blood of any bird or animal at home. 27Whoever does, will be excluded from the community.”   	Lev 7:22-27

The Priests’ Portion

28-29The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“When you offer a peace offering, take it to the LORD 30with the breast and fat of the animal so you can present it with your hands as a wave offering to the LORD. 31The priest will offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast will be for Aaron and his sons. 32Give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the peace offering. 33That portion is for the one that offers its blood and fat. 34I’ve taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the people’s peace offerings, and given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their permanent due from the people.  	Lev 7:28-34

35“That’s what God has consecrated to Aaron and his sons from the offerings by fire to the LORD when he presents them to serve as priests. 36The LORD commanded the Israelites to give them from the day he anointed them. It’s their permanent due.”

37That’s the law for the burnt offering, grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering, ordination offering, and peace offering. 38It’s what the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai when he told the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. 	Lev 7:35-38

The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons

8:1The LORD told Moses,

2“Take Aaron and his sons, their vestments and anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the 2 rams, and the basket of bread containing no yeast, 3and gather the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.”

4When they came, 5Moses told them, “The LORD has commanded this.” 	Lev 8:1-5

6Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and bathed them. 7He put the tunic and sash on Aaron, dressed him in the robe, put the ephod on him, and tied it on with the artistic band of the ephod. 8He placed the pouch on him and put the Urim and the Thummin in it. 9He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban he put the golden plate, the holy crown.

10He took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything in it. 11He sprinkled it on the altar seven times and anointed its utensils, the basin, and its stand to consecrate them. 12He poured some anointing oil on Aaron’s head to consecrate him. 13Next, he had Aaron’s sons approach, dressed them with tunics, wrapped them with sashes, and tied caps on them.   	Lev 8:6-13

14He brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 15He slaughtered it, and with his finger put some of its blood on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured the rest at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to atone for it. 16He took the two kidneys with the fat on the kidneys, entrails, and lobe of the liver and offered them up in smoke on the altar. 17He burned the bull, its hide, meat, and refuse in the fire outside the camp.

Lev 8:14-17

18Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 19He slaughtered it and sprinkled its blood on the altar. 20When he’d cut the ram into pieces, he offered up the head, the pieces, and the suet in smoke. 21After he’d washed its entrails and legs, he offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.

Lev 8:18-21

22He presented the second ram, the ram of ordination. Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 23Moses slaughtered it and put some of its blood on Aaron’s right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe. 24He had Aaron’s sons approach. He put some of the blood on their right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes. He sprinkled the rest around on the altar. 25He took the fat, the fat tail, the fat on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh. 26From the basket of bread without yeast in front of the LORD, he took a cake containing no yeast, a cake of bread mixed with olive oil, and a wafer, and placed them on the portion of fat and on the right thigh. 27He put them on the hands of Aaron and his sons, and presented them as a wave offering to the LORD. 28Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering to the LORD by fire for a pleasing aroma. 29He presented the breast as a wave offering. It was Moses’ portion of the ordination ram.   	Lev 8:22-29

30Moses took some anointing oil and blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes to consecrate them and their clothes.

31Moses told Aaron and his sons,

“Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that’s in the basket of the ordination offering like I commanded. 32Burn the rest of the meat and bread. 33Don’t go outside the Tent of Meeting for a week, till you fulfill your period of ordination; he’ll ordain you over the seven-day period. 34The LORD commanded to do as we’ve done today to atone for you. 35Stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for a week and keep the LORD’s charge so you won’t die; that’s what I’ve commanded.”

36Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded by Moses. 	Lev 8:30-36

The Priests Begin Their Service

9:1On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders in Israel. 2He told Aaron,

“Take a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering—both without defect—and offer them to the LORD. 3Then tell the Israelites,

‘Take a male goat for a sin offering,

a year-old calf and lamb without defect for a burnt offering,

4an ox and ram for peace offerings, and

a grain offering mixed with olive oil

because the LORD is going to appear to you today.’”

5They took what Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting. The whole community came and stood in front of the LORD. 6Moses said, “The LORD has told you to do that so his glory can appear to you.” 7He told Aaron, “Come to the altar and offer your sin offering and burnt offering so you can atone for yourself. Then make the offerings to atone for the people.”  	Lev 9:1-7

8Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf for the sin offering for himself. 9His sons handed him the blood. He dipped his finger in it, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the base of the altar. 10Then he offered up in smoke the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver; 11but he burned the meat and skin outside the camp.

12He slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 13They handed him the burnt offering in pieces with the head, and he offered them up in smoke. 14He washed the entrails and legs and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering.	 Lev 9:8-14

15He presented the people’s offering. He slaughtered the goat for the sin offering and offered it like the first. 16He also presented the burnt offering as required by the Law. 17Next, he offered up in smoke a handful of the grain offering on the altar—in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.

18Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, peace offerings for the people. Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 19-20On the breasts they placed the fat from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, fat covering, kidneys, and lobe of the liver. He offered them up in smoke. 21But Aaron presented the breasts and right thigh as a wave offering to the LORD —like Moses had commanded.

22Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. After he made the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offerings, he stepped down. 23He and Moses went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to them. 24Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar. When the people saw it, they cried out and fell on their faces.	Lev 9:15-24

The Death of Nadab and Abihu

10:1Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s sons, put fire in their firepans. They put incense on it and offered before the LORD fire different from what he’d commanded them. 2Fire came out from the LORD and consumed them, and they died. 3Moses told Aaron, “That’s what the LORD meant when he said,

‘Those who come near me will treat me as holy

in front of the people.’”

So Aaron kept quiet.

4Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, “Carry your relatives outside the camp from in front of the sanctuary.” 5They carried them outside the camp still in their tunics. 6Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar,

“Don’t uncover your heads or tear your clothes so you won’t die and make him angry with the whole community. But your kin, the whole House of Israel, will wail over the burning the LORD brought about. 7Don’t even go out of the Tent of Meeting; you’ll die because the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.”

They did what Moses said.	 Lev 10:1-7

8The LORD told Aaron,

9“Don’t drink wine or alcohol when you or your sons come into the Tent of Meeting so you won’t die—an ongoing permanent statute. 10That’s to distinguish the holy from the profane, the ceremonially clean from unclean. 11It’s to teach the Israelites the statutes the LORD has given them through Moses.”

12Then Moses told Aaron and his surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar,

“Take the grain offering that’s left over from the LORD’s offerings by fire and eat it without yeast beside the altar; it’s most holy. 13Eat it in a holy place; it’s for you and your sons from the LORD’s offerings by fire. That’s what God commanded me. 14The breast and thigh of the wave offering, however, you and your sons and daughters can eat in a clean place; those parts are for you and your offspring. 15The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving, they’ll take with the burnt offerings of the fat portions to present in a wave offering before the LORD. It’s for you and your sons permanently.”	 Lev 10:8-15

16Moses looked all over for the goat from the sin offering, but it had been burned up. He was mad at Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar,

17“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering at the holy place? It’s most holy, and the LORD gave it to you to carry away the guilt of the community, to atone for them. 18Since its blood hadn’t been brought into the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary like I commanded.”

19But Aaron told Moses,

“This very day they presented their sin offering and burnt offering to the LORD. But this tragedy has happened to me. If I’d eaten a sin offering today, would the LORD have considered it good?”

20That made sense to Moses.	Lev 10:16-20

Ceremonially Clean and Unclean Animals

11:1-2Again the LORD told Moses and Aaron to tell the Israelites,

“You can eat animals 3that have a split hoof and chew cud. 4-6Don’t eat anything that just chews cud or only has a split hoof: a camel or rock-badger or rabbit. 7Don’t eat a pig; it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew cud. 8Don’t eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they’re ceremonially unclean.	 Lev 11:1-8

9“You can eat anything in the water—seas and rivers—that has fins and scales. 10-11Any marine life that doesn’t have fins and scales is repulsive to you; detest their carcasses. [12]

13“Detest these birds and don’t eat them: eagles, vultures, buzzards, 14kites, falcons of any kind, 15ravens of any kind, 16ostrices, owls, sea gulls, hawks of any kind, 17little owls, cormorants, ibises, 18water hens, pelicans, carrion vultures, 19storks, herons of any kind, hoopoes, or bats.

20“Detest most winged insects that walk on four legs. 21Eat only the ones that have jointed legs and hop on the ground: 22any kind of locust, cricket, or grasshopper. [23]	 Lev 11:9-23

24“Touching a carcass makes you ceremonially unclean. 25If you pick it up, you have to wash your clothes and be unclean until evening. 26Touching a ceremonially unclean animal—that doesn’t chew cud and split hoofs—makes you unclean. 27Any four-footed animal that walks on paws is ceremonially unclean. Touching its carcass makes you unclean. 28If you pick it up, wash your clothes and be unclean till evening. 	Lev 11:24-28

29“These things that crawl on the ground are ceremonially unclean: moles, mice, big lizards of any kind, 30gechos, crocodiles, lizards, sand lizards of any kind, and chameleons. 31Whoever touches them when they’re dead is unclean till evening. 32Anything they fall on when they’re dead is also unclean: wooden articles, clothes, skins, sacks, anything you use. Put them in water till evening, and they’ll be clean. 	Lev 11:29-32

33“Any clay container that one of these ceremonially unclean things falls into is ceremonially unclean. Break it. 34Any food in it that water gets on is likewise unclean. Water or any liquid a person might drink in any container becomes unclean. 35Anything that part of their carcass falls on becomes unclean. Smash an oven or stove; they’re permanently unclean. 36A spring or cistern that collects water is clean even though the one that has touched their carcasses is unclean. 37If any part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing, it’s clean. 38But, if water gets on that seed, it’s ceremonially unclean.	Lev 11:33-38

39“If an animal dies that you have for food, touching its carcass makes you ceremonially unclean till evening. 40If you pick it up or eat some of it, wash your clothes and be unclean till evening. 	Lev 11:39-40

41“Don’t eat anything that crawls on the ground: 42anything that crawls on its belly, walks on four legs, or has many feet is detestable. 43Don’t make yourselves ceremonially unclean by them. 44Consecrate yourselves and be holy. 45I’m the LORD that brought you up from Egypt to be your God. Be holy because I’m holy.”

46That’s the law about animals, birds, marine life, or what crawls on the ground 47so you can distinguish ceremonially clean from unclean, edible from not edible.	Lev 11:41-47

Purification After Childbirth

12:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“When a woman has a boy, she’s ceremonially unclean for a week like during her menstruation. 3On the eighth day, circumcise his foreskin. 4For 33 more days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth. She’s not to touch anything consecrated or enter the sanctuary until after her purification time. 5If she has a girl, she’s ceremonially unclean for two weeks like during menstruation. For 66 more days, she’ll be impure from her bleeding at childbirth.	 Lev 12:1-5

6“When her purification days are over for a son or daughter, she’ll take to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering. 7He’ll offer it to the LORD for her purification, and she’ll be ceremonially cleansed from her bleeding at childbirth. That’s the law for a woman that has a male or female child. 8If she can’t afford a lamb, she can take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a burnt offering, the other for a sin offering. The priest will offer them for her, and she’ll be ceremonially clean.” 	Lev 12:6-8

Tests for Serious Skin Diseases

13:1The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

2“When any of you has a swelling, rash, or skin discoloration that could become leprous, go to Aaron the priest or one of his sons as priests. 3He’ll examine the spot. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin, it’s leprosy. The priest will pronounce you unclean. 4But if the discoloration doesn’t appear to go that deep and the hair on it hasn’t turned white, the priest will quarantine you for a week 5and examine it on the seventh day. If the spot has changed or spread, he’ll quarantine you for another week 6and examine it again. If the spot has faded and not spread, he’ll pronounce you ceremonially clean; it’s just a rash. Wash your clothes and be clean.

Lev 13:1-6

7“But if the rash spreads, go to the priest again, 8and he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s leprosy.

9“If you get leprosy, you need to go to the priest 10to be examined. If there’s a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and there are open sores in the swelling, 11it’s chronic leprosy. The priest will pronounce you unclean. He won’t quarantine because you’re definitely unclean. 12If the leprosy spreads from head to toe, 13he’ll pronounce you clean if it has all turned to normal skin color. 14But if open sores appear, 15it’s leprosy. 16If the open sores turn to normal skin color again, 17the priest will pronounce you clean.	Lev 13:7-17

18“When a boil heals 19and a discoloration or reddish-white swelling comes up in its place, show it to the priest. 20If it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair on it has turned white, he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s leprosy that has broken out in the boil. 21But if there aren’t any white hairs in it, it’s not deeper than the skin, and it’s faded, you’ll quarantine for a week. 22If it spreads, the priest will pronounce you unclean; it’s an infection. 23But if the discoloration doesn’t spread, it’s just a scar from the boil. You’re clean.	 Lev 13:18-23

24“If your body gets a burn on the skin and an open sore becomes a bright white or reddish-white spot, 25the priest needs to examine it. If the hair in the bright spot has turned white and appears to be deeper than the skin, it’s leprosy that broke out of the burn. He’ll pronounce you unclean. 26If there’s no white hair in the bright spot and it’s no deeper than the skin, but has faded, you’ll quarantine for a week. 27The priest will examine you on the seventh day. If it spreads on the skin, he’ll declare you unclean; it’s leprosy. 28But if the bright spot doesn’t spread, but has faded, it’s the swelling from the burn. The priest will declare you clean; it’s just a scar from the burn.	 Lev 13:24-28

29“If any of you, man or woman, has an infection on the head—or in the beard, 30the priest needs to examine it. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and there’s thin yellowish hair in it, he’ll pronounce you unclean. It’s a sore, leprosy of the head or beard. 31But if it appears to be no deeper than the skin and there’s no black hair in it, quarantine for a week. 32On the seventh day, the priest will examine it. If the sore hasn’t spread, no yellowish hair has grown in it, and the scale appears to be no deeper than the skin, 33then shave except for the spot and quarantine for another week. 34On the seventh day, the priest will examine it. If the spot hasn’t spread and doesn’t appear to be deeper than the skin, he’ll pronounce you clean. 35If the spot spreads after that cleansing, 36the priest need not look for yellowish hair; you’re definitely unclean. 37If the priest thinks the spot hasn’t spread and black hairs have grown in it, the sore has healed. He’ll pronounce you ceremonially clean.

38“If any of you, man or woman, has a white bright spot on the skin, 39the priest needs to examine it. If it’s faint white, it’s eczema breaking out on the skin. You’re ceremonially clean.	 Lev 13:29-39

40“If a man loses his hair and becomes bald; he’s clean. 41If his head becomes bald in the front and temples and he’s bald on the forehead; he’s clean. 42But if a reddish infection occurs on the bald head or brow, it’s leprosy breaking out. 43The priest needs to examine him. If the swelling is reddish white, 44he has leprosy. The priest will pronounce him unclean; it’s an infection.  	Lev 13:40-44

45“If you’re a leper, you need to tear your clothes, uncover your head, cover your upper lip, and call out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’  46You’re unclean as long as you have the infection. Live outside the camp apart from the rest of society.

Regulations About Mildew

47When a piece of wool or linen cloth or clothes has mildew on it 48as well as on any leather article, 49if the mark is greenish or reddish, show it to the priest. 50He’ll examine it and quarantine it for a week. 51Then he’ll examine it on the seventh day. If it has spread, it’s infectious and unclean. 52Burn it.	 Lev 13:45-52

53“But if the spot hasn’t spread, 54the priest will have them wash it. He’ll quarantine it for another week 55and examine it again. If the spot hasn’t changed color, it’s unclean even though it hasn’t spread. Burn it whether the spot is on the front or back.

56“If the priest examines it and the spot has faded after it was washed, he’ll remove it from the cloth or leather article. 57If it appears again in the piece of cloth or leather article, it’s an outbreak. Burn the article. 58A piece of clothes that loses the spot after it’s been washed will be washed a second time and be clean.”

59That’s the law for pronouncing clean or unclean a spot of mildew on any leather article or piece of wool or linen cloth. 	Lev 13:53-59

Cleansing from Skin Diseases

14:1The LORD told Moses,

2“This is the law about lepers that are ceremonially cleansed. Take them to the priest 3outside the camp to see if the leprosy has healed. 4He’ll give orders to take two live clean birds, cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop. 5He’ll have one bird killed in a clay basin over running water. 6He’ll take the live bird, the cedar wood, scarlet string, and hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird killed over running water. 7Then he’ll sprinkle seven times the one to be cleansed, pronounce the person ceremonially clean, and let the live bird go free in an open field. 8The ones cleansed will wash their clothes, shave off their hair, take a bath, and be clean. Afterwards they can go into the camp, but they’ll stay outside the tent for a week. 9On the seventh day, they’ll shave off their hair, beard, and eyebrows; wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean.     	 Lev 14:1-9

10“On the eighth day, the one cleansed will take 2 male lambs without defect, a yearling ewe without defect, .33 bushel .3 ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, and 1 pint 1 log of oil. 11The priest will present them and the person to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 12The priest will bring 1 male lamb for a guilt offering with the pint 1 log of olive oil and present them as a wave offering. 13He’ll slaughter the male lamb where they slaughter the sin offering and burnt offering, because the guilt offering (like the sin offering) is for the priest; it’s most holy. 14He’s to take some blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed. 15He’ll pour some of the pint log of olive oil into his left palm, 16dip his right-hand finger in it, and sprinkle it seven times in front of the LORD. 17Some of the oil still in his palm he’ll put on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed—on top of the blood from the guilt offering. 18The rest of the oil in his palm goes on the head of the one to be cleansed. 19Next, he’ll offer the sin offering to atone for the person. Last, he’ll slaughter the burnt offering 20and offer it up with the grain offering on the altar. Then the person will be ceremonially clean.	 Lev 14:10-20

21“But someone that’s poor can take 1 male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering for atonement, .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a pint log of oil, 22and two turtledoves or young pigeons. One will be a sin offering, the other a burnt offering. 23On the eighth day the person will take them to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 24The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the pint log of olive oil and offer them for a wave offering to the LORD. 25He’ll slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and put some of its blood on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed. 26He’ll pour some of the olive oil into his left palm 27and with his right-hand finger sprinkle it seven times to the LORD. 28He’s to put some of it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the one to be cleansed—on top of the blood from the guilt offering. 29The rest of the oil that’s in his palm goes on the head of the one to be cleansed. 30Then he’ll offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, 31one for a sin offering, the other for a burnt offering—together with the grain offering. The priest will purify the one to be cleansed.”

32That’s the law for ceremonially cleansing someone with limited means who had a skin infection. 	Lev 14:21-32

Cleansing from Mildew

33The LORD said further to Moses and Aaron,

34“When you go to Canaan and I put mildew on a house, 35the owner will tell the priest, ‘Something like mildew has become visible in my house.’ 36The priest will have them empty the house before he goes in to look at the spot so everything in the house won’t become unclean. 37He’ll go in and look at it. If the mark on the walls has greenish or reddish depressions, and appears deeper than the surface, 38he’ll come to the door and quarantine the house for a week. 39On the seventh day, he’ll inspect the house again. If the spot has spread on the walls, 40he’ll have them tear out the stones with the spot on them and dump them at an unclean place outside the city. 41He’ll have them scrape off all the plaster in the house and dump it at an unclean place outside the city. 42Then they’ll replace the first stones and re-plaster the house. 	Lev 14:33-42

43“If the spot shows up again 44and the priest sees it has spread, it’s toxic and unclean. 45He’ll have them tear the house down—its stones, timbers, and plaster—and dump them outside the city in an unclean place. 46Whoever goes into the house during the quarantine, becomes unclean till evening. 47Likewise, whoever eats or lies down in the house will wash their clothes. 	Lev 14:43-47

48“But, if the priest inspects the house and the spot hasn’t reappeared after being re-plastered, he’ll pronounce it ceremonially clean. 49To cleanse the house, he’ll take two birds, some cedar wood, a scarlet string, and hyssop, 50and kill one bird in a clay basin over running water. 51He’ll take the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet string, and live bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water and sprinkle the house seven times. 52He’ll cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and running water, along with the live bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet string. 53However, he’ll let the live bird loose outside the city in an open field. That way he’ll purify the house, and it’ll be ceremonially clean.”

54That’s the law for any skin disease, scabby sores, 55mildew on clothes or a house, 56a swelling, rash, or discolored skin—57to determine when they’re ceremonially clean or unclean.

Lev 14:48-57

Discharges That Cause Uncleanness

15:1-2The LORD told Moses and Aaron to say to Israel,

“When a man has a discharge from his body, it’s ceremonially unclean 3whether it keeps flowing or stops on its own. 4Anything he lies on or sits on is unclean. 5-6If any of you touch his bed or anything he sits on, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 7Any of you that touch a person with a discharge will do the same and be unclean till evening. 8If someone with a discharge spits on any of you that are clean, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 9Any saddle a person with a discharge rides on is unclean. 10If any of you touch anything what was under him, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 11Likewise, if the one with the discharge touches any of you without rinsing his hands, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 12Break any clay container he touches and rinse any wooden container in water.  	Lev 15:1-12

13“To become ceremonially clean, a man with a discharge will count off a week for his cleansing. He’ll wash his clothes and take a bath in running water and be clean. 14On the eighth day, he’ll take two turtledoves or young pigeons, and give them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 15The priest will offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. He’ll purify him from his discharge before the LORD.	Lev 15:13-15

16“If a man has a discharge of semen, he’ll take a bath and be ceremonially unclean till evening. 17He’ll wash any piece of clothes or leather that has semen on it, and it’ll be unclean till evening. 18If a man has relations with a woman so that there’s an emission of semen, they’ll both take a bath and be unclean till evening.	 Lev 15:16-18

19“When a woman has her period, she’ll be in her menstrual impurity for a week. If any of you touch her, you’ll be ceremonially unclean till evening. 20Anything she lies on or sits on is unclean. [21] 22-23If any of you touch anything she sits on or lies on, wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 24If a man has relations with her during her period, he’ll be unclean for a week, and any bed he lies on will be unclean.	 Lev 15:19-24

25“If a woman has a discharge of blood many days outside her period or beyond her period, she’ll be ceremonially unclean like during her period. 26Any bed she lies on or anything she sits on is unclean like during her period. 27If any of you touch them, you’ll be unclean. Wash your clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 28To become clean from her discharge, she’ll count off a week; afterward she’ll be clean. 29On the eighth day, she’ll take two turtledoves or young pigeons, and take them in to the priest, to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 30He’ll offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to purify her.

31“That’s how you’ll keep Israelites separated from their ceremonial uncleanness so they won’t die for defiling my Tabernacle.”

32That law deals with anyone that has a discharge: a man that has an emission of semen, 33a woman during her period, a man that lies with an unclean woman.	Lev 15:25-33

Tshe Day of Atonement

16:1After Aaron’s two sons died from approaching the LORD, he told Moses,

2“Tell your brother Aaron not to enter the Holy Place at just any time—the place inside the curtain in front of the Mercy Seat that’s on the Ark. He’ll die because I’ll appear in the cloud above the mercy seat. 3He’ll enter the Holy Place with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 4After he takes a bath, he can put on the linen holy vestments: the tunic, underclothes, sash, and turban. 5He’s to take from the community 2 male goats for a sin offering and 1 ram for a burnt offering. 6He’ll offer the bull for the sin offering to atone for himself and his family, 7and present the 2 goats at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 8He’ll cast lots for them, one for the LORD, the other as a scapegoat. 9Then he’ll offer the one as a sin offering to the LORD 10and present the other one alive to the LORD to make atonement by sending it into the open country.

Lev 16:1-10

11“Aaron will slaughter the bull as a sin offering to atone for himself and his family. 12He’ll take a firepan of coals from the altar that’s in front of the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense and carry them inside the curtain. 13When he puts the incense on the fire, a cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat so he won’t die. 14With his finger, seven times he’ll sprinkle the bull’s blood in front of the Mercy Seat. 	Lev 16:11-14

15“Then he’ll slaughter the goat as a sin offering for the people and take its blood inside the curtain. He’ll do with its blood what he did with the bull’s blood. 16He’ll atone for the Holy Place because of the Israelites’ impurities, transgressions, and sins. He is to do the same thing for the Tent of Meeting that stands with them among their impurities. 17When he makes atonement in the Holy Place, nobody will be in the Tent of Meeting till he comes back out, so he can atone for himself, his family, and the whole assembly. 18Then he’ll go out to the altar that’s in front of the LORD and atone for it by putting some of the bull’s and goat’s blood on the horns of the altar. 19With his finger he’ll sprinkle blood on it seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the impurities of the Israelites.

Lev 16:15-19

20“When he finishes atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he’ll offer the live goat. 21He’ll put both hands on its head and confess over it the Israelites’ iniquities, transgressions, and sins. He’ll put them on the goat’s head and send it into the open country by a man standing by. 22The goat will carry their sins to a solitary place, and the man will release it.	 Lev 16:20-22

23“Then Aaron will come into the Tent of Meeting, change out of the linen vestments, and leave them there. 24He’ll take a bath in a holy place, put on his own clothes, and come out to offer burnt offerings to atone for himself and the people. 25He’ll offer up in smoke the fat from the sin offering on the altar. 26The one that released the scapegoat will wash his clothes and take a bath. Then he can come into camp. 27But take outside the camp the bull and goat for the sin offering—whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place. Burn their hides, meat, and refuse. 28The one that burns them will wash his clothes and take a bath before he comes back into camp.	Lev 16:23-28

29“This is a permanent statute: the tenth day, seventh month, you and any foreigner living among you will fast and not work. 30That day, the priest will atone for your sins in front of the LORD. 31It’s a fast and solemn rest for you. 32The priest that’s anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s place will make atonement. He’ll put on the holy linen vestments 33and atone for the holy sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting, the altar, the priests, and the whole assembly. 34That’s a permanent statute to atone for the Israelites’ sins once a year.”

Moses did what the LORD said. 	Lev 16:29-34

Prohibition Against Eating Blood

17:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron, his sons, and all Israel,

“The LORD has commanded 3that no one in Israel is to slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat inside or outside the camp 4instead of taking it to the Tent of Meeting to present it to Yahveh. God will hold him guilty of shedding blood. Exclude him from the community. 5Instead, people need to take their animals to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as peace offerings. 6The priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and offer up the fat in smoke as an aroma pleasing to Yahveh. 7They’ll no longer sacrifice to the goat-idols they commit prostitution with. That’s a permanent statute. 	Lev 17:1-7

8“Anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice 9without taking it to the LORD, will be excluded from the community.

10“I’ll oppose and exclude from the community anyone in Israel or a foreigner living there who eats blood. 11The life is in the blood, and I’ve given it to you on the altar to atone for you. It’s the lifeblood that atones.” 12I told Israel, “Nobody among you or foreigner among you can eat blood. 13When you hunt an animal or bird that can be eaten, drain out its blood and cover it with dirt.

Lev 17:8-13

14“In all kinds of flesh, blood is identified with its life; so I told the Israelites not to eat blood. If any of you eat it, you’ll be excluded from the community. 15Whether native or foreign, if you eat an animal that has died or wild animals have torn to pieces, wash your clothes, take a bath, and remain ceremonially unclean till evening. 16If you don’t do that, you’re considered guilty.”   	Lev 17:14-16

Forbidden Sexual Behaviors

18:1-2The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“I’m the LORD your God. 3Don’t do what they do in Egypt where you lived or in Canaan where I’m taking you. Don’t follow their statutes. 4If you obey my regulations and keep my statutes, 5you’ll have life.	 Lev 18:1-5

6“Don’t have sexual relations with any blood relative; I’m the LORD. 7Don’t uncover the nakedness of your father by uncovering the nakedness of your mother 8or your father’s wife. 9Don’t have sexual relations with your sister or half-sister, born in your home or elsewhere. 10Don’t uncover the nakedness of your granddaughter; her nakedness is your nakedness. [11] 12-14Don’t uncover the nakedness of your aunt; she’s your parent’s blood relative. You uncover your uncle’s nakedness by approaching his wife. 15Don’t have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law; she’s your son’s wife. 16Don’t have sexual relations with your sister-in-law; it’s your brother’s nakedness. 17Don’t uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter or granddaughter; they’re blood relatives. It’s sinful. 18Don’t marry a woman and her sister and they become rivals.	 Lev 18:6-18

19“Don’t have sexual relations with a woman during her period. 20Don’t have sexual relations with your neighbor’s wife and be defiled with her. 21Don’t offer any of your offspring to Molech or profane your God; I’m the LORD. 22Don’t lie with a male as one lies with a female; it’s detestable. 23Don’t have sexual relations with any animal; you defile yourself. No woman is to stand in front of an animal to mate with it; it’s perverse.  	Lev 18:19-23

24“Don’t defile yourselves with such things. The nations I’m chasing out ahead of you defiled themselves that way. 25They’ve defiled the land; so I’ve brought punishment on it; it has spewed out its people. 26You are to keep my statutes and judgments; no native or foreigner among you is to do any of those disgusting things. [27] 28That’s so the land won’t spew you out for defiling it. 29Exclude from the community whoever does any of those disgusting things. 30“You’re to keep my charge so you won’t defile yourselves. I’m the LORD your God.” 	Lev 18:24-30

Laws About Personal Holiness

19:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell the whole community of Israel,

“Be holy because I’m holy. 3Respect your parents and keep my Sabbaths. 4Don’t turn to idols or make molten gods. I’m the LORD your God.

5“When you offer a peace offering to the LORD, offer it so he’ll accept it. 6Eat it the day you offer it and the next day. Burn what’s left over till the third day. 7If you eat it on the third day, the LORD won’t accept it. 8You’ll be guilty of profaning what’s holy to him and be excluded from the community.	  Lev 19:1-8

9“When you harvest, don’t harvest the corners of your field or pick up the gleanings of your harvest. 10Don’t glean your vineyard or pick up its fallen fruit. Leave it for the needy and foreigners. I’m the LORD your God.

11“Don’t steal, lie, or deal falsely with one another. 12Don’t swear falsely by me and profane my name.

13“Don’t oppress or rob anyone or keep a hired hand’s wages overnight. 14Don’t curse the deaf or trip the blind. Respect your God. I’m the LORD.

Lev 19:9-14

15“Be just when you judge. Don’t be partial to the poor or defer to someone with status. Judge fairly. 16Don’t slander or act against anyone’s life.

17“You can reprove but not sin against or hate a fellow citizen. 18Don’t take revenge or bear a grudge. Love your neighbor as yourself.	 Lev 19:15-18

19“Keep my statutes. Don’t crossbreed two kinds of cattle, sow your field with two kinds of seed, or wear a piece of clothes that blends two kinds of material. 20If a man lies carnally with a slave woman that’s engaged to another man but not yet redeemed or given her freedom, punish them. Don’t put them to death; she wasn’t free. 21He’ll take a ram to the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 22The priest will atone for him with the ram, and he will be forgiven.

Lev 19:19-22

23“When you go into the land and plant fruit trees, consider their fruit forbidden for three years. 24In the fourth year, their fruit will be holy, a praise offering to the LORD. 25The fifth year, you can eat it so it’ll increase for you. I’m the LORD your God.

26“Don’t eat anything with blood in it or practice fortunetelling or soothsaying.

27“Don’t trim off the hair on your temples or trim the edges of your beard.

28“Don’t make cuts on your body for the dead or wear tattoos. I’m the LORD. 	Lev 19:23-28

29“Don’t profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, so your country won’t fall into prostitution and fill up with lewdness.

30“Keep my Sabbaths and respect my sanctuary.

31“Don’t defile yourself by appealing to mediums or spiritualists.

32“Stand up for the gray headed, honor the aged, respect God.

33“Don’t mistreat foreigners living in your country. 34Treat them like the natives among you. Love them like yourself. You were foreigners in Egypt. I’m the LORD your God.

35“Don’t cheat in judgment in measuring weight or volume. 36Have accurate balances, weights, ephahs, and hins. 37Observe my statutes and ordinances. I’m the LORD that brought you out of Egypt.”	Lev 19:29-37

Punishments for Sin

20:1-2The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“Stone to death people that sacrifice their offspring to Molech. 3I’ll oppose them and exclude them from the community; they’ve defiled my sanctuary and my holy name. 4If you don’t execute them, 5I’ll oppose them and their families, and exclude both them and the ones that carried on prostitution with them.

6“I’ll oppose people that turn to mediums or spiritualists and carry on prostitution with them. I’ll exclude them from the community. 7-8So consecrate yourselves and be holy. Practice my statutes because I’m the LORD that sanctifies you.

9“Exclude from the community anyone that cusses at father or mother. That’s a crime punishable by death. 	Lev 20:1-9

10“If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife, execute them both. 11A man that lies with his father’s wife, has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Execute them both. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. 12If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, execute them both; they’ve committed incest. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. 13A man that lies with a male like the ones that lie with a woman—both of them have committed a disgusting act. Execute them. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. 14It’s immoral for a man to marry a woman and her mother. Burn them both so there won’t be immorality among you. 15Execute a man that lies with an animal and kill the animal. 16Execute any woman that approaches an animal to mate with it; kill the animal. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death. 	Lev 20:10-16

17“It’s a disgrace for a man to take his sister—his father’s or mother’s daughter—so he sees her nakedness and she sees his. Exclude them from the community. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness. He bears his guilt. 18A man that lies with a menstruating woman has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood. Cut both of them off from the community. 19Don’t have sexual relations with your aunt; you’ve made naked a blood relative. You’ll be guilty. 20A man that lies with his uncle’s wife has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They’ll bear their sin and die childless. 21A man that takes his brother’s wife is repulsive; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. Both will die childless. 	Lev 20:17-21

22“Keep my statutes and ordinances so the land where I’m taking you won’t spew you out. 23Don’t follow the customs of nations I drive out ahead of you. It’s because they did those things that they’re repulsive to me. 24Take their land; I’ll give it to you, a land flowing with milk and honey. 25So distinguish between ceremonially clean and unclean animals or birds. Don’t make yourselves disgusting by animals, birds, or what crawls on the ground that I’ve separated from you as unclean. 26Be holy to me because I, the LORD, am holy. I’ve set you apart from the nations to be mine.

27“Stone a medium or spiritualist, man or woman. They’ve committed a crime punishable by death.”	Lev 20:22-27

Instructions for Priests

21:1The LORD told Moses to tell the sons of Aaron the priests,

“None of you are to defile yourselves for a dead person 2except for a close relative: mother, father, son, daughter, brother—3or virgin sister, since she doesn’t have a husband. 4Don’t profane yourselves as a relative by marriage. 5Don’t shave your heads, trim your beards, or make cuts on your bodies. 6Be holy to your God and not profane him, because you present the offerings by fire to the LORD, the food of your God. 7Priests can’t marry a prostitute or divorced woman. They’re holy to God”

8“Consecrate them because they offer the food of your God. They’ll be holy to you because I, the LORD, that sanctifies you am holy. 9If a priest’s daughter profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father. Burn her.

Lev 21:1-9

10“A high priest—the one that’s anointed and consecrated to wear the vestments—will not uncover his head or tear his clothes, 11approach any dead person or defile himself even for his father or mother. 12He’s not to leave the sanctuary or profane it, because he has on him God’s consecrating oil. 13He has to marry a virgin from his own people. 14He can’t marry a widow, divorced woman, or prostitute; 15he would profane his offspring among his people. I’m the LORD that sanctifies him.”					    eHe

Lev 21:10-15

16-17The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron,

“None of your offspring with a defect can offer the bread of his God: 18a blind or lame man, one with a disfigured face or deformed limb, 19a man with a broken foot or hand, 20a hunchback or dwarf, one with a defect in his eye, one with eczema, scabs, or crushed testicles. 21None of your descendants that has a defect can offer the LORD’s offerings by fire. 22He can eat the bread of his God, holy and most holy, 23but he can’t go in to the curtain or approach the altar. He’s not to profane my sanctuary. I’m the LORD that sanctifies him.”

24That’s what Moses told Aaron, his sons, and all Israel.	 Lev 21:16-24

22:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron and his sons,

“Handle the holy gifts carefully that the Israelites dedicate to me so you don’t profane my name. 3Don’t approach the holy gifts while you’re ceremonially unclean. I’ll remove you from me. 4If you’re a leper or have a discharge, you can’t eat the holy gifts till you’re clean. Touching anything made ceremonially unclean by a corpse or seminal emission, 5or touching any teeming thing that makes any person unclean, 6makes you unclean till evening. You can’t eat the sacred gifts till you take a bath. 7When the sun sets, you’ll be clean and can eat them. 8You can’t eat an animal that dies or is torn to pieces by wild animals; that makes you ceremonially unclean. 9Keep my charge so you won’t be considered defiled and die for profaning my name. I’m the LORD that sanctifies them.

Lev 22:1-9

10“No layman, visitor with a priest, or hired hand can eat the sacred gifts. 11But a slave that a priest buys with his own money can eat them; so can slaves born in his house. 12If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she can’t continue to eat the gifts. 13But if she becomes a widow or is divorced, doesn’t have any children, and goes back to her father’s family, she can eat her father’s food. 14If any of you laymen unintentionally eat a sacred gift, add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. 15Laymen are not to profane the sacred gift Israelites offer to the LORD; 16so they’re fined for it. I’m the LORD that sanctifies them.’”	 Lev 22:10-16

Unacceptable Sacrifices

17-18The LORD told Moses to tell Aaron, his sons, and all Israel:

“When an Israelite or foreigner presents a burnt offering, an offering for fulfilling a vow, or a freewill offering, 19for God to accept it, it must be a male without defect from the cattle, sheep, or goats. 20Don’t offer anything that has a defect. 21When anyone sacrifices a peace offering to the LORD to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering from the herd or flock, it must be perfect. 22Don’t offer a blind, crippled, or injured animal, or one with a running sore, eczema, or scab. Don’t make it an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD.  23An ox or lamb that has an enlarged or undersized member, you can present for a freewill offering, but not for a vow. 24Don’t offer anything that has its testicles bruised, crushed, torn to pieces by wild animals, or castrated. 25Don’t accept anything like that from a foreigner for an offering as the food of your God. It has a defect; he won’t accept it.”	 Lev 22:17-25

26The LORD told Moses,

27“A newborn ox, sheep, or goat will remain with its mother for a week. After that it’s acceptable as an offering by fire to the LORD. 28But don’t slaughter an ox or sheep and its young the same day. 29When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, do it so he will accept you. 30Eat it the same day; don’t leave any till morning. 31Keep my commandments that way. 32Don’t profane my holy name; treat me as holy in Israel. I’m the LORD that sanctifies you, 33who brought you out of Egypt to be your God.” 	Lev 22:26-33

Sabbaths and Festivals

23:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

Sabbaths

“The LORD has appointed these times: 3six days you can work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath for complete rest, a holy convocation. It’s a Sabbath to the LORD wherever you live.

4“These are his appointed times, holy convocations that you’ll declare at their appointed times. 5The fourteenth day, first month at twilight is the LORD’s Passover. 6Then on the fifteenth, there’s a Festival of Unleavened Bread to him. Eat bread without yeast for a week. 7The first day, hold a holy convocation; don’t work. 8Present an offering by fire to the LORD for a week. On the seventh day, hold a holy convocation; don’t work.”	 Lev 23:1-8

Firstfruits

9-10The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“When you harvest the land I’m giving you, take a bundle of the first part of the harvest to the priest. 11The day after Sabbath he’ll wave it back and forth in front of the LORD for you to be accepted. 12When you wave it, offer a male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering. 13Its grain offering will be .22 bushel .2 ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil, an offering by fire to the LORD for a pleasing aroma, with its liquid offering, 3pts ¼ hin of wine. 14Before you take the offering to your God, don’t eat bread or roasted grain from the new growth. It’s an ongoing permanent statute wherever you live.	 Lev 23:9-14

Feast of Weeks

15“Count seven Sabbaths from the day after the Sabbath when you brought the bundle for the wave offering. 16Count 50 days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then present a new grain offering to the LORD. 17Take in 2 loaves of bread for a wave offering, made from .22 bushel .2 ephah. They’ll consist of fine flour baked with yeast as the first of the harvest to the LORD.

18Along with the bread, present 7 year-old male lambs without defect, a bull from the herd, and 2 rams. They’ll be a burnt offering along with their grain offering and liquid offerings. It’s an offering by fire of an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 19Also offer 1 male goat for a sin offering and 2 yearling male lambs for a peace offering. 20The priest will wave them with the bread from the first part of the harvest for a wave offering with 2 lambs in front of the LORD. They’re holy to the LORD for the priest. 21On that same day, make a proclamation. Hold a holy convocation. Don’t work. It’s an ongoing permanent statute wherever you live.

22“When you harvest, don’t harvest the corners of your field or gather the gleanings from your harvest. Leave them for the poor and foreigners. I’m the LORD your God.”	 Lev 23:15-22

Feast of Trumpets

23-24Again the LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“The first day, seventh month, hold a complete rest, a reminder by blowing bugles, a holy convocation. 25Don’t work but present an offering by fire to the LORD.”	Lev 23:23-25

Day of Atonement

26The LORD told Moses,

27-28“The tenth day, seventh month, is The Day of Atonement, a holy convocation. Fast and don’t work; present an offering by fire to the LORD to atone for yourselves to the LORD your God. 29Any of you that won’t fast 30and refrain from working that day, I’ll destroy from among the people. 31It’s a permanent statute wherever you live. 32On the ninth of the month at evening, rest till the next evening.”	Lev 23:26-32

Feast of Tabernacles

33-34Again the LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“The fifteenth day, seventh month is the Festival of Booths to the LORD for a week. 35The first day is a holy convocation. Don’t do any kind of work. 36For a week, present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day, hold a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD.

37“These are the LORD’s scheduled holidays that you’re to declare as holy convocations, to present burnt offerings to the LORD, grain offerings, sacrifices, and liquid offerings, each day’s matter as prescribed. 38They’re in addition to the ones on the LORD’s Sabbaths.	 Lev 23:33-38

39“The fifteenth day, seventh month, when you’ve gathered your crops, celebrate the LORD’s festival for a week. Rest on the first and eighth days. 40-41On the first day, take the foliage from beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows by the stream. Every year celebrate a festival to the LORD your God for a week. It’s an ongoing permanent statute for the seventh month. 42The native-born in Israel will live in booths for a week 43to remind your generations that I had the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt. I’m the LORD your God.”

44Moses declared to Israel the LORD’s specified holidays. 	Lev 23:39-44

Pure Oil and Holy Bread

24:1The LORD said to Moses,

2“Tell the people to bring you clear oil from pressed olives that can keep a lamp burning continually. 3-4Outside the curtain of Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron will keep the lamps on the lampstand in order from evening to morning continually. It’s an ongoing permanent statute.

5“Take fine flour and bake 12 cakes. Put .22 bushels .2 ephah in each one. 6Set them in two stacks, six to a stack on the pure gold table. 7Put pure frankincense beside each stack for the bread as God’s portion, an offering by fire to the LORD. 8Every Sabbath Aaron will set this bread in order in front of the LORD, a permanent covenant for Israel. 9It’ll be for Aaron and his sons to eat in a sacred place. It’s the most sacred to them from the LORD’s offerings by fire, their permanent portion.”  	Lev 24:1-9

A Blasphemer Stoned

10The son of an Israelite woman and Egyptian father went out among the people and got into a fight with an Israelite man in the camp. 11The woman’s son blasphemed the Name and cursed; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, tribe of Dan.) 12They put him in custody till the LORD made his commandment clear to Moses.

13The LORD told Moses,

14“Take him outside the camp. The ones who heard him will put their hands on his head and the community will stone him. 15Tell the people, ‘If anybody curses God, he’s considered guilty. 16The community is to stone anybody that blasphemes the LORD.

17“Execute a murderer, 18but anybody that kills an animal will make it good, life for life. 19If one person injures another, do the same thing to that person: 20fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.  [21] 22There’ll be one standard for you and a foreigner. I’m the LORD your God.”

23Moses told the people, and they took outside the camp the one that had cursed, and stoned him.

Lev 24:10-23

The Sabbath Year

25:1-2The LORD told Moses at Mount Sinai to tell Israel,

“When you go into the land I’m giving you, the ground will have a rest to the LORD. 3Plant your fields, prune your vineyards, harvest your crops for six years. 4But the seventh year, the ground will rest to the LORD. Don’t plant your fields or prune your vineyards. 5Don’t store up volunteer growth or gather grapes from untrimmed vines. Let the ground lie feral for a year. 6You’ll have for food what the ground grows on its own during its sabbath year—yourselves, your male and female slaves, hired hands, and foreigners living with you. 7Your livestock and the wild animals on your land will have its produce to eat directly.   Lev 25:1-7

The Year of Jubilee

8“Count off 7 weeks of years (49 years). 9Then blow the ram’s horn all over the country on the tenth day, seventh month, the Day of Atonement. 10Consecrate the fiftieth year as a nation-wide release for its people, a jubilee. You’ll go back to your own property and family. 11Don’t plant, store up volunteer growth, or pick clean the untrimmed vines. 12It’s a Year of Jubilee, set aside for you. Eat its produce directly out of the field. 	Lev 25:8-12

13“In the Year of Jubilee, each of you may go back to your own property. 14If you sell or buy something from one another, don’t wrong one another. 15Corresponding to the number of years since the last Year of Jubilee, you’ll buy and sell it based on the number of crops. 16Calculate its price by the number of crops you’re buying or selling. 17Don’t cheat one another; respect God. I’m the LORD your God.  	Lev 25:13-17

18“In that way, observe my statutes and obey my regulations so you can live securely on the land. 19Then the ground will yield its produce so you can eat your fill. 20But if you wonder what you’re going to eat in the seventh year if you don’t plant or harvest crops, 21I’ll order my blessing for you in the sixth year so the ground will produce a crop sufficient for three years. 22When you’re planting the eighth year, you’ll still be eating from the old crops till the ninth year’s crop comes in.    	Lev 25:18-22

23“You can’t sell land permanently because it’s mine. You’re foreigners that live temporarily with me. 24So provide for the redemption of every piece of property. 25If you become so poor you have to sell some of your property, your nearest relative can buy it back. 26If you don’t have any relatives but accumulate enough, you have the right to buy it back yourself. 27To reclaim it, calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance. 28If you don’t accumulate enough to buy it back, it remains with the buyer till the Year of Jubilee and then reverts to you.	 Lev 25:23-28

29“If you sell a house in a walled city, you have a right to buy it back for a full year. 30If you don’t buy it back within a year, it passes permanently to the buyer; it doesn’t go back to you in the Year of Jubilee. 31Houses in villages without walls, however, are like property in the open country; you can buy them back, and they revert to you in the Year of Jubilee. 32In Levitical towns, Levites have an ongoing right to buy back their houses, 33and their houses revert to them in the Year of Jubilee. Their houses are their possessions among the Israelites, 34but they can’t sell pastures attached to their towns; they’re permanent possessions. 	Lev 25:29-34

35“If citizens become poor, sustain them like foreigners or temporary residents so they can keep living with you. 36Don’t charge them interest; respect God. 37Don’t lend them your silver or food at interest. 38I’m the LORD your God that brought you out of Egypt to give you Canaan and be your God. 	Lev 25:35-38

39“If citizens become so poor that they sell themselves to you, don’t subject them to slavery. 40Till the Year of Jubilee, treat them like hired hands or foreigners with you. 41Then they and their offspring will go back to their family and ancestors’ property. 42They’re my servants that I brought out of Egypt. Don’t sell them in the slave trade. 43Don’t rule them harshly; respect me. 44You can acquire male and female slaves from pagan nations,

45from foreigners living among you;

you can acquire possessions from the families they produce in your country; 46you can will them to your heirs and

use them as permanent slaves.

But with Israelites, don’t mistreat one another that way.	 Lev 25:39-46

47“If foreigners’ or temporary residents’ means become sufficient and any fellow citizens become so poor as to sell themselves to a foreigner or descendant living among you, 48-49they’ll have redemption rights. A brother, uncle, nephew, or other blood relative has a right to buy them back. If they prosper, they can redeem themselves. 50Then they and their purchaser will calculate from the year they sold yourselves up to the Year of jubilee. The price of their sale will correspond to that number of years. Their case will be like the time of a hired hand. 51If many years still remain for their redemption, they’ll refund their purchase price corresponding to their remaining years. 52If few years remain till the Year of Jubilee, they’ll calculate with their purchaser. In proportion to their years, they’ll refund the amount for their redemption. 53They’ll be with the purchaser like someone hired year by year, not like slaves. 54If you’re not bought back, you and your offspring will still go back free in the Year of Jubilee, 55because Israelites are my servants that I brought out of Egypt. I’m the LORD your God.”   	Lev 25:47-55

Blessings for Obedience

26:1“Don’t make idols, set up images or sacred pillars, or put stone figurines in your country to bow to. 2Keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary. 3If you follow my statutes and keep my commandments, 4I’ll give you rain in its season so the ground will grow crops and the trees will bear fruit. 5Threshing time will last till grape harvest, and grape harvest will last till planting season. You’ll have plenty to eat, and you’ll live securely in your country. 6I’ll grant peace so you can lie down without feeling afraid. I’ll eliminate dangerous wild animals from the land, and no sword will pass through your land. 7You’ll chase your enemies, and they’ll fall by your sword. 8Five of you will chase 100, and 100 will chase 10,000. 9I’ll favor you, multiply you, and confirm my covenant with you. 10You’ll eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new. 11I’ll live among you 12and be your God, and you’ll be my people. 13I’m the LORD your God that brought you out of Egypt so you wouldn’t be their slaves. I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect. 	Lev 26:1-13

Punishment for Disobedience

14“If you don’t carry out these commandments, 15if you reject my statutes, abhor my ordinances, and break my covenant, 16I’ll bring panic over you. Consumption and fever will make your eyes sink in and depress you. You’ll plant your seed for nothing because your enemies will eat it. 17I’ll oppose you, and your enemies will strike you down. The ones that hate you will rule you. You’ll run when nobody’s chasing.

18“If you still don’t obey me, I’ll punish you seven times over 19and break your strong pride. I’ll make your sky like iron and your ground like bronze. 20You’ll spend your strength for nothing, because the ground won’t grow crops and the trees won’t bear fruit.

21“If you’re still hostile toward me and refuse to obey, I’ll strike you with plague seven times over. 22I’ll let wild animals loose among you to terrorize your children, destroy your livestock, and decimate your population till your roads are deserted.

23“If you’re still hostile toward me and don’t return to me, 24I’ll be hostile toward you and strike you seven times over. 25I’ll bring on you a sword to avenge the covenant. When you retreat to your towns, I’ll send a plague and deliver you to your enemies. 26When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven and bring it to you in rations. You’ll eat and not be satisfied.

27“If you still don’t obey me, but act hostile toward me, 28I’ll act hostile toward you and punish you seven times over. 29You’ll eat your sons and daughters. 30I’ll destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols because I’ll abhor you. 31I’ll lay waste your towns too, and make your sanctuaries desolate. I won’t smell your pleasing aromas. 32I’ll make the land so desolate it will appall your enemies that settle in it. 33I’ll scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you as your land grows desolate and your towns become ruins.

34“The land will enjoy its Sabbaths during its desolation while you’re in your enemies’ country. 35It will get the rest it didn’t get on the Sabbaths while you were living in it. 36You that are left, I’ll make lose heart in your enemies’ countries. The sound of a blown leaf will chase you. You’ll run when nobody’s chasing you. 37You’ll stumble over each other and fall like you’re running from the sword, even though nobody’s chasing you. You won’t have the strength to stand up to your enemies. 38You’ll perish among the nations that consume you. 39You that are left will rot away in your enemies’ countries because of your ancestors’ sin.   	Lev 26:14-39

Future Restoration

40“If you confess your and your ancestors’ sin in your unfaithfulness and hostility toward me—41if your uncircumcised heart becomes humble and you make amends for your sin, 42I’ll remember my covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as well, and I’ll remember the land. [43] 44I won’t reject you so completely that I destroy you and break my covenant with you. 45I’ll remember the covenant with your ancestors that I brought out of Egypt in front of the nations so I could be your God. I’m the LORD.”

46The LORD established those statutes, ordinances, and laws for Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai.	Lev 26:40-46

Laws About Vows

27:1-2Again the LORD told Moses,

“When people make difficult vows, appraise them before the LORD. 3Appraise a male that’s 20 to 60 years old at 20 oz of silver 50 shekels of the sanctuary 4and a female at 12 oz 30 shekels of silver. 5Appraise a male that’s 5 to 20 years old at 8 oz 20 shekels and a female at 4 oz 10 shekels. 6Appraise a male that’s a month to 5 years old at 2 oz 5 shekels of silver and a female at 1⅕ oz 3 shekels. 7Your appraisal for males above 60 will be 6 oz 15 shekels and 4 oz 10 shekels for females. 8But if you can’t afford that appraisal, you can have the priest appraise you according to your means. 9If it’s an animal you can offer to the LORD, it will be holy. 10You won’t exchange it good for bad or vice versa. If you do exchange it, both it and the substitute become holy. 11-12But if it’s a ceremonially unclean animal, which people don’t offer to the LORD, the priest will appraise it. His appraisal is final. 13But if you ever want to buy it back, add a fifth to the appraisal.	 Lev 27:1-13

14“If you consecrate your house to the LORD, the priest will appraise it. His appraisal is final. 15But if you want to buy it back, add a fifth to the appraisal.

Lev 27:14-15

16“If you consecrate part of your field to the LORD, the priest’s appraisal will be in proportion to the seed for sowing it: 11 bushels 1 homer of barley at 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. 17If you consecrate your field in relation to the Year of Jubilee, it will stand according to the priest’s appraisal. 18If you consecrate your field after the Year of Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price in proportion to the years till the next Year of Jubilee and deduct it from its appraisal. 19If you ever want to buy it back, add a fifth to the appraisal. 20If you sell it, you can’t buy it back. 21When it reverts in the Year of Jubilee, it will be holy to the LORD like a field set apart and will belong to the priest. 22If you consecrate a field to the LORD that you’ve bought—not a part of your own property—23then the priest will calculate for it the amount of your valuation as holy to the LORD. 24In the Year of Jubilee, the field will go back to its original owner. 25Appraisals will be in shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs per shekel).	 Lev 27:16-25

26“However, you can’t consecrate firstborn animals—ox or sheep; they already belong to the LORD. 27But if it’s a ceremonially unclean animal, you can buy it back according to its appraised value plus a fifth. If you don’t buy it back, the priest will sell it for its appraised value.

28“Nevertheless, nothing devoted to the LORD —man, animal, or field—can be sold or bought back. It’s most holy. 29No one that’s been sentenced to death can be ransomed. Execute that person. 	Lev 27:26-29

Laws About Tithes

30“Set apart to the LORD a tenth of the land, produce of the ground and fruit of the trees. 31If you want to buy back part of that tenth, add a fifth to it. 32Set apart to the LORD every tenth member of a herd and flock. 33Whether it’s good or bad, you don’t need to substitute for it. If you do, both it and the substitute become holy, and you can’t buy them back.”

34Those are commandments the LORD gave Moses for Israel at Mount Sinai. 	Lev 27:30-34

NUMBERS

Census of Israel’s Troops

1:1On the first day, second month, second year after they left Egypt, the LORD told Moses at Sinai in the Tent of Meeting,

2“Take a census by families. Count the men 320 years old and up that can go to war. You and Aaron count them by armies. 4To help you, appoint one man from each tribe as head of his ancestor’s house. 5They’ll stand with you:

from Reuben, 	Elizur son of Shedeur;

6from Simeon, 	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;

7from Judah, 	Nahshon son of Amminadab;

8from Issachar, 	Nethanel son of Zuar;

9from Zebulun,	 Eliab son of Helon;

10from Joseph’s son Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud;

from Joseph’s son Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;

11from Benjamin, 	Abidan son of Gideoni;

12from Dan, 	Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;

13from Asher, 	Pagiel son of Ochran;

14from Gad, 	Eliasaph son of Deuel;

15from Naphtali, 	Ahira son of Enan.

16Those are the appointed leaders by tribes, the heads of clans in Israel.”	 Num 1:1-16

17Moses and Aaron took the men God had designated 18and gathered the community on the first day, second month. [19]

20The count came out as follows:

2146,500 from Reuben, Israel’s firstborn;

22-2359,300 from Simeon,

24-2545,650 from Gad,

26-2774,600 from Judah,

28-2954,400 from Issachar,

30-3157,400 from Zebulun,

32-3340,500 from Ephraim,

34-3532,300 from Manasseh,

36-3735,400 from Benjamin,

38-3962,700 from Dan

40-4141,500 from Asher,

42-4353,400 from Naphtali,

44-46The total was 603,550. 	Num 1:17-46

47They didn’t count the Levites in the military census. 48The LORD told Moses,

49“Don’t count the Levites. 50Put them in charge of the Tabernacle and everything associated with it. They’ll transport it and its furnishings, take care of it, and camp around it. 51When it sets out, they’ll dismantle it. When it camps, they’ll assemble it. Execute any layman that comes near. 52The Israelites will camp in groups by their standard in their armies. 53But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle so there won’t be any wrath on the Israelites. [54a]

Israel did everything the LORD commanded Moses.    	Num 1:47-54

The Layout of Israel’s Camp

2:[1] 2“The Israelites will camp with the banners of their families facing the Tent of Meeting. 3-4On the east side of the Tabernacle, Judah will camp by its standard—the army of Nahshon (74,600). 5-6Issachar will camp next to him—the army of Nethanel (54,400). 7-8Zebulun will camp with its leader Eliab (57,400). 9The Judah camp totals 186,400. It will move out first.  	Num 2:1-9

10-11“On the south side of the Tabernacle, Reuben will camp by its standard—the army of Elizur (46,500). 12-13Simeon will camp next to him—the army of Shelumiel (59,300). 14-15Gad will camp with its leader Eliasaph (45,650). 16The Reuben camp totals 151,450. It will move out second.

17“Then the Tent of Meeting will move out with the Levites in the middle of the camps.

18-19“On the west side of the Tabernacle, Ephraim will camp by its standard—the army of Elishama (40,500). 20-21Manasseh will camp next to him—with its leader Gamaliel (32,200). 22-23Benjamin camps next—the army of Abidan (35,400). 24The Ephraim camp totals 108,100. It will move out third. 	Num 2:10-24

25-26“On the north side of the Tabernacle, Dan will camp by its standard—the army of Ahiezer (62,700). 27-28Asher will camp next to him—with its leader Pagiel (41,500). 29-30Naphtali camps next—with its leader Ahira (53,400).  31The Dan camp totals 157,600. It will move out last.”

32The total men numbered 603,550, 33not including the Levites. 34The Israelites did everything the LORD told Moses. They camped by their standards and went out in that order, each by family and ancestral house.	 Num 2:25-34

3:1The Generations of Aaron and Moses

When the LORD Spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai

Duties of Levites

2The sons of Aaron were Nadab, the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar—3anointed and ordained as priests. 4In the Wilderness of Sinai, Nadab and Abihu died from offering before the LORD, fire different from what he’d commanded. They didn’t have any children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron’s lifetime.	 Num 3:1-4

5The LORD told Moses,

6“Set the tribe of Levi aside to serve Aaron. 7They’ll perform duties for him and the whole community at the Tent of Meeting. They’ll service the Tabernacle 8and keep the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting in assisting with the duties of the people. 9Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. 10Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; execute any layman that tries to come near.”

11Again the LORD told Moses,

12“I’ve taken the Levites from the people in place of the firstborn. 13The firstborn belong to me. When I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart to myself the firstborn people and animals in Israel. The Levites belong to me; I’m the LORD.”	Num 3:5-13

14The LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 15“Count the descendants of Levi by families—every male a month old and up.” 16Moses counted them:

17the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

18 the clans descended from Gershon: Libni and Shimei.

19the clans descended from Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

20the clans descended from Merari: Mahli and Mushi.  	Num 3:14-20

21The Libnites and Shimeites descended from Gershon. 22Their males a month old and up numbered 7,500. 23They camped west of the Tabernacle, behind it. 24Eliasaph son of Lael was family leader among the Gershonites. 25The sons of Gershon serviced the Tent of Meeting, including the Tabernacle and tent, its covering, the screen for the door to the Tent of Meeting, 26the hangings around the court, and the screen for the door to the court around the Tabernacle, the altar, and its cords. 	Num 3:21-26

27The Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites descended from Kohath. 28Their males a month old and up numbered 8,600; they serviced the sanctuary. 29They camped south of the Tabernacle. 30Elizaphan son of Uzziel was family leader among the Kohathites. 31The sons of Kohath serviced the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary they perform service with, and the screen.

32Eleazar son of Aaron, the chief leader from Levi, oversaw the ones that performed duties in the sanctuary.  							     Num 3:27-32

33The Mahlites and Mushites descended from Merari. 34Their males a month old and up numbered 6,200. 35Zuriel son of Abihail was family of Merari. They camped north of the Tabernacle. 36The sons of Merari serviced the frames of the Tabernacle, its bars, posts, bases, equipment, 37together with the posts around the court with their bases, pegs, and cords.

38 Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped east of the Tabernacle and performed duties in the sanctuary for the obligation of Israel. Any layman that would come near was to be executed. 39The Levites that Moses and Aaron counted a month old and up numbered 22,000. 	Num 3:33-39

Redemption of the Firstborn

40The LORD told Moses,

“Count by name every male firstborn in Israel a month old and up. 41Take the Levites for me in place of Israel’s firstborn sons, and take the Levites’ livestock in place of the nation’s firstborn livestock.”

42Moses counted Israel’s firstborn: 4322,273 males a month old and up.

44The LORD told Moses,

45“The Levites belong to me; I’m the LORD. 46For the ransom of the 273 firstborn in Israel above the number of Levites, 47take 2 oz 5 shekels per head, shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs to a shekel). 48Give the ransom money to Aaron and his sons.”

49Moses took the ransom money from the ones above the number ransomed by the Levites. 50From the firstborn he took the money in shekels of the sanctuary (1,365 shekels 34 lbs) 51and gave it to Aaron and his sons. 					  	     	     Num 3:40-51

Duties of the Kohathites

4:1The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

2“Count the descendants of Kohath by families 330-50 years old who serve in the Tent of Meeting. 4This is the work of Kohath’s descendants with the most holy objects. 5When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons will go in and take down the screen and cover the Ark of Testimony with it. 6They’ll lay a dolphin-skin covering over it, spread a pure blue cloth over it, and insert its poles. 7Over the table for the Bread of the Presence, they’ll spread a pure blue cloth and put on it the dishes, spoons, sacrificial bowls, liquid offering jars, and the continual bread that’s on it. 8They’ll spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover it with a dolphin-skin covering, and insert its poles. 9Then they’ll take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand, its lamps, snuffers, trays, and oil jars. 10They’ll put it and its utensils in a dolphin-skin covering and put it on the carrying bars. 11They’ll spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, and cover it with a dolphin-skin covering, and insert its bars. 12They’ll take the utensils for service in the sanctuary, put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a dolphin-skin covering, and put them on the carrying bars. 13Then they’ll take away the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it. 14They’ll put its utensils on it: the firepans, forks, shovels, and basins. They’ll spread a dolphin-skin covering over it and insert its poles.

Num 4:1-14

15“After Aaron and his sons cover the holy objects and furnishings, the Kohathites will come to carry them so they won’t touch the holy objects and die.

16“Eleazar is responsible for the olive oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and anointing oil—the Tabernacle and everything in it, the sanctuary and its furnishings.”

17The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

18“Don’t let the clans of Kohath get eliminated from the Levites. 19Do this so they won’t die when they approach the most holy objects.  Have Aaron and his sons go in and assign each of them his work and his load, 20but they won’t go in to see the holy objects even for a moment; they’ll die.”  	  	     Num 4:15-20

21The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

22“Count the clans of Gershon by families 2330-50 years old who serve in the Tent of Meeting. 24The Gershonites 25will carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with its covering and the dolphin-skin covering that’s on top of it, the screen for the door to the Tent of Meeting, 26the hangings for the court, the screen for the door to the court that’s around the Tabernacle and the altar, their cords, and the equipment for their service and everything that’s to be done. 27The Gershonites will serve under Aaron and his sons. You’ll assign them their loads. 28Ithamar son of Aaron will direct the Gershonites’ service.	 Num 4:21-28

29“Count the descendants of Merari by families 3030-50 years old who serve with the Tent of Meeting. 31They’ll carry the boards of the Tabernacle, its bars, posts, and bases; 32the posts around the court, their bases, pegs, and cords, with their equipment and service. 33Assign each man by name what he’s supposed to carry. Ithamar will direct their service.”  	Num 4:29-33

34Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites 3530-50 years old who served with the Tent of Meeting: 362,750. [37]

38-41The Gershonites 30-50 years old by family, numbered 2,630.

42The men counted from the families of Merari 4330-50 years old who served in the Tent of Meeting, numbered 443,200. [45]

46The Levites that Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted 4730-50 years old who carried the Tent of Meeting, numbered 488,580. 49Moses counted them.  	Num 4:34-49

Purity in Israel’s Camp

5:1The LORD told Moses,

2“Tell Israel to send outside the camp any leper, anybody with a discharge, anyone ceremonially unclean because of a dead person. 3Send out male or female so they won’t defile their camp where I live.”

4They did that.	Num 5:1-4

5-6The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

6“When a man or woman sins against the LORD by sinning against another person, 7the offender will confess and pay restitution plus a fifth to the one that was wronged. 8If there’s no relative to receive the restitution, it goes to the LORD for the priest in addition to the ram offered for the atonement. 9The priest will also receive every contribution associated with the holy gifts the people offer. 10Everybody’s holy gifts belong to the priest.”   	Num 5:5-10

The Test for Adultery

[11] 12-13“If a husband suspects his wife has been unfaithful, 14-15he can take her to the priest. He’s to take .11 bushels .1 ephah of barley meal as an offering for her. He won’t pour olive oil on it or put frankincense on it because it’s a grain offering of jealousy, a reminder of sin.

16“The priest will have her stand in the LORD’s presence. 17He’ll take holy water in a clay jar, take some dust from the floor of the Tabernacle, and put it in the water. 18He’ll let her hair down loose and place the memorial grain offering in her hands. The priest will have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse. 19He’ll have her take an oath, ‘If no man has had intercourse with you while under your husband’s authority, be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse. 20But if you’ve defiled yourself with another man,’ [21then he’ll have her swear the oath] ‘may the LORD make you a curse among your people. 22This water will make your abdomen swell and your thigh shrivel’ She’ll say, ‘True. True.’

Num 5:11-22

23“The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the water. 24Then he’ll have her drink the water. 25The priest will take the grain offering of jealousy from her, wave it in front of the LORD, and take it to the altar. 26He’ll take a handful of the memorial grain offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar. Afterward he’ll have her drink the water. 27If she has been unfaithful, the water will cause bitterness. Her abdomen will swell, her thigh will waste away, and she’ll become a curse among her people. 28If she hasn’t defiled herself, she’ll be free and can conceive children.

29“That’s the law of jealousy 30when a husband suspects his wife has gone astray. 31He won’t be responsible, but she’ll be held guilty.” 	Num 5:23-31

The Nazirite Vow

6:1-2The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“When men or women take a Nazarite vow to dedicate themselves to the LORD, 3they must abstain from wine, alcohol, and from vinegar made from them. They can’t drink grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins. 4They’re not to eat anything a grapevine produces from seeds to skin.

5“During that time, they have to let their hair grow. 6-7They can’t make themselves ceremonially unclean by going near a dead body even for a parent or sibling that dies. [8]  	Num 6:1-8

9“If someone dies suddenly beside them and defiles their dedicated head, they’ll shave it the same day and on the seventh day. 10The eighth day, they’ll take two turtledoves or young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 11The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; that will purify them from their defilement. That same day they’ll re-consecrate their head, 12dedicate to the LORD their days as a Nazirite, and take a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering. Their previous days of separation are void. 	Num 6:9-12

13“When Nazirites finish their time of separation, they’ll take an offering to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting 14and present it to the LORD:

one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering,

one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering,

one ram without defect for a peace offering, 15and

a basket of cakes of fine flour without yeast mixed with olive oil and

wafers without yeast basted with olive oil, along with

their grain offering and liquid offerings.

16The priest will present them all to the LORD. [17] 18Then the Nazirites will shave their head and put the dedicated hair on the fire that’s under the peace offering. 19The priest will take the ram’s boiled shoulder and one cake and wafer without yeast from the basket, and put them in the Nazirites’ hands. 20The priest will wave them in front of the LORD. They’re set apart for the priest, together with the chest offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up. Afterward Nazirites can drink wine again.

21“That’s the law for Nazirites that vow their offering to the LORD for their separation in addition to what else they can afford.”	 Num 6:13-21

Aaron’s Blessing

22The LORD told Moses to have Aaron and his sons 23pronounce this blessing on Israel:

24“The LORD bless you and keep you.

25The LORD smile on you

and be gracious to you.

26The LORD lift up his countenance on you

and give you peace.”

27“In that way they’ll invoke my name on the people, and I’ll bless them.”

Num 6:22-27

Offerings of Dedication

7:1The day Moses finished setting up the Tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated its furnishings, the altar, and its utensils. 2The leaders in Israel (besides the numbered men) made an offering 3and brought it to the Tabernacle: 6 covered carts and 12 cattle, a cart for each pair of leaders and an ox for each leader. 4The LORD told Moses, 5“Accept these things for use in the Tent of Meeting. Give them to each Levite according to his service.” 6Moses accepted the carts and cattle and gave them to the Levites: 72 carts and 4 cattle to Gershon’s descendants to match their service, 8and 4 carts and 8 cattle to Merari’s descendants to match their service—as directed by Ithamar son of Aaron. 9He didn’t give any to Kohath’s descendants because their service was with the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders. 10The leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed; they offered it in front of the altar. 	Num 7:1-10

11Then the LORD told Moses, “Have them present their offering, one leader a day, for the dedication of the altar.” [Each leader presented the same offering as follows:]

13one silver platter that weighed 3¼ lbs 130 shekels,

one silver bowl that weighed 28 oz 70 shekels of the sanctuary—

both full of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering;

14one gold pan weighing 4 oz 10 shekels, full of incense;

15one bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;

16one male goat for a sin offering;

17two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs a year old for peace

offerings.

12The first day, Nahshon son of Amminadab, from Judah, presented his offering.

18The second day, Nethanel son of Zuar, leader of Issachar, presented his offering.

24The third day, Eliab son of Helon, leader of Zebulun, presented.

30The fourth day, Elizur son of Shedeur, leader of Reuben, presented.

36The fifth day, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, leader of Simeon, presented.

42The sixth day, Eliasaph son of Deuel, leader of Gad, presented.

48The seventh day, Elishama son of Ammihud, leader of Ephraim, presented.

54The eighth day, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, leader of Manasseh, presented.

60The ninth day, Abidan son of Gideoni, leader of Benjamin, presented.

66The tenth day, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai, leader of Benjamin, presented.

72The eleventh day, Pagiel son of Ochran, leader of Asher, presented.

78The twelfth day, Ahira son of Enan, leader of Naphtali, presented.

[19-23] = [25-29] = [31-35] = [37-41] = [43-47] = [49-53] = [55-59] = [61-65] = [67-71] =

[73-77] = [79-83] repeats of 13-17. 	Num 7:11-83

84That was the dedication offering for the altar from the leaders of Israel when it was anointed: 12 silver platters, 12 silver bowls, 12 gold pans, 85each silver platter weighing 3¼ lbs 130 shekels and each bowl weighing 28 oz 70 shekels. The silver of the utensils weighed 60 lbs 2,400 shekels of the sanctuary. 86The 12 gold saucers full of incense weighed 4 oz 10 shekels apiece—3 lbs 120 shekels altogether. 87For the burnt offerings there were 12 bulls, 12 rams, 12 male lambs a year old with their grain offerings, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. 88For the peace offerings there were 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, 60 male lambs a year old. That was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed.

89Whenever Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak to the LORD, he’d hear a voice speaking to him from between the two cherubs above the mercy seat on the Ark of Testimony.

Num 7:84-89

The Seven Lamps

8:1The LORD told Moses 2to have Aaron put up the 7 lamps to shine in front of the lampstand. 3Aaron did that. 4The lampstand was hammered gold from its base to its flowers in the pattern the LORD showed Moses.	 Num 8:1-4

The Levites Dedicated

5Again the LORD told Moses,

6“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse them. 7For their cleansing, sprinkle purifying water on them, have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. 8Then have them take a bull with its grain offering—fine flour mixed with olive oil. Take a second bull for a sin offering. 9Present the Levites at the Tent of Meeting and gather the community. 10Have them put their hands on the Levites. 11Then Aaron will present the Levites to the LORD as a wave offering from the people to qualify them to perform service to the LORD. 12The Levites will put their hands on the bulls’ heads. They’ll offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to atone for the Levites. 13Have the Levites stand in the presence of Aaron and his sons to present them as a wave offering to the LORD.  	Num 8:5-13

14“In that way, set the Levites apart from among the Israelites. The Levites will belong to me. 15Then they can serve in the Tent of Meeting. But you’ll cleanse them and present them as a wave offering, 16because I’ve dedicated them to myself in place of every firstborn in Israel. 17Every firstborn belongs to me among people and animals. The day I struck down the firstborn in Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. [18] 19I’ve given the Levites to Aaron and his sons to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting, and to atone for them so there won’t be a plague on Israel from coming near the sanctuary.”

20That’s what Moses, Aaron, and the community did with the Levites. 21The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron presented them as a wave offering and atoned for them. 22Afterwards they went into the Tent of Meeting to perform their service with Aaron and his sons.     	Num 8:14-22

23The LORD told Moses,

24“The Levites will serve in the Tent of Meeting from age 25 to 50 25and then retire. 26They can, however, help their relatives in the Tent of Meeting in keeping an obligation, but they themselves can’t work.” 	Num 8:23-26

The Second Passover

9:1In the first month, second year after the Israelites left Egypt, the LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, 2-3“Have Israel observe Passover as directed at its scheduled time: the fourteenth day of this month in the evening.” 4Moses told the Israelites to observe it. 5They did so in the Wilderness of Sinai the way the LORD commanded Moses. 	Num 9:1-5

6Some men were ceremonially unclean because of a corpse, so they couldn’t observe it that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day, 7“Although we’re unclean, why can’t we present the offering to the LORD at the scheduled time with the rest of Israel?”

8Moses said, “I’ll listen to what the LORD says.”

9-10The LORD told him to tell Israel,

“If any of you becomes ceremonially unclean because of a dead person or being on a long trip, go ahead and observe the Passover to the LORD. 11Observe it on the fourteenth day, second month in the evening. Eat it with bitter herbs and bread without yeast. 12Don’t leave any of it till morning or break a bone of it. 13But any of you that’s clean and not on a trip and doesn’t observe it, will be excluded from Israel. You didn’t present the offering to the LORD as scheduled. You’ll be held guilty. 14Any foreigner living among you may observe Passover as directed. You’ll have one statute for foreigners and citizens.”  	Num 9:6-14

The Cloud over the Tabernacle

15The day they set up the Tabernacle (the Tent of Testimony), the cloud covered it. In the evening, what looked like fire appeared over it till morning. 16That became the pattern: the cloud covered it during the day and what looked like fire covered it at night. 17Whenever the cloud lifted, the Israelites would set out. Where it settled, they’d camp. 18As the LORD directed Moses, they’d set out or camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle, they stayed at that camp 19even if it was for a long time. [20] 21If the cloud stayed all night and lifted in the morning, they’d move out in the morning. If it stayed all day and lifted at night, they’d move out in the evening. 22Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, they wouldn’t move till the cloud lifted. [23] 	Num 9:15-23

The Silver Trumpets

10:1The LORD told Moses,

2“Make two bugles out of hammered silver. Use them to gather the community or move the camp out. 3Blow both bugles to gather the community at the Tent of Meeting. 4Blow one bugle to gather just the leaders of thousands there.

5“When you blow the signal, the camps pitched on the east side will set out. 6When you blow the signal again, the camps pitched on the south side will set out. 7When assembling the community, however, blow without sounding an alarm. 8By permanent statute the priestly descendants of Aaron will blow the bugles. 9When you go to war in your country against an attacker, blow the signal with the bugle, so the LORD will remember you and save you from your enemies. 10At celebrations, at scheduled festivals, and on the first day of the month, blow the bugles over your burnt offerings and peace offerings to remind your God about you. I’m the LORD your God.”  	Num 10:1-10

Israel Leaves Sinai

11On the twentieth day, second month, second year, the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle. 12The Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai and came to rest in the Wilderness of Paran. 13That was the first time they moved at the LORD’s directive through Moses. 14The standard of Judah’s camp set out first, with Nahshon over its army, 15Nethanel over Issachar’s tribal army, 16and Eliab over Zebulun’s tribal army. 	Num 10:11-16

17The Levites dismantled the Tabernacle; the descendants of Gershon and Merari set out carrying it. 18Next, Reuben’s standard set out with Elizur over its army, 19Shelumiel over Simeon’s tribal army, 20and Eliasaph over Gad’s tribal army.

21Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects, and the Tabernacle would already be set up before they arrived. 22Next, Ephraim’s standard set out with Elishama over its army, 23Gamaliel over Manasseh’s army, 24and Abidan over Benjamin’s army.

25Then Dan’s standard, the rear guard for the camps, set out with Ahiezer over its army, 26Pagiel over Asher’s army, 27and Ahira over Naphtali’s army. 28That was the order of the Israelite’s tribal armies.	 Num 10:17-28

29Moses told Hobab son of Reuel/Jethro from Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, “We’re setting out to the place the LORD said he’d give us. Go with us and we’ll do you good because he has promised good for Israel.”

30But he said, “No; I’ll go to my own territory and relatives.”

31Moses said,

“Don’t leave. You know where to camp in the open country. You can be our eyes. 32If you go with us, whatever good the LORD does for us we’ll do for you.”	 Num 10:29-32

33They set out from the mountain of the LORD on a three-day journey, with the Ark of the Covenant in front, to find a resting place. 34The cloud of the LORD was over them during the day when they set out from the camp.

35When the Ark set out, Moses would say,

“Rise up, LORD!

Scatter your enemies;

make the ones that hate you flee.”

36When the Ark came to rest, he’d say,

“Come back, LORD,

to the countless thousands in Israel.” 	 Num 10:33-36

The People Complain

11:1The people started complaining about their hardships. The LORD’s anger flared. It burned among them and burned up the outskirts of the camp. 2The people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. 3The name of that place became Taberah, because the LORD’s fire “burned” among them.

4Some riffraff among them had selfish interests and cried out again,

“Who’s going to feed us? 5We remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. 6Now our appetite’s gone. There’s nothing to look at except this manna.”

7The manna was like coriander seed and looked like bdellium. 8The people would go around and gather it up, grind it between millstones, mash it in mortars, or boil it in pots and make cakes. The cakes tasted like they were baked with olive oil. 9Manna fell with the dew at night.

Num 11:1-9

10Moses heard the families whining at the entrance to their tents. The LORD’s anger kindled greatly, and Moses wasn’t pleased. 11He asked the LORD,

“Why be so hard on me? How have I displeased you that you’ve laid the responsibility for all these people on me? 12Was I the one that conceived them and had them, that you should tell me to carry them in my arms like a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land you swore to their ancestors? 13Where can I get meat for all these people? They’re crying to me for something to eat! 14I can’t carry them; they’re too heavy. 15If you’re going to deal with me this way, take my life now if I’m pleasing to you. Spare me the misery.”	 Num 11:10-15

Elders Appointed to Help Moses

16The LORD told Moses,

“Gather the 70 elders and their officers at the Tent of Meeting. Have them stand there with you. 17I’ll come down and speak to you and take the Spirit that’s on you and put on them. They’ll bear responsibility for the people, too, so you won’t be bearing it by yourself. 18Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you’ll eat meat because you’ve cried, “Oh that someone would feed us! We were well-off in Egypt.” The LORD will give you meat and you’ll eat it—19not 1 day, 2 days, 5, 10, or 20 days, 20but for a whole month, till it comes out your nostrils and you sick of it. That’s because you’ve rejected the LORD that’s among you and whined to his face, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”

21But Moses said,

“There are 600,000 people around me; yet you’ve said you’d give them meat for a month. 22Should they butcher flocks and herds to get enough or try to catch all the fish in the sea?”

23The LORD said, “Am I limited? You’ll see if what I said comes true.” 	Num 11:16-23

24Moses told the people what the LORD said. He gathered the 70 elders and stationed them around the tent. 25The LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him. The Spirit that was on Moses he put on them. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they never did it again.

26Two men had remained in the camp, Eldad and Medad. The Spirit rested on them, and they kept on prophesying. (They were among the ones that had been registered but hadn’t gone out to the Tent.) 27A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”

Num 11:24-27

28Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant from his youth, said, “Moses, my lord, stop them.”

29“Are you jealous for me? Oh that all the LORD’s people were prophets, and he would put his Spirit on them.”

30Moses and the elders went back to the camp.

The LORD Sends Quail

31The LORD made a wind blow from the sea to bring quail. They fell about a day’s walk away all around the camp—about 3ft deep all over the ground. 32The people spent all day, all night, and the next day picking them up and spreading them out all around the camp. The least anybody gathered was 62.5 bushels. 33While they chewed the meat, the LORD’s anger flared at them; he struck them with a severe plague. 34So they called the place Kibroth-hattaavah because they put in “graves” the people that had been “greedy.” 35From Kibroth-hattaavah they set out for Hazaroth and stayed there.	   	  	   			   	   Num 11:28-35

Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses

12:1Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses for the Nubian woman he’d married. 2“Has the LORD indeed only spoken through you? Hasn’t he spoken through us too?” The LORD heard it. (3Moses was the most humble man in the world.) 4At once, the LORD told Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out to the Tent of Meeting.” 5He came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent to call Aaron and Miriam. When they’d come forward, 6he said,

“Listen to what I’m saying:

if there’s a prophet among you,

I’ll show myself to him in a vision

or speak to him in a dream.

7Not so with Moses;

he’s faithful in my house.

8I speak to him directly, clearly,

not in dark sayings;

he sees my form.

Why then weren’t you afraid

to criticize him?”		Num 12:1-8

9The LORD’s anger burned against them, and he left. 10When the cloud withdrew from over the Tent, Miriam had leprosy as white as snow. When Aaron turned and saw it, 11he told Moses, “Don’t hold that foolish sin against us. 12Don’t leave her like somebody dead, with flesh half eaten away at birth.”

13Moses cried out to the LORD, “God, heal her!”

14The LORD said,

“If her father had only spit in her face, wouldn’t she have borne her disgrace for a week? Quarantine her outside the camp for a week. Then she can come back.”

15So they did; the people didn’t move on till she returned. 16Then they moved out from Hazeroth to the Wilderness of Paran.	     				     		     	     Num 12:9-16

Spies Sent into Canaan

13:1The LORD told Moses, 2“Send one leader from each tribe to spy out Canaan that I’m giving to Israel.”

3Moses sent out these leaders from Paran:

4from Reuben, 	Shammua son of Zaccur;

5from Simeon, 	Shaphat son of Hori;

6from Judah, 		Caleb son of Jephunneh;

7from Issachar, 	Igal son of Joseph;

8from Ephraim, 	Hoshea son of Nun, (16bthat Moses called Joshua);

9from Benjamin, 	Palti son of Raphu;

10from Zebulun, 	Gaddiel son of Sodi;

11from Joseph, tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi;

12from Dan, 		Ammiel son of Gemalli;

13from Asher, 	Sethur son of Michael;

14from Naphtali, 	Nahbi son of Vophsi;

15from Gad, 	Geuel son of Machi.		 Num 13:1-15

16aMoses sent them to spy out the land.

17He told them,

“Go up into the Negev, then to the hill country. 18See what the land is like, how strong the people are, how many there are. 19See if the land is good or bad. See if the towns are like open camps or if they’re fortified. 20Is the ground lush or with little vegetation? Do they have trees? Bring back some fruit.”

It was the season for the first-ripe grapes.

21They spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob to Lebo-hamath. 22After they’d gone up to the Negev, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron was built 7 years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23They went to the Valley of Eshcol and cut off a branch with a single cluster of grapes. They carried it on a pole between two men along with some pomegranates and figs. 24They called that place The Valley of Eshcol because of the “cluster” of grapes they cut off there. 	Num 13:16-24

The Report of the Spies

25When they came back after 40 days, 26they went to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back their report and showed them the fruit from the land:

27“We went into the land, and it does flow with milk and honey. Here’s some of its fruit. 28But the people are strong, and the towns are fortified and big. Besides, we saw descendants of Anak there. 29Amalek lives in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.”

30Caleb quieted the people in front of Moses, “We should certainly go up and take possession of it. We can conquer it.”

31But the men that had gone up with him said, “We can’t go up against the people. They’re too strong for us.”

32They gave the people a discouraging report,

“The land overruns its people. They’re big people. 33We saw the Nephilim [Descendants of Anak are one part of the Nephilim.]; we felt like grasshoppers, and that’s what we looked like to them.”	Num 13:25-33

The People Rebel

14:1The community cried out loud that night 2and complained to Moses and Aaron,

“We should’ve died in Egypt! We should’ve died in the desert! 3Why is the LORD taking us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and little ones will become spoils of war. Wouldn’t we be better off to go back to Egypt?”

4They said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and go back.”

5Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in front of the assembly. 6Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh tore their clothes 7and told them,

“The land we passed through is really good land. 8If the LORD is pleased with us, he’ll take us in and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 9Don’t rebel against him or be afraid of them; they’ll be our prey. Their protection has been removed, and the LORD is with us.”

10But the community said to stone them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the Tent of Meeting to the Israelites, 11and he told Moses,

“How long will these people spurn me? How long will they not trust me despite all the signs I’ve performed among them? 12I’ll hit them with a plague and disinherit them, and I’ll make you into a nation bigger and stronger than them.”

Num 14:1-12

Moses Intercedes for the People

13But Moses told him,

“The Egyptians will hear about it, because by your strength you brought these people up from among them, 14and they’ll tell the people in this land. They’ve heard you’re among the people. You’re seen eye to eye while your cloud stands over them, and you lead them in a pillar of cloud in the daytime and a pillar of fire at night. 15If you kill this whole nation, the nations that have heard of your fame will say 16you couldn’t take them to the land you promised them with an oath; so you killed them in the desert. 17Let your power be great like you’ve said, 18‘You’re slow to get angry, you abound in kindness, and forgive sin. But you won’t by any means acquit the guilty. You visit the consequences of parents’ sin on their descendants for three or four generations.’ 19Pardon these people in keeping with your great kindness—like you’ve done from Egypt till now.”

God Measures Out Judgment

20The LORD said,

“I’ll pardon them; 21but as I live, I’ll fill the whole world with my glory. 22The people saw my glory and signs in Egypt and in the desert, but they’ve tested me ten times and ignored me. 23None of them that spurned me will see the land I swore to their ancestors. 24I’ll take my servant Caleb in. He’s had a different spirit and followed me faithfully. His descendants will take possession of it. 25The Amalekites and Canaanites live in the valleys. Turn around tomorrow and set out to the open country by the Red Sea.”	Num 14:13-25

26The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,

27“How long do I have to put up with this evil community and their complaints against me. 26-28Tell them, ‘As I live,’ the LORD says, ‘as you’ve said what I can hear, I’ll say what you can hear. 29Your corpses will fall in this desert—everyone 20 years old and up that’s criticized me. 30You won’t come into the land I swore to settle you in—except Caleb and Joshua. 31I’ll take in the little ones you said would be prey. They’ll experience the land you rejected. [32] 33Your offspring will be shepherds in the desert for 40 years. Because of your unfaithfulness, they’ll suffer till your corpses lie in the desert. 34So you’ll realize how displeased I am, you’ll suffer for your guilt one year for every day you spied out the land. 35I’ve spoken, and I’ll do it to this community that has united against me: you’ll die in this desert.”

36-37The men that got the community to criticize Moses because of their bad report, died by a plague in the LORD’s presence. 38But Joshua and Caleb remained alive.  	Num 14:26-38

Israel Defeated in Battle

39When Moses told that to the people, they mourned greatly. 40But in the morning, they got up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, “Here we are. We’ve indeed sinned, but we’ll go up to the place the LORD promised.”

41But Moses said,

“Why sin against his command? It won’t work. 42Don’t go; your enemies will strike you down. The LORD’s not with you. 43The Amalekites and Canaanites will confront you, and you’ll fall by the sword because you rejected him.”

44But they went up anyway to the ridge of the hill country. Moses and the Ark stayed in camp. 45The Amalekites and Canaanites attacked them and beat them back to Hormah.	 Num 14:39-45

Laws About Sacrifices

15:1The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

2“When you go into the land I’m giving you, 3make a burnt offering to me—a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, a free-will offering, at your scheduled times. Make a pleasing aroma from the herd or flock.

4“When you present your offering, present a grain offering made from .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 pints ¼ hin of olive oil.  5Prepare wine for the liquid offering, 3 pints ¼ hin, with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for each lamb.

6“For a ram, prepare as a grain offering .22 bushel .2 ephah of fine flour mixed with ⅓⅓ him of olive oil. 7For a liquid offering, offer ⅓ gallon ⅓ hin of wine as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 	Num 15:1-7

8“When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice—to fulfill a special vow or for peace offerings to the LORD —9offer it with a grain offering made from .33 bushel .3 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 quarts ½ hin of olive oil. 10Offer as the liquid offering 3 quarts ½ hin of wine as an offering by fire, as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 11That’s the way it’s to be done for each ox, ram, male lamb, or goat, 12the same for each sacrifice.

13“Every citizen of you will do those things when you present an offering by fire, as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 14If foreigners staying with you—temporarily or permanently—want to make an offering by fire, they’ll do it the same way you do. 15-16There’ll be one statute, one law, one ordinance for you and for foreigners among you throughout your generations.” 	Num 15:8-16

17-18The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“When you go into the land where I’m taking you 19and you eat the food that’s there, lift up an offering to the LORD.   20-21From the first of your dough, lift up a cake as an offering from the threshing floor. 	Num 15:17-21

Unintentional Sins

22-23“When the whole community unintentionally fails to observe any commandment, 24they’ll offer 1 bull for a burnt offering (as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, with its grain offering and liquid offering) and 1 male goat for a sin offering. 25The priest will atone for the whole community because they brought the offering to the LORD for their error. 26He’ll forgive the community, including any foreigner among them, since it wasn’t intentional.	 Num 15:22-26

27“If one of you sins unintentionally, offer a year-old female goat for a sin offering. 28The priest will atone for you in front of the LORD. 29For doing something unintentionally, there’ll be one law for a native and a foreigner.

30“But if you do something intentionally, native or foreign, you’re blaspheming the LORD. You’ll be excluded from the community. 31Your guilt will remain because you’ve disregarded the LORD’s message and broken his commandment.”

Execution of a Sabbath Breaker

32When Israel was in the desert, they found a fellow gathering wood on the Sabbath. 33They brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the community. 34They put him in custody because it hadn’t been specified what should happen to him. 35The LORD told Moses, “Execute him. Have the community stone him outside the camp.” 36The community took him outside the camp and stoned him.	   Num 15:27-36

Tassels on Clothing

37The LORD also said to Moses,

38“Tell Israel to make tassels for the hems of their cloaks throughout their generations. Put a blue cord on the tassel for each corner. 39When you see it, remember to do everything the LORD commands instead of doing what’s in your own mind and thereby becoming a prostitute. 40Set yourselves apart to your God. 41I’m the LORD who brought you out of Egypt to be your God.”	 Num 15:37-41

Korah’s Rebellion

16:1Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab and On son of Peleth (descendants of Reuben)—2rebelled together with 250 prominent, chosen leaders of the community. 3They gathered against Moses and Aaron, and said,

“You’ve gone far enough. The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD’s among them. Why place yourselves above the LORD’s assembly?”	Num 16:1-3

4When Moses heard it, he fell on his face. 5Then he told Korah and his company,

“Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who’s his and who’s holy. He’ll bring near the one he chooses. 6You and your company take censers 7tomorrow and put fire in them and incense on them in the LORD’s presence. The man he designates will be the one that’s holy. You’ve gone far enough, you descendants of Levi. [8] 9Aren’t you satisfied that God has set you apart from the community, and brought you near to service the Tabernacle and perform service to the community? 10Isn’t it enough that he’s brought you near? Are you trying to usurp the priesthood too? 11You and your company have gathered against the LORD. Why criticize Aaron?” 	Num 16:4-11

12Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said,

“We’re not coming. 13Isn’t it enough that you’ve brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in a desert? You also want to lord it over us. 14You haven’t brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey. You haven’t given us fields and vineyards to inherit. Do you want to put out these men’s eyes? We’re not coming!”

15Moses was really mad and said to the LORD, “Don’t regard their offering! I haven’t taken a single donkey of theirs or harmed any of them.” 16Moses told Korah,

“You and your company, along with Aaron, present yourselves to the LORD tomorrow. 17Each of you 250 and Aaron, take your firepans, put incense on them, and bring them to the LORD.”

18They took their censers and put fire and incense on them. They stood at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. 19Korah gathered the community against them there. The glory of the LORD appeared to the whole community.	Num 16:12-19

20He told Moses and Aaron, 21“Get away from the community so I can consume them instantly.”

22But they fell on their faces and said, “God, God of everyone’s spirit, when one person sins, will you direct your anger at the whole community?”

23He said to Moses and Aaron, 24“Tell them to get away from where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram live.”	Num 16:20-24

25Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders followed him. 26He told the community, “Get away from these men’s tents. Don’t touch anything that’s theirs or you’ll get swept away in their sin.” 27They got away from where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram lived. Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents with their wives, sons, and little ones. 28Moses said,

“This is how you’ll know the LORD has sent me to do this; it’s not my idea. 29If these men die naturally or suffer a typical fate, the LORD hasn’t sent me. 30But if he causes something entirely new and the ground opens up and swallows them and what’s theirs, you’ll understand that they’ve rejected the LORD.” 	Num 16:25-30

31Just as he finished speaking, the ground under them gaped open. 32It swallowed them, their families, the people that belonged to Korah, and their possessions. 33They all went down to Sheol alive, and the ground closed back over them. 34Everybody around them fled at their outcry, “The ground may swallow us!” 35Fire from the LORD also consumed the 250 men that were offering incense.

36The LORD said to Moses,

37“Tell Eleazar to pick up the censers from the blaze and scatter the embers. 38Hammer the censors into sheets for plating the altar, since they did present them to the LORD and they’re holy. They’ll serve as a sign for Israel.”

39Eleazar took the bronze censers and hammered them out as plating for the altar. 40That was to remind Israel that no layman—someone not descended from Aaron—should come to burn incense to the LORD; he’d end up like Korah and his company.	Num 16:31-40

41But the next day the community criticized Moses and Aaron, “You made the LORD’s people die.” 42However, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 43They went to the front of the Tent, 44and the LORD told Moses, 45“Get away from the community so I can consume them all at once.” They fell on their faces. 46Moses told Aaron,

“Take your censer, put fire in it from the altar, and add incense to it. Hurry and take it to the community and atone for them. The LORD’s anger has gone out and started a plague!”

47Aaron did that and ran into the assembly and put on the incense and atoned for them. 48He stood between the dead and living, and the plague stopped. 49But 14,700 died from it besides the ones that died because of Korah. 50Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting because the plague had stopped.	   	    				   Num 16:41-50

Aaron’s Rod That Budded

17:1The LORD said to Moses,

2“Tell the Israelites to get a rod from each family leader. Write each man’s name on his rod 3and write Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod. 4Then put them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony where I meet you.  5The rod of the man I choose will sprout. I’ll stifle the criticism of your critics.

6Moses told the Israelites to give him a rod for each family leader (12 rods) with Aaron’s rod among them. 7Moses put the rods in front of the LORD in the Tent of Testimony. 	       Num 17:1-7

8The next day Moses went into the Tent, and Aaron’s rod had sprouted, put out buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 9Moses brought out the rods as the Israelites watched and each man took his rod. 10But the LORD told Moses,

“Put Aaron’s rod back in front of the Testimony to keep as a sign against the rebels so you can stop their complaining against me and they don’t die.”

11Moses did that.

12The Israelites said to Moses, “We’re perishing! We’re all dying! 13Everybody that goes near the Tabernacle dies. Are we all going to perish?”   	Num 17:8-13

Duties of Priests and Levites

18:1So the LORD told Aaron,

“You, your sons, and your father’s family will be responsible for the sanctuary. You and your sons will be responsible for the priesthood. 2But take your relatives from the tribe of Levi to help you while you and your sons serve in the Tent of Testimony. 3They’ll make preparations throughout the Tent, but they can’t approach the sanctuary furnishings or the altar, or they and you will die. 4An outsider can’t come near you. 5They’ll tend to preparations for the sanctuary and the altar so there won’t be any more anger on Israel. 6I’ll give your fellow Levites to you, dedicated to the LORD, to service the Tent of Meeting. 7But you and your sons will tend to everything around the altar and inside the curtain. I’m giving you the priesthood as a service; execute any outsider that comes near.”

Num 18:1-7

8Then the LORD told Aaron,

“I’ve put you in charge of my heave offerings. 9As a permanent allotment, I’ve given you and your sons the holy gifts the Israelites bring. That will be yours from the most holy things, reserved from the fire. Every grain offering, sin offering, and gift offering will be most holy for you and your sons. 10Every male of yours will eat them.

11Their wave offerings are yours too. I’ve given them to you and your sons and daughters as an ongoing allotment. Anybody in your family that’s ceremonially clean can eat them.

12I’ve given you the best of the fresh olive oil, fresh wine, and grain— the first part of the harvest that the people bring to me. 13They belong to you. Anybody in your family that’s ceremonially clean can eat them.

14Devoted things in Israel are yours. 15You’ll have the first issue of the womb of people and animals that’s offered to me. Nevertheless, you’ll redeem firstborn people and ceremonially unclean animals. 16The redemption price from a month old will be 2 oz of silver 5 shekels of the sanctuary (20 gerahs a shekel). 17But you can’t redeem a firstborn ox, sheep, or goat; they’re holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and offer up their fat in smoke as a burnt offering, for an aroma pleasing to me. 18All their meat will be yours like the breast of a wave offering and the right thigh. 19The holy gifts are a permanent allotment to you, your sons, and daughters—a permanent covenant of salt with me for you and your descendants.”     	Num 18:8-19

20The LORD told Aaron,

“You won’t own or inherit land. I’m your portion, service in the Tent of Meeting. 21I’ve given the Levites a tithe from Israel as payment for their service. 22Israelites can’t approach the Tent of Meeting anymore, or they’ll be held guilty and die. 23Only Levites will perform service there. They’ll bear that responsibility as an ongoing statute throughout your generations. [24]” 	Num 18:20-24

25The LORD told Moses to tell the Levites,

26“When you receive the tithe from Israel, present a tenth of it to the LORD. 27It will be considered equivalent to the grain from the threshing floor or the wine from the wine vat. 28You, too, will present an offering to the LORD—from the tithes you receive. Present it to Aaron the priest 29from the best of the tithes, their sacred portion.  30Tell them, ‘When you’ve offered the best of it, the rest will be considered equivalent to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor or the wine vat. 31You and your families can eat it anywhere; it’s your compensation for service in the Tent of Meeting. 32You won’t be held guilty when you’ve offered the best of it. Don’t profane the Israelites’ sacred gifts, or you’ll die.’” 	Num 18:25-32

Water of Purification

19:1The LORD told Moses and Aaron,

2“This is a statute of the LORD, ‘Tell the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red heifer that’s never worn a yoke. 3Give it to Eleazar to take outside the camp and slaughter in his presence. 4He’ll take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. 5Then the heifer will be burned in front of him—hide, meat, blood, and refuse. 6The priest will take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet material, and throw it onto the burning heifer. 7Then he’ll wash his clothes, take a bath, and afterward come into the camp, but he’ll be ceremonially unclean till evening. 8The one that burns it will also wash his clothes, take a bath, and be unclean till evening. 9A man that’s clean will gather the heifer’s ashes and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the community will keep it as water for removing impurity from sin. 10The one that gathers the ashes will wash his clothes and be unclean till evening. A permanent statute for Israelites and foreigners living among them.       		     							                 Num 19:1-10

11‘Anyone of you that touches a human corpse will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 12Purify yourself with the water on the third and seventh days, and you’ll be clean. If you don’t, you’re still unclean; 13you’re defiling the LORD’s Tabernacle, and you’re excluded from Israel.

14‘If someone dies in your tent, all of you in it will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 15Every open container will be unclean.  	Num 19:11-15

16‘Anybody that touches a body out in the open, slain with a sword or dead from natural causes, will be ceremonially unclean for a week. 17Then for the unclean person they’ll take some ashes from the burnt purification from sin and add flowing water in a basin. 18A clean person will dip hyssop in the water and sprinkle it on the tent, its furnishings, the people that were there, and the one that touched the bone, the one slain, the one dead of natural causes, or the grave. 19Then the clean person will sprinkle the unclean persons on the third and seventh days. On the seventh day the clean purify the unclean. Then they’ll wash their clothes, take a bath, and be ceremonially clean by evening. 	Num 19:16-19

20‘But those who don’t purify themselves will be excluded from the community. They’ve defiled the LORD’s sanctuary. The water for removing impurity wasn’t sprinkled on them. 21Those who sprinkle the water will wash their clothes, and those who touch the water will be ceremonially unclean until evening. 22Anything an unclean person touches is unclean; anyone that touches it is unclean till evening.’” 	Num 19:20-22

The Death of Miriam

20:1The whole community came to the Wilderness of Zin in the first month and stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and they buried her there.

Moses Strikes the Rock

2The community didn’t have water and gathered against Moses and Aaron,

3“If only we’d perished when our relatives perished in the LORD’s presence! 4Why bring his assembly into this desert for us and our animals to die? 5Why make us come up from Egypt to this wretched place? It’s not a place with grain, figs, grapes, or pomegranates; and there’s no water.”	 Num 20:1-5

6Moses and Aaron came from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell on their faces. The glory of the LORD appeared to them. 7He told Moses, 8“Take the staff. You and your brother gather the community. Speak to the rock in front of them so it will yield water, and the community and their animals can drink.” 9Moses took the staff, 10and he and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock. He said, “Listen, you rebels. Should we bring water out of this rock for you?” 11Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, water came out abundantly, and the community and their animals could drink. 12But the LORD told him and Aaron, “Since youpl haven’t treated me as holy in front of them, you won’t bring this assembly to the land I’ve given them.” 13That was the water at Meribah, because the Israelites “quarreled” with the LORD, and he proved himself holy among them.    	Num 20:6-13

Edom Refuses Passage

14Moses sent ambassadors from Kadesh to the king of Edom.

“Your relative Israel says, ‘You know the hardship that has fallen to us. 15You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt and stayed there a long time, and that the Egyptians mistreated them and us. 16But when we cried out to the LORD, he sent an angel to bring us out. We’re at Kadesh on the edge of your territory. 17Let us go through your land. We won’t go through fields or vineyards, or even drink water from a well. We’ll stay on the King’s Highway till we get past your territory.’”

18But Edom said, “No. I’ll come out with swords.”

19Again the Israelites said, “We’ll go up the highway. If any of our livestock do drink your water, we’ll pay for it. Just let us walk through; it’s not a big thing.”

20But he said, “No.” He came out against them with a heavy force 21and refused to let them go through; so Israel turned away.	Num 20:14-21

The Death of Aaron

22When they left Kadesh, the whole community came to Mount Hor. 23The LORD told Moses and Aaron there at the border of Edom,

24“Aaron will pass on to his people. He won’t enter the land I’ve given Israel because youpl rebelled against my command at Meribah. 25Bring him and his son Eleazar up to Mount Hor. 26Take off his vestments and put them on Eleazar.”

27The three of them went up on Mount Hor as the community watched. 28After Moses stripped Aaron and put his vestments on Eleazar, Aaron died. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 29When the community saw Aaron had died, they mourned for him 30 days.

Num 20:22-29

Arad Destroyed

21:1When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by way of Atharim, he fought Israel and took some captives. 2Israel vowed to the LORD, “If you’ll deliver them to me, we’ll destroy their towns.” 3He delivered them, and they “destroyed” them and their towns; the name of the place became Hormah.	Num 21:1-3

The Bronze Snake

4Then they set out from Mount Hor by taking the road to the Red Sea, to go around Edom, and the people got impatient because of the journey. 5They criticized God and Moses, “Why bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? There’s no food or water. We hate this miserable food!” 6The LORD sent poisonous snakes among them. They bit the people and a lot of them died. 7They came to Moses, “We’ve sinned; we’ve criticized you and the LORD. Intercede with him so he’ll take the snakes away.” Moses did that, 8and the LORD told him, “Fashion a poisonous snake on a standard so everybody that looks at it will survive.” 9Moses did that.  If a snake bit anyone and they looked at the bronze serpent, they’d survive.  	Num 21:4-9

Israel’s Journey to Moab

10The Israelites moved out and camped in Oboth, 11 from there to Iyeabarim in the desert east of Moab, 12from there to Wadi Zered, 13and then to the other side of the Arnon in the desert that comes out of the border of the Amorite. The Arnon forms the border between Moab and the Amorites. 14 The Book of the Wars of the LORD says,

“Waheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon,

15and the slope of the wadis

that extends to Ar

and leads to the border of Moab.”	 Num 21:10-15

16From there they continued to Beer. That’s the “well” where the LORD told Moses, “Gather the people so I can give them water.”

17Then Israel sang this song:

“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!

18The well that the leaders sank,

that the nobles dug

with their scepters and staffs.”

From the desert they continued to Mattanah, 19to Nahaliel, to Bamoth, 20to the valley in Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks Jeshimon. 	Num 21:16-20

King Sihon Defeated

21Israel sent ambassadors to Sihon, king of the Amorites,

22“Let me go through your land. We won’t turn off into fields or vineyards, or drink water from your wells. We’ll go by the King’s Highway till we’ve passed through.”

23But Sihon wouldn’t let them. He gathered his army and attacked Israel in the Wilderness at Jahaz. 24Israel struck him with the sword and took his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites. Jazer was the border of Ammon. 25Israel took those towns and lived in them, in Heshbon and its surrounding villages. 26Heshbon was Sihon’s city, who had fought the former king of Moab and took his land as far as the Arnon. 27The ones that recite proverbs say,

“Come to Heshbon and build it!

Set up Sihon’s city.

28A fire went out from Heshbon,

a flame from Sihon’s city.

It consumed Ar in Moab,

the dominating Bamoth of the Arnon.

29Misfortune awaits you, Moab!

You’re ruined, people of Chemosh!

He made his sons refugees

and turned his daughters over to captivity,

to an Amorite king, Sihon.

30But we’ve thrown them down;

from Heshbon to Dibon;

we wiped them out

from Nophah to Medeba.”

King Og Defeated

31So Israel lived in the territory of the Amorites. 32Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and expelled the Amorites there.

33Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og, king of Bashan, went out with his people to fight at Edrei. 34But the LORD told Moses, “Don’t be afraid of him. I’ll give him, his people, and his land to you. Do to him what you did to Sihon.” 35So they killed him, his sons, and his people till there wasn’t a remnant left. They took over his land. 	Num 21:21-35

Balak Summons Balaam

22:1Israel traveled and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. 2Balak son of Zippor saw what Israel did to the Amorites. 3The people of Moab were afraid of them because there were so many of them. 4The king of Moab told the elders in Midian, “This horde will eat up everything around us like an ox eats up grass in a pasture.” Balak, king of Moab at the time, 5sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, near the River Euphrates in the land of his people. He called him and said,

“A people has come out of Egypt. They cover the ground; they’re living across from me. 6Come and put a curse on them; there are too many of them for me to fight. Maybe I can defeat them and drive them out. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.” 	Num 22:1-6

7The elders in Moab and Midian left with a fee for fortunetelling in hand and went to Balaam with Balak’s message.

8He said, “Spend the night here, and I’ll bring word back to you as the LORD tells me.” So they stayed with him.

9God came to Balaam, “Who are these men?”

10“Balak son of Zippor sent me a message, 11‘A people has come out of Egypt and covered the land. Come put a curse on them for me. Maybe I can fight them and drive them out.’”

12“Don’t go with them. Don’t curse the people because they’re blessed.”

13Balaam got up in the morning and told Balak’s leaders, “Go back. The LORD has refused to let me go with you.” 	Num 22:7-13

14They went back to Balak, “Balaam wouldn’t come with us.”

15Balak sent a bigger group of more distinguished officials,

16“Balak says, ‘Please don’t let anything keep you from coming to me. 17I’ll honor you richly and do whatever you tell me. Come put a curse on this nation for me.’”

18Balaam said,

“Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, I couldn’t do anything great or small that’s contrary to what the LORD my God says. 19Stay here tonight, and I’ll find out what else the LORD may say.”

20God came to him at night, “If the men have come to call you, go ahead with them; but only do what I tell you.”	 Num 22:14-20

Balaam and His Donkey

21Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with them. 22But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to hinder him. He was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 23When the donkey saw the angel standing there with his sword drawn, she went off the road into a field, but Balaam hit her to get her back on the road. 24Then the angel stood in a narrow path between vineyards with a wall on both sides. 25When the donkey saw the angel, she pressed herself to the wall and mashed Balaam’s foot; so he hit her again. 26The angel went on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either way. 27When the donkey saw the angel, she lay down under Balaam. He was mad and hit her with his stick. 	Num 22:21-27

28The LORD opened her mouth, and she asked, “What have I done to you to hit me three times?”

29Balaam said, “You’ve mocked me! If I’d had a sword, I would’ve killed you!”

30The donkey said, “Am I not the donkey you’ve ridden all your life? Have I ever acted like this before?”

31Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel standing on the road with his sword drawn, and he bowed to the ground.

32The angel said,

“Why did you hit your donkey three times? I’ve come to restrain you, because you’re opposing me. 33But the donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If she hadn’t, I would’ve killed you and let her live.”

34Balaam said, “I’ve sinned. I didn’t know you were standing on the road. If you want me to, I’ll turn around.”

35But the angel said, “Go on with the men, but only say what I tell you.”

So Balaam went along with them.	 Num 22:28-35

36When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab on the Arnon border. 37He said, “Didn’t I urgently call you? Why didn’t you come? Am I really not able to honor you?” 38Balaam said, “I’m here! Can I say just anything? I’ll say what God tells me.” 39He went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth. 40Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders that were with him. 41In the morning he took Balaam to the high places of Baal to see part of the people from there. 	Num 22:36-41

Balaam’s First Oracle

23:1Then Balaam told Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and rams.” 2They offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 3Balaam told him, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I’ll go. Maybe the LORD will come to me, and I’ll tell you what he shows me.” He went to a bare hill. 4God met him, and he said, “I’ve set up seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each one.” 5The LORD gave Balaam a message, “Go tell Balak such and such.” 6He went back to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering with the leaders of Moab.  	Num 23:1-6

7Balaam took up this oracle:

“Balak brought me from Aram,

Moab’s king from the eastern mountains.

‘Come curse Jacob for me;

come denounce Israel.’

8How can I curse someone God hasn’t cursed?

How can I denounce the one God hasn’t denounced?

9I see him from the top of the cliffs

and look at him from the hills;

a people that lives off by itself

won’t be counted among the nations.

10Who can count the dust of Jacob

or number even a fourth of Israel?

Let me die like the godly;

let my demise be like theirs!”	 Num 23:7-10

11Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I told you to curse my enemies; you’ve blessed them!”

12“Don’t I have to say what the LORD tells me?”

Balaam’s Second Oracle

13Balak said, “Come to a different place, where you can see them—even though it’ll just be the tail-end of them. Curse them for me from there.” 14He took him to the Field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and ram on each one.

15Balaam told him, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there.” 16The LORD met Balaam and gave him a message, “Go back to Balak, and say such and such.” 17Balaam went to him, who was standing by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked, “What has the LORD said?”	   Num 23:11-17

18Balaam took up this oracle:

“Balak, listen;

pay attention, son of Zippor.

19God does not lie like people do

or change his mind like their offspring.

Has he said and won’t do?

Has he spoken and not made it good?

20I’ve received a command to bless;

when he has blessed, I can’t revoke it.

21He hasn’t observed misfortune in Jacob

or seen trouble in Israel.

The LORD their God is with them,

and has been proclaimed their king.

22God is bringing them out of Egypt;

he’s like the horns of a wild ox for them.

23There’s no omen against Jacob,

no fortunetelling against Israel.

At the right time what God has done

will be said to Jacob;

it will be told to Israel.

24These people rise like a lioness;

they get up like a lion.

They won’t lie down till they eat their prey

and drink the blood of the slain.”	   Num 23:18-24

25Balak told him, “Don’t curse them at all or bless them at all!”

26But Balaam answered, “Didn’t I tell you I have to do what the LORD says?”

27Balak said to him, “Come on; I’ll take you to another place. Maybe God will agree to put a curse on them there.” 28Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks Jeshimon. 29Balaam told him, “Build seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and rams.” 30Balak did that and offered a bull and ram on each altar. 	Num 23:25-30

Balaam’s Third Oracle

24;1When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he didn’t go like before to look for omens, but faced the open country. 2He saw Israel camping by tribes, and God’s Spirit came on him. 3He took up this oracle:

“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,

the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,

4the oracle of one that hears God’s message,

that sees a vision from the Almighty,

that falls down with his eyes wide open.

5“How fair your tents, Jacob,

the places where you live, Israel!

6like valleys that stretch out,

like orchards beside a river,

like aloes the LORD planted,

like cedars beside the water.

7Water will flow from Jacob’s buckets;

his seed will live by abundant water;

his king will be greater than Agag;

his kingdom will be exalted.

8God is bringing him out of Egypt;

he’s like the horns of a wild ox for him.

He’ll devastate the nations that oppose him;

he’ll crush their bones to pieces

and shatter them with his arrows.

9Israel lies down like a lion;

who dares to rouse him?

Blessed is everyone that blesses him;

cursed are all who curse him.”	 Num 24:1-9

10Balak was mad at Balaam. He clapped his hands, and said, “I called you to curse my enemies, and you’ve persisted in blessing them three times! 11Go back home. I said I’d greatly honor you, but the LORD has prevented you from receiving your honor.”

12Balaam said,

“Didn’t I tell your messengers, 13‘Though Balak gives me his house full of silver and gold, on my own I can’t do anything contrary to the LORD’s command, good or bad. I’ll say what he says.’? 14I’m going to my people, but I’ll advise you what this nation will do to your people later.” 	Num 24:10-14

Balaam’s Last Oracle

15He took up this oracle:

“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,

the oracle of a man with his eyes wide open,

16the oracle of one that hears God’s message,

that knows Elyon,

that sees a vision from the Almighty,

and falls down with eyes wide open.

17“I see him, but not now;

I look at him, but not near.

A star will rise out of Jacob;

a scepter will arise from Israel.

He’ll crush the forehead of Moab

and tear down the sons of Sheth.

18Edom will be a possession;

Seir, his enemy, will be overtaken,

while Israel grows strong.

19A ruler will arise from Jacob

and destroy the remnant of Ir.	 Num 24:15-19

20He looked at Amalek and took up this oracle:

“Amalek was first among the nations,

but he’ll end in destruction.”

21He looked at the Kenites and took up this oracle:

“Where you live endures;

your nest sits on a cliff.

22Nevertheless, Kain will be consumed;

how long will Asshur hold you captive?

23He took up his oracle:

“Who can live except God ordains it?

24But ships will come from the coast of Kittim

and attack Asshur and Eber;

so they’ll end up in destruction too.”

25Balaam went home and Balak left.	Num 24:20-25

Moab Seduces Israel

25:1While Israel was camping in Shittim, the people started carrying on prostitution with the women of Moab. 2They invited the people to the sacrifices to their gods, and the people ate and bowed to their gods. 3In this way, Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry. 4He told Moses, “Seize the ringleaders and execute them in broad daylight in my presence so my fierce anger will turn away from Israel.” 5Moses told the judges, “Each of you put to death his men that have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.” 	Num 25:1-5

6One Israelite even brought a Midianite woman among his fellow Jews right in front of Moses and the assembly while they were crying at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 7When Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest saw it, he got up from the assembly. He took a spear, 8followed the man into the tent, and ran both of them through, and so checked the plague on Israel. 924,000 had died from it.	Num 25:6-9

10Then the LORD told Moses,

11“Phinehas has turned away my anger because he was as zealous as I am for my honor, so I didn’t destroy Israel. 12So say, ‘I’m giving him and his descendants my covenant of peace, 13a permanent priesthood, because he was zealous for me and atoned for Israel.’”

14The slain man was Zimri son of Salu, a family leader in Simeon. 15The Midianite woman was Cozbi, daughter of Zur, a family leader in Midian.

16The LORD told Moses,

17“Attack the Midianites and strike them down. 18They’ve been hostile to you by deceiving you at Peor with Cozbi their sister, who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor.” 	Num 25:10-18

The Second Registration of Israel’s Troops

26:1After the plague the LORD told Moses and Eleazar, 2“Count by families the men 20 years old and up that can go to war.” 3Moses and Eleazar told them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, 4“Count the men 20 years old and up.” The Israelites that came out of Egypt were as follows:

5Reuben by families was Hanoch, Pallu, 6-7Hezron, and Carmi: 	43,730

8The son of Pallu was Eliab, 9father of Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram the community called on to oppose Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD. 10The ground opened up and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, and the fire consumed 250 men. That served as a warning. 11The sons of Korah, however, didn’t die.

12-14Simeon by families was Nemuel, Jamin, Jachin, Zerah, and Shaul. 	22,200

15-18Gad by families was Zephon, Haggai, Shuni, Ozni, Eri, Arod, and Areli. 	40,500

19-22Judah by families was Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. 			            76,500

The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. Judah’s other sons Er

and Onan died in Canaan.

23-25Issachar by families was Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron. 	  64,300

26-27Zebulun by families was Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.	 60,500

28-37Joseph by families was Manasseh and Ephraim.

The sons of Manasseh were Machir, father of Gilead, father of Jezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, and Hepher. Hepher was father of Zelophehad, whose daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 	52,700

The sons of Ephraim were Shuthelah, Becher, and Tahan. The son of Shuthelah was Eran. 	32,500

38-41Benjamin by families was Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham.

The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman. 	45,600

42-43Dan’s family was Shuham. 	   64,400

44-47Asher by families was Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah. 				 53,400

The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel. Asher’s daughter was Serah.

48-50Naphtali by families was Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 	45,400

51601,730

Num 26:1-51

52The LORD told Moses,

53“Parcel out the land among these for an inheritance in proportion to their numbers, 54a larger inheritance for larger groups, a smaller one for smaller groups. 55Divide it up by lot by tribes. [56]” 	Num 26:52-56

57These are the Levites numbered by families: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 58These are the families of Levi: the Libnites, Hebronites, Mahlites, Mushites, and the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram. 59Amram’s wife was Jochebed, daughter of Levi, born in Egypt. She bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam. 60Aaron became the father of Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  61Nadab and Abihu died from offering before the LORD fire different from what he’d commanded. 62The number of male Levites a month old and up was 23,000. They weren’t counted with the Israelites because they didn’t inherit with them.

63Those were the ones Moses and Eleazar counted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.  64But Moses and Aaron didn’t count anyone they’d counted in the Wilderness at Sinai.  65That was because the LORD had said they’d die in the desert. Only Caleb and Joshua would survive.	Num 26:57-65

The Daughters of Zelophehad

27:1The daughters of Zelophehad son of (Hepher son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh son of) Joseph came near: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 2They stood in front of Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and said,

3“Our father died in the wilderness, but not among those who opposed the LORD with Korah. He died in his own sin and didn’t have any sons. 4Why should he disappear from his clan just because he didn’t have any sons? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”   	Num 27:1-4

5Moses brought the case to the LORD.

6The LORD told him,

7“Zelophehad’s daughters are right. Give them a possession among their father’s brothers and transfer their father’s inheritance to them. 8If a man dies without a son, transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 9If he doesn’t have a daughter, give it to his brothers. 10If he doesn’t have any brothers, give it to his father’s brothers. 11If his father doesn’t have any brothers, give it to the nearest other relative in his family. It will be an ordinance in Israel.”

Joahua to Succeed Moses

12The LORD told Moses,

“Climb one of the mountains in the Abarim range and look at the land I’ll give Israel. 13When you’ve seen it, you’ll pass on to your people like Aaron did. 14In the Wilderness of Zin, during the conflict with the community, you rebelled against my command to honor me as holy in front of them at the water” (of Meribah at Kadesh). 							      Num 27:5-14

15Moses said,

16“May the LORD, the God that gives breath to all flesh, appoint a man 17to lead the community so they won’t be like sheep without a shepherd.”

18The LORD told him,

“Take Joshua son of Nun, a man that has the Spirit in him, and put your hand on him. 19Have him stand in the presence of Eleazar and the community and commission him. 20Put some of your authority on him so the community can obey him. 21He’ll present himself to Eleazar, who will ask the LORD for him by the Urim. At his command, he and this whole community will determine what to do.”

22So Moses stood Joshua in front of Eleazar and the community, 23put his hand on him, and commissioned him. 				  Num 27:15-23

Daily Offerings

28:1-2The LORD told Moses to tell Israel,

“Present my offerings by fire at their scheduled times, an aroma pleasing to me, my ‘food.’ 3Make this offering by fire to the LORD every day: 2 male lambs a year old without defect. 4Offer one in the morning, the other in the evening. 5For a grain offering, offer .11 bushel .1 ephah of fine flour mixed with 3 pints ¼ hin of pressed olive oil. 6It’s a daily burnt offering that was ordained at Mount Sinai. 7The liquid offering that goes with it will be 3 pints ¼ hin of alcohol for each lamb, poured out in the Holy Place. 8Offer the other lamb that evening the same way with its grain offering and liquid offering. 	Num 28:1-8

Sabbath Offerings

40Moses told Israel everything the LORD commanded him.     	Num 29:17-40

Men’s Vows

30:1Then Moses told the tribal leaders,

“This is what the LORD has commanded. 2If a man makes a vow to the LORD or takes an oath that obligates him to do something, he must keep his word.

Women’s Vows

3If a woman takes a vow to the LORD and obligates herself to do something while in her father’s family in her youth, 4and her father hears it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 5But if her father forbids her, her vow or pledge doesn’t stand. The LORD will release her from them because her father forbade her.

6“But, if she marries while under her vow or rash statement 7and her husband hears about it and doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 8But, if he forbids her, he annuls her vow or rash statement, and the LORD will release her from it.

9“The vow of a widow or divorced woman stands. 	Num 30:1-9

10“However, if she vows in her husband’s house or binds herself to an obligation with an oath 11and her husband hears it, but doesn’t object, then her vow or pledge stands. 12But if her husband annuls it, it won’t stand, and the LORD will release her from them.

13“A husband can annul any vow or binding oath a wife submits herself to. 14If he doesn’t say anything to her the day he hears it, then he confirms it. 15But if he tries to annul it later, he’ll bear her guilt.”

16Those statutes the LORD commanded Moses about a husband and wife and a father and daughter in her youth in his home.	 	Num 30:10-16

Conquest of the Midianites

31:1The LORD told Moses, 2“Take revenge for Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you’ll pass on to your people.”

3Moses told the people, “Arm men to attack Midian and carry out the LORD’s revenge on it. 4Send 1,000 men from each tribe.”

5They provided 12,000 men. 6Moses sent them to war with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest along with the holy items from the sanctuary and bugles for signaling. 7They fought Midian and killed every male, 8including its five kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with a sword. 9They took the women and children, their cattle, flocks, and possessions. 10They burned their towns, houses, and camps; 11and took the spoil—people and animals. 12They brought the captives, prey, and spoil to Moses, Eleazar, and the community on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.	 Num 31:1-12

13Moses, Eleazar, and the leaders of the community met them outside the camp. 14Moses was mad at the officers of the army and the commanders of thousands and hundreds.

15“You’ve saved the women alive? 16They’re what got Israel to sin against the LORD at Peor, and a plague came into the community by Balaam’s advice. 17So kill every male child and every woman that has had intercourse with a man. 18Keep alive for yourselves the young girls that are virgins. 19Camp outside the camp for a week. Whoever has killed anybody or touched a slain body, purify yourself on the third day and seventh day, you and your captives. 20Purify every piece of clothing, anything made out of skin, goat hair, or wood.”

21Eleazar told the men that fought,

“The LORD commanded Moses this statute. 22‘The gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, and lead—23anything that doesn’t burn—put through fire to cleanse it; then purify it with water. Anything that will burn, purify with water. 24Wash your clothes the seventh day. You’ll be ceremonially clean then, and you can come into the camp.”	 Num 31:13-24

25The LORD told Moses,

26“You, Eleazar, and heads of families, count the spoil—people and animals—27and divide it between soldiers and community. 28Levy a tax for the LORD from the soldiers’ spoil: 1 per 500 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep. 29Give this share to Eleazar as a heave offering to the LORD. 30From Israel’s half, take 1 from every 50 persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep, and give them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle.”

31Moses and Eleazar did that.

32The prey that was left from the soldiers’ spoil was 675,000 sheep, 3372,000 cattle, 3461,000 donkeys, 3532,000 virgins.

36The soldiers’ half was 337,500 sheep; 37the LORDv’s levy, 675.

38There were 36,000 cattle; the LORD’s levy, 72.

39There were 30,500 donkeys; the LORD’s levy, 61.

40There were 16,000 persons; the LORD’s levy, 32.

41Moses gave the LORD’s levy to Eleazar the priest. 	Num 31:25-41

42Israel’s half was 43337,500 sheep, 4436,000 cattle, 4530,500 donkeys, 46and 16,000 persons. 47From Israel’s half Moses took out one from every 50 people and animals, and gave them to the Levites that take care of the Tabernacle.

48The commanders of thousands and hundreds came to Moses,

49“We’ve counted the men who fought and not a one is missing. 50So, from what each man found, we’ve brought an offering to the LORD: articles of gold, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and neck chains to atone for ourselves.”

51Moses and Eleazar took the gold and crafted articles, 52418¾ lbs 16,750 shekels worth. 53Each soldier had taken spoil. 54Moses and Eleazar brought the commanders’ gold to the Tent of Meeting as a memorial to Israel before the LORD. 	Num 31:42-54

Reuben and Gad Settle in Gilead

32:1Reuben and Gad had lots of livestock. When they saw that Jazer and Gilead had good grazing land, 2they spoke to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community,

3“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—4land the LORD overthrew for Israel—is suitable for our livestock. 5If we’re pleasing to you, give us this land instead of having us cross the Jordan.”

6Moses said,

“Will your relatives go to war, and you sit here? 7Why discourage Israel from going to the land the LORD has given them? 8That’s what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. 9When they went to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged Israel from going in. 10The LORD was angry that day and swore, 11‘No men that came up from Egypt 20 years and older will see the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they wouldn’t follow me. 12Only Caleb the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun faithfully followed me.’ 13The LORD made Israel wander in the desert for 40 years till that generation died off. 14You’re replacing your parents as sinful people to anger the LORD toward Israel. 15If you turn aside from him, he’ll leave you in the desert. You’ll be responsible for destroying this nation.”	  Num 32:1-15

16They came to him and said,

“We’ll build corrals here for our livestock and towns for our children, 17but we’ll take up arms and go with Israel till we’ve brought them to their place. Our children will live in fortified towns because of the people still in the land. 18We won’t go home till everyone has received their inheritance. 19We won’t inherit with them on that side of the Jordan; our inheritance will lie here.”

Num 32:16-19

20Moses said,

“If you take up arms 21and cross the Jordan till the LORD 22has conquered the land, you’ll meet your obligations. 23If you don’t, be sure your sin will find you out. 24Build your towns, put up corrals, and do what you’ve promised.”

25“We will. 26Our little ones, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay in towns in Gilead. 27But we’ll cross over armed to fight like you’ve said.”

28Moses charged Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of Israel,

29“If Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan and help you conquer the land, give them Gilead. 30If they don’t, they’ll have possessions among you in Canaan.”       [31-32]	    Num 32:20-32

33Moses gave to Gad, Reuben, and the Manasseh half-tribe the kingdoms of Sihon and Og, and the towns and territory around them. 34Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 36Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran—fortified towns and corrals for sheep. 37Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38Nebo, and Baal-meon (new names), and Sibmah. They renamed the towns they built. 39The sons of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it away from the Amorites. 40Moses gave them Gilead and they lived there. 41“Jair” son of Manasseh took its “towns” and called them Havvoth-jair. 42Nobah took Kenath and its villages and renamed it after himself.	Num 32:33-42

Recounting Israel’s Journey

33:1These are the segments of the journey Israel took when they left Egypt. 2The LORD told Moses to write them down. 3They traveled from Rameses on the fifteenth day, first month, the day after Passover. They left right in front of the Egyptians 4while they were burying the firstborn that the LORD struck. The LORD also carried out judgments against their gods.

Num 33:1-4

5They left from Ramses 			to Succoth,

6to Etham on the edge of open country,

where they turned back,

7to Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-Zephon,

and camped near Migdol.

8They passed through the sea

to the Wilderness of Etham

for 3 days

They camped at Marah and

9Elim, where there were

12 springs and 70 palms trees.

10They camped by the Red Sea,

11then in the Wilderness of Sin,

12in Dophkah,

13Alush,

14in Rephidim, where there was

no water to drink.

15They camped in the Wilderness of Sinai,

16Kibroth-hattaavah,

17Hazeroth,

18Rithmah,

19Rimmon-perez,

20Libnah,

21Rissah,

22Kehelathah,

23Shepher,

24and Haradah,

25in Makheloth,

26Tahath,

27Terah,

28Mithkah

29and Hashmonah,

30in Maseroth

31and Bene-jaakan,

32in Hor-haggidgad,

33Jotbathah,

34Abronah,

35Ezion-geber,

36in the Wilderness of Zin (Kadesh),

37and at Mount Hor on the edge of Edom

Num 33:5-37

38The LORD told Aaron to go up to Mount Hor. He died the first day, fifth month, fortieth year after Israel left Egypt; 39he was 123. 40The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard Israel was coming.

41Israel went					from Mount Hor

and camped in Zalmonah,

42then Punon,

43 Oboth,

44Iyeabarim (Iyim) on the border of Moab,

45at Dibon-gad,

46 Almon-diblathaim,

47the mountains of Abarim near Nebo,

48and in the plains of Moab

by the Jordan across from Jericho.

49They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim on the plains of Moab.

Num 33:38-49

50-51The LORD told Moses to tell Israel there,

“When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 52drive out the people, destroy their carved stones and molten images, and tear down their pagan shrines. 53Take the land and live in it because I’ve given it to you. 54You’ll inherit land by allotment per clan. Bigger clans will inherit more; the smaller ones will inherit less. Their allotments will fall within their tribe. 55If you don’t drive out the people, they’ll be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and cause you trouble. 56I’ll end up doing to you what I intend to do to them.” 	    Num 33:50-56

Boundaries of the Land

34:1-2The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“When you go into Canaan, 3your south border will run from the Wilderness of Zin alongside Edom from the end of the Dead Sea eastward. 4Your border will turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and go on along to Zin. It will end south of Kadesh-barnea, go out to Hazaraddar, and on along to Azmon. 5The border will turn from Azmon to where the River of Egypt empties into the Mediterranean Sea. 	Num 34:1-5

6“Your west border will be the Mediterranean Sea.

7“Your north border will stretch from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor, 8Lebo-hamath, Zedad, 9Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan.

10“Your east border will run from Hazar-enan to Shepham 11down to Riblah on the east of Ain down to the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth. 12It will go down to the Jordan and on down to the Dead Sea.”

13Moses told Israel,

“That’s the land you’ll inherit by lot, land the LORD told you to give to the-nine-and-a-half tribes. 14-15Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe have received their inheritance 15beyond the Jordan.” 	Num 34:6-15

Leaders for Dividing the Land

16The LORD told Moses,

17“Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide up the land. 18Name one leader from each tribe to divide it up:

19from Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;

20from Simeon, Samuel son of Ammihud;

21from Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon;

22from Dan, Bukki son of Jogli;

23from Joseph—Manasseh, Hanniel son of Ephod;

24	          —Ephraim, Kemuel son of Shiphtan;

25from Zebulun, Elizaphan son of Parnach;

26from Issachar, Paltiel son of Azza;

27from Asher, Ahihud son of Shelomi;

28from Naphtali, Pedahel son of Ammihud.”

29The LORD commissioned those men to divide up Canaan for Israel.   	Num 34:16-29

Towns for the Levites

35:1In the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,

2“Tell Israel to give the Levites towns to live in, 3along with pastureland for their cattle, herds, and animals. 4The pastures will extend 1500ft out from the wall all around the city, 5a 3,000ft diameter of pastureland. 6Give the Levites 6 cities as refuge for a person to flee to that’s killed someone accidentally. 7Give them 42 other towns with their pastures to make 48 total. 8The towns you give them will be in proportion to the number of towns each tribe inherits.” Num 35:1-8

Cities of Refuge

9-10The LORD told Moses to say to Israel,

“When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 11identify cities of refuge a person can flee to from killing someone accidentally. 12-13The 6 cities will serve as refuges from an avenger till the slayer can stand public trial: 143 cities beyond the Jordan and three in Canaan. 15They’ll serve Israelites, foreigners, and people living temporarily in Israel.	 Num 35:9-15

16“If a slayer kills someone with an iron instrument, it’s murder; execute the slayer. 17The same applies if the weapon is stone 18or wood. 19The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 20If one person pushes another in hate, throws something from an ambush, 21or hits barehanded with enmity and kills the other, it’s murder. The avenger is to execute the murderer on the spot when they meet. 	   Num 35:16-21

22“One person might push someone suddenly without enmity or throw something 23like a stone and hit the other accidentally. 24The community will decide between the slayer and the avenger by these ordinances. 25They’ll protect the slayer from the avenger by returning the slayer to the city of refuge till the high priest dies. 26If the slayer ventures outside the city, 27the avenger is not considered a murderer. 28The slayer should’ve stayed in the city till the high priest died. Then the slayer could have gone home.  	Num 35:22-28

29“These are permanent statutes wherever you live. 30On the testimony of two or more witnesses, execute whoever commits murder. One witness isn’t enough. 31Don’t take a ransom in place of execution 32or for someone that flees to a city of refuge so they can go home early before the high priest dies. 33Don’t defile the land you live in; blood defiles it. Don’t atone for land defiled by blood except by the blood of the one that shed it. 34Don’t defile the land you’re living in because I’m living in it with you.”	Num 35:29-34

Women Heirs of Property

36:1The heads of clans came down from Gilead (son of Machir son of Manasseh son of Joseph) to Moses and Israel’s leaders. 2They said,

“The LORD told you to allot land to Israel for inheritance, and to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our relative to his daughters. 3But if they marry outside their tribe, their inheritance will move to the new tribe. 4When Israel’s Year of Jubilee comes, it will become permanent in the new tribe and lost from ours.”

5So from the LORD Moses said,

“Joseph’s descendants are raising a legitimate issue. 6Do this: the daughters of Zelophehad can marry anyone in their father’s tribe. 7Inheritance can’t move from tribe to tribe. 8Every daughter that inherits must marry in her tribe. 9Each tribe will retain its inheritance.”

10That’s what the daughters of Zelophehad did. 11Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah married their uncles’ sons; 12and their inheritance stayed in their father’s tribe.

13The LORD gave those commandments to Israel through Moses in the Plain of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.	 Num 36:1-13

DEUTERONOMY

The Command to Leave Horeb

1:1Moses spoke to Israel in the open country east of the Jordan, in the Arabah across from Suph between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 2It takes 11 days to travel from Horeb/Sinai past Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. 3The first day, eleventh month, fortieth year, Moses told Israel everything the LORD had told him to give them. 4That was after he’d defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, in Heshbon and Og, king of Bashan, in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 5East of the Jordan in Moab, Moses undertook to explain the Law. 		         Deut 1:1-5

6“The LORD our God told us at Horeb/Sinai, ‘You’ve stayed long enough at this mountain. 7Go to the Amorites and their neighbors in the Arabah, the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon as far as the Euphrates River. 8I’ve put the land in front of you. Go in and take over what I swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants.’

Tribal Leaders Appointed

9“At that time, I told you, ‘I can’t handle the responsibility for you by myself. 10The LORD has multiplied you, and there are as many of you as stars in the sky. 11May he multiply you a thousand times and bless you like he promised, 12but I can’t handle the responsibility for you and your conflict by myself. 13Choose wise, insightful, experienced men from your tribes, and I’ll appoint them as your leaders.’ 14You answered, ‘That’s good.’ 15I took those wise, insightful men, and appointed them over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.

Deut 1:6-15

16“I instructed your judges, ‘Hear cases between citizens. Judge justly between them or the foreigners among them. 17Don’t show favoritism; hear least and greatest the same way. Don’t be afraid of people; it’s God’s judgment. Any case that’s too hard, bring to me. 18I’ve told you everything to do.’

Spies Sent Out

19“Then we left Horeb/Sinai and went through that terrible desert you saw on our way to the hill country of the Amorites. We came to Kadesh-barnea. 20I told you, ‘You’ve come to the hill country of the Amorites that the LORD is about to give us. 21Look, he has put the land in front of you. Take it over like he told you. Don’t be afraid or intimidated.’ 22Then you came and said to me, ‘Let’s send scouts ahead to look over the land, and report how to proceed against the towns we’ll enter.’ 23I liked that idea and took a man from each tribe. 24They went to the hill country and the Valley of Eschol and spied it out. 25They brought some fruit down to us and reported, ‘The land the LORD our God is about to give us is a good land.’ 	Deut 1:16-25

Israel’s Rebellion Against the LORD

26“But you wouldn’t go up. You rebelled against the LORD. 27You complained in your tents, ‘The LORD hates us. He brought us out of Egypt to deliver us to the Amorites. 28Where can we go up? Our relatives made our hearts melt when they said the people are bigger and taller than we are. The towns are large and fortified to the sky. They saw Anakim there.’ 29I told you, ‘Don’t be afraid of them. 30The LORD your God will go ahead of you and fight for you like you saw him do in Egypt. 31In the desert you saw how he carried you all the way here like a man carries his son.’ 32Despite that, you wouldn’t trust the One 33that goes ahead of you to find a place to camp and show you how to get there, the One that goes by fire at night and cloud by day. 	Deut 1:26-33

Israel’s Wanderings Decreed

34“What the LORD heard you say made him angry. He swore, 35‘None of you sinful people from this generation will see the good land I swore to give your ancestors. 36Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will see it. I’ll give him and his descendants the land he set foot on, because he’s followed me faithfully.’ 37The LORD was angry with me, too, as a lesson to you, ‘You won’t go in either. 38Your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will go in. Encourage him; he’ll make Israel able to inherit the land. 39What’s more, yourpl little ones that you said would become prey, your offspring that don’t know good from bad, will go in. I’ll give it to them; they’ll take it over. 40You turn around and head out for the desert by the Red Sea.’

Deut 1:34-40

41“Then you said, ‘We’ve sinned against the LORD. We’ll go up and fight like he commanded.’ Every man put on his weapons and thought it would be easy to go up to the hill country.

42“The LORD said to tell them, ‘Don’t go up to fight. I’m not with you; they’ll defeat you.’ 43But you ignored him. You acted on your own to go up to the hill country. 44The Amorites came out like bees and chased you and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. 45You came back and cried in the LORD’s presence, but he ignored you. 46So you stayed at Kadesh a long time.	Deut 1:41-46

Israel’s Wanderings Remembered

2:1“We turned around and set out for the desert toward the Red Sea like the LORD instructed me, and we circled Mount Seir for a long time. 2He told me, 3’You’ve circled this mountain long enough; turn north. 4Tell the people, “Go through the territory of your relatives, Esau’s descendants, who live in Seir. 5Don’t stir them up; I won’t give you a foot of their land. I’ve given Mount Seir to Esau. 6Buy food and water from them so you can eat and drink. 7The LORD has blessed you in everything you’ve done. He has known your wanderings through this big desert. He’s been with you 40 years. You haven’t lacked anything.”’

Deut 2:1-7

8“So we went past Esau’s descendants in Seir, away from the Arabah Road, away from Elath and Ezion-geber. We turned and passed through the Wilderness of Moab. 9The LORD told me, ‘Don’t harass Moab or stir them up to war, because I won’t give you any of their land. I’ve given Ar to Lot’s descendants. [10The Emim lived there before, a people as big, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. 11Like the Anakim they’re considered Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. 12The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but Esau’s descendants destroyed them and replaced them, like Israel did to the land the LORD gave them.] 13Cross Wadi Zered.’ 14It took 38 years to get from Kadesh-barnea across Wadi Zered. That whole generation of soldiers died—like the LORD swore. 15Besides, he opposed them, destroying them from inside the camp.

16“When those soldiers had perished, 17the LORD told me, 18‘Cross over Ar, the border of Moab today. 19When you get across from Ammon, don’t harass them; I won’t give you any Ammonite land. I’ve given it to Lot’s descendants. [20It’s regarded as the land of Rephaim as well because they lived in it before. The Ammonites call them Zamzummin, 21a people as big, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them in front of the Ammonites. They drove them out and replaced them, 22like he did for Esau’s descendants in Seir. He destroyed the Horites. They drove them out and have settled in their place till now. 23The Philistines came from Crete and destroyed the Avvim that lived in villages as far as Gaza and lived in their place.]

Defeat of King Sihon

24Pass through Wadi Arnon. I’ve given you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Start taking it over and confront him in battle. 25Today I’m beginning to put the fear of you on nations all around so when they hear about you, they’ll tremble with dread.’	 Deut 2:8-25

26“I sent ambassadors from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon with offers of peace, 27‘Let me go through your land. I’ll stay on the highway. 28Sell me food and water. Just let me go through on foot—29like the descendants of Esau and the Moabites did—till I cross the Jordan to the land the LORD is giving us.’ 30Sihon wouldn’t let us. The LORD had hardened his spirit and made him stubborn to deliver him to you. 31He told me, ‘I’ve started to deliver Sihon and his land to you. Start occupying it.’

32“Sihon and his people came out to fight us at Jahaz. 33The LORD delivered him, his sons, and his people to us. 34We captured his towns, and completely wiped out their men, women, and children. 35We just took the animals as spoil. 36From Aroer on the edge of Arnon valley and from the city that’s in the valley, all the way to Gilead no city was too strong for us. The LORD delivered them to us. 37You didn’t go near the land of the Ammonites—along Wadi Jabbok and the towns in the hill country—or wherever else the LORD prohibited.

Deut 2:26-37

Defeat of King Og

3:1“Then we turned and went up the highway to Bashan. Og king of Bashan and his people came out to battle at Edrei. 2But the LORD told me, ‘Don’t be afraid of him. I’ll deliver him, his people, and his land to you. Do what you did to Sihon.’ 3He delivered Og and his people to us. We didn’t leave any survivors.

4“We captured all 60 of Og’s towns, the whole region of Argob, his kingdom in Bashan. 5They were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars—besides a great many country villages.  6We destroyed them—men, women, and children—in every city, 7and took the animals and the spoil. 8We took the land of two Amorite kings east of the Jordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon. [9Sidonians call Hermon Sirion; the Amorites call it Senir.] 10We took all the towns on the plateau, all Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei. [11Og was the only Rephaim left. He had an iron bed 6 x 13½ft. It’s in Rabbah with the descendants of Ammon.]     	Deut 3:1-11

Division of the Land East of the Jordan

12“We took over that land. I gave Reuben and Gad the territory from Aroer by Wadi Arnon and half the hill country of Gilead and its towns. 13The rest of Gilead and all Bashan I gave to the Manasseh half-tribe—the whole region of Argob. [All Bashan is called The Land of Rephaim. 14Jair son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name. It’s still Havvoth-jair.] 15I gave Gilead to Machir. 16I gave Reuben and Gad the territory from Gilead to the middle of the Arnon valley. Their territory continued to Wadi Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites. 17I also gave them the Arabah, with the Jordan for a border from Chinnereth to the Sea of Arabah [the Dead Sea] at the foot of Pisgah to the east.

18“I told you at that time, ‘The LORD your God has given you this land. You trained soldiers, cross over armed, with your relatives, the people of Israel. 19Your wives, little ones, and livestock—I know you have lots of livestock—can stay in the towns I’ve given you. 20Stay there till the LORD gives your fellow citizens peace like he’s given you, and they take over the land west of the Jordan. Then you can go back to your possession.’

Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan

21I told Joshua, ‘You saw what the LORD did to those two kings. That’s what he’ll do to all the kingdoms you invade. 22Don’t be afraid of them. He’ll fight for you.’	 Deut 3:12-22

23“I also pleaded with the LORD, 24‘You’ve begun to show me how great and strong you are. What God is there in the sky or on earth that can demonstrate such power? 25Let me cross over and see the fair land beyond the Jordan, the good hill country and Lebanon.’ 26But he was angry with me out of regard for you. ‘That’s enough! Don’t bring it up again. 27Go to the top of Pisgah and look in every direction. You’re not going to cross the Jordan. 28Commission Joshua, encourage him and strengthen him. He’ll lead the people across and give them the land you’ll see.’ 29We stayed in the valley across from Beth-peor. 	Deut 3:23-29

Moses Commands Israel to Obey

4:1“Listen, Israel, to the statutes and case laws I’m teaching you so you can take over the land. 2Don’t add to or take away from what I’m telling you. 3You’ve seen what the LORD did to you at Baal-peor: he destroyed everyone that followed Baal-peor. 4But every one of you is alive today that held onto the LORD your God. 5I’ve taught you statutes and case laws like the LORD commanded me so you’d do them in the land you’re entering. 6Keep them; that’s your wisdom and understanding in front of the nations that will hear those statues and say, ‘This great nation has wisdom and understanding.’ 7What great nation has a god as near it as the LORD is when we call on him? 8What great nation has statutes and case laws as good as this Law I’m setting in front of you today?

9“Be careful not to forget what you’ve seen or let those memories ever leave your heart. Tell your sons and grandsons about them. 10Think back to when you stood in front of the LORD at Horeb/Sinai. He told me to gather you so you could hear what he was saying and learn to respect him all your lives and teach your children. 11You stood at the foot of the mountain, and it burned as high as the sky—black clouds and dense darkness. 12You heard him speak to you out of the fire, but you didn’t see any shape. 13He declared the covenant to you, the Ten Commandments he wrote on two stone tablets. 14He told me then to teach you statutes and case laws so you’d do them in the land. 	Deut 4:1-14

Idolatry Forbidden

15“Watch carefully 16not to do something corrupt by making a carved image of anything male or female, 17animal on land, bird in the sky, 18fish in the water, or what crawls on the ground. 19Don’t gaze at the sun, moon, and countless stars, and get drawn away into worshiping and serving what the LORD your God has allotted to everyone under the sky. 20He brought you out of the iron furnace (Egypt) to be his own people like you are now. [21] 22I’ll die here, but you’ll cross over and take possession of the land. 23Watch that you don’t forget his covenant and make a carved image of anything. He forbids it. 24He’s a consuming fire, an exclusive God.    	Deut 4:15-24

25“Later on, if your descendants make an idol and anger the LORD, 26you’ll soon perish. I call earth and sky to witness against you today. You won’t live there very long. 27He’ll scatter you among the nations, and there won’t be many of you where he drives you. 28You’ll serve gods there made out of wood and stone, gods that can’t see, hear, eat, or smell. 29But you’ll look to the LORD your God from there, and you’ll find him if you look with all your heart and soul. 30When you’re in distress and those things come on you later, you’ll come back to him. 31He’s a merciful God. He won’t fail you, destroy you, or forget the covenant he swore with your ancestors.

Only the LORD Is God

32“Indeed, ask about any earlier time since God created people. Ask about any other place from one end of the sky to the other. Has anything like this ever happened? Has anything like this ever been heard of? 33Has any people heard God speak out of fire like you have, and lived? 34Has any god taken a nation from inside another nation by trials, signs, and wonders; by warfare, a strong hand and outstretched arm; by great terrifying displays like the LORD did for you in Egypt right in front of you? 35Those things happened so you could know the LORD is God. There’s no god but him. 36From the sky he let you hear his voice to discipline you. On the earth he let you see his great fire and hear him speak out of it. 37Because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants and brought you out of Egypt by his great power. 38He’s driving out nations bigger and stronger than you, and giving you their land. 39Take it to heart then that the LORD is God in heaven above and on earth below. There isn’t any other. 40Keep his statutes and commandments that I’m giving you. Then things will go well for you and your descendants, and you’ll live a long time in the land he’s giving you permanently.” 	Deut 4:25-40

Cities of Refuge

41Then Moses set aside three towns east of the Jordan 42where a person who accidentally killed someone could flee to and live: 43Bezar in the open country on the plateau for Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead for Gad, and Golan in Bashan for Manasseh.

44That’s the Law Moses set in front of Israel—45the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances he gave them when they left Egypt. 46He did that beyond the Jordan in the valley near Beth-peor in the land of 47the two kings that ruled the Amorites east of the Jordan. 48Their land stretched from Aroer on the edge of Arnon valley to Mount Sion (Hermon). 49Their territories went all along the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan south to the Sea of Arabah at the foot of Pisgah.

Deut 4:41-49

The Ten Commandments

5:1Then Moses called Israel together,

“Listen to these statutes and ordinances so you can learn them and observe them carefully. 2The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb/Sinai. 3He didn’t make that covenant with our ancestors, but with us. 4Out of the fire he spoke to you directly at the mountain 5while I stood between him and you. I stood there to tell you what he said, because you were afraid of the fire and didn’t go up the mountain. He said,

6‘I am the LORD your God that brought you out of slavery in Egypt.

7‘Do not havef any god but me.

8‘Do not makef a carved image, any likeness of what is in the sky, on the ground, or in the water lower than the ground 9to worshipf or servef, because I am an exclusive God. I visit the consequences of parents’ sins on their descendants for three or four generations that hate me. 10I am kind to thousands who love me and obey me.

11‘Do not usef my name ‘the LORD’ your God as a byword. I will punish whoever does that.

12‘Observe the Sabbath. Set it apart like I’ve commanded. 13Workf six days, 14but the seventh day rest to me your God. Do not workf that day—you, your son or daughter, male or female servant, ox, donkey, cattle, foreigner among you. 15Rememberf that you were slaves in Egypt, and I brought you out with a strong hand and outstretched arm. That is why I have commanded you to observe the Sabbath.

16‘Honor your parents so you can live a long time and things will go well for you in the land I your God am giving you.

17‘Do not commit murderf.

18‘Do not commitf adultery.

19‘Do not stealf.

20‘Do not lief about other people.

21‘Do not covetf someone else’s wife, his house, field, male servant, ox, donkey, or anything else.’	 Deut 5:1-21

22“With a loud voice the LORD said that to your whole assembly at the mountain out of the fire, cloud, and dense darkness. He didn’t add anything else. He wrote it on two stone tablets and gave them to me. 23You heard him speak out of the blackness while the mountain was burning. The leaders and elders in your tribes came to me, 24‘The LORD our God has shown us how great and glorious he is. We’ve heard him speak out of the fire. We’ve seen him speak to people, but they still live. 25But why should we die? This great fire will burn us up. If we hear him speak anymore, it’ll kill us. 26Who ever heard the living God speak out of fire like we have, and lived? 27You approach him and hear what he says. Then tell us, and we’ll do it.’

28“The LORD told me, ‘I’ve heard what they said. They’ve done well in saying it. 29Oh that they had a heart to respect me and keep my commandments so it would be well with them and their descendants forever! 30Tell them to go back home. 31But you stand here with me so I can tell you the commandments, statutes, and case laws you’re to teach them.’ 32Do exactly what he says. Don’t stray away from it. 33That way you’ll live, things will go well for you, and you’ll occupy the land a long time. 	Deut 5:22-33

Call to Commitment

6:1“The LORD your God told me to teach you those statutes 2so you and your descendants would respect him and keep them your whole life and live a long time. 3Do them, Israel, so things will go well for you, and you’ll multiply in a land flowing with milk and honey.

4“Listen, Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD only. 5Love him with all your heart, soul, and strength. 6Keep in mind the things I’m commanding you. 7Teach them diligently to your children. Talk about them when you’re sitting at home, walking down the road, lying down, or getting up. 8Tie them like signs on your hand and make them like frontlets on your forehead. 9Write them on your gates and doorposts. 	Deut 6:1-9

10“The land the LORD is taking you to has big, splendid cities you didn’t build, 11houses full of good things you didn’t put there, hewn cisterns you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees you didn’t plant. When you eat and are satisfied, 12make sure you don’t forget him. 13Respect him only. Worship him and swear by him. 14Don’t follow the gods of people around you. The LORD is an exclusive God. 15If you follow other gods, his anger will flare at you and wipe you off the earth.

16“Don’t test the LORD like you did at Massah. 17Diligently keep his statutes. 18-19Do what he considers right and good so things will go well, so he’ll drive out your enemies and you’ll take over the good land. 20When your children ask you what his statutes mean, 21tell them, ‘We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, and he brought us out with a tremendous demonstration of power. 22He showed us great terrifying signs and wonders against Egypt, Pharaoh, and his household. 23He brought us out to give us this land. 24He told us to observe these statutes, to always respect him for our own good, for our survival, as is the case today. 25We’ll be good if we observe everything he’s commanded.’	Deut 6:10-25

Driving Out the Nations

7:1“The LORD will take you to the land and clear out the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites—seven nations bigger and stronger than you. 2He’ll deliver them to you, defeat them, and destroy them. Don’t make treaties with them or show them mercy 3or intermarry with them. 4They’ll turn your children away from following him to serving other gods. His anger will flare and soon destroy you. 5Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, burn their carved images.

6“You’ve been set aside to the LORD your God. Out of all the earth’s nations, he chose you as his own. 7He didn’t set his love on you because you were bigger than other nations; you were few compared to them. 8Because he loved you and wanted to keep his oath to your ancestors, he brought you out with power and redeemed you from slavery under Pharaoh. 9Know then that the LORD is faithful and keeps covenant and kindness to a thousand generations that love him and obey him. 10But he repays directly people that hate him. He won’t delay repaying them with destruction. 11Keep the commandments, statutes, and case laws I’m commanding you.    	Deut 7:1-11

12“If you keep these case laws, he’ll keep you with his covenant and kindness. 13He’ll love you, bless you, and multiply you. He’ll bless your offspring and what your ground produces—grain, new wine, olive oil. He’ll increase your herd and the young in your flock. 14You’ll be more blessed than any other nation. No male or female will be sterile among you or your livestock. 15He’ll keep you from getting sick and not put on you any of the diseases you knew in Egypt. He’ll lay them on people that hate you. 16You’ll consume the nations he delivers to you. Don’t show them any mercy or serve their gods. That would be a snare to you.

17“If you say to yourselves, ‘These nations are bigger than we are. How can we overtake them?’ 18You don’t have to be afraid of them. Remember what the LORD did to Pharaoh and to Egypt. 19Remember the great trials you saw, the signs and wonders, the strong hand and outstretched arm he delivered you with. That’s what he’ll do to the nations you’re afraid of. 20He’ll send hornets after them till they perish who hide from you. 21A great, awesome God is among you. 22He’ll clear them away little by little. You won’t be able to put an end to them right away. Wild animals would take over. 23He’ll deliver them by throwing them into confusion till you destroy them. 24He’ll deliver their kings to you to wipe out. Nobody will be able to resist you. 25Burn the carved images of their gods. Don’t covet the silver or gold that’s on them or take it for yourselves. It would be a snare to you, and it’s detestable to the LORD. 26Don’t bring anything detestable into your house to serve as a devoted thing. Detest it completely; abhor it utterly.

Deut 7:12-26

Call Not to Forget the LORD

8:1“Do every commandment I’m giving you today, so you’ll live and multiply, and take over the land. 2Remember the way the LORD led you in the desert those 40 years to humble you. He was testing you to see if you were committed to obeying him. 3He let you get hungry, then fed you with manna, which you and your ancestors had never seen. He made you understand that a person doesn’t live by bread alone, but by everything the LORD says. 4All that time your clothes didn’t wear out; your feet didn’t swell. 5He was disciplining you like a father disciplines his children. 6So follow his commandments and respect him. 7He’s taking you to a good land with streams and fountains, springs flowing in the hills and valleys. 8It’s a land of wheat and barley; grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates; olive oil and honey; 9a land where there’s plenty of food, whose stones contain iron, whose hills have copper you can mine. 10When you eat till you’re full, bless the LORD for the good land he’s given you.	 Deut 8:1-10

11“Make sure you don’t forget him or neglect his commandments, ordinances, and statutes. 12That way you’ll eat till you’re full, build nice houses and live in them, 13have herds and flocks that multiply, and increase your silver and gold along with everything else you have. 14Then you won’t get proud and forget about him. 15He led you through the big, terrible desert, its poisonous snakes and scorpions, its thirsty ground with no water. He brought water out of flint rock. 16He fed you manna to test you and humble you, to do you good in the end. 17Otherwise, you might say to yourselves that your own power and strength have created this wealth. 18Remember that he’s giving you the opportunity to create wealth in confirmation of his covenant. 19If you ever forget him and go after other gods, I’m telling you today, you’ll certainly perish 20like the nations he’ll make perish in front of you.    	Deut 8:11-20

Victory by God’s Power

9:1“Israel, you’re crossing the Jordan now to take over nations bigger and stronger than you, to take over big cities fortified to the sky, 2to take over people big and tall, the Anakim you’ve heard people say about, ‘Who can stand up to the descendants of Anak?’

3“Understand that it’s the LORD your God who’s crossing over ahead of you like a consuming fire. He’ll conquer and destroy them so you can drive them out quickly.

4“When he drives them out, don’t tell yourselves it’s because of your goodness that he brought you to this land. Instead, it’s because of their sinfulness that he drove them out. 5It’s not that you’re godly, but that they’re sinful. He’s confirming his oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

6“It’s not your goodness; you’re stubborn.			         Deut 9:1-6

The Gold Calf

7Don’t forget how you’ve provoked the LORD in the desert. From the time you left Egypt, you’ve been rebellious toward him. 8Even at Horeb/Sinai you provoked him. He was so angry with you he was ready to destroy you. 9When I went up on the mountain to receive the stone tablets of his covenant with you, I stayed there 40 days and nights without eating or drinking. 10He gave me the tablets he wrote that contained everything he’d told you out of the fire at your assembly. 11At the end of the 40 days, he gave them to me, 12‘Quick, go down. Your people have acted corruptly. They’ve turned aside so soon from what I commanded and made themselves a molten image. 13I’ve seen how stubborn they are. 14Stand aside so I can destroy them and erase their name. I’ll make a nation out of you that’s bigger and stronger than they are.’

15“I came down from the burning mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 16I saw you’d really sinned against him and made a molten calf. 17I threw the tablets down and shattered them in front of you. 18I fell down to the LORD as at the first for 40 days and nights. I didn’t eat or drink anything because your sin stirred him up. 19I was afraid his anger was going to destroy you, but he listened to me that time too. 20He was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I prayed for him at the same time. 21I burned the sinful calf you’d made, pulverized it, ground it up, and threw the dust into the creek that was running down from the mountain.	 Deut 9:7-21

22“Again at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked him. 23When he sent you from Kadesh-barnea to go up and take over the land he’d given you, you wouldn’t listen or trust him. 24You’ve kept rebelling since I first knew you.

25“I fell down to him for 40 days and nights because he said he’d destroy you. 26I prayed, ‘Lord GOD, don’t destroy your people, the permanent possession you redeemed with your greatness, the nation you brought out of Egypt by your power. 27Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t just look at these people’s stubbornness and sin. 28Otherwise, the country you brought us from will say, “The LORD took them out to kill them in the desert. He hated them and couldn’t take them to the land he’d promised them.” 29But they’re your people, your inheritance that you brought out with your great power and outstretched arm.’

Deut 9:22-29

The Second Stone Tablets

10:1“At that time, the LORD said, ‘Carve out your own two stone tablets like the first ones, come up to me on the mountain, and make a wooden Ark. 2I’ll write on the tablets what was on the ones you shattered. Put them in the Ark.’ 3I made an Ark out of acacia wood and hewed out two stone tablets like the first ones and carried them up the mountain. 4He wrote the Ten Commandments on them that he’d given you on the mountain out of the fire when you assembled. He gave them to me. 5I came down and put the tablets in the Ark, and there they are.”

Deut 10:1-5

[6The Israelites set out from Beeroth Benejaakan to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and his son Eleazar began to serve as priest. 7From there they set out for Gudgodah, then to Jotbathah, a land full of streams. 8At that time, the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark, to stand in his presence, to serve him, and bless in his name till now. 9That’s why Levi doesn’t have a territory with his kin. The LORD is his inheritance—like the LORD your God told him.]

10“I stayed on the mountain 40 days and nights like the firs t time. The LORD LORD listened to me that time, too, and didn’t destroy you. 11He said, ‘Go on with your journey ahead of the people so they can take over the land.’

Fear the LORD

12“Now, Israel, what does the LORD require from you but to respect him, follow his ways, love him, serve him with all your heart and soul, 13and keep his commandments and statutes for your own good? 14The sky and highest heaven, the earth and everything in it belong to him. 15Yet he set his affection on your ancestors and chose their descendants above all the other nations, as it is now. 16Circumcise your heart and don’t stiffen your neck. 17He is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, strong, awesome God that doesn’t show favoritism or take bribes. 18He carries out justice for orphans and widows, and loves foreigners by giving them food and clothes. 19So love foreigners because you were foreigners in Egypt. 20Respect the LORD, serve him, hold onto him, swear by him. 21He’s your praise and your God, who has done for you the great, awesome things you’ve seen. 22Your ancestors went down to Egypt 70 people total. He’s made you as countless as the stars.	 Deut 10:6-22

Love and Obey the LORD

11:1“Love the LORD and always keep his ordinances. 2I’m not speaking to your sons today. They haven’t seen his discipline, his greatness, his strong hand and outstretched arm; 3his signs and works against Pharaoh, his country, 4his army, its horses and chariots. He made the Red Sea overwhelm them when they chased you. 5Your children didn’t see what he did to you in the desert before you got here. 6They didn’t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram, Eliab’s sons, when the ground swallowed them, their families, tents, and everything living with them. 7But you have seen his great work.

8“Keep every commandment I’m giving you so you’ll be strong enough to take over the land, 9so you’ll live a long time in that land flowing with milk and honey. 10That land is not like Egypt, where you sowed your seed and watered it by hand like a vegetable garden. 11The land you’re entering has hills and valleys that soak up rain, 12a land the LORD takes care of and watches over year around.

Deut 11:1-12

13“If you’ll love him and serve him with all your heart and soul, 14he’ll give you the autumn and spring rains so you can harvest your grain, new wine, and olive oil. 15He’ll grow grass in your pastures for your livestock, and you’ll eat till you’re satisfied. 16Don’t let your hearts deceive you into serving other gods. 17His anger will flare at you, and he’ll stop the sky from raining and the ground from growing crops, and you’ll soon perish.

18“Impress these things on your heart and soul, tie them to your hand, wear them on your forehead. 19Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you’re sitting at home, walking down the road, lying down, or getting up. 20Write them on your gates and doorposts 21so you and your children will flourish in the land for as long as the sky’s above the earth. 22If you keep these commandments carefully, 23the LORD will drive out the nations. You’ll take over nations bigger and stronger than you. 24Everywhere you step you’ll own. Your borders will stretch from the desert to Lebanon, from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 25Nobody will be able to withstand you. Your God will make the whole land afraid of you.

26“I’m setting in front of you a blessing and a curse: 27a blessing if you listen to what I’m giving you, 28a curse if you turn aside after other gods. 29When the LORD takes you to the land, put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 30Aren’t they across the Jordan toward the sunset in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah near Gilgal and the Oaks of Moreh? [31-32] 	Deut 11:13-32

One Central Place of Worship

12:1“You’re to observe these statutes and judgments as long as you live. 2Destroy the places where these nations worship their gods—on hills and mountains and under every green tree. 3Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn their Asherah poles, cut down the carved images of their gods, erase their name from those places.

4Don’t conduct yourselves that way with the LORD your God. 5Look to him where he designates. 6Take your burnt offerings there, your sacrifices, your tithes and contributions, your offerings for fulfilling a vow, and your freewill offerings, the firstborn in your herds and flocks. 7Eat there with the LORD and celebrate in your endeavors. 8Don’t do like we’re doing here today, with all of you doing what seems right to you. 9You haven’t yet come to the resting place the LORD’s giving you. 10When he gives you security from your enemies, 14do everything I command you where he designates in one of your tribes—[11] 12byou, your children, your male and female servants, and the Levite inside your gates (since he doesn’t have any inheritance with you). [12a, 13] 	Deut 12:1-14

15“But, you can butcher and eat meat inside your gates however you like with the LORD’s blessing. The ceremonially clean and unclean can eat it, as with the gazelle and the deer. 16Only don’t eat the blood; drain it out on the ground. 17Don’t eat inside your gates the tenth of your grain, any offering for fulfilling a vow, or your freewill offerings and contributions. 18Eat them with the LORD where he designates and celebrate your endeavors. 19Make sure you don’t leave him anytime in life.

20“When the LORD extends your border and you want some meat, go on and eat it. 21If the place he designates is too far away, butcher animals from your herds and flocks where you live. 22Just like you eat a gazelle or deer, whether you’re ceremonially clean or unclean. [23-24] 25Don’t eat the blood, so things will go well for you and your descendants; you’ll be doing what’s right in front of God. 26But where he designates take your holy things and offerings to fulfill a vow. 27Offer your burnt offerings on the altar, pour out the blood on the altar, and eat the meat. [28]

29“When the LORD cuts off the nations you overtakesg, 30don’t asksg how they serve their gods so you can do that. 31They do for their gods every disgusting thing the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters to their gods.

32“Do what I tell you, nothing more or less.  	Deut 12:15-32

Warning Against Idolatry

13:1“If a prophet or dreamer arises and gives you a sign or wonder 2that comes true, and uses it to say, ‘Let’s serve other gods,’ 3ignore him. The LORD’s testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul. 4Follow him, respect him, keep his commandments, listen to him, serve him, hold onto him. 5Execute that prophet or dreamer. He has advocated rebellion against the LORD who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. He’s seducing you to leave the LORD. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.

6“If your brother, your son or daughter, the wife you love, your close friend tempts you privately to serve other gods—7of people near or far, from one end of the earth to the other—8don’t yield to them. Don’t show mercy or cover it up. 9Execute them. Be the first to strike against them, then the other people will join in. 10Stone them to death, because they have tried to tempt you away from the LORD your God that brought you out of slavery in Egypt. 11Israel will hear about it and show respect, and not do such a sinful thing again. 	Deut 13:1-11

12-13“If you hear that some worthless individuals have tempted the people in their city to serve other gods, 14investigate the matter thoroughly. If it’s true, 15strike them with the sword. Destroy the city, its people, and their livestock. 16Gather its spoil in its open square and burn it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Make the city a permanent ruin; don’t rebuild it. 17Get rid of any plunder marked for destruction so the LORD will turn his furious anger away, have mercy on you, and make a big nation out of you—like he swore to your ancestors. [18]

Deut 13:12-18

Ceremonially Clean and Unclean Animals

14:1“You’re the people of the LORD your God. Don’t cut yourselves or shave your eyebrows for the dead. 2You’re set apart to the LORD. Out of all the nations, he’s chosen you to be his nation.

3“Don’t eat anything detestable. 4You can eat these animals: cattle, sheep, goats, 5deer, gazelles, roebucks, wild goats, ibexes, antelopes, mountain sheep. 6You can eat any animal that has divided hoofs and chews their cud. 7Don’t eat camels, rabbits, and rock-badgers. They chew the cud, but don’t divide the hoof. They’re unclean. 8Don’t eat pigs. They divide the hoof, but don’t chew cud. They’re ceremonially unclean. Don’t touch their carcasses. 	Deut 14:1-8

9“You can eat water animals that have fins and scales. 10If they don’t have both, they’re ceremonially unclean.

11“You can eat any clean bird. 12You can’t eat eagles, vultures, buzzards, 13red kites, falcons, kites of any kind, 14ravens of any kind, 15horned owls, screech owls, sea gulls, hawks of any kind, 16the little owls, great horned owls, white owls, 17pelilcans, carrion vultures, cormorants, 18storks, herons of any kind, hoopoes, or bats.

19“Flying insects are ceremonially unclean. [20]

21“Don’t eat anything that dies on its own. You can give or sell it to foreigners in your town to eat. You’re a holy people.

“Don’t boil a kid in its mother’s milk.	 Deut 14:9-21

Tithes

22“Make sure to present a tenth of everything you sow in the field each year. 23Eat it in the LORD’s presence where he designates—a tenth of your grain, new wine, olive oil, the firstborn in your herd and flock so you’ll learn to respect him always. 24If you live too far away to take the tenth itself, 25sell it and take the money where he designates. 26You and your family can spend it on whatever you want—cattle, sheep, wine, alcohol—and eat it in his presence and celebrate. 27Don’t neglect the Levites in your town. They don’t have a territory to inherit.

28“At the end of the year, deposit a tenth of your produce in your town. 29The Levites (who don’t have an inheritance), foreigners, orphans, and widows in your town can come and eat till they’re full; the LORD your God will bless you in your work. 	Deut 14:22-29

The Year for Canceling Debts

15:1“At the end of every seven years, cancel debts. 2Creditors are to let go of what they’ve loaned to their fellow Hebrews. Don’t exact it from them; the LORD has canceled the debt. 3You can exact it from a foreigner, but not from fellow citizens. 4There won’t be any poor among you because the LORD will bless you like he promised 5if you obey this commandment. 6Lend to other nations, but don’t borrow from them. You’ll rule other nations; they won’t rule you.

7“If there are poor fellow citizens in your town, be sensitive. 8Be willing to lend them what they need. 9Don’t harbor the selfish thought, ‘The seventh year is coming, the year of debt cancelation,’ and not help them. They may call out to the LORD, and it’ll be a sin on you. 10Give generously without regret so the LORD will bless what you undertake. 11You’ll always have poor people in your land. Be willing to open your hand to your kin, the needy, the poor.  	 Deut 15:1-11

Release of Hebrew Slaves

12“If you buy Hebrew men or women, they’ll serve you six years and go free the seventh. 13When you set them free, don’t send them away with nothing. 14Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, your wine vat. Give to them in proportion to how the LORD has blessed you. 15Remember, you were a slave in Egypt, and he redeemed you. 16If a servant says he doesn’t want to leave, because he loves you and your household and gets along well with you, 17pierce his ear with an awl. He’ll be your servant permanently. Do the same thing with a maidservant. 18Don’t let it bother you to set servants free. They’ve given you six years with twice the service a hired hand gives. That way the LORD will bless you in whatever you do.

Sacrifice of Firstborn Male Animals

19“Consecrate to the LORD the male firstborn in your herd and flock. Don’t work the firstborn in your herd or shear the firstborn in your flock. 20You and your family will eat it every year with the LORD where he designates. 21Don’t sacrifice it if it has any serious defect like lameness or blindness. 22Eat it at home; ceremonially clean and unclean alike can eat it—like a gazelle or deer. 23Only don’t eat its blood. Drain it out on the ground. 	Deut 15:12-23

Passover Festival

16:1“In the month Abib, celebrate Passover to the LORD your God. That’s when he brought you out of Egypt at night. 2Sacrifice the Passover from the flock and the herd where he designates. 3For a week, only eat bread without yeast—the bread of suffering (you came out in a hurry)—so you’ll remember all your life when you left Egypt. 4For a week no yeast will be anywhere in any of your houses. None of the meat you sacrifice the first evening is to remain till morning. 5You can’t sacrifice the Passover anywhere except where the LORD designates for his name. 6Sacrifice it at sundown, which is when you left Egypt. 7Cook it and eat it where he designates. In the morning go back home. 8For six days, eat bread with no yeast. On the seventh, hold a solemn assembly to the LORD. Don’t do any work that day.	Deut 16:1-8

Festival of Weeks

9“Count seven weeks from when you start using the sickle on standing grain. 10Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the LORD with a freewill offering. Give in proportion to how he blesses you. 11Celebrate in his presence—you, your son and daughter, male and female servant, the Levite in your town, the foreigner, orphan, and widow among you. 12Remember that you were a slave in Egypt. Observe these statutes carefully.	 Deut 16:9-12

Festival of Tabernacles

13“Celebrate the Festival of Booths for a week after you’ve gathered in the grain from your threshing floor and the wine from your vat. 14Celebrate at the festival—you, your son and daughter, male and female servants, the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow in your towns. 15Celebrate a festival to the LORD for a week where he designates. He’ll bless everything you do and what you produce. You’ll be altogether joyful.

16“Three times a year, males are to appear in the LORD’s presence where he designates: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. They’re not to appear empty-handed. 17Every man will give as he can, in proportion to the LORD’s blessing. 	Deut 16:13-17

Judges Appointed

18“Appoint judges and officers in your towns by tribes. Judge the people with justice. 19Don’t distort justice. Be impartial. Don’t take bribes; they blind the wise and pervert the just. 20Pursue justice and justice only, so you can live and possess the land the LORD’s giving you.

Worshiping Other Gods

21“Don’t set up a wooden Asherah pole beside an altar you make for the LORD. 22Don’t set up sacred pillars. That’s something he despises.  	Deut 16:18-22

17:1“Don’t sacrifice an ox or sheep that has a blemish. The LORD detests that.

2-4“In any of your towns, if you hear about a man or woman that breaks the covenant by serving other gods or worshiping the sun, moon, or stars, verify that detestable thing thoroughly. 5Then take the person to your city gates and stone that man or woman to death. 6You need the testimony of two or three witnesses to execute anyone. Don’t execute anybody on the word of one witness. 7The accuser needs to throw the first stone. Then the people will join in. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.

8“If a case is too hard for you to decide in your courts—between one kind of homicide and another, between one kind of lawsuit and another, between one kind of assault and another—go to where the LORD designates. 9Go to the Levitical priest or judge that’s in office and lay the case in front of him. He’ll render a verdict. 10Carry out all its terms. 11Follow the law he teaches you in the verdict he gives. 12The person will die that ignores the priest or judge. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel. 13The other people will hear about it and show respect, and not act presumptuously again.	Deut 17:1-13

The King

14“When you’re in the land, you’ll want to install a king like the nations around you. 15Install a fellow citizen that the LORD chooses. 16He must not multiply horses for himself or send people to Egypt to multiply them. The LORD has said never to go back there. 17He must not multiply wives; they’ll turn his heart away. He must not amass silver and gold for himself.

18“When he sits on the throne, he’s to write a copy of this Law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. 19It’ll be with him to read all his life

so he’ll learn to respect the LORD by doing what it says,

20so he won’t lord it over fellow citizens,

so he won’t deviate from its commandments,

so he and his descendants will continue long in his kingdom.	Deut 17:14-20

Offerings for Priests and Levites

18:1“The Levitical priests won’t inherit territory. They’ll eat the LORD’s offerings by fire and his portion. 2He is their inheritance like he promised.

3“This is what the people owe the priests. When they offer a sacrifice—ox or sheep—they’ll give the priest the shoulder, two cheeks, and stomach. 4They’ll give him the first part of the harvest of their grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the first shearing of their sheep. 5Out of all the tribes, the LORD has permanently chosen Levi and his descendants to stand and serve in his name.

6“If a Levite living in a town in Israel solemnly wants to come to where the LORD designates, 7then he’ll serve there in the LORD’s name like his fellow Levites. 8He’ll eat equal portions as well as what he receives from selling his fathers’ property. 	Deut 18:1-8

Disgusting Practices Prohibited

9“When you go to a land, don’t do the disgusting things its people do. 10No one will burn a son or daughter as an offering, use fortunetelling, practice witchcraft, interpret omens, use sorcery, 11cast spells, call up the dead, be a medium or spiritualist. 12The LORD detests whoever does those things. It’s because of such detestable things that he’s going to drive those people out. 13Be blameless toward him.

Prophets True and False

14“Those nations listen to witches and fortunetellers, but the LORD your God doesn’t allow that. 15He’ll raise up a prophet like me from among you; listen to him. 16That corresponds to what you asked the LORD in assembly at Horeb/Sinai, ‘Don’t let us hear his voice again or see this great fire anymore. We’re afraid we’ll die.’ 17The LORD told me, ‘They’ve spoken well. 18I’ll raise up a prophet from among their fellow citizens like you. I’ll give him my message, and he’ll tell them everything I’ve told him. 19I’ll hold responsible whoever ignores what he says in my name. 20But any prophet will die that tries to speak in my name when I haven’t authorized it. The same thing applies to anybody that speaks in the name of other gods. 21You may wonder how you can tell what I haven’t said. 22When a prophet speaks in my name and it doesn’t happen, I didn’t say it. The prophet has spoken without my authority. Don’t pay any attention to him.’

Deut 18:9-22

Cities of Refuge

19:1“When the LORD cuts off the nations whose land he’s giving you and you settle in their towns and houses, 2set aside three towns, 3build roads to them, and section the land into three parts so a person that’s killed someone can flee to them.

4“This provision is for someone that kills another accidentally to flee to and live. 5It’s for cases like when a couple friends go to the woods to cut wood. When one of them swings the axe to cut down a tree and the iron head comes off and kills the friend, the slayer can flee to one of these towns. 6That way the avenger of blood can’t pursue in the heat of anger and take the slayer’s life. The slayer doesn’t deserve death because it didn’t happen because of hate. 7So set aside three towns. [8If the LORD enlarges your territory and gives you the land he promised your ancestors, 9and you always love him and follow his ways, then add three more towns.] 10That way you won’t become guilty of shedding innocent blood.

Deut 19:1-10

11“But it’s another thing if one person hates another, lies in wait, commits murder, and flees to one of these towns. 12The elders back home are to get the slayer returned for the avenger of blood to execute. 13Don’t show mercy. Purge from Israel the guilt for shedding innocent blood so things will go well for you.

14“Don’t move a boundary marker that the ancestors have set.

Use of Witnesses

15“A single witness can’t accuse somebody of a sin. It takes two or three witnesses to establish a matter. 16If a malicious witness accuses someone, 17both people will stand in the presence of the LORD, that is, in front of the priests and judges in office. 18The judges will investigate thoroughly. If the witness has accused falsely, 19do to him what he’d intended to do to the fellow citizen. That’s how you’re to purge sin from you. 20The rest of the people will show respect and not do such a sinful thing. 21Don’t show mercy: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.	Deut 19:11-21

Going to War

20:1“When you go to battle and see horses, chariots, and people more numerous than you, don’t be afraid. The LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, is with you. 2When you’re getting ready for battle, the priests will come to remind you, 3‘Don’t be fainthearted, Israel. Don’t panic or tremble. 4The LORD is with you to fight for you and save you.’ 5The officers will also say,

‘Who has built a house and not dedicated it? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else dedicate it.

6Who has planted a vineyard and not used its fruit? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else use it.

7Who is engaged to a woman and not married her? He can go home so he won’t die in battle and somebody else marry her.

8Who’s afraid? He can go home so he won’t make his companions’ hearts melt like his.’

9When the officers have finished speaking, they’ll appoint commanders to lead the people. 	Deut 20:1-9

10“When you approach a city beyond your promised territory, offer it terms of peace. 11If it makes peace, its people will serve you as forced laborers. 12But, if it doesn’t make peace with you, besiege it. 13When the LORD gives it to you, strike the men with the sword. 14Only the women, children, animals, and everything in the city take as spoil and use. 15Do that to all distant towns. 16In towns the LORD’s giving you as an inheritance, don’t leave anything that breathes. 17Destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 18That way they won’t teach you the disgusting things they do for their gods, so you won’t sin against the LORD your God.

19“When you besiege a city, don’t cut down its fruit trees. You can eat from them later. Is a tree a person, that you should besiege it? 20You can only cut down what are not fruit trees to build siege works.	Deut 20:10-20

Ceremonial Cleansing for Unsolved Murder

21:1“If a slain body turns up in open country and nobody knows who killed it, 2your elders and judges will figure how far it is to the towns nearby. 3The elders in the nearest town will take a heifer that hasn’t been worked, 4and go down to a valley with running water—a valley that hasn’t been plowed or sown—and break her neck. 5Then the priests, the Levites, will come—because the LORD has chosen them to serve him—to bless in his name, to settle assaults. 6The elders in that city will wash their hands over the heifer 7and say, ‘We haven’t shed this blood and don’t know who did. 8Forgive your people that you’ve redeemed, LORD. Don’t hold the guilt for innocent blood against us.’ He’ll forgive the murder. 9That’s how you’ll remove the guilt for murder when you do what God considers right.

Marrying a Captive Woman

10“When the LORD delivers your enemies to you in battle, 11and you see among the captives a beautiful woman you want to take as your wife, 12take her home and have her shave her head and trim her nails. 13She’ll change from the clothes you captured her in and live with you in your house for a full month, mourning her parents. After that you can sleep with her, and she’ll be your wife. 14If she becomes displeasing to you, let her go wherever she wants to. But don’t sell her or mistreat her, because you’ve humiliated her.	 Deut 21:1-14

Rights of the Firstborn

15“If a man has two wives, one loved and the other loved less, and both have had male firstborn, he can’t put the firstborn of the loved ahead of the firstborn of the one loved less if the latter is older. 16-17When he wills his possessions, he must give the double portion to the firstborn of the one less loved. The one that first issued from his virility holds the right of the firstborn.

A Rebellious Son

18“If anyone has a stubborn, rebellious son that won’t obey his parents or pay attention when they discipline him, 19they’re to take hold of him and take him to the elders in court in his hometown. 20They’ll tell them, ‘Our son is stubborn, rebellious, and disobedient. He’s a glutton and a drunk.’ 21The men in the city are to stone him to death. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you. All Israel will hear about it and show respect.

Various Regulations

22“If someone has been hung on a tree for a crime that deserves death, 23don’t leave the corpse on the tree overnight. Bury it the same day so you don’t defile the land the LORD is giving you. (God considers cursed a person that’s been hanged.) 	Deut 21:15-23

22:1“Don’t watch your fellow citizen’s ox or sheep stray off and not take it to its owner. 2If the owner doesn’t live close by or you don’t know who the owner is, take it home till the owner comes looking for it and then return it. 3Do the same thing with someone’s donkey, piece of clothing, or anything a person lost. You can’t confiscate it. 4Don’t watch your fellow citizen’s donkey or ox fall down on the road and not help it get it up.

5“A woman is not to wear a man’s clothes or vice versa. Whoever does that is detestable to the LORD.

6“If you find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground with a mother sitting on eggs or chicks, 7you can take the young, but let the mother go so you’ll prosper and have a long life.

8“When you build a house, build a short wall around the flat roof so you won’t be responsible for somebody falling off and dying.

9“Don’t sow in your vineyard a second kind of crop interspersed and thereby make both crops unusable. 10Don’t plow with an ox and donkey together. 11Don’t wear clothing made from wool and linen mixed. 	Deut 22:1-11

12“Put tassels on the hem of the four sides of your cloak.

Regulations for Sexual Purity

13If a man takes a wife and goes into her and then turns against her, 14accuses her of shameful acts, publicly defames her, and says, ‘I took this woman, but when I came near her, I found out she wasn’t a virgin,’ 15then her parents will bring the evidence for her virginity to the elders at the city gate. 16Her father will tell them, ‘I gave her to him as a wife, but he turned against her 17He accused her Hjjjjand accused her of not being a virgin. But this is the evidence of her virginity.’ They’ll spread the article of clothing in front of the elders of the city. 18They’ll take the man and punish him. 19They’ll fine him 2½ lbs 100 shekels of silver and give it to the girl’s father, because the husband publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. She’ll remain his wife, and he can’t divorce her. 20But if the accusation is true, 21they’ll take her out to the entrance to her father’s home. The men in her city will stone her to death because she committed a disgraceful act by serving as a prostitute in her father’s family. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.

Deut 22:12-21

22“If a man is caught lying with a married woman, both will die. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel.

23“If a virgin is engaged and another man lies with her, 24take them both to the city gate and stone them to death—the girl, because she didn’t scream in the city, and the man because he violated another man’s fiancée. That’s how you’re to purge evil from Israel. 25But if the man finds an engaged girl in a field and rapes her, then only the man will die. 26Don’t do anything to her; there’s no sin in her that deserves death. This case is like a man that murders someone. 27When he found her in the field, she screamed, but there wasn’t anybody there to rescue her.

28“If a man finds a virgin that’s not engaged and has sex with her and they’re discovered, 29the man will give her father 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. She’ll become his wife because he violated her. He can’t divorce her.

30“A man can’t marry his father’s former wife and thereby uncover his father’s cloak.	Deut 22:22-30

Exclusion from the Assembly

23:1“Nobody that’s been castrated or has his penis cut off, can go into the LORD’s assembly. 2No illegitimate person or his descendant can go into the LORD’s assembly for ten generations. 3No Ammonite, Moabite, or their descendant can go into the LORD’s assembly for ten generations. 4They didn’t meet you with food and water when you came out of Egypt. They hired Balaam son of Beor from Mesopotamia to curse you, 5but the LORD wouldn’t listen to him. He turned the curse into a blessing because he loves you. 6Never seek peace or prosperity with them.

7“Don’t detest Edomites; they’re kin. Don’t detest Egyptians; you lived as foreigners in their land. 8The third generation can enter the LORD’s assembly.

Uncleanness in Camp

9“When you go out as an army, keep yourselves away from anything impure. 10If a man is ceremonially unclean from night emissions, he must leave the camp the rest of the day. 11In the evening, he can take a bath and come back. 12Have a place outside the camp to go to. 13Keep a spade among your tools. When you defecate, dig a hole and cover up your feces. 14Since the LORD lives in your camp to deliver you from your enemies, your camp must be holy. He must not see anything detestable among you, or he’ll turn away from you.    	Deut 23:1-14

Miscellaneous Laws

15“Don’t hand over to their master any slaves that escape to you. 16Let them live among you where they choose. Don’t mistreat them.

17“No son or daughter will be a cult prostitute. 18Don’t take the hire of a female or male prostitute* to the LORD’s house for an offering to fulfill a vow. They’re detestable to your God.

19“Don’t charge your fellow citizens interest on money, food, or anything that can be loaned at interest, 20so the LORD can bless what you undertake. You can charge a foreigner interest.

21“When you vow to the LORD, don’t delay paying it. That would be a sin, and he’ll certainly hold you to it. (22Not taking any vow isn’t a sin.) 23You have to do what you voluntarily promise your God.

24“You can go into someone else’s vineyard and eat as many grapes as you want, but you can’t put any in a container. 25You can go into someone’s standing grain and pick off heads, but you can’t use a sickle on it. 	Deut 23:15-25

24:1“When a man gets married and his wife becomes displeasing to him because he finds something wrong with her, he’s to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away. 2If she marries another man 3and he divorces her or dies, 4her first husband can’t marry her again because she’s been defiled. That would be detestable to the LORD. Don’t bring sin on the land he’s giving you.

5“When a man gets married, he won’t be charged with any military duty for a year. He’ll be free at home to make his wife happy.

6“Don’t take a hand mill or upper millstone as a pledge. You’d be taking a livelihood as a pledge.

7“If someone kidnaps and enslaves or sells a fellow citizen, execute the kidnapper. That’s how you’re to purge evil from among you.

8“Keep an eye on a spot of leprosy and follow the priests’ instructions. 9Remember what the LORD did to Miriam on the way from Egypt. 	Deut 24:1-9

10“When you loan somebody something, don’t go into his house to get it. 11Let him bring it out to you. 12If he’s poor, don’t keep his pledge overnight. 13Give it back at sundown so he can sleep in his cloak and have a good attitude toward you. The LORD will consider you good.

14“Don’t oppress hired hands that are poor, citizen or foreign. 15Pay them each day before sundown. They’re poor and their livelihood depends on it. That way they won’t call out to the LORD, and it becomes sin in you.

16“Don’t execute parents for children or vice versa. Execute each person for that person’s sin.

17“Don’t pervert justice with a foreigner or orphan, or take a widow’s cloak as a pledge. 18Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the LORD freed you. That’s why I’m telling you this.

19“When you harvest your field and overlook a bundle, don’t go back to get it. Leave it for foreigners, orphans, or widows. The LORD your God will bless you in your work. 20When you beat the limbs on your olive tree, don’t go back over them. Leave them for foreigners, orphans, and widows. 21When you gather grapes from your vineyard, don’t pick back over them. Leave them for foreigners, orphans, and widows. 22Remember that you were a slave in Egypt. That’s why I’m telling you this. 	Deut 24:10-22

25:1“When people go to court and the judges decide their case, 2if the offender deserves to be scourged, the judge will make the offender lie down and be scourged in his presence the number of stripes appropriate to the offence. 3He can scourge him 40 times at most. More than that would be despising him.

4“Don’t muzzle an ox while it’s threshing.

5“When brothers live together and one dies with no son, the wife of the deceased can’t remarry outside the family. Her brother-in-law will take her as his wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law. 6Her first son will carry on her dead husband’s lineage so it won’t disappear from Israel. 7If the brother-in-law doesn’t want to take his brother’s wife, she’s to go to the elders at the gate and say, ‘My brother-in-law refuses to carry on my husband’s name in Israel. He doesn’t want to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to me.’ 8The elders will send for him and talk to him about it. If he persists and says, ‘I don’t want to take her,’ 9she’s to take his sandal off, spit in his face, and declare, ‘That’s what’s done to the man who doesn’t build up his brother’s house.’ 10His name in Israel will be ‘The house of the man whose sandal’s off [Bet-chaluts-hanna‘al].’  	Deut 25:1-10

11“If two men are fighting and one of the wives comes to help her husband by grabbing his attacker’s testicles, 12cut her hand off. Don’t show mercy.

13“Don’t have different-sized weights in your bags, 14and don’t have different-sized measures in your houses. 15Use full-sized, exact weights and measures so you’ll live long in the land. 16The LORD detests whoever cheats with weights and measures.

17“Don’t forget what Amalek did when you came out of Egypt. 18He attacked the stragglers in the rear when you were faint and tired. He didn’t fear God. 19When the LORD your God has given you peace from all your other enemies, remember to totally erase the memory of Amalek.	Deut 25:11-19

Firstfruits and Tithes

26:1“Once you’re living in the land, 2put some of its first produce in a basket and go where the LORD chooses to put his name. 3Go to the priest and say,

‘I declare to the LORD my God that I’ve entered the land he swore he’d give us.’ 4The priest will set the basket down at the altar. 5You’ll answer, ‘My ancestor was an Aramean nomad. He went down to Egypt and lived few in number, but he became a big strong nation there. 6The Egyptians abused us with hard labor, 7and we cried out to our ancestors’ God. He heard us and saw our misery, toil, and oppression. 8He brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and outstretched arm, with terror, signs, and wonders. 9He brought us here and gave us this land, flowing with milk and honey. 10I’ve brought the first produce of the ground you’ve given me.’ Set it down by the LORD and worship him there. 11You, the Levite, the foreigner among you will celebrate over the good he’s given you and your family. 	Deut 26:1-11

12“When you pay a tenth of your crop the third year, give it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow in your towns so they can eat till they’re satisfied. 13Say in front of the LORD,

‘I’ve removed the sacred portion from my house, and given it to the Levite, foreigner, orphan, and widow. I haven’t disobeyed any of your commandments: 14I’ve not eaten some of it while in mourning, removed any of it while ceremonially unclean, or offered any of it to the dead. 15Look down from your holy house in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you’ve given us, a land flowing with milk and honey—like you swore to our ancestors.’

Obeying the LORD

16“Today the LORD commands you to do these ordinances with all your heart and soul.

17Today you’ve declared that the LORD is your God and that you’ll follow his ways, keep his commandments, listen to him.

18Today the LORD has declared that you’re his people, the treasured possession he promised you’d be. 19He has declared that he’ll set you high above all other nations for praise, fame, and honor; and you’ll be consecrated to him.”

Deut 26:12-19

The Altar on Mount Ebal

27:1Then Moses and the elders in Israel charged the people,

“Keep the commandments I’m giving you. 2When you cross the Jordan, set up large stones coated with lime. 3Write this Law on them clearly so you can go to the promised land that’s flowing with milk and honey. 4Set up these stones on Mount Ebal. 5Build an altar there out of uncut stones—don’t use any iron tools on them. 6Offer a burnt offering to the LORD on it, 7and sacrifice peace offerings. Eat there and celebrate in his presence.” [ 8]

9Then Moses and the Levitical priests told Israel,

“Be still and listen. Today you’ve become a people for the LORD your God; 10so obey him.”	Deut 27:1-10

Curses from Mount Ebal

11Moses charged them,

12“When you cross the Jordan, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people. 13Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali will stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce a curse. 14With a loud voice the Levites will answer the people of Israel,

Deut 27:11-14

15‘Accursed is anyone that makes an idol or molten image—a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of a craftsman—and sets it up secretly.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

16‘Accursed is anyone that disrespects father or mother.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

17‘Accursed is anyone that moves a boundary marker.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

18‘Accursed is anyone that misleads someone that’s blind.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

widow.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

20‘Accursed is the man that lies with his father’s wife; he has uncovered

his father’s cloak.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

21‘Accursed is the man that lies with any animal.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

22‘Accursed is the man that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father

or his mother.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

23‘Accursed is the man that lies with his mother-in-law.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

24‘Accursed is anyone that strikes another person in secret.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

25‘Accursed is anyone that accepts a bribe to assassinate an innocent person.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’

26‘Accursed is everyone that doesn’t conform to this Law.’

The people will say, ‘Amen.’ 	   Deut 27:15-26

panic for the kingdoms. 26Your corpses will feed the birds and wild

animals. There won’t be anybody to scare them off.

with hemorrhoids, scab, and itch that won’t heal.

28“The LORD will strike you with madness, blindness, and

it.

grapes. Worms will eat them.

you’ll sink lower and lower. 44He’ll lend to you, but you won’t lend to him. He’ll be the head; you’ll be the tail.  	Deut 28:30-44

45“These curses will come on you till they destroy you, because you wouldn’t obey the LORD. 46They’ll become a sign and a wonder on you and your descendants forever. 47Since you didn’t serve him with joy and happiness for the abundance of everything, 48you’ll serve the enemies he sends against you, and you’ll do so in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and the lack of everything. He’ll put an iron yoke on your neck till he’s destroyed you.

49“The LORD will bring a nation against you from the end of the earth like a swooping eagle, a nation whose language you can’t understand. 50It’ll be a nation that doesn’t respect the old or favor the young. 51It’ll eat the offspring of your herd and the produce from your ground. It won’t leave you any grain, new wine, olive oil, increase in your herd, or the young in your flock till its people wipe you out. 52It will besiege you in your towns till your high, fortified walls you trusted come down all over your land. 53In the sieges you’ll be so oppressed you’ll eat the offspring of your own body, the sons and daughters the LORD gave you. 54Your refined, cultured gentleman will be hostile toward his brother, the wife he cherishes, his children that remain. 55He won’t give a one of them any of his children’s flesh he’s eating, because he won’t have anything left during the oppressive siege. 56Your refined, cultured lady that wouldn’t walk on the ground barefoot, will be hostile toward the husband she cherishes, her son and daughter, 57the afterbirth from between her legs, the children she bears. She’ll eat them secretly for lack of anything else during the oppressive siege. 	Deut 28:45-57

58“If you don’t observe the laws in this scroll and respect this honored and awesome name, ‘The LORD Your God’ [Yahveh-Elohekha], 59he’ll bring severe plagues, miserable chronic diseases on you and your descendants. 60He’ll bring on you Egypt’s diseases that you feared and still cling to you. 61He’ll even bring on you sicknesses and plagues that aren’t in this scroll.

62“Although you were like stars in the sky, you’ll end up being few. 63As the LORD delighted in prospering you, he’ll delight in destroying you. He’ll tear you from the land you’re entering 64and scatter you among the nations from one end of the world to the other. You’ll serve wooden and stone gods there. 65You won’t find anywhere to rest your feet. He’ll give you a cringing heart, failing eyes, despairing souls. 66Your life will hang uncertain in front of you, and you’ll dread night and day with no assurance that you’ll live. 67In the morning you’ll say, ‘Oh that it was evening!’ In the evening you’ll say, ‘Oh that it was morning!’ 68The LORD will take you back to Egypt in ships. You’ll never see your country again. You’ll try to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but nobody will buy you.”	 Deut 28:58-68

Renewal of the Covenant

29:1The LORD told Moses to make this covenant with Israel in Moab besides the covenant he made with them at Horeb/Sinai. 2Moses called Israel together and said,

“You’ve seen what the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his officials, and his land. 3You saw the great trials, signs, and wonders. 4Yet he still hasn’t given you a heart to know, eyes to see, or ears to hear. 5I’ve been leading you for 40 years in the desert. Your clothes and sandals haven’t worn out. 6You didn’t eat bread or drink wine or alcohol, but he provided for you so you would know he’s the LORD your God. 7When you got here, Sihon and Og came out to meet us, but we defeated them. 8We gave their land to Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe. 9So keep this covenant so you can prosper in everything you do.

10“You’re standing today in the LORD’s presence: your chiefs, tribes, elders, officers, all the men in Israel, 11your children and wives, foreigners in your camps from the ones that chop your wood to the ones that draw your water. 12You’re standing here to enter the covenant with the LORD and into the oath he’s taking with you today 13to establish you as his people and himself as your God—like he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.	Deut 29:1-13

14“It’s not just with you that he’s making this covenant and taking this oath. 15It’s with the ones that aren’t standing here yet. (16You know how we lived in Egypt, and how we passed through the nations. 17You’ve seen their detestable things and their idols made out of wood, stone, silver, and gold.) 18He’s making this covenant so there won’t be any man or woman, family or tribe, whose heart turns away from him to serve those nations’ gods. He’s doing it so there won’t be among you a root that bears bitter, poisonous fruit, 19or anyone that gloats with this curse, ‘I have peace though I’m living in stubbornness to destroy the watered land with the dry.’ 20The LORD will never forgive such people. His anger and jealousy will burn against them. Every curse in this scroll will lie on them, and he’ll erase their names from under the sky. 21He’ll single them out for adversity. 	Deut 29:14-21

22“Your future generations and the foreigners from distant lands will see the plagues and diseases the LORD inflicts on this land. They’ll say, 23‘This whole land is sulfur and salt, a burning wasteland, unsown, unproductive, and without vegetation. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which he overthrew.’ 24The nations will ask, ‘Why’d the LORD do that to it? Why’s he so angry?’ 25People will answer, ‘Because they forsook his covenant with them and their ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt. 26They served other gods he hadn’t given them. 27So his anger burned against their land, and he brought on it every curse in this scroll. 28He uprooted them and threw them into other lands, like they are now.’

29“The secret things belong to the LORD, but the revealed things belong to us and our descendants permanently so we can observe everything in this Law.

Deut 29:22-29

Prosperity for Turning to the LORD

30:1-2“When these blessings and curses have come down on you, and you and your descendants remember them where the LORD banishes you, and you change and obey him with all your heart and soul—3then he’ll show you mercy and bring you back from captivity in the nations where he’s scattered you. 4Even if you’re far away, he’ll return you 5to your ancestors’ land to possess it again. He’ll prosper you and multiply you more than your forebears. 6He’ll circumcise your and your descendants’ hearts so you’ll love him heart and soul, and have life. 7The LORD will inflict these curses on people that hate you and persecute you. 8You’ll obey him again in everything I’m telling you now. 9Then he’ll prosper you in what you do, in the offspring from your body and your livestock, and in the produce from your ground. He’ll delight in you again like he did in your ancestors. [10]

The Choice Between Life and Death

11“This commandment’s not too hard for you. It’s not out of reach 12in the sky, that would make you say, ‘Who’ll go up to get it for us so we can hear it and do it?’ 13It’s not beyond the ocean that would make you say, ‘Who’ll go get it for us so we can hear it and do it?’ 14It’s right beside you, in your mouth and heart, so you can do it.   	  Deut 30:1-14

15“Look, today I’m setting life and prosperity in front of you, death and adversity. 16It’s prosperity if you love the LORD, follow his ways, and keep his commandments so you can live and multiply, and he can bless you in the land. 17It’s adversity if your heart turns away and you go serve other gods.  18You’ll completely perish. You won’t live long in the land you’re crossing the Jordan to possess. 19I call earth and sky as witnesses: I’ve set life and death in front of you, a blessing and a curse. Choose life so you and your descendants will live. Choose life 20by loving the LORD your God, obeying him, holding tight to him. This is your life and length of days: to live in the land he swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”	Deut 30:15-20

Joshua to Succeed Moses

31:1Moses went and told all Israel,

2“I’m 120 years old today. I can’t do like I used to, and the LORD has told me I won’t cross the Jordan. 3He’llY cross ahead of you and destroy those nations, and you’ll take over their land. Joshua will cross ahead of you like the LORD said. 4The LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon, Og, and their lands. 5He’ll deliver them up to you, and you’ll do to them like I’ve commanded you. 6Be strong and courageous; don’t tremble with fear at them. The LORD’s going with you. He won’t fail you or abandon you.”

7 Then Moses called Joshua and told him in the presence of all Israel,

“Be strong and courageous. You’llsg go with these people into the land and give it to them to inherit. 8The LORD will go ahead of you. He won’t fail you or abandon you. Don’t be afraid or intimidated.

Public Reading of the Law

9Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests, the Levites who carried the Ark of the Covenant, and to the elders in Israel. 10Then he told them,

“At the end of every seven years, at the time of year for forgiving debts, at the Festival of Booths—11when Israel appears in the LORD’s presence—read this Law to all Israel. 12Gather the people, men and women, children, foreigners in your town so they can hear and learn to respect the LORD. Be sure to observe everything in this Law. 13The children who haven’t known will hear and learn to respect the LORD as long as they live on the land they’re about to take over.”

Deut 31:1-13

Israel’s Rebellion Predicted

14The LORD told Moses,

“It’s time for you to die. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting so I can commission him.”

So Moses and Joshua presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting. 15The LORD appeared in a pillar of cloud at the doorway 16and told Moses,

“You’re about to lie down with your ancestors. This nation will carry on prostitution with the foreign gods in the land they’re entering. They’ll leave me and break my covenant. 17My anger will flare at them, and I’ll leave them and make myself invisible to them. They’ll be consumed, and many troubles will come on them. They’ll say then, ‘Isn’t it because our God is not among us?’ 18But I’ll hide from them because of all the sins they’ll do in turning to other gods. 19So write this song and teach it to Israel. Have them learn it so it will be evidence for me against them. 20When I take them to the land flowing with milk and honey, they’ll eat till they’re satisfied and become prosperous. Then they’ll turn to other gods and serve them. They’ll spurn me and break my covenant. 21When many troubles have come on them, this song will confront them. (Their descendants won’t forget it.) I know what they’re already heading for even before I’ve taken them into the land.”	     Deut 31:14-21

22Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to Israel.

23Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun, “Be strong and courageous; you’ll take the people into the land, and I’ll be with you.”

24When Moses had finished writing the whole Law in a scroll, 25he told the Levites who carried the Ark of the Covenant,

26“Put this Law beside the Ark as a witness against you. 27I know you’re rebellious and stubborn. While I’ve been alive with you up to now, you’ve rebelled against the LORD. How much more after I die? 28Gather the elders and officials in your tribes so I can tell them these things and call earth and sky as witness against them. 29I know that after I die, you’ll turn away from what I’ve commanded you. Disaster will come on you because you’ll do what the LORD forbids and make him angry.”	 Deut 31:22-29

The Song of Moses

30Then Moses presented this whole song to the assembly:

32:1“Listen, sky; let me speak;

earth, hear what I say.

2Let my teaching fall like rain;

let my speech distill like dew,

like drops on fresh grass,

like showers on plants;

3because I’m proclaiming the LORD.

Credit greatness to our God, the Rock!		Deut 31:30-32:1-3

4His work is perfect;

his ways are just,

a faithful and just God,

good and upright.

5His people have acted corruptly toward him;

they’re not his children because of their defect;

they’re a perverse, crooked generation.

6Is that the way you repay the LORD,

you foolish people?

Isn’t he your Father who bought you,

who made you and made you secure?		Deut 32:4-6

7Remember the old days;

consider the years of past history.

Ask your father, he’ll inform you;

ask your elders, they’ll tell you.

8When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,

when he divided up the human race,

he set people’s boundaries

in comparison to the numbers in Israel.

9For the LORD’s people are his portion;

Jacob is his allotted inheritance.

10He found them a desert land;

in the howling wasteland of a desert

he surrounded them, cared for them,

guarded them like the pupil of his eye.	Deut 32:7-10

11Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,

that hovers over its young,

he spread his wings and caught them;

he carried them on his pinions.

12The LORD alone guided them;

no foreign god was among them.

13He made them ride above the high places of the earth;

they ate the crops in the field.

He enabled them to suck honey from rock

and olive oil from flint stone,

14curds from cows, milk from the flock,

with the fat of lambs

and rams—the breed from Bashan—and goats,

with the finest wheat,

They drank wine made from grape juice.		Deut 32:11-14

15“But Jeshurun soon got fat and rebelled;

they grew fat, thick, and sleek.

They forsook the God that made them

and scorned the Rock that saved them.

16They made him jealous with foreign gods

and provoked him with disgusting deeds.

17They sacrificed to demons that aren’t God,

to gods they hadn’t known,

to new gods that came lately,

that their ancestors didn’t dread.

18They neglected the Rock that begot them

and forgot the God that bore them.		Deut 32:15-18

19“The LORD saw that and spurned them

because his sons and daughters provoked him.

20He said, ‘I’ll hide from them

and see what their end will be;

they’re a perverse generation of unfaithful offspring.

21They made me jealous with what’s not God;

they provoked me with their idols.

So I’ll make them jealous with those who aren’t a people;

I’ll provoke them with a foolish nation.

22A fire has kindled my anger,

one that burns to the bottom of Sheol;

it consumes the ground along with its yield

and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.

Deut 32:19-22

23“I’ll pile misfortunes on them

and shoot my arrows at them.

24They’ll be wasted by famine

and consumed by scorching heat and bitter destruction;

I’ll sic the animals on them

and the venom of snakes that slither in the dirt.

25A sword will bereave them outside,

and panic inside—

young man and virgin,

nursing baby and graying grandpa.

26I would’ve said, ‘I’ll cut them in pieces

and erase their memory from people’s minds,’

27if I hadn’t feared provocation by enemies

or adversaries that would misjudge and say,

‘We won! The LORD hasn’t done all that.’	 Deut 32:23-27

28“They’re a nation without counsel,

bereft of understanding.

29Oh that they’d be wise and understand

so they’d discern their own future!

30How could one chase 1,000

and two put 10,000 to flight

unless their Rock had sold them out,

unless the LORD had given them up?

31Their rock is certainly not like our Rock;

even our enemies can see that.

32Their grapevine grows from Sodom’s vines

from Gomorrah’s vineyards.

Their grapes are poisonous;

their clusters are bitter.

33Their wine is snake venom,

cobras’ deadly poison.	Deut 32:28-33

34“The LORD says, ‘Isn’t that stored up with me

and sealed in my treasuries?

35Vengeance and retribution are my business;

in due time their foot will slip.

Their time for catastrophe is coming;

impending things are rushing at them,’

36because the LORD will vindicate his people

and show mercy to his servants.

When he sees their strength is gone

and nobody remains, bond or free,

37he’ll say, ‘Where are their gods,

the rock they looked to for refuge?

38Who ate the fat of their sacrifices

and drank the wine of their liquid offerings?

Let their gods rise up and help them;

let them be their hiding place!

39See now that I’m the One;

there’s no god but me.

I’m the One that puts to death and gives life.

I’ve wounded, and I’m the One that heals.

Nobody can deliver them from me.		Deut 32:34-39

40Indeed, I lift up my hand to the sky

and say, ‘as I live forever.’

41When I sharpen my flashing sword

and begin to render justice,

I’ll carry out vengeance on my enemies

and pay back the ones that hate me.

42I’ll make my arrows drunk with blood.

My sword will devour flesh

with the blood of the slain and the captives

from the heads of the enemy’s leaders.’

43Celebrate, Gentiles, with his people;

for he’ll avenge his servants’ blood.

He’ll carry out vengeance on his adversaries

and atone for his land and his people.”	Deut 32:40-43

44Then Moses came with Joshua and presented the song to the people. 45When he’d finished, 46he told them,

“Take my warnings to heart. Tell your sons to observe them carefully. 47It’s not an idle message; it’s your life. It affects how long you’ll live in the land you’re crossing Jordan to take over.”

48The LORD told Moses that same day,

49“Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, in Moab across from Jericho, and look across at Canaan. 50Then die on the mountain and pass on to your people, like Aaron your brother did on Mount Hor. 51You broke faith with me among the Israelites at the water of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. You didn’t honor me as holy among them. 52You’ll see the land at a distance, but you can’t go in.”	 Deut 32:44-52

Moses Blesses the Tribes

33:1 Moses the man of God gave this blessing to Israel before he died:

2“The LORD came from Sinai

and dawned from Seir;

he shined out from Mount Paran.

He came with ten thousand holy ones

with flashing lightning at his right hand.

3He loved his people;

all the ones consecrated to him

were in his hand;

so they followed in his steps

and received direction from him

4when Moses commanded us a law

as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.

5The LORD became king in Jeshurun,

when the leaders of the people gathered

all the tribes of Israel.”

6“Let Reuben live,

let his people not be few.”			           Deut 33:1-6

7He said about Judah,

“Listen, LORD, to Judah

and bring him to his people.

With your hands, contend for him

and help him against his enemies.”		Deut 33:7

8 He said about Levi,

“You’ve given Levi your Thummin

and your Urim to that godly man

that you tested at Massah

and strove with at Meribah;

9who said of his parents,

‘I don’t care about them’;

who disowned his relatives

and ignored his children

in preference to observing your word

and keeping your covenant.

10He’ll teach Jacob your ordinances

and Israel your Law.

He’ll put incense in front of you

and whole burnt offering on your altar.

11 LORD, bless his substance

and accept his ministry.

Crush the loins of his adversaries,

the ones who hate him,

so they won’t get up again.”	                      Deut 33:8-11

12 He said about Benjamin,

“The LORD’s beloved

lives in safety beside him.

He surrounds him all day long

and makes his home

between his shoulders.”	Deut 33:12

13He said about Joseph,

“May the LORD bless his land

with the best gifts from the sky above

and the deep below,

14with the best fruits of the sun

and the rich yield of the months,

15with the finest produce of the ancient mountains

and the abundance of the everlasting hills,

16with the best gifts of the soil and its bounty,

and the favor of him that appeared in the bush.

May these come on Joseph’s head

and on the crown of the one that’s

chief among his brothers.

17He has the majesty of a young bull

and the horns of a wild ox.

He’ll gore the nations

to the ends of the earth.

Such are the thousands of Manasseh

and the ten thousands of Ephraim.”		 Deut 33:13-17

18He said about Zebulun and Issachar,

“Celebrate, Zebulun, in your travels,

and Issachar, in your tents.

19Call the people to the mountains

to offer proper sacrifices.

Draw wealth from the sea

and hidden treasures from the sand.”	Deut 33:18-19

20He said about Gad,

“Blessed is the one that enlarges Gad’s territory.

Gad crouches like a lion

to tear off an arm and the crown from the head.

21He chose the best land for himself,

because a commander’s portion was reserved there.

He came to the heads of the people;

with Israel he carried out the LORD’s commands

and just decrees.”				Deut 33:20-21

22He said about Dan,

“Dan is a lion’s cub

that leaps out from Bashan.”			Deut 33:22

23He said about Naphtali,

“Naphtali, satisfied by being favored

and full of the LORD’s blessing,

possess the lake and the south.”			Deut 33:23

24He said about Asher,

“May Asher be more blessed than other sons;

let him be his brothers’ favorite,

and let him dip his foot in olive oil.

25Your bars will be iron and bronze;

your strength will be like your days.”		Deut 33:24-25

26“There’s none like the God of Jeshurun,

who rides through the heavens to help you,

who rides through the sky in his majesty.

27The eternal God is where you live;

his everlasting arms undergird you.

He thrust out your enemy in front of you

and said, ‘Destroy them.’

28So Israel lives in safety,

the fountain of Jacob alone,

in a land of grain and wine;

his sky drops dew.

29You’re blessed, Israel.

Who is like you,

a people the LORD has saved,

the LORD, the shield that protected you,

the sword that gave you triumph?

Your enemies will come cringing before you;

you’ll walk on their backs.” 				Deut 33:26-29

The Death of Moses

34:1Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah across from Jericho. The LORD showed him the land, Gilead to Dan; 2Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh; the land of Judah to the Mediterranean Sea; 3the Negev and the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms as far as Zoar. 4He told him, “This is the land I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ‘I’ll give it to your descendants.’ I’ve let you see it, but not enter it.” 5So Moses died in Moab. 6The LORD buried him in an unknown place in a valley in Moab across from Beth-peor. 7Although he was 120 when he died, his sight was still clear, and his energy was good. 8Israel mourned him for 30 days in the plains of Moab.

9Joshua was wise because Moses had laid his hands on him. The Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD told Moses. 10Since then no prophet has risen in Israel that the LORD related to directly. 11There was nobody like him for the signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt against Pharaoh, his officials, and his country, 12and for the great power and terrifying deeds he performed for Israel to see.  	Deut 34:1-12

JOSHUA

The LORD’s Charge to Joshua

1:1After Moses died, God said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant,

2“Moses has died. You and the people, cross the Jordan to the land I’m giving you. 3Like I promised Moses, everywhere you go I’ll deliver it to you. 4Your territory will be from the desert and Lebanon to the big Euphrates River, the land of the Hittites to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 5Nobody will be able to stand up to you all your life. I’ll be with you like I was with Moses; I won’t fail you or abandon you. 6Be strong and courageous. You’ll enable my people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors I’d give them. 7Make sure you do everything in the Law that Moses commanded you. 8Think about it day and night. You’ll prosper and succeed. 9Haven’t I commanded you? Don’t be afraid or intimidated. The LORD your God is with you.”		         	         Josh 1:1-9

10Joshua told the officers of the people,

11“Go through the camp and tell the people to get the baggage ready. Three days from now, you’re going to cross the Jordan to take the land the LORD your God is giving you.”

12Joshua told Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe,

13“Remember what Moses told you, the LORD your God is providing you this land as a place to rest. 14Your wives, little ones, and livestock will stay beyond the Jordan; but your fighting men will cross over armed to help your fellow Jews 15till they have their land, and the LORD gives them peace. Then you can go back east of the Jordan.”

16They answered,

“We’ll do everything you’ve said and go wherever you go. 17We’ll obey you like we did Moses. The LORD be with you like he was with him! 18We’ll execute whoever disobeys you. Be strong and courageous.”	Josh 1:10-18

Rahab and the Spies

2:1Joshua sent two men secretly from Shittim to check out the land, Jericho in particular. They went to the house of a harlot named Rahab to lodge. 2The king of Jericho heard about it, “Some men from Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.” 3He sent to Rahab, “Bring the men that have come to your house. They’re spies.” 4But the woman had hidden them, “Men did come, but I didn’t know where they came from. 5They left when the gate closed at dark. I don’t know where they went. Follow them right away so you can catch up with them.” 6But she’d taken them up to the roof and hidden them under stalks of flax. 7The men pursued them toward the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as they left, the gate was shut.	 Josh 2:1-7

8Before they lay down, she came up to the roof 9and said,

“I know the LORD is going to deliver the land to you. We’re all afraid; the people are melting away on account of you. 10We’ve heard how he dried up the Red Sea for you when you left Egypt, and how you destroyed Sihon and Og beyond the Jordan. 11As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted. Nobody had any courage left. The LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below. 12Now, swear by him that as I’ve dealt graciously with you, you’ll deal graciously with my father’s family. Give me a guarantee 13that you’ll save my parents, brothers and sisters, and their relatives.”

14They said, “Our life for yours! If you don’t tell why we’re here, you can trust us to deal graciously with you when the LORD gives us the land.”

15Her house was built against the city wall. She let them down by a rope through the window and 16told them, “Go up into the hills so you won’t run into the ones that are searching for you. Hide there three days till they get back. Then you’ll be able to go.”	Josh 2:8-16

17They said, “We won’t be guilty of the oath you had us swear. 18When we come, tie this scarlet cord in the window you let us down through. Get your parents, brothers, and father’s family into the house. 19If any of them goes out into the street, their blood’s on themselves. But if a hand is laid on anybody that’s in the house with you, that person’s blood’s on us. 20If you tell why we’re here, we won’t be obligated by the oath.”

21“All right.”

She sent them away and tied the scarlet cord in the window.

22They went into the hills for three days till the ones that were looking for them got back. They’d looked all along the road and didn’t find anything. 23Then the two men came back down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua. They told him what all had happened, 24“The LORD has for sure delivered the land to us. The inhabitants have lost heart over us.” 	Josh 2:17-24

Crossing the Jordan

3:1Joshua got up early and set out from Shittim with the people. They got to the Jordan and stayed there before they crossed. 2After three days the officers went through the camp 3and told the people,

“When you see the priests pick up the Ark of the Covenant, follow it so you’ll know where to go. You haven’t gone this way before. 4Don’t get near it. Stay back about 3,000ft.”

5Joshua told the people, “Sanctify yourselves; tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” 6He told the priests to pick up the Ark and go out ahead of the people.  	Josh 3:1-6

7The LORD told Joshua,

“Today I’ll start elevating you in Israel so they’ll know I’m with you like I was with Moses. 8Tell the priests that carry the Ark, when they come to the edge of the Jordan, to stand still in it.”

9Joshua said,

“Come and listen to a message from your God. 10This is how you’ll know the living God is among you and will drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 11The Ark will cross the Jordan first. 12Select a man from each of the 12 tribes. 13When the priests’ feet rest in the water, the Jordan will stop flowing. The water coming downstream will pile up.”

14The people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan 15When the priests waded into the water (The Jordan floods during harvest.), 16the water coming downstream piled up all the way back to Adam, a town beside Zarethan. What was flowing toward the Sea of Arabah (the Dead Sea) held back while the people crossed near Jericho. 17The priests stood on dry riverbed till the whole nation finished crossing. 	Josh 3:7-17

Memorial to the Jordan Crossing

4:1When they’d crossed, the LORD told Joshua,

2“Appoint a man from each tribe 3to take a rock from the Jordan, carry it over, and lay it down where they’ll spend the night.”

4Joshua called the twelve men,

5“Go on past the Ark to the middle of the Jordan and pick up a rock onto your shoulder. 6They’ll be a sign when your children ask what these rocks mean. 7Tell them the Jordan River held back ahead of the Ark as it crossed. These rocks serve as a permanent memorial for Israelites.”

8They picked up 12 rocks out of the Jordan, carried them over to where they would spend the night, and laid them down. 9Then Joshua set up 12 rocks in the Jordan where the priests had stood. They’re still there. 10The priests stood in the Jordan till everything happened that the LORD had Joshua tell the people. 	Josh 4:1-10a

The people crossed in a hurry. 11Then the priests and the Ark went on over. 12Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe also went over to the plains by Jericho—13about 40,000. 14That day the LORD elevated Joshua in Israel. They stood in awe of him all his life.

15The LORD said to Joshua, 16“Tell the priests that are carrying the Ark to come up out of the Jordan.” [17] 18When they’d come up, the water went back to overflowing its banks.

19The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day, first month, and camped at Gilgal east of Jericho. 20Joshua set up the 12 stones from the Jordan at Gilgal 21and told the people,

“When your descendants ask what these stones mean, 22tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry riverbed. 23The LORD our God dried up the water till we crossed it like he did at the Red Sea.’ 24Everybody in the world will know the LORD is powerful, and you’ll respect him forever.”	Josh 4:10b-24

Circumcision at Gilgal

5:1The Amorite kings west of the Jordan and the Canaanite kings by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the Jordan for the Israelites to cross. Their hearts melted; there was no spirit in them.

2At that time, the LORD told Joshua to make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites this second time. 3He did that at Gibeath-haaraloth. 4The fighting men who came out of Egypt 5had been circumcised, but the ones born in the desert hadn’t. 6The Israelites lived there 40 years till those fighting men died. The LORD swore they wouldn’t see the land flowing with milk and honey that he’d promised their ancestors. 7So Joshua circumcised the offspring the LORD raised up to replace them.

8After the circumcising, they stayed in the camp till they healed up. 9The LORD told Joshua, “I’ve ‘rolled away’ from you the disgrace of Egypt today”; so the place has been called Gilgal ever since.

10While the people camped in Gilgal, they kept Passover on the fourteenth of the month in the evening in the plains by Jericho. 11The next day, they began eating the produce in the land—parched grain and cakes without yeast in them. 12The manna stopped permanently the next day; they ate the produce in Canaan that year. 	  Josh 5:1-12

13When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man with his sword drawn. He went to him and asked, “Are you for us or our enemies?”

14“I’ve come to command the LORD’s army.”

Joshua fell on his face in homage, “What do you want me to do?”

15“Take your shoes off. Where you’re standing is holy.” Joshua obeyed.	 Josh 5:13-15

The Fall of Jericho

6:1Jericho was shut up; nobody was coming out or going in. 2The LORD told Joshua,

“I’ll deliver Jericho to you, its king and strong fighting men. 3Have Israel’s fighting men march around the city once a day for a week. 4Have seven priests each carry a ram’s horn ahead of the Ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times while the priests blow their rams’ horns. 5As soon as you hear a long blast on the rams’ horns, raise the battle cry as loud as you can, and the city wall will fall down flat. Every man, go straight in.”

6Joshua called the priests and told them to take the Ark and have seven priests each carry a ram’s horn ahead of it.

7He told the people to start marching around the city with the armed men ahead of the Ark. 	Josh 6:1-7

8The seven priests went forward blowing rams’ horns in front of the LORD with the Ark behind them. 9The armed men went first ahead of the priests, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. The rams’ horns blew continually.

10Joshua told the people, “Don’t raise the battle cry till the day I tell you.” 11He sent the Ark around the city once. Then they spent the night in camp

12Joshua got up early, and the priests took the Ark, 13and the seven priests went along, blowing the horns continually. The armed men went first ahead of them, and the rear guard came last after the Ark. 14The second day they marched around the city once and went back to camp. They did that for six days.	Josh 6:8-14

15The seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city the same way seven times. 16The seventh time, when the priests blew the rams’ horns, Joshua told the people,

“Raise the battle cry! The LORD is delivering the city to you. 17The city and everything in it will be devoted to him for destruction. Only Rahab the harlot and her household will live; she hid the messengers we sent. 18Make sure you keep away from the things devoted to destruction. If you take any devoted thing, you’ll bring trouble on Israel’s camp and get it destroyed. 19All the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items, are set aside to the LORD. They’ll go into his treasury.”

20The priests blew the rams’ horns. As soon as the people heard them, they raised the battle cry as loud as they could, and the wall down fell flat. Every man went straight ahead up into the city and took it. 21With swords they destroyed men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys. 	Josh 6:15-21

22Joshua told the two men that had spied out the land to go to the harlot’s house and bring her and her relatives out like they’d promised.

23They went in and brought out her, her parents, brothers, and relatives; and put them outside the camp. 24They burned the city and everything in it, but put in the LORD’s treasury the silver and gold, the bronze and iron items. 25Rahab and her father’s family still live in Israel because she hid the spies.

26Joshua bound an oath on them,

“Cursed by the LORD is anyone that rebuilds this city.

he’ll lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn

and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son.”

27The LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread all over the territory.	 Josh 6:22-27

Achan’s Sin

7:1But the people violated the instructions about the things set apart to the LORD. Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah from the tribe of Judah, took some devoted things, and the LORD’s anger burned against Israel.

2Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai near Beth-aven, east of Bethel to spy out the area. They spied it out, 3came back and said, “Just have 2,000 or 3,000 go up to attack Ai. There aren’t many of them.” 4About 3,000 went up but fled. 5The men from Ai killed about 36. They chased them from the gate as far as Shebarim and killed them at the descent. The people’s hearts melted and became like water. 	Josh 7:1-5

6Joshua tore his clothes. He and the elders fell on their faces by the Ark of the LORD till evening and put dust on their heads. 7Joshua said,

“Lord GOD, why bring us across the Jordan and turn us over to the Amorites? If only we’d been content to live beyond the Jordan! 8What can I say when Israel has turned its back on its enemies? 9The Canaanites and the people in the land will hear about it and surround us. They’ll remove our name from the earth, and what will you do for your great name?”

10The LORD told Joshua,

“Why fall on your face? Get up. 11Israel has broken my covenant and taken some devoted things. They’ve stolen and lied about it and put them among their own things. 12So Israel can’t stand up to its enemies. They turn their backs on them because now they’re something to be destroyed. 13Get up. Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. You can’t stand up to your enemies till you get rid of the devoted things. 14In the morning, come forward by tribes. The tribe the LORD takes will come forward by families. The family he takes will come by households. The household he takes will come one at a time. 15The one that took the devoted things and everything he has will be burned. He’s sinned against the LORD’s covenant by doing something horrible.”	 Josh 7:6-15

16Joshua got up early and brought Israel forward tribe by tribe; the LORD took Judah. 17He brought the clans of Judah forward; the LORD took the family of Zerah. He brought the family Zerah forward one household at a time; the LORD took the household of Zabdi. 18He brought Zabdi’s household forward one man at a time; the LORD took Achan son of (Carmi son of Zabdi son of) Zerah. 19Joshua told Achan, “Son, honor the LORD God of Israel and praise him. What have you done?”

20Achan answered,

“Truthfully, I did sin against the LORD God of Israel. 21I saw among the spoils a beautiful mantle from Shinar, 5 lbs 200 shekels of silver, and a gold bar weighing 20 oz 50 shekels. I wanted them and took them and hid them in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath.”

22Joshua sent messengers to the tent. The devoted things were there with the silver under them. 23They brought them out to Joshua and put them down in front of the LORD. 24Joshua and all Israel took Achan, the silver, the mantle, the gold bar, his children, cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent and everything he had, and went up to the Valley of Achor. 25Joshua said, “Why bring trouble on us? The LORD is bringing trouble on you now.” Israel stoned them and burned them, 26and piled a big mound of rocks over him that’s still there. Then the LORD turned away his burning anger.	Josh 7:16-26

Israel Destroys Ai

8:1The LORD told Joshua,

“Don’t be afraid or intimidated. Take the fighting men up to Ai. I’ll deliver the king, his people, his city, and his land to you. 2Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king. Just take its spoil and livestock for yourselves. Ambush the city from behind.”

3Joshua and the fighting men got up to go to Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 trained men and sent them out at night. 4He told them,

“Lie in ambush behind the city. Stay fairly close to it and be ready. 5The people and I will approach the city. When they come out against us, we’ll flee. 6They’ll chase us till we’ve drawn them away from the city; they’ll think we’re running from them like the last time. 7Then rise up from the ambush and seize the city; the LORD your God will give it to you. 8When you’ve taken it, set it on fire like he said.”

9Joshua sent them out to the place for the ambush between Bethel and Ai, west of Ai. He spent that night with the people.	 Josh 8:1-9

10He got up early, mustered the people, and went up with the elders to Ai. 11The fighting men that were with him came close to the city and camped north of it with a ravine between them and Ai. 12He set about 5,000 men in ambush between Bethel and Ai, west of the city. 13So they stationed the main camp north of the city and its rear guard west of it. Joshua spent that night in the valley. 14When the king of Ai saw it, the men in the city hurried out early to the descent toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he didn’t know about the ambush behind the city. 15Joshua and the Israelites pretended to be beaten and retreated toward open country. 16The people in the city were called together to chase them and drew away from it. 17Every man in Ai and Bethel went out after Israel and left the city wide open. 	Josh 8:10-17

18The LORD told Joshua, “Hold out your javelin.” He held it out toward the city, 19and the ambush got up at once, went in, and took it. They hurried and set it on fire. 20When the men from Ai looked back, they saw the smoke going up from the city. They couldn’t escape because the ones that ran toward open country turned back on them. 21When Joshua and the Israelites saw that the ambush had taken the city and its smoke was going up, they turned around and attacked. 22The others came out of the city, and the Israelites trapped them between their two companies. They killed till no one survived or escaped. 23They captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.

24When Israel had finished killing the people of Ai in the open country, they went back and struck the city with the sword. 25All its people fell that day: 12,000 men and women. 26Joshua didn’t draw back his javelin till he’d destroyed everybody. 27Israel just took the livestock and spoils—like the LORD said. 28Joshua burned the city and made it a pile of ruins till now. 29He hanged the king on a tree till sundown. Then he had them take his body down and throw it at the entrance to the city gate. They piled stones over it, which are still there.

Josh 8:18-29

30Joshua built an altar to the LORD on Mount Ebal 31the way Moses commanded in the Law—with uncut stones nobody has used an iron tool on. They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 32There in the presence of the people, he wrote on the stones a copy of Moses’ Law. 33All Israel, foreigner and home born, elders, officers, and judges stood on opposite sides of the Ark in front of the Levitical priests who carried it. Half were in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal—like Moses had commanded them to bless Israel. 34Afterward he read the whole Law, the blessing, and the curse. 35He read it to Israel, the women, children, and foreigners among them. 	Josh 8:30-35

9:1The kings heard about it in the hill country and the western foothills along the Mediterranean Sea up to Lebanon—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 2They formed an alliance against Israel.

The Gibeonites Deceive Israel

3But when the people in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 4they resorted to trickery. They made fake preparations: worn-out sacks on their donkeys; worn-out, torn, and mended wineskins; 5worn-out and patched sandals, and worn-out clothes. Their provisions were dry and moldy. 6They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and told him and Israel, “We’ve come from a distant country. Make a treaty with us.” 	Josh 9:1-6

7But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Maybe you’re living among us. How could we make a treaty with you?”

8They said to Joshua, “We’re your servants.”

“Who are you? Where did you come from?”

9“We’ve come a long way because of the LORD your God. We’ve heard what all he did in Egypt, 10and to the Amorite kings beyond the Jordan—Sihon and Og, who lived in Ashtaroth. 11Our elders and the people in our country told us to take provisions for the journey, go meet you, and say, ‘We’re your servants. Make a treaty with us.’ 12Our bread was still warm when we took it from our houses for the trip. Now it’s dry and moldy. 13These wineskins were new when we filled them; now they’ve burst. These clothes and shoes are worn out from the trip.”

14The men took some of their provisions and didn’t ask for direction from the LORD. 15Joshua made peace with them and let them live. The leaders of the community swore to them. 	Josh 9:7-15

16Three days later, they found out they were neighbors. 17Israel set out and reached their towns on the third day: Gibeon, Cherphirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 18But they didn’t kill them, because their leaders had sworn by the LORD God of Israel. The community murmured against the leaders, 19“We’ve sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. We can’t touch them. 20We’ll let them live so wrath won’t come on us.” 21They cut wood and drew water for the community—like the leaders told them.

22Joshua sent for them and said,

“Why lie to us and say you were from a distant country when you were living among us? 23Now you’re cursed. Some of you will always be slaves, cutting wood and drawing water for my God’s house.”

24They answered Joshua,

“We heard that the LORD your God had commanded Moses to give you the land and destroy its people. We were afraid we’d be killed. 25We’re at your mercy. Do to us what you think’s right.”

26That’s what he did and rescued them from the people. 27He made them cut wood and draw water for the community and the LORD’s altar where he chose. They still do that.       Josh 9:16-27

The Sun Stands Still

10:1Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had taken Ai and destroyed it like Jericho and its king. He heard how Gibeon had made peace with Israel and was among them. 2He was really afraid because Gibeon was a big city, like a royal city. It was bigger than Ai and its men were strong. 3So he sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, 4“Help me attack Gibeon; it has made peace with Israel.” 5Those five allied forces camped against Gibeon and attacked it.

6The men in Gibeon sent to Joshua at camp in Gilgal, “Don’t relax your grip on us. Come quick and save us! The Amorite kings from the hill country have formed an alliance against us.”

7So Joshua and the fighting men went up from Gilgal. 8The LORD told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of them. I’ll deliver them to you. Not a man will stand against you.”

9He marched up all night and attacked them by surprise. 10The LORD threw them into panic, and Israel killed them with a great slaughter. They chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 11As they fled down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD sent big hailstones on them all the way to Azekah. More died from hailstones than Israel killed with the sword. 	Josh 10:1-11

12Then in front of Israel, Joshua spoke to the LORD the day he gave the Amorites to Israel,

“Have the sun stand still at Gibeon

and the moon over the Valley of Aijalon.”

13So the sun stood still, and the moon stayed till the nation took revenge on its enemies. It’s recorded in The Book of Jashar. The sun stood still at midday and didn’t go down for about a day. 14There wasn’t a day like it before or since when the LORD listened to such an extreme request by someone, because he fought for Israel.

15Joshua and Israel came back to camp at Gilgal.

Five Amorite Kings Executed

16The five kings fled and hid in the cave at Makkedah. 17People told Joshua where they were hiding.

18He said,

“Roll large rocks against the mouth of the cave and post a guard. 19Don’t stay there. Chase your enemies and fall on them. Don’t let them get into their towns. The LORD your God will deliver them to you.”

20Joshua and the Israelites killed them with a great slaughter till they wiped them out, but some stragglers got back into the fortified towns. 21The people came back safe to Joshua at Makkedah. Nobody said a word against Israel.	Josh 10:12-21

22Then Joshua told them to open the cave and bring out the five kings. [23]

24He told the commanders and fighting men, “Put your feet on their necks. 25Don’t be afraid or intimidated; be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you fight.”

26He struck them and put them to death and hung them on five trees. 27At sundown he had the men take them down, throw them back into the cave, and put large rocks against its mouth. They’re still there.

28That day Joshua struck down everybody in Makkedah with the sword and did to its king what he’d done to Jericho’s king. 	Josh 10:22-28

Southern Towns Conquered

29He and Israel passed on from Makkedah and attacked Libnah. 30The LORD gave it and its king to Israel. He struck everybody in it with the sword.

31Next, Joshua lay siege to Lachish, 32and the LORD gave it to Israel. He took it on the second day and struck everybody in it with the sword.

33Then Horam, king of Gezer, came to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people till there weren’t any left.

34He passed on from Lachish, laid siege to Eglon, and attacked it. 35They took it that day, struck it with the sword, and destroyed everyone in it.

36Joshua went up from Eglon to attack Hebron. 37He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them.

38Then he turned back and attacked Debir. 39He struck it, its king, and surrounding villages with the sword and destroyed everybody in them. So he did to Debir what he’d done to Hebron, Libnah, and their kings.

40Joshua defeated the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, the slopes, and their kings. He destroyed everybody that breathed—like the LORD commanded. 41He defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, the whole country of Goshen as far as Gibeon. 42He took those kings and their land in one campaign because the LORD God of Israel fought for them. 43Then he and Israel went back to camp at Gilgal.	Josh 10:29-43

Northern Kings Defeated

11:1When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard about it, he sent

to Jobab, king of Madon,

to the king of Shimron

to the king of Achshaph,

2to the kings in the northern hill country,

the Arabah south of Chinneroth,

the western foothills,

Naphothdor on the west,

3to the Canaanites in the east and west,

the Amorites,

Hittites,

Perizzites,

Jebusites in the hill country, and

Hivites on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

4They came out with their troops, a large army like sand on the shore, with very many horses and chariots. 5All those kings joined forces, and came and camped together at the water by Merom.

6The LORD told Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of them. At this time tomorrow, I’ll deliver them to Israel. Hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.” 7He came suddenly on them with all his fighting men. 8The LORD gave them to Israel, who struck them and chased them to Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward to the Valley of Mizpah. There weren’t any left. 9Joshua hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. 	Josh 11:1-9

10Joshua turned back and took Hazor and struck its king with the sword. Hazor was formerly the head of those kingdoms. 11The Israelites put to the sword everything in it that breathed, and Joshua burned Hazor. 12He took the kings and their towns and destroyed them—like Moses the LORD’s servant commanded. 13Israel didn’t burn towns that stood on mounds, but Joshua did burn Hazor. 14The people took the spoil in those towns and the livestock for plunder. They struck every man with the sword till they’d destroyed them. 15What the LORD told Moses, Moses told Joshua, and he did it.

16Joshua conquered the hill country, the Negev, Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland 17from Mount Halak that rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He put their kings to death. 18Joshua fought those kings for a long time. 19No city made peace with Israel except the Hivites in Gibeon. 20The LORD hardened their hearts to come out against Israel so they’d be destroyed without mercy.

21At that time, Joshua completely wiped out the Anakim and their towns in the hill county—Hebron, Debir, Anab, and the towns in the territory of Judah and Israel. 22The only Anakim left were a few in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 23He took the whole land the way the LORD had told Moses. He gave it to Israel by tribal allotments. The land rested from war.    Josh 11:10-23

List of Defeated Kings

12:1These are the kings the Israelites defeated and whose land they took east of the Jordan—from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon with all the eastern Arabah:

2Sihon, king of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, on the edge of the valley of Arnon—from the middle of the valley to the river Jabbok, which is the boundary with the Ammonites, that is, half of Gilead 3and the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth east, and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth to the Sea of Arabah (the Dead Sea), south to the foot of Pisgah.

4Og, king of Bashan, one of the remaining Rephaim that lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei 5and ruled Mount Hermon, Salecah, all Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the boundary of Sihon, king of Heshbon.

6Moses and Israel gave their land to Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe.	      Josh 12:1-6

7These are the kings Joshua and Israel defeated west of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir: (Joshua gave their land to the tribes by allotments, 8in the hill country, the lowland, the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the open country, the Negev, the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.)

9one king each in Jericho; Ai, next to Bethel; 10Jerusalem, Hebron, 11Jarmuth, Lachish, 12Eglon, Gezer, 13Debir, Geder, 14Hormah, Arad, 15Libnah, Adullam, 16Makkedah, Bethel, 17Tappuah, Hepher, 18Aphek, Lasharon, 19Madon, Hazor, 20Shimron-meron, Achshaph, 21Taanach, Megiddo, 22Kedesh, Jokneam in Carmel, 23Dor in Naphath-dor, Goiim in Galilee, 24and Tirzah (31 kings).

Josh 12:7-24

Land Yet to Be Conquered

13:1When Joshua was getting along I years, the LORD told him,

“You’re getting old, and there’s still a lot of land to take:

2the territory of the Philistines,

Geshurites (3From the Shihor east of Egypt, north to the boundary of Ekron, is

considered Canaanite. The Philistines have five rulers: in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.) and

the Avvim, 4in the south;

the land of the Canaanites, and

Mearah, which belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the

Amorites,

5the Gebalites, and

all of Lebanon, toward the east,

from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath,

6-7the people in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, that is,

the Sidonians.

I’ll drive them out in front of Israel.  Allot the land to the nine tribes and the Manasseh half-tribe.” 	Josh 13:1-7

Land East of the Jordan Divided

8The other Manasseh half-tribe together with Reuben and Gad had received their inheritance from Moses east of the Jordan: 9from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon valley, the city in the middle of the valley, the whole tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon; 10the towns of Sihon, king of the Amorites; 11Gilead, the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites; all of Mount Hermon, the whole of Bashan to Salecah; 12the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the only Rephaim left.) Moses had defeated them and driven them out. 13Yet the people of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites or Maacathites. They still live among the Israelites.

14Moses didn’t give an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. Their inheritance was the offerings by fire to the LORD. 	Josh 13:8-14

15Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben by clans. 16Their territory went from Aroer—on the edge of the Arnon valley, and the city that’s in the middle of the valley—the whole tableland of Medeba; 17Heshbon and the other towns on the tableland: Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baalmeon, 18Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 19Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 20Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth. 21Reuben’s territory included the whole kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated together with the leaders of Midian—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, allies of Sihon. 22The people of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam son of Beor, the fortuneteller. 23The Jordan was the boundary of Reuben. That was Reuben’s inheritance by clans, towns, and villages. 	Josh 13:15-23

24Moses gave an inheritance to Gad by clans. 25Their territory was Jazer, the towns in Gilead, half the land of the Ammonites to Aroer, east of Rabbah; 26from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpah and Betonim, from Mahanaim to the territory around Debir; 27the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The Jordan was its boundary to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward from the Jordan. 28That was Gad’s inheritance by clans, towns, and villages.	  Josh 13:24-28

29Moses gave an inheritance to the Manasseh half-tribe by clans. 30Their territory extended from Mahanaim through Bashan—the whole kingdom of Og, king of Bashan—all the towns of Jair in Bashan (60 towns), 31half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, towns in Og’s kingdom in Bashan. Those were allotted to the people of Machir son of Manasseh for half of the Machirites by clans.

32Those inheritances Moses had distributed by God’s command in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho. 33He didn’t give an inheritance to Levi; the LORD is their inheritance.	Josh 13:29-33

Land West of the Jordan Divided

14:1These are the territories the Israelites inherited in Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of families distributed. 2Their inheritance came by lot for the 9½ tribes. [3] 4Joseph’s people consisted of two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. Moses just gave the Levites towns to live in along with land for pasturing livestock and raising crops for them. 5The Israelites allotted the land like the LORD commanded. 	Josh 14:1-5

6Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb, son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, told him,

“You know what the LORD told Moses in Kadesh-barnea about you and me. 7I was 40 when Moses sent me to spy out the land. I brought back word to him as it was in my heart. 8But my brothers that went up with me made the people’s heart melt. Yet I wholly followed the LORD. 9Moses swore that day, ‘The land you’ve walked on will belong to you and your descendants permanently. You’ve followed the LORD my God.’ 10He has kept me alive these 45 years since he said that to Moses in the desert. Today I’m 85. 11I’m still as strong as I was when Moses sent me—strong for war and everyday life. 12Give me this hill country the LORD spoke about that day. At that time, you heard that Anakim were there with big, fortified towns. the LORD maybe with me, and I can drive them out.”

13Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron. 14It’s still his inheritance because he wholly followed the LORD. (15Hebron’s earlier name had been Kiriath-arba because Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) The land rested from war.	 Josh 14:6-15

Allotment to Judah

15:1Judah’s allotment by clans reached the border of Edom, went south to the Wilderness of Zin at the farthest. 2Their south border went from the lower end of the Dead Sea, from the bay that turns south. 3It went on south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up south of Kadesh-barnea, continued to Hezron, up to Addar, and turned to Karka. 4It went on to Azmon and the River of Egypt and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. That was their south border.

5The east border was the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan. 	Josh 15:1-5a

The north border went from the mouth of the Jordan, 6 up to Beth-hoglah, continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and up to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 7The border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turned north toward Gilgal, which is across from the ascent of Adummim, on the south of the valley. It continued to En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 8Then the border went up the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (Jerusalem). It went on up to the top of the mountain that lies across from the Valley of Hinnom to the west, at the northern end of the Valley Rephaim. 9From the top of the mountain, the border curved to the spring of Nephtoah, went on to the towns of Mount Ephron, and curved to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim). 10It turned west from Baalah to Mount Seir, continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (Chesalon), went down to Beth-shemesh, and continued through Timnah. 11The border proceeded to the north side of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron and to Mount Baalah and Jabneel, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.

12The west border was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. 	Josh 15:5b-12

13By the LORD’s command, Joshua gave Caleb a territory among the descendants of Judah: Kiriath-arba (Hebron). 14Caleb drove out Anak’s three sons: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 15He went up from there against Debir (formerly Kiriath-sepher). 16Caleb said, “Whoever takes Kiriath-sepher, I’ll give Achsah my daughter as a wife.” 17Othniel, son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz, took it; so Caleb gave her to him as a wife. 18When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked her what she wanted.

19“Give me another endowment. Since you’ve put me in the Negev, give me springs too.” He gave her the upper and lower springs.	 Josh 15:13-19

61In the open country, Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,

62Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi—6 towns with their villages.

63But Judah couldn’t drive the Jebusites out of Jerusalem. They still live there

with the people of Judah.	    Josh 15:61-63

Allotment to Ephraim and Manasseh

16:1The allotment for Joseph’s descendants goes from the Jordan by Jericho to the open country to the hill country of Bethel. 2Then it goes from Bethel to Luz and passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites. 3Then it runs west to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the area around Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. 4Joseph’s people—Manasseh and Ephraim—received their inheritance.

5This is the territory of Ephraim by clans. The boundary on the east is Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon 6and from there to the Mediterranean Sea. Michmethath is on the north. The boundary turns east toward Taanath-shiloh and continues east to Janoah. 7Then it goes down to Ataroth and Naarah, touches Jericho, and ends at the Jordan. 8From Tappuah the boundary goes west to Brook Kanah and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. That’s the inheritance for the Ephraimites by clans, 9together with their towns and villages that were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites. 10But they didn’t drive out the Canaanites in Gezer. They still live among the Ephraimites, doing forced labor.	 Josh 16:1-10

17:1Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn, received an allotment. Gilead and Bashan went to Machir, Manasseh’s firstborn and father of Gilead, because he was a soldier. 2Allotment came to the rest of Manasseh’s male descendants by clans: the sons of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. 3However, Zelophehad son of Hepher (son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh) only had daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the elders, “The LORD told Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So he gave them an inheritance among their uncles. 5Ten sections fell to Manasseh besides Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan, 6because Manasseh’s daughters received an inheritance with his sons. Gilead belonged to the rest of Manasseh’s sons.	Josh 17:1-6

7Manasseh’s territory reached from Asher to Michmethath, east of Shechem. Then the boundary went south to En-tappuah. 8The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to Ephraim. 9Then the boundary went down to Brook Kanah. The towns there, south of the stream, among the towns in Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim. Then Manasseh’s boundary went on the north side of the stream and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 11Also in Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean/Beth-shan, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements. (The third was Naphath.) 12Yet Manasseh’s descendants couldn’t conquer those towns, so the Canaanites kept living there. 13When Israel grew stronger, they put them to forced labor, but didn’t completely drive them out.	 Josh 17:7-13

14The tribe of Joseph asked Joshua, “Why have you given us only one territory though we’re numerous because the LORD has blessed us?”

15“If the hill country of Ephraim is not big enough, go up into the wooded land and clear ground in the territory of the Perizzites and Rephaim.”

16“The hill country’s still not big enough. The Canaanites that still live in the lowlands have iron chariots, those in Beth-shean/Beth-shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”

17Then Joshua told the House of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh,

“You’re numerous and strong. You won’t just have one lot 18but the hill country too. Though it’s wooded land, clear it and take possession of it to its full extent. You’ll drive out the Canaanites too though they’re strong and have iron chariots.” 	Josh 17:14-18

Allotment of Remaining Land

18:1The whole community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting. The land had been conquered, 2but seven tribes hadn’t yet received their inheritance. 3Joshua said,

“How long will you put off taking possession of what the LORD has given you? 4Select three men from each tribe that I can send through the land to write a description of their inheritance. 5-6Divide it into seven territories and describe them. Judah will stay in its territory on the south. Joseph will stay in its territory on the north. I’ll cast lots for you here in front of the LORD. 7The Levites don’t have any territory; the priesthood is their inheritance. Moses has given Gad, Reuben, and the Manasseh half-tribe their inheritance east of the Jordan.”

8Joshua told the men, “Go through the land, describe it, and come back. I’ll cast lots for you here in front of the LORD in Shiloh.” 9They went through the land and described it by cites in seven divisions in a scroll. They came back to him at Shiloh. 10He cast lots for them and divided the land according to their divisions.	Josh 18:1-10

Allotment to Benjamin

11The lot for Benjamin came out by clans. Their territory lay between Judah and Joseph. 12The north border ran from the Jordan up past Jericho through the hill country west, ending at the Wilderness of Beth-aven.

13From there it went south toward Luz (Bethel), and down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. 14The border extended around on the west side southward from the hill facing Beth-horon and ended at Kiriath-baal (Kiriath-jearim), a city of Judah. That was the west border.

15The south side began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim and ran to Ephron to the Spring of Nephtoah. 16Then it went down south to the edge of the mountain that’s in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. From there it extended down to the Valley of Hinnom, south to the slope of the Jebusites down to En-rogel. 17It curved around north to En-shemesh and then to Geliloth, across from the ascent of Adummim. Then it went down to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 18It passed on to the north of Beth-arabah and went down to the Arabah. 19It passed north of Beth-hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, the south end of the Jordan. That was the south border.

20The Jordan was its east border.						    Josh 18:11-20

21The towns in Benjamin by clans were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 22Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 23Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 24Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba—12 towns with their villages;

25Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 26Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah, 27Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 28Zelah, Haeleph, Jebus (Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim—14 towns with their villages.

That was Benjamin’s inheritance by clans.				    	    	    Josh 18:21-28

Allotment to Simeon

19:1The second lot came out for Simeon by clans. Its inheritance was inside Judah. 2It had

Beer-sheba, Sheba, Moladah, 3Hazarshual, Balah, Ezem, 4Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 5Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 6Beth-lebaoth, Sharuhen—13 towns with their villages.

7Ain, Rimmon, Ether, Ashan—4 towns with their villages,

8and the villages around those towns as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah in the Negev. That was Simeon’s inheritance by clans. 9They took his territory out of Judah’s because Judah’s share was too big.	 Josh 19:1-9

Allotment to Zebulun

10The third lot came out for Zebulun by clans. The territory went as far as Sarid. 11Then their border passed up to the west to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and reached the stream east of Jokneam. 12It turned from Sarid east as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia. 13It continued east to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and on to Rimmon that stretches to Neah. 14The border on the north turned to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtahel. 15It included Kattah, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, Bethlehem—12 towns with their villages. 16That was Zebulun’s inheritance by clans.

Allotment to Issachar

17The fourth lot fell to Issachar by clans. 18Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 19Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 20Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 21Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, Beth-pazzez. 22The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan—16 towns with their villages. 23That was Issachar’s inheritance by clans.	 Josh 19:10-23

24The fifth lot fell to Asher by clans. 25Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 26Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west it reached Carmel and Shihor-libnath. 27It turned east to Beth-dagon and reached Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel north to Beth-emek and Neiel. Then it proceeded north to Cabul, 28Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, as far as Great Sihon. 29The border turned to Ramah and the fortified city of Tyre, then turned to Hosah, and ended at the sea; Mehebel, Achzib, 30 Ummah, Aphek, Rehob—22 towns with their villages. 31That was Asher’s inheritance by clans. 	Josh 19:24-31

Allotment to Naphtali

32The sixth lot fell to Naphtali by clans. 33Their border was from Heleph, from the oak tree in Zaanannim, Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan. 34The border turned west to Aznoth-tabor, proceeded to Hukkok, and reached Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan on the east. 35The fortified towns were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 36Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 37Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 38Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh—19 towns with their villages. 39That was Naphtali’s inheritance by clans.					   	    	    Josh 19:32-39

Allotment to Dan

40The seventh lot fell to Dan by clans. 41Their territory included Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh, 42Sha-alabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 43Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 44Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 45Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 46Me-jarkon, Rakkon, with the territory against Joppa. 47When Dan’s territory was lost to them, they went up and fought Leshem and captured it. They struck it with the sword, possessed it, and settled in it. They called it Dan after their ancestor. 48That was Dan’s inheritance by clans.				    	    	    Josh 19:40-48

Allotment to Joshua

49When they finished dividing up the land, the Israelites gave Joshua an inheritance. 50In accordance with the LORD’s command, they gave him the city he asked for, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and settled in it.

51Those are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the heads of households distributed by lot in Shiloh in front of the LORD, at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing up the land.								    Josh 19:49-51

Cities of Refuge

20:1Then the LORD said to Joshua,

2“Have the people establish the cities of refuge I spoke to you about through Moses, 3so anyone that kills somebody accidentally can flee there from an avenger. 4Standing at the entrance to the city gate, the slayer will explain his case to the elders, and they’ll provide a place to stay in the city. 5They won’t betray the slayer to any avenger because the death was an accident, no previous animosity involved. 6The slayer will stay in that city for judgment till the death of the current high priest, and then go back home.”

7They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 8East of Jericho and the Jordan, they designated Bezer on the tableland in Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in Gad, and Golan in Bashan in Manasseh. 9They designated those towns for Israelites and foreigners among them to flee to, so the avenger of blood couldn’t take revenge before the slayer could stand in public trial.       	Josh 20:1-9

Towns for the Levites

21:1The heads of families among the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the heads of families in Israel. 2They said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us towns to live in along with pastures for our livestock.” 3Israel gave the Levites those towns and their pastures out of their inheritance.

4The lot came out for the clans of Kohathites; the descendants of Aaron received 13 towns from Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.

5The rest of the Kohathites received by lot 10 towns from Ephraim, Dan, and the Manasseh half-tribe.

6The Gershonites received by lot 13 towns from Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali, and the Manasseh half-tribe in Bashan.

7The Merarites by clans received 12 towns from Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. [8]

Josh 21:1-8

9From Judah and Simeon they gave the following towns. 10They went to Aaron’s descendants, one clan of Kohathites among the Levites, since the lot fell to them first. 11They gave them Kiriath-arba (Hebron; Arba was father of Anak.) in the hill country of Judah, along with its pastureland. 12But the city’s fields and villages had been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh. 13They gave them Hebron, a city of refuge; Libnah, 14Jattir, Eshtemoa, 15Holon, Debir, 16Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh—9 towns with their pastures. 17From Benjamin they gave Gibeon, Geba, 18Anathoth, and Almon—4 towns with their pastures. 19Aaron’s descendants had 13 towns in all.

20To the rest of the Kohathites the towns were allotted from Ephraim: 21Shechem, a city of refuge in the hill country of Ephraim; Gezer, 22Kibzaim, and Beth-horon—4 towns with their pastures. 23From Dan they gave Elteke, Gibbethon, 24Aijalon, Gath-rimmon—4 towns with their pastures. 25From the Manasseh half-tribe they gave Taanach and Gath-rimmon—2 towns with their pastures. 26The rest of the Kohathites had 10 towns with their pastures.	 Josh 21:9-26

27To the Gershonites—one clan of the Levites—from the Manasseh half-tribe they gave Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge; and Be-eshterah—2 towns with their pastures. 28From Issachar they gave Kishion, Daberath, 29Jarmuth, En-gannim—4 towns with their pastures. 30From Asher they gave Mishal, Abdon, 31Helkath, and Rehob—4 towns with their pastures. 32From Naphtali they gave Kedesh in Galilee, a city of refuge, Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—3 towns with their pastures. 33The Gershonites had 13 towns with their pastures.   	Josh 21:27-33

34To the rest of the Levites—the Merarite clan—from Zebulun they gave Jokneam, Kartah, 35Dimnah, and Nahalal—4 towns with their pastures. 36From Reuben they gave Bezer, Jahaz, 37Kedemoth, and Mephaath—4 towns with their pastures. 38From Gad they gave Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge; Mahanaim, 39Heshbon, and Jazer—4 towns with their pastures. 40The Merarite clan had 12 towns.

41-42Throughout Israel the Levites had 48 towns with their pastures around them.

43The LORD gave Israel all the land he swore to their ancestors. They took it and settled there. 44He gave them peace from every direction. Not one of their enemies could stand against them. 45None of his good promises failed.     				     	    	     Josh 21:34-45

Eastern Tribes Return Home

22:1Then Joshua called Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe,

2“You’ve done everything Moses and I have commanded you. 3You haven’t abandoned your fellow Jews. You’ve kept the LORD’s charge, 4and he’s given them peace. Go to your possession beyond the Jordan. 5Observe the Law Moses commanded you: love the LORD your God, follow his ways, hold onto him, and serve him with all your heart and soul.”

6Joshua blessed them and sent them home.

7To the one Manasseh half-tribe, Moses had given a possession in Bashan. To the other half, Joshua had given a possession beside them west of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them home, 8he said, “Go with your considerable wealth in livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and clothing. Divide the spoil from your enemies with your relatives.” 9Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe separated from Israel at Shiloh in Canaan and went to Gilead.	 Josh 22:1-9

10When they came to the region around the Jordan (which lies in Canaan), Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe built a large altar by the Jordan. 11People in Israel heard that Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe had built an altar at the frontier with Canaan near the Jordan on Israel’s side. 12When they heard about it, they gathered at Shiloh to fight them.

13Israel sent them Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest 14and one family head from each tribe. 15They said,

16“The whole community says, ‘What’s this treachery you’ve committed against the LORD God of Israel by building yourselves an altar in rebellion against him? 17Didn’t we have enough sin at Peor that we haven’t yet cleansed ourselves from? Because of it a plague came on the community. 18If you rebel against him today, he’ll be angry with the whole community tomorrow. 19If your land is ceremonially unclean, pass over to where his Tabernacle stands. Take a possession among us. Just don’t rebel against the LORD or make us rebels by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD. 20Didn’t Achan son of Zerah break faith with the devoted things, and wrath fell on the whole community? He didn’t perish alone in his sin.’	 Josh 22:10-20

21Then Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe answered,

22“The Mighty One, God the LORD! The Mighty One, God the LORD! He knows, and let Israel know! If it’s rebellion or unfaithfulness toward him, don’t spare us. 23If we did it to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or peace offerings, may he take revenge. 24No! We did so that later on your descendants couldn’t say to ours, ‘What do you have to do with the LORD God of Israel? 25He has made the Jordan a boundary between us. You don’t have any territory in him.’ Your descendants might make ours stop worshiping the LORD. 26So we said we’d build an altar now, not for sacrifice, 27but to testify that we and our descendants do serve the LORD with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. We did it for fear that your descendants might tell ours they didn’t have any territory in the LORD. 28Then we could say, ‘Look at the copy of his altar our ancestors built for a witness between us.’ 29We’re certainly not rebelling against him by building an altar to replace the one in front of his Tabernacle!”  	Josh 22:21-29

30Phinehas and the heads of the community liked what they heard. 31He told them, “Now we know the LORD is among us. You haven’t committed treachery. You’ve saved Israel from the LORD.” 32They left and took word back to Israel in Canaan. 33The report pleased them, and they blessed God and didn’t say anything more about fighting. 34Reuben and Gad called the altar Ed, a ‘witness’ that the LORD is God.	Josh 22:30-34

Joshua’s Farewell

23:1A good while later, when Joshua was old, 2he called in Israel’s elders, heads, judges, and officers, and told them,

“I’m getting old. 3You’ve seen everything the LORD your God has done to those nations for you. He fought for you. 4I’ve allotted to your tribes those nations that remain, along with the nations I’ve already removed, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 5The LORD will push them back. 6Keep doing everything in the Law of Moses. 7Don’t mix with the nations left among you. Don’t mention their gods, swear by them, serve them, bow down to them. 8Hold onto the LORD like you’ve done so far. 9He has driven out big, strong nations. Nobody has been able to resist you. 10One of you puts a thousand to flight, because he fights for you like he promised. 11Give attention to loving him. 12If you join the remnants of nations left among you and intermarry with them, 13you can be sure he won’t keep driving them out. They’ll be a snare, a trap, a scourge in your sides, thorns in your eyes, till you perish from this good land he’s given you.

14“I’m going to die soon. You know in your hearts and souls that not one good thing has failed to happen that the LORD promised. 15Just as he has done all the good things he promised, he’ll bring about all the bad things till he’s destroyed you. 16If you sin against his covenant, serve other gods, and bow to them, his anger will flare at you, and you’ll soon perish.”	Josh 23:1-16

Covenant Renewed at Shechem

24:1Then Joshua gathered the tribes to Shechem with their elders, heads, judges, and officers. They presented themselves to God. 2Joshua said,

“The LORD God of Israel, says, ‘Your ancestors lived beyond the Euphrates River. Nahor and Terah, Abraham’s father, served other gods. 3I led Abraham from there all over Canaan and multiplied his offspring. I gave him Isaac, 4and gave Isaac Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir, but Jacob and his descendants went down to Egypt. 5I sent Moses and Aaron, and plagued Egypt in its own land. 6Afterwards I brought you out of there. You came to the Red Sea, and the Egyptians chased you with chariots and cavalry to the sea. 7When you cried out to me, I put darkness between you and them, and made the sea cover them. You saw that and lived a long time in the desert. 8Then I brought you to Amorite country east of the Jordan. They fought you, and I destroyed them in front of you. You took their land. 9Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose up to oppose you. He sent for Balaam son of Beor and invited him to curse you. 10But I wouldn’t listen to Balaam. So he blessed you, and I delivered you from him. 11You crossed the Jordan to Jericho, and the people in Jericho fought you as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites. I gave them to you. 12I sent hornets to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your sword and bow didn’t do it. 13I gave you a land you hadn’t worked and towns you didn’t build, and you lived in them. You’re eating the fruit from vineyards and olive orchards you didn’t plant.’ 	Josh 24:1-13

14“Now then, respect the LORD, serve him sincerely and faithfully. Put away the gods your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt. 15If you won’t serve him, choose today who you will serve: the gods of your ancestors beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites where you’re living. My house and I will serve the LORD.”

16The people answered,

“We’ll never leave the LORD and serve other gods. 17He’s the one that brought us and our ancestors out of slavery in Egypt. He did those great signs for us and preserved us all the way among the nations we passed through. 18He drove the Amorites out of the land, so we’ll serve the LORD. He’s our God.”

19But Joshua told the people,

“You can’t serve the LORD, a holy, exclusive God that won’t forgive your sins. 20If you serve foreign gods, he’ll consume you after doing you good.”

21“No! We’ll serve the LORD.”

22“You’re witnesses to yourselves that you’ve chosen to serve the LORD.”

“We’re witnesses.”

23“Then put away your foreign gods. Incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.”

24“We’ll serve the LORD our God and obey him.” 	Josh 24:14-24

25Joshua made a covenant with them that day at Shechem, with a statute and an ordinance 26that he wrote in the Law of God. He set up a large stone there under the oak in the LORD’s sanctuary. 27He told the people,

“This stone will testify against us. It has heard everything the LORD told us. It’ll testify against you so you won’t deal falsely with him.”

28Joshua sent everybody home to their inheritance.

Leaders Buried in the Promised Land

29After that, Joshua died at 110. 30They buried him in his inheritance at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 31Israel served the LORD all his life and the lives of the elders that outlived him and knew what the LORD had done for Israel.

32The Israelites had brought up Joseph’s bones from Egypt and buried them at Shechem in the piece of ground Jacob bought from the descendants of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of money. It became an inheritance for Joseph’s descendants.

33Eleazar, Aaron’s son, died, and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of Phinehas his

son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.	Josh 24:25-33

JUDGES

Partial Conquest of Remaining Territory

1:1After Joshua died, the people asked the LORD, “Who will go up first to fight the Canaanites?”

2He said, “Judah. I’ll deliver the land to him.”

3Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Go with me to my territory to fight the Canaanites, and I’ll go with you to yours.”

So he went with him.

4Judah went up and the LORD delivered 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites to him at Bezek. 5-6They attacked Adoni-bezek 6and he fled, but they caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 7He said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. God has done to me what I’ve done.” They took him to Jerusalem, where he died.

8Judah fought Jerusalem and took it. They struck it with the sword and set it on fire. 9Then they went down to fight the Canaanites in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills. 10Judah attacked the Canaanites in Hebron (called Kiriath-arba before) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.	 Jud 1:1-10

11From there they attacked Debir (called Kiriath-sepher before). 12Caleb said, “Whoever takes Keriath-sepher, I’ll give my daughter Achsah as a wife.” 13Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, and Caleb gave her to him. 14When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked, “What do you want for yourself?”

15“A present. Since you’ve put me in the Negev, give me springs.”

Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.

16The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, moved from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad, and settled with the people. 17Judah went with Simeon and defeated the Canaanites in Zephath and “destroyed” it; so the city was called Hormah. 18Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, and their territories. 19The LORD was with Judah, and he gained possession of the hill country, but he couldn’t drive out the people in the plain; they had iron chariots. 20They gave Hebron to Caleb, like Moses had said. He drove out Anak’s three sons. 	Jud 1:11-20

21But Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites in Jerusalem; they still live there among them.

22Joseph went up against Bethel and the LORD was with them. 23Joseph’s house spied out Bethel (called Luz before). 24The spies saw a man coming out of the city, and said, “Show us how to get into the city, and we’ll have mercy on you.” 25He showed them. They struck it with the sword, but they let him and his family go. 26He went to the Hittites and built a city he called Luz. That’s still its name.

27Manasseh didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, or Megiddo and their villages. The Canaanites kept living there. 28When Israel grew stronger, they put them to forced labor; but they didn’t completely drive them out. 	Jud 1:21-28

29Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites in Gezer, who kept living among them.

30Zebulun didn’t drive out the people in Kitron or Nahalol, who kept living among them, subject to forced labor.

31Asher didn’t drive out the people in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. 32They lived among the Canaanites.

33Naphtali didn’t drive out the people in Beth-shemesh or Beth-anath. They lived among those Canaanites, who became forced labor.

34The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country. They wouldn’t let them come down to the plain. 35They went on living in Mount Heres. Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But Joseph’s house pressed heavily on them and subjected them to forced labor. 36The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and up.	 Jud 1:29-36

The Angel of the Lord Comes to Bokim

2:1The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said,

“I brought you up from Egypt to this land that I swore to give your ancestors. I said, ‘I’ll never break my covenant with you. 2Don’t make any covenant with the people here. Tear down their altars.’ But you haven’t obeyed me. 3So I won’t drive them out. They’ll become adversaries, and their gods will be a snare to you.”

4When the angel of the LORD told the people that, they “cried” out loud. 5They called the place Bochim and sacrificed to the LORD there.

The Death of Joshua

6When Joshua dismissed the people to their inheritances, 7they served the LORD while he was alive and the elders that outlived him, who’d seen the LORD’s great work for Israel. 8He died at 110. 9They buried him in his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 10That whole generation passed on to their ancestors, and another generation grew up that hadn’t known the LORD or seen his work for Israel. 	Jud 2:1-10

Disobedience and Defeat

11The people did sin and served the images of Baal 13and Ashtoreth 12and forsook their ancestors’ God. They worshiped the gods of people around them. That made the LORD angry; 14so he let plunderers sell them to their enemies so they couldn’t stand against them any longer. 15Whenever they marched out, he opposed them like he’d sworn. They were in dire straits.

16Then the LORD raised up judges to save them from their plunderers, 17but they wouldn’t listen to them. They carried on prostitution with other gods and soon turned aside from the way their ancestors lived. 18Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with him and saved them as long as the judge was alive. He took pity on their groaning. 19But whenever the judge died, they’d turn back and do worse than their ancestors and wouldn’t quit. 20The LORD was angry and said,

“They’ve sinned against my covenant like their ancestors. 21From now on, I won’t drive out any nation Joshua left when he died. 22I’ll use them to test Israel to see if they’ll follow me like their ancestors.” [23]	Jud 2:11-23

3:1The LORD left those nations to test the Israelites that hadn’t experienced war in Canaan. [2] 3The nations were

the five lords of the Philistines,

all the Canaanites,

Sidonians,

the Hivites on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.

4They served to test whether Israel would obey the LORD’s commandments to their ancestors by Moses. 5So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 6They intermarried with them and served their gods.

Othniel Judges Israel

7Israel forgot the LORD its God and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. 8He was angry and sold Israel to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for 8 years. 9When they appealed to the LORD, he raised up Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, to deliver them. 10The Spirit of the LORD stirred him up to judge Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim to him. 11The land had peace for 40 years. Then Othniel died.

Jud 3:1-11

Ehuid Judges Israel

12The people sinned again, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, king of Moab. 13He gathered the Amorites and Amalekites, defeated Israel, and took the City of Palms. 14Israel served him for 18 years.

15But when Israel appealed to the LORD, he raised up Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon. 16Ehud made a double-edged sword 18ins long and fastened it under his right thigh under his clothes. 17He presented the tribute to Eglon, an obese man. 18When he sent away the people that carried it. 19At the idols near Gilgal, he turned back and said, “I have a private message for you, King.” He said, “Just a minute.” His attendants went out. 20Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof room. He said, “I have a message from God for you.” He got up from his seat. 21Ehud reached with his left hand, took his sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly. 22The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade. He didn’t pull it out, and the refuse came out. 23Ehud went out to the anteroom, closed the doors to the roof room, and locked them.

Jud 3:12-23

24When he’d gone, the servants came and saw the doors locked, and thought he was relieving himself in the cool room. 25They waited till they were completely confused. When he still didn’t come out, they took the key and opened the doors. There he was on the floor, dead.

26While they delayed, Ehud escaped past the idols to Seirah. 27When he arrived, he blew the ram’s horn in the hill country of Ephraim. The people went down from the hill country with him leading. 28He told them, “Follow me. The LORD will deliver the Moabites to you.” They went down and seized the fords of the Jordan from the Moabites and wouldn’t let anybody cross. 29They killed about 10,000 Moabites, strong, able-bodied men. No one escaped. 30Israel subdued Moab that day. The land had peace for 80 years.

Shamgar Judges Israel

31After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad and delivered Israel.	Jud 3:24-31

Deborah Judges Israel

4:1After Ehud died, the people sinned again, 2and the LORD sold them to Jabin, king of Canaan in Hazor. Sisera commanded his army from Harosheth-hagoyim. 3The people appealed to the LORD because Sisera had 900 iron chariots and oppressed Israel cruelly for 20 years.

4Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. 5She sat under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people came up to her for judgment. 6She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali,

“The LORD God of Israel commands you, ‘Gather to Mount Tabor 10,000 troops from Naphtali and Zebulun. 7I’ll draw out Sisera, Jabin’s general, to meet you by the Kishon River with his chariots and troops. I’ll give him to you.’”

8Barak said, “If you’ll go, I’ll go. If you won’t, I won’t.”

9“I’ll go with you, but that won’t give you any honor. The LORD will be selling Sisera to a woman.”

She went with him to Kedesh, 10and Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; 10,000 men went up with him.									       Jud 4:1-10

11Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law*. He had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim near Kedesh.

12When Sisera heard that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, 13he called out his 900 iron chariots and all his army from Harosheth-hagoyim to the Kishon River. 14Deborah told Barak, “Get up! The LORD is going to deliver Sisera to you today. Isn’t it the LORD that’s leading you out?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men. 15The LORD routed Sisera, his chariots, and army. Sisera jumped down from his chariot and fled on foot. 16Barak chased the chariots and the army back home to Harosheth-hagoyim, and Sisera’s whole army fell by the sword.

17Sisera fled to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, because he and Heber’s family had been on good terms. 18Jael came out to meet him, “Turn aside, Sir. You don’t have to be afraid.” He turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a rug. 19He said, “Please give me a little water. I’m thirsty.” She opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him up. 20He said, “Stand at the door. If anybody comes and asks if anybody’s here, say, ‘No.’” 21But she took a tent peg and a hammer, and went quietly to him and drove the peg into his temple till it stuck into the ground while he was asleep, exhausted. That’s how he died. 22As Barak pursued him, Jael went out to meet him, “Come here, I’ll show you the man you’re looking for.” He went into her tent and found Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temple.

23God subdued Jabin that day in front of Israel. 24They kept pressing harder and harder on him till they’d destroyed him.	 Jud 4:11-24

The Song of Deborah

5:1Deborah and Barak sang that day,

2“Bless the LORD!

because the leaders led in Israel,

the people volunteered.

3Hear, you kings; listen, you officials;

I’ll sing to the LORD;

I’ll praise Israel’s God.

4LORD, when you went out from Seir,

when you marched from Edom,

the ground shook,

the sky dripped,

yes, the clouds dripped water.

5The mountains shook in front of the LORD;

you, Sinai, shook in front of Israel’s God.	Jud 5:1-5

6“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,

in the days of Jael, caravans ceased;

travelers kept to the back roads.

7The rural people ceased in Israel;

they ceased till you arose, Deborah,

as a mother in Israel.

8When the people chose new gods,

war was in the gates;

not a shield or spear was seen

among 40,000 in Israel.

9My heart goes out to Israel’s commanders,

who volunteered willingly among the people.

Bless the LORD.	Jud 5:6-9

10“Sing, you that ride white donkeys,

who sit on rich carpets

and travel on the highway.

11At the sound of those who separate flocks

by the watering places,

they repeat the LORD’s triumphs,

the triumphs of his rural people in Israel.

Then the LORD’s people went down to the gates. Jud 5:10-11

12“Wake up, wake up, Deborah!

Wake up, wake up, and sing!

Arise, Barak;

lead away your captives, son of Abinoam.

13The remnant of the nobles came down;

the LORD’s people came down

for him against the powerful.

14They set out to the valley from Ephraim;

they followed you, Benjamin, with your kin.

The commanders marched down from Machir;

from Zebulun they marched

who carry the marshal’s staff.		Jud 5:12-14

15The officials of Issachar came with Deborah;

as Issachar came so did Barak.

They rushed out to the valley at his heels,

but the clans of Reuben held back.

16Why did you linger among the sheepfolds?

To hear the piping for the flocks?

The clans of Reuben held back.

17Gilead stayed put beyond the Jordan.

Why did Dan stay with his ships?

Asher sat still at the coast by the sea

and settled down by his landings.

18Zebulun was a people that risked their lives,

Naphtali, too, on the high places in the countryside.

Jud 5:15-18

19“The kings came and fought;

they fought the kings of Canaan

at Taanach by the water of Megiddo;

they got no spoils of silver.

20The stars fought from the sky;

from their courses they fought Sisera.

21The current of the Kishon swept them away,

the rushing torrent in the Kishon.

March on, my soul, with confidence!

22“Then the horses’ hoofs beat loud

with the galloping of steeds.	Jud 5:19-22

23“‘Curse Meroz,’ the angel of the LORD says;

‘put its people under a severe curse.

They didn’t come to help the LORD

against the powerful.’

24May Jael be most fortunate among women,

the wife of Heber the Kenite,

most fortunate among women in the tent.

25He asked for water; she gave him milk.

She brought him curds in a beautiful bowl.

26She took a tent peg

and a workman’s hammer;

she struck Sisera a blow

and crushed his head.

She shattered and pierced his temple.

27He sank, he fell;

he lay still at her feet.

He sank and fell down dead at her feet.	Jud 5:23-27

28“She looked out the window;

Sisera’s mother gazed through the lattice.

‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?

Why do the hoof beats with his chariots tarry?’

29Her wise ladies answer;

no, she answers herself,

30‘Aren’t they finding and dividing the spoil—

a young woman or two for every man.

spoil of embroidered dyed work for Sisera,

two pieces of dyed work for the spoiler’s neck?’

31“May all your enemies perish that way, LORD!

But may your friends be like the sun

when it rises at it brightest.”

The land had peace for 40 years.	 Jud 5:28-31

Gideon Judges Israel

6:1Israel did what the LORD considered sin; so he gave them over to Midian for 7 years. 2Because of Midian, the Israelites made dens and caves and barricades in the mountains. 3Whenever they sowed anything, the Midianites, Amalekites, and people from the east would come up and attack them. 4They’d camp against them and destroy their crops as far as the territory around Gaza. They wouldn’t leave any sustenance in Israel—sheep, oxen, or donkeys. 5They’d come up with their livestock, camels, and tents like locusts in number. They trashed the land 6and brought Israel low. The people appealed to the LORD, 	Jud 6:1-6

[7] 8and he sent a prophet,

“The LORD God of Israel says, ‘I led you out of slavery in Egypt 9and delivered you from other oppressors. I drove them out and gave you their land. 10I told you, “I’m the LORD your God. Don’t be afraid of the Amorites’ gods where you’re living.” But you’ve ignored me.’”

11Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.

12The angel appeared to him, “The LORD is with you, brave soldier!” 	Jud 6:7-12

13Gideon said,

“Sir, if he’s with us, why is this happening? Where are his wonderful deeds our ancestors talked about when he brought us up from Egypt? He’s thrown us away now and delivered us to Midian.”

14“Take your strength and deliver Israel from them. Haven’t I sent you?”

15“LORD, how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I’m the least in my family.”

16“l’ll be with you. You’ll strike the Midianites as if they were one man.”

17“If I’m pleasing to you, give me a sign that it’s you speaking to me.  18Don’t leave till I come back with your present.”

“I’ll wait.”	 Jud 6:13-18

19Gideon went into the house and fixed a kid and cakes without yeast from 1.1 bushels           1 ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and took them to him under the terebinth tree. 20God’s angel said, “Put the meat and cakes on this rock and pour the broth over them.”  When he did that, 21the angel touched the meat and cakes with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed them, and he vanished. 22Then Gideon surmised that he was the angel of the LORD, “Lord GOD! I’ve seen the angel of the LORD directly.” 23But the LORD said, You don’t have to be afraid. You won’t die.” 24Then Gideon built an altar to him and called it The LORD Is Peace [Yahveh Shalom]. It’s still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.

25That night the LORD told him,

“Take your father’s bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down your father’s altar to Baal. Cut down the Asherah pole beside it. 26Build an altar to the LORD your God on top of the fortress here, with stones laid in order. Offer the second bull as a burnt offering with the wood from the Asherah pole you cut down.”

27Gideon took ten servants and did that. He was too afraid of family and townspeople to do it in the daytime, so he did it at night.	 Jud 6:19-27

28When people in town got up early, Baal’s altar was pulled down, the Asherah pole was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar Gideon built. 29They asked one another who did it. After they asked around, people said, “Gideon son of Joash.” 30They told Joash, “Bring your son out to die. He pulled down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole.” 31Joash said to everybody lined up against him,

“Will you defend Baal or his cause? Whoever fights for him will be put to death by morning. If he’s a god, he can defend himself. It’s his altar that Gideon tore down!” 	Jud 6:28-31

32That day he called him Jerubbaal (“Let Baal Fight Him”) because he tore down his altar.

33Then the Midianites, Amalekites, and people east of the Jordan joined forces, crossed the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 34The Spirit of the LORD stirred up Gideon. He blew the ram’s horn and called the Abiezrites to follow him. 35He sent messengers all over Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to follow him too. They went up to meet them.

36Then Gideon said to God,

“If you’re going to deliver Israel by me, 37I’m laying a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there’s dew on it but the ground around it’s dry, I’ll know you’ll deliver Israel by me.”

38That’s what happened. When he got up early, he wrung out enough dew to fill a bowl. 39Then he said to God,

“Don’t be angry with me. Let me test you one more time with the fleece. Let it be dry and the ground around it have dew on it.”

40That’s what God did that night. It was dry just on the fleece; the ground was wet. 	Jud 6:32-40

7:1Then Jerubbaal (Gideon) and the people got up early and camped beside the Spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was in the valley north of them by the Hill of Moreh.

2The LORD told Gideon,

“You have too many for me to deliver the Midianites to you. I don’t want Israel to pride themselves in thinking they’ve delivered themselves. 3Tell whoever is afraid and trembling to go home.”

Gideon tested them; 22,000 went back, 10,000 stayed.

4The LORD told Gideon,

“There are still too many. Take them down to the creek; I’ll test them. The ones I tell you, will go with you. The others won’t.”

5He took them down to the water. The LORD told Gideon,

“The ones that lap water like a dog, put in a group. Those who kneel down to drink put in another group.”

6300 put their hands to their mouths. The rest got on their knees to drink from the water. 7The LORD told Gideon, “I’ll deliver the Midianites to you with 300 men. Send the rest home.” 8He took the people’s jars and rams’ horns and sent the rest home. Midian camped below them in the valley.	          Jud 7:1-8

9That night the LORD told him,

“Get up and go down against the camp. I’ll deliver it to you. 10If you’re afraid, go down with your servant Purah. 11You’ll hear what they’re saying and be confident about attacking the camp.”

He went down with Purah to the outposts of the camp. 12The Midianites, Amalekites, and people from east of the Jordan lay along the valley like locusts. Their camels were without number, like sand on the shore. 13When Gideon got there, a man was telling his friend about a dream,

“I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp. It knocked a tent over and flattened it.”

14His friend answered, “That’s the sword of Gideon, a man of Israel. God is going to deliver Midian and the erst of the army to him.” 	Jud 7:9-14

15When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship and went back to camp. He said, “Get up! The LORD is going to deliver Midian’s army to you.” 16He divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them all rams’ horns and empty jars with torches inside. 17He told them,

“Do what I do when I get to the edge of the camp. 18When I and the ones with me blow the rams’ horns, then blow your rams’ horns all around the camp, and raise the battle cry, ‘For the LORD and Gideon!’”

19Gideon and the 300 got to the edge of the camp when they’d just set the middle watch. 20They blew the rams’ horns and broke the jars, holding the torches in their left hands and the rams’ horns in their right, and raised the battle cry, “A sword for the LORD and Gideon!” 21Every man stood in place all around the camp, and Midian’s whole army screamed and fled. 22When the Israelites blew the 300 rams’ horns, the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow soldier throughout Midian’s army. The army fled all the way to Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. 23Gideon called out Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh to chase them. 24He sent messengers all over the hill country of Ephraim, “Come down against the Midianites and seize control of the water, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” Ephraim came out and seized it. 25They captured Oreb and Zeeb, Midian’s two rulers. In the chase they killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They brought their heads to Gideon beyond the Jordan.	 Jud 7:15-25

8:1The men in Ephraim said to him,

“What have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?” They were in animated contention with him.

2He said,

“What have I done compared to you? Isn’t the gleaning of grapes in Ephraim better than the vintage in Abiezer? 3God delivered Oreb and Zeeb to you. What have I done compared to that?”

They calmed down.

4Gideon and the 300 crossed the Jordan, exhausted from chasing. 5He said to the men in Succoth, “Give loaves of bread to the ones with me. I’m afraid they’re worn out, and I’m chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”

6The officials in Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your army?”

7Gideon said, “All right, then. When the LORD delivers them to me, I’ll flail you with wild briers and thorns.” 8He went on up to Penuel and asked them the same thing, and they answered the same way.

9He told them, “When I come back after peace is restored, I’ll tear down this tower.”

Jud 8:1-9

10Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 men, what were left from the entire army from east of the Jordan; 120,000 swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah and caught them in a surprise attack. 12Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon chased them and captured them and sent the whole army into a panic.

13When he went back from the battle by the ascent of Heres, 14he captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him. He wrote down the names of the 77 officials and elders in Succoth. 15Gideon came and said, “Look, Zebah and Zalmunna that you taunted me about, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in hand that we should feed your exhausted men?’ 16He disciplined the city elders with thorns and briers from the countryside. 17He tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men in the city.

18He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”

They answered, “Every one of them was like you, like a king’s son.”

19He said, “They were my brothers, my mother’s sons. As sure as the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn’t have killed you.”

20He told Jether his firstborn to get up and kill them.

But the young man was afraid to draw his sword because he was young.

21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Be a man. Come do it yourself.”

Gideon got up and killed them and took the crescents off their camels’ necks.	 Jud 8:10-21

22Then the Israelites said to him, “Be our ruler, you, your son, and your grandson as well. You’ve delivered us from Midian.”

23“I won’t be your ruler. My son won’t either. The LORD will be your ruler. 24Let me ask you for one thing, though. Each of you give me the earrings from your spoil.”

25“We’ll be glad to.” They spread out a cloak and every man tossed on it the earrings from his spoil. 26The gold earrings weighed 50 pounds 1700 shekels of gold plus the camels’ crescents. 27Gideon made an ephod out of it and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 28So Israel subdued Midian; they didn’t threaten anymore. The land had peace for 40 years during Gideon’s life.

29Jerubbaal/Gideon went and lived in his own house. 30He had 77 sons from many wives. 31A concubine of his in Shechem also had a son he named Abimelech. 32Gideon died at a good old age, and they buried him in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah among the Abiezrites.

33As soon as he died, the people went back to worshiping the images of Baal. They made Baal-berith their god. 34They didn’t remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from their enemies in every direction, 35or show kindness to Jerubbaal’s family in return for everything he’d done for Israel. 	Jud 8:22-35

Abimelech’s Conspiracy

9:1Abimelech went to his mother’s relatives in Shechem and said to her clan, 2“Ask the leaders in Shechem which is better: for Jerubbaal’s 70 sons to rule you or for one man to rule you. Remember, I’m your flesh and bone.” 3His mother’s relatives circulated that around for him, and the people were inclined to follow him because he was their kin. 4They gave him 70 pieces of silver from Baal-berith’s temple. He used them to hire worthless, reckless fellows 5to go with him to his father’s family at Ophrah and kill his 70 brothers on one stone. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, hid. 6The people in Shechem and Beth-millo gathered and made Abimelech king by the Oak of the Pillar at Shechem. 	Jud 9:1-6

7When Jotham heard about it, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted,

“Listen, people of Shechem, so God will listen to you. 8The trees went out to anoint a king. They asked the olive tree to rule them. 9But the olive tree said, ‘Should I leave my richness that honors gods and mortals, and go sway over the trees?’ 10The trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and rule us.’ 11But the fig tree said, ‘Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go sway over the trees?’ 12The trees said to the grapevine, ‘You come and rule us.’ 13But the grapevine said, ‘Should I leave my wine that cheers gods and mortals, and go to sway over the trees?’ 14Then the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and rule us.’ 15The bramble said, ‘If you’re anointing me king in good faith, then come and take refuge in my shade. If not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.

“[16] 17My father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from Midian. 18You’ve risen up against his family and killed his 70 sons on one rock. You’ve made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king of Shechem because he’s your relative. 19If you’ve acted honorably in good faith with Jerubbaal and his family as his deeds deserved, then be happy with one another. 20If not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the people in Shechem and Beth-millo.”

21Jotham fled to Beer and lived there for fear of his half-brother. 	Jud 9:7-21

22Abimelech ruled Israel for 3 years. 23God put animosity between him and the people in Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with him. 24That was so the violence done to Jerubbaal’s 70 sons might come on Abimelech who murdered them and on the men who helped him. 25The men in Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops and robbed everybody that went by. Abimelech heard about it.

26Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his relatives and gained the confidence of the people there. 27They went out and gathered grapes from their vineyards, trod them, and held a feast. They went to the temple of their god and ate and drank, and ranted about Abimelech. 28Gaal said,

“Who is Abimelech? Why should we serve him? Didn’t the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him? 29If these people were under my command, I’d remove Abimelech! I’d tell him to muster an army and come out and fight.”

Jud 9:22-29

30When Zebul the ruler of the city heard what Gaal said, he was mad 31and sent ambassadors to Abimelech at Arumah,

“Gaal and his relatives have come to Shechem; they’re stirring up the city against you. 32So you and your men go during the night and lie in ambush in the fields. 33In the morning at sunup, rush on the city. When he and his men come out against you, do to them what you can.”

34Abimelech and his men got up during the night and laid in ambush against Shechem in four companies. 35Gaal went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and his men rose up from the ambush. 36When Gaal saw them, he told Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountains!”

Zebul said, “You’re just seeing the mountains’ shadows.”

37Gaal said again, “Look, there are men are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”

38Then Zebul said, “Where’s your bragging now, you that said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Aren’t these the men you despised? Go fight them.” 39Gaal led the men out to fight him. 40Abimelech chased him and he fled. Many fell wounded all the way back to the entrance of the gate. 41Abimelech retreated to Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem.	 Jud 9:30-41

42The next day the men went out to the fields. Abimelech heard about it. 43He divided his men into three companies and laid in wait there. When the men come out of the city, he attacked them and killed them. 44Abimelech and his company rushed up and stood at the entrance to the city gate while the two companies attacked and killed the ones in the fields. 45Abimelech fought the city all day and took it. He killed the people in it, tore it down, and scattered salt all over it.

46When people in the tower at Shechem heard about it, they withdrew into the fortress of El-berith’s temple. 47When Abimelech found out they were in the tower, 48he and his men went up to Mount Zalmon. He cut a bundle of brush with an axe and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. 49Each one cut a bundle and followed him. He piled the bundles against the fortress and set it on fire over the ones inside. Everybody in the tower died, about 1,000 men and women.	Jud 9:42-49

50Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and took it. 51But the city had a strong tower. The men and women fled to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof. 52He attacked it and came to burn down the tower door. 53A woman threw an upper millstone down on him and cracked his skull. 54Right away he called to his young armor bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me so people won’t say a woman killed me.” His young man thrust him through, and he died. 55When Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they went home. 56So God repaid him for his crime against his father in killing his 70 brothers. 57God also made the sinfulness of the men in Shechem come back on their heads and made Jotham’s curse fall on them. 	Jud 9:50-57

Tola Judges Israel

10:1After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dodo from Issachar, rose up to deliver Israel. He lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim 2and judged Israel 23 years. He died and was buried at Shamir.

Jair Juddges Israel

3Then Jair from Gilead judged Israel 22 years. 4He had 30 sons that rode 30 donkeys and had 30 “towns” people still call Havvoth-jair in Gilead. 5He died and was buried in Kamon.

Jud 10:1-5

6Again, Israel sinned and served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites and Philistines. They forsook the LORD. 7His anger flared at them, and he sold them to the Ammonites and Philistines. 8They crushed and oppressed Israel that year. For 18 years they oppressed Israel beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites (Gilead). 9The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim; Israel was severely distressed.

10Israel cried out to the LORD, “We’ve sinned against you; we’ve left our God and served the images of Baal.”

11He said to them,

“Didn’t I deliver you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines? 12The Sidonians, Amalekites, Maonites oppressed you too. You appealed to me and I delivered you from them. 13Yet you’ve left me and served other gods; so I won’t deliver you anymore. 14Call out to the gods you’ve chosen. Have them deliver you.”

15They said to the LORD, “We’ve sinned. Do whatever you think’s good. Just deliver us today, please.” 16They put away the foreign gods and served the LORD; he couldn’t bear Israel’s misery any longer. 17The Ammonites called to arms and encamped in Gilead. Israel came together and camped in Mizpah. 18The leaders in Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will lead the fight against the Ammonites will rule everyone in Gilead.”    	Jud 10:6-18

Jephthah Judges Israel

11:1Jephthah from Gilead was a strong soldier, but he was a prostitute’s son. His father was Gilead. 2Gilead’s wife also bore him sons. When her sons grew up, they shoved Jephthah out, “You won’t inherit in our father’s family. You’re another woman’s son.” 3He ran away and lived in the land of Tob. Ruffians gathered around him and went on raids with him.

4After a time the Ammonites went to war against Israel. 5The elders in Gilead went to bring Jephthah from Tob, 6“Come, lead us so we can fight the Ammonites.”

7“Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s family? Why come to me now when you’re in trouble?”

8“That’s why we’ve turned to you so you can lead us in Gilead to fight the Ammonites.”

9“If you take me home again to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them to me, I’ll lead you.”

10“The LORD is witness. We’ll do that.”

11Jephthah went with them, and the people made him their leader. He swore in at Mizpah in front of the LORD.	Jud 11:1-11

12He sent messengers to the Ammonite king, “What do you have against me that you’ve attacked my land?”

13The king answered his messengers, “Because when Israel came out of Egypt, he took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok all along the Jordan. Return it peacefully.”

14Jephthah sent messengers back to him,

15“Jephthah says,

‘Israel didn’t take away Moab’s or Ammon’s land. 16When the Israelites came up from Egypt, they went through open country to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 17Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom to let them pass through your land. But he wouldn’t. They sent to the king of Moab too, but he wouldn’t consent; so Israel stayed at Kadesh. 18Then they traveled through open country and went around Edom and Moab. They arrived at the east side of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They didn’t go into Moab; the Arnon was its border. 19Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king at Heshbon, to let them pass through his land to go to their own country. 20But Sihon wouldn’t trust Israel. He gathered his people, camped at Jahaz, and fought them. 21The LORD God of Israel delivered them all to Israel and defeated them. Israel took over Amorite territory 22from the Arnon to the Jabbok, from the desert to the Jordan. 23The LORD expelled the Amorites in front of his own people, and you’re going to take it back? 24Wouldn’t you keep what your god Chemosh gave you? We’ll keep everything the LORD our God has taken for us. 25Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel or go to war with them? 26Why didn’t you recover them while Israel lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, and in the towns on the banks of the Arnon for 300 years? 27I haven’t sinned against you. You’ve wronged me by attacking me. May the LORD the Judge decide today between Israel and Ammon.”

28But the Ammonite king wouldn’t listen.	Jud 11:12-28

29The Spirit of the LORD stirred up Jephthah, and he went through Gilead and Manasseh to Mizpah in Gilead and on to the Ammonites. 30He vowed to the LORD, “If you’ll give the Ammonites to me, 31whatever comes out of my house to meet me when I get back, I’ll offer up for a burnt offering.” 32He crossed over to fight them, and the LORD gave them to him. 33He massacred them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, 20 towns, and as far as Abel-keramin. So Israel subdued the Ammonites.

34Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah, and his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She was his only child. 35When he saw her, he tore his clothes,

“My daughter! You’ve brought me low! You’ve brought me great trouble! I’ve opened my mouth to the LORD, and I can’t take back my vow.”

36She said, “Father, if you’ve vowed to the LORD, do to me what you’ve vowed, now that he has avenged you of the Ammonites. 37Do this for me: let me alone two months so my companions and I can wander in the mountains and mourn my virginity.”

38He said, “Go ahead.”

He sent her away; she and her companions left to mourn her virginity for two months. 39She came back to her father, who did with her according to his vow. She never knew a man. It became a custom in Israel 40that the young women went four days a year to mourn the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead.	Jud 11:29-40

12:1The men of Ephraim gathered an army, crossed over the Jordan to Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites and not call us to go with you? We’ll burn your house on top of you.”

2Jephthah told them, “My people and I had a major conflict with the Ammonites. When I called you, you didn’t deliver me from them. 3When I saw that you wouldn’t deliver me, I took my life in hand and crossed over against them, and the LORD delivered them to me. Why then have you come up to fight me?”

4Jephthah gathered the men from Gilead and struck Ephraim because they said, “You Gileadites are refugees from Ephraim in Ephraim and Manasseh.” 5The Gileadites captured the Jordan fords. When a refugee from Ephraim asked to go across, the Gileadites would ask him if he was an Ephraimite. If he said, “No,” 6they’d tell him to say shibboleth. He’d say sibboleth because he couldn’t pronounce it right; so they’d kill him. At that time, 42,000 Ephraimites fell.

7Jephthah judged Israel 6 years. He died and was buried in his city in Gilead.    Jud 12:1-7

Ibzan Judges Israel

8After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 9He had 30 sons and gave 30 daughters in marriage outside his clan. He brought in 30 daughters from outside for his sons. He judged Israel 7 years. 10He died and was buried at Bethlehem.

Elon Judges Israel

11After him Elon from Zebulun judged Israel for 10 years. 12He died and was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun.

Abdon Judges Israel

13After him Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon judged Israel. 14He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons that rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel 8 years. 15He died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.	Jud 12:8-15

The Samson Cycle

13:1Israel sinned again, and the LORD gave them to the Philistines for 40 years.

2A man named Manoah in Zorah from the tribe of Dan had a wife that couldn’t have children. 3The angel of the LORD appeared to her,

“You haven’t been able to have children, but you’ll have a son. 4Make sure not to drink wine or alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean. 5Your son is not to shave his head. He’ll be a Nazirite to me from birth and begin delivering Israel from the Philistines.”

6She went and told her husband,

“A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, really awesome. I didn’t ask him where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 7He said, ‘You’ll have a son; don’t drink wine or alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean, because he’ll be a Nazirite to me from birth to death.’”

Jud 13:1-7

8Manoah pleaded with the LORD, “Please let the man you sent come again and teach us what to do with the boy.” 9His angel came again while she was sitting alone in the field. 10She ran and told Manoah, “The man that came to me the other day has appeared to me.”

11Manoah got up and followed her, “Are you the man that talked to her?”

“Yes.”

12“When your promise comes true, how should the boy live? What’s he supposed to do?”

13“Make sure to do everything I told her. 14She’s not to eat anything from the grapevine. Don’t let her drink wine or alcohol, or eat anything ceremonially unclean.”

15“Let me detain you and fix you a kid.”

16“If you detain me, I won’t eat your food. If you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” (Manoah didn’t know he was the angel of the LORD.)

17“What’s your name, so when your promise come true, we can honor you?”

18“Why ask what my name is? You can’t understand it.”

19Manoah took the kid with its grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, who worked wonders while Manoah and his wife watched. 20When the flame went up from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in it. They fell on their faces on the ground. 	Jud 13:8-20

21The angel of the LORD never appeared to them again. Then Manoah realized he was the angel of the LORD. 22He told his wife, “We going to die! We’ve seen God.” 23But she said, “If he meant to kill us, he wouldn’t have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering. He wouldn’t have shown us those things or told us such things.” 24She had a son and named him Samson. He grew and the LORD blessed him. 25The Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.	     Jud 13:21-25

Samson’s Marriage

14:1Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman. 2He came up and told his parents, “I saw a young Philistine woman at Timnah. Get her for me for a wife.”

3They said, “Isn’t there a woman among your relatives or all our people that you have to marry a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?”

But he told his father, “Get her for me; I really like her.”

4His parents didn’t know it was all right with the LORD because he was looking for an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines controlled Israel.

5Samson went down to Timnah with his parents and came to the vineyards at Timnah. A young lion roared at him, 6and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him. Barehanded he tore the lion apart like it was a kid. 7He went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased him well. 8After a while, he went back to take her and turned aside to see the lion’s carcass. There was a swarm of bees and honey in it. 9He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. He came to his parents and gave them some to eat; but he didn’t tell them he got it out of the lion’s carcass. 	Jud 14:1-9

10His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there. That’s the way young men used to do. 11When the people saw him, they brought 30 companions to be with him. 12Samson said to them,

“Let me put a riddle to you. If you can figure it out and tell me during the week of the feast, I’ll give you 30 linen tunics and 30 festive robes. 13If you can’t, you’ll give me that many.”

“Let’s hear it.”

14He said, “Out of the eater came something to eat.

Out of the strong came something sweet.”

In three days they couldn’t explain the riddle.    	Jud 14:10-14

15The fourth day, they told Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle means, or we’ll burn you and your father’s family. Have you invited us here to make us poor?”

16Samson’s wife cried in front of him, “You just hate me, you don’t love me. You’ve put a riddle to my countrymen and haven’t told me what it means.”

He told her, “I haven’t told my own parents. Am I going to tell you?”

17She cried in his presence the week the feast lasted. The seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told her countrymen the riddle. 18The men of the city told him on the seventh day before the sun set,

“What’s sweeter than honey?

What’s stronger than a lion?”

He told them,

“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,

you wouldn’t have solved my riddle.”

19The Spirit of the LORD came on him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 men from the city. He took their spoil and gave the festive robes to the ones that told him the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house. 20So Samson’s father-in-law gave his wife to his companion, who had been his best man.					    Jud 14:15-20

Samson’s Vengeance on the Philistines

15:1After a while at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid. He said, “I’ll sleep with my wife in her room.”

But her father wouldn’t let him go in, 2“I thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister better looking? Take her instead.”

3Samson told them, “This time I’ll be blameless for harming the Philistines.”

4Samson caught 300 foxes, turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each set of tails. 5He lit the torches and released the foxes in the Philistines’ standing grain and olive orchards. 6The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They said, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because he gave his wife to his companion.” The Philistines came up and burned her and her father. 7Samson told them, “If this is what you do, I swear I’ll take my revenge on you, and after that I’ll quit.” 8He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and went down to stay in the cave at Etam.				       		       		       	       Jud 15:1-8

9Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. 10The men in Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”

They said, “We’ve come to tie up Samson and do to him as he did to us.”

11Then 3,000 men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock at Etam, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know the Philistines rule us? What have you done to us? 12We’ve come down to tie you up and give you to the Philistines.”

“Swear that you won’t fall on me yourselves.”

13“We’ll tie you up and give you to them. We won’t kill you.”

So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.  	Jud 15:9-13

14When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him, and the Spirit of the LORD came on him powerfully. The ropes on his arms became like smoldering flax, and his bonds melted off his hands. 15He found a fresh jawbone from a donkey and killed 1,000 men with it. 16He said,

“With a donkey’s ‘jawbone,’

piles on piles,

With a donkey’s jawbone,

I killed 1,000 men.”

17After he said that, he threw it away. That place was called Ramath-lehi [Jawbone Hill].

18He was thirsty and “cried out” to the LORD, “You’ve granted me this great deliverance. Am I to die from thirst and fall into the hands of uncircumcised men?” 19God split open the hollow place that’s in Lehi, and water started coming out of it. When he drank it, his energy returned, and he revived. So he named it En-hakkore; it’s still at Lehi. 20He judged Israel 20 years during the time of the Philistines.					     	     Jud 15:14-20

Samson and Delilah

16:1Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute and slept with her. 2The Gazites heard he was there. They surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, “Let’s wait till morning light, then kill him.” 3But Samson lay till midnight, he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and its two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that’s near Hebron. 	Jud 16:1-3

4Later he fell in love with a woman named Delilah in the Valley of Sorek. 5The lords of the Philistines came and told her,

“Entice him to see where his great strength lies so we can overpower   him, tie him up, and subdue him. We’ll each give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”

6Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies and how you can be tied up.”

7“If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that haven’t been dried, I’ll become as weak as other men.”

8The lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings, and she tied him up with them. 9She had men lying in wait in an inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings like a piece of string snaps when it touches the fire. So they didn’t find out the secret of his strength. 	  Jud 16:4-9

10Delilah said to Samson, “You’ve made fun of me and lied to me. Please tell me how you can be tied up.”

11“If they tie me up with brand new ropes, I’ll become as weak as other men.”

12So she tied him up with new ropes and said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” The men lying in wait were in an inner room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.

13She said to Samson, “You’ve making fun of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied up.”

“If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”

14So while he was asleep, she wove the seven locks of his hair into the web. She made them tight with the pin, and said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” But he woke up and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web. 	Jud 16:10-14

15She said to him,

“How can you say you love me when you’re not honest with me? You’ve made fun of me three times, and haven’t told me where your great strength lies.”

16When she pressed him hard day after day, it distressed him to death. 17He told her honestly,

“A razor has never come on my head. I’ve been a Nazarite to God from birth. If I’m shaved, my strength will leave; I’ll become as weak as any other man.”

18When Delilah saw that he’d been straight with her, she called the lords of the Philistines, “Come up one more time. He’s told me his mind.” They came and brought her the money. 19She had him sleep on her knees and called a man to shave off the seven locks on his head. 20She said, “The Philistines are coming at you, Samson!” He woke up and said, “I’ll go out as at other times and shake myself free.” He didn’t know the LORD had left him. 21The Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains. He ground at the mill in the prison, 22but his hair began to grow again.

Jud 16:15-22

The Death of Samson

23The lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a big sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. “Our god has delivered our enemy to us.” 24When the people saw him, they praised their god; “Our god has delivered our enemy to us, the destroyer of our country who has killed many of us.” 25When they’d got half drunk, they said, “Call Samson so he can entertain us.” So they called him out of the prison to entertain them. They made him stand between the pillars. 26He told the boy that was holding him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars the temple rests on so I can lean on them.” 27The temple was filled with men and women, and the lords of the Philistines were there. There were about 3,000 men and women on the roof, watching while Samson entertained them.

28Samson called to the LORD, “Lord GOD, remember me this one time so I can be avenged on the Philistines for my eyes.” 29Samson took hold of the two middle pillars the temple rested on, and leaned his weight on them, his right hand on one, his left hand on the other. 30He said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed with all his might, and the house fell on the lords and people in it. He killed more people in his death than in his life. 31His brothers and family came down to get him. They took him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in Manoah’s tomb. He’d judged Israel 20 years.			    Jud 16:23-31

Micah’s Idols

17:1A man named Micah in the hill country of Ephraim 2told his mother, “I took the 1,100 pieces of silver that were stolen from you, that you told me about and I heard you speak a curse on; I have them.” She said, “May the LORD bless my son.” 3He gave them back to her. She said, “I consecrate the silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a molten image. Now I’ll return it to you.” he gave 200 pieces of it to a silversmith to make a carved image and a molten image. It was in Micah’s house. 5He had a shrine and appointed one of his sons as his priest. 6In those days, there wasn’t any king in Israel. Everyone did what seemed right to them.	Jud 17:1-6

7A young Levite from the family of Judah was living temporarily in Bethlehem in Judah. 8He left to find a place to live. As he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. 9Micah asked him where he was from.

“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I’m going away to find a place to live.”

10“Stay with me. Be a father and a priest for me. I’ll give you 10 pieces of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and living expenses.”

11The Levite was content to live with him and became like one of his sons. 12Micah installed the Levite as his priest in his house. 13Then he said, “Now I know the LORD will prosper me; I have a Levite as a priest.”	Jud 17:7-13

Idolatry Among the Danites

18:1In those days there wasn’t any king in Israel. The tribe of Dan was looking for a territory to live in, because no inheritance in Israel had fallen to them yet. 2They sent out from Zorah and Eshtaol five capable men from their tribe to spy out the land and explore it. They happened to come to Micah’s house and lodged there. 3While they were at his house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite and turned aside to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here?”

4“Micah has done such and such with me and hired me to be his priest.”

5“Ask God so we can know if our journey will be successful.”

6“Goodbye. The LORD is watching the journey you’re on.”	Jud 18:1-6

7The five men left and came to Laish and saw how the people lived in security, like the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing and possessing wealth. They saw how far they were from Sidon and had no dealings with anybody. 8When they came to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol, they asked them for their report. 9They said,

“Let’s go up against them. The land is fertile. Aren’t you going to do anything? Don’t hesitate to take the land. 10When you go, you’ll come to an unsuspecting people. The land is extensive. Yes, God will give you the place that doesn’t lack anything.”

11Then 600 armed men from the tribe of Dan set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 12They went up and “camped” at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That’s why the place is still called Mahaneh-dan—west of Kiriath-jearim. 13They went on from there to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.	Jud 18:7-13

14The five men that had spied out the country of Laish told their kin, “Did you know there are household idols, an ephod, a carved image, and a molten image in these houses? Think what you can do.” 15They turned aside to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s home and asked him how he was doing. 16The 600 armed Danites stood by the gate entrance, 17and the five men went in and took the carved image, ephod, household idols, and molten image, while the priest stood by the gate entrance with the 600 men. 18When they went into Micah’s house and took those things, the priest asked, “What are you doing?”

19They told him, “Keep your voice down, cover your mouth, and come with us. Be a father and priest for us.  Is it better to be a priest for one man’s house, or for a family and tribe in Israel?”

20The priest was happy. He took the ephod, household idols, and carved image and went in among the people.

21So they turned around and left, putting their little ones, livestock, and goods in front of them. 22When they were a good way from Micah’s house, the men in the houses close by were called out and overtook the Danites. 23They shouted at them. They turned around and said to Micah, “What ails you that you’ve come with such a crowd?”

24He said, “You take away the gods I made, and the priest, and what do I have left? What do you mean, ‘What ails you?’”

25The Danites said, “Don’t raise your voice at us or angry fellows might fall on you. You’ll lose your life and your family’s lives.”

26The Danites left. Micah saw that they were too strong for him and went home.       Jud 18:14-26

27The Danites took what Micah had made and his priest, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the sword and burned the town. 28There wasn’t any deliverer because it was too far from Sidon, and they didn’t have dealings with anybody. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the town and lived in it. 29They renamed it Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son. 30They set up the carved image, and Jonathan son of Gershom son of Moses and his descendants were priests for the tribe of Dan till the time of the captivity. 31They set up the carved image Micah made for as long as God’s house was at Shiloh.

Jud 18:27-31

A Levite and His Concubine

19:1At that time, there wasn’t any king in Israel. A Levite was living in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim. He took a concubine from Bethlehem, Judah. 2She got mad at him and went back to her father’s family in Bethlehem for four months. 3Then her husband went after her to speak graciously to her and bring her back. He had a servant and a couple donkeys with him. SheLXX brought him to her father’s family. When her father saw him, he was glad to see him. 4His father-in-law urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days. They ate and drank and lodged there. 5On the fourth day, they got up early, and he got ready to go, but the girl’s father told him, “Strengthen yourself with some bread and after that you can go.” 6The two men sat and ate and drank together. The girl’s father told him, “Spend the night and enjoy yourself.” 7When he got up to go, his father-in-law urged him till he stayed there again. 8On the fifth day, he got up early to leave, and the girl’s father said, “Strengthen yourself and wait till this afternoon.” So they ate together again. 9When the man, his concubine, and his servant got up to leave, his father in-law said, “It’s getting toward evening; stay here tonight and relax. You can get up early tomorrow for your trip home.”	        Jud 19:1-9

10But he wouldn’t. He left and headed toward Jebus (Jerusalem) with two saddled donkeys and his concubine. 11When they got close to Jebus, it was late in the day, and the servant said, “Let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”

12His master said,

“We won’t turn aside to a city that doesn’t belong to Israel. We’ll go on toward Gibeah. 13Let’s get close to a place there and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah.”

14So they went on past Jebus. The sun went down on them near Gibeah, in Benjamin. 15They stopped there to go in and spend the night. He sat down in the open square of the town because nobody had taken them home. 	Jud 19:10-15

16At evening an old man came in from working in the field. He was from the hill country of Ephraim and living in Gibeah. The men there were Benjamites. 17He saw the traveler in the open square and said, “Where are you from, and where are you going?”

18He said, “We’re going from Bethlehem to a distant part of Ephraim, where I come from. I went to Bethlehem, and I’m going home. Nobody is taking me to his house. 19We have straw and hay for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me, my maidservant, and the young man with us. We have everything we need.”

20The old man said, “Don’t worry. I’ll take care of everything you need. Just don’t spend the night in the square.”

21He took him into his house and gave the donkeys hay. They washed their feet and ate.

Jud 19:16-21

22As they were relaxing, some riffraff from the town surrounded the house, beating on the door and saying to the old man that owned the house, “Bring the man out that came to your house so we can rape him.” 23The man went out and said,

“No, brothers, don’t do something so wicked. He has come to my house; don’t do that awful thing. 24Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what you want, but don’t do such an awful thing.”

25But the men wouldn’t listen, so the man grabbed his concubine and put her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night till morning. As it started getting daylight, they let her go. 26She came and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was.

27Her husband got up in the morning; and when he opened the doors to leave, his concubine was lying there with her hands on the threshold. 28He said to her, “Get up; let’s go on.” But she didn’t answer. He put her on the donkey and went on to his home. 29When he got there, he took a knife and divided her limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent them all over Israel. 30Everybody that saw it said, “Such an awful thing has never happened since Israel came up from Egypt. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.” 					     Jud 19:22-30

Israel Fights the Benjamites

20:1The people came out from Dan to Beersheba, including Gilead, and gathered in unity to the LORD at Mizpah. 2The chiefs from all the tribes presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people, 400,000 infantry that drew sword. 3(Now the Benjamites heard that the people had gone up to Mizpah.) They said, “How did this wickedness happen?” 4The Levite, husband of the murdered woman, said,

“My concubine and I came to Gibeah, in Benjamin, to spend the night. 5The men there rose against me and set on the house around me after dark. They meant to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she’s dead. 6I cut her up in pieces and sent them all over Israel because they’ve committed a detestable, disgraceful act. 7People of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.”

8The people arose in agreement,

“None of us will go to his tent or house. 9We’ll go up against Gibeah by lot. 10We’ll take 10 men from 100 from all the tribes, 100 from 1,000, 1,000 from 10,000, to bring provisions for the people, so when they come, they can pay back Gibeah for that awful crime.”

11The men of Israel gathered in unity against the town.	 Jud 20:1-11

12The tribes of Israel sent men through the whole tribe of Benjamin, and said, “What’s this wickedness that’s taken place among you? 13Give up the base men of Gibeah, so we can put them to death and purge sin from Israel.” But the Benjamites wouldn’t listen. 14They came together out of the towns to Gibeah to fight. 15That day they mustered 26,000 swordsmen, besides 700 elite men in Gibeah. 16Among them were 700 elite men that were left-handed. Every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. 17Israel, not including those from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 swordsmen.

18The people of Israel went up to Bethel and asked God, “Which of us should go up first to fight Benjamin?” The LORD said, “Judah.” 19The people got up in the morning and camped against Gibeah. 20They went out to fight Benjamin and drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. 21The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and felled 22,000 Israelites that day. 22But the people took courage and formed the battle line again in the same place. 23They went up and cried to the LORD till evening and asked him, “Should we go again against our relatives the Benjamites?”

“Yes.”	Jud 20:12-23

24So they attacked the Benjamites the second day. 25Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day and felled 18,000 swordsmen. 26Then the entire army of Israel went up to Bethel and cried. They sat in front of the LORD and fasted that day till evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. 27(The Ark was there at that time, 28and Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron performed service in front of it.) They asked him, “Should we go up again against our fellow Jews?”

“Yes, I’ll deliver them to you tomorrow.”

29Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. 30On the third day, they went up against the Benjamites and set themselves in formation against Gibeah like before. 31The Benjamites came out against them and drew away from the town. As at other times, they began to strike down and kill some people in the highways—one that goes up to Bethel, the other to Gibeah—and in the countryside, about 30 men of Israel. 32The Benjamites said, “They’re routed like the first time.” But the men of Israel said, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the town onto the highways.” 33They rose up out of their place and set themselves in formation at Baal-tamar, and the men lying in ambush rushed out of their place west of Geba. 3410,000 elite men out of all Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was hard, but the Benjamites didn’t know that disaster was coming. 35The LORD defeated Benjamin in front of Israel. Israel destroyed 25,100 Benjamite swordsmen that day. 36Then the Benjamites realized they were defeated.	Jud 20:24-36a

The men of Israel gave ground, because they relied on the ones in ambush to attack the town. 37The men in ambush hurried out and struck the whole town with the sword. 38The signal by the men in ambush was that when they made a big cloud of smoke rise out of the town, 39the men of Israel should turn around in battle. Benjamin said, “We’ve struck them down like in the first battle.” 40But when the signal began to rise, the Benjamites looked back. The whole town was going up in smoke. 41Then Israel turned around and Benjamin panicked when they saw that disaster was on them. 42So they turned their backs on Israel toward open country, but the battle overtook them. Those who came out of the towns 43cut them down and pursued them down from Nohah all the way across from Gibeah to the east. 4418,000 Benjamites fell. 45They turned and fled toward the open country to the Rock of Rimmon. On the roads they cut down 5,000 more and pursued them hard to Gidom and killed another 2,000. 4625,000 Benjamites fell that day, trained soldiers. 47But 600 fled toward open country to the Rock of Rimmon and stayed there four months. 48The men of Israel turned back and struck them with the sword, people and animals and everybody they found. They set on fire the towns they found.	Jud 20:36b-48

Wives for Benjamites

21:1The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah that none of them would give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin. 2The people came to Bethel and sat till evening in front of God and cried bitterly. 3“LORD God of Israel, why has this happened that a tribe should be missing from Israel?” 4The people got up early the next day, built an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 5They said, “Which tribe didn’t come up to the assembly to the LORD?” They’d taken an oath at Mizpah to put to death anyone that didn’t come up to the LORD. 6They felt sorry for Benjamin, their fellow Jews, “A tribe has been eliminated from Israel today. 7What are we going to do for wives for the ones that are left? We’ve sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters for wives.”	Jud 21:1-7

8They said, “What tribe didn’t come up?” 9When the people mustered, not one person from Jabesh-gilead was there. 10The community sent 12,000 of their bravest men, “Go strike the people in Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including women and children. 11Destroy every male and every woman that has been with a man.” 12They found 400 young virgins in Jabesh-gilead and brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.

13Then the whole community sent word to Benjamin at the Rock of Rimmon to announce a truce. 14Benjamin came back, and they gave them the women they’d saved from Jabesh-gilead, but they weren’t enough. 15The people had mercy on Benjamin because the LORD had created a division in the tribes.	Jud 21:8-15

16The elders of the community said,

“What are we going to do for the rest of them? The women from Benjamin had been destroyed. 17There has to be an inheritance for the survivors so a tribe doesn’t disappear. 18But we can’t give them our daughters for wives.”

The people had sworn, “Anybody that gives a wife to Benjamin is under a course.”

19They said, “There’s the annual festival of the LORD at Shiloh, north of Bethel, east of the road from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah.”

20They told the Benjamites,

“Lie in wait in the vineyards 21and watch. If the young women of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, each man come out of the vineyards, grab his wife, and go to Benjamin’s land. 22When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we’ll say, ‘Grant them graciously to us because we didn’t take wives for them in battle. You didn’t give them wives; otherwise, you’d be guilty.’”

23The Benjamites did that and took their wives according to their number from the dancers they carried off. They went back to their inheritance, rebuilt the towns, and lived in them. 24Each man of Israel went to his tribe and family, to his inheritance.

25In those days there wasn’t a king in Israel. Everybody did what seemed right to them.

Jud 21:16-25

RUTH

Elimelech’s Family Moves to Moab

1:1Judges were ruling when a famine came over the country. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went with his wife and sons to stay in Moab. 2His name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites. 3But Elimelech died and Naomi was left with her two sons. 4They married Moabite wives Orpah and Ruth. They lived there about 10 years, 5and Mahlon and Chilion died too. So Naomi lost her husband and both sons. 	Ruth 1:1-5

Naomi and Ruth Return

6-7With her daughters-in-law she started to go back from Moab, because she’d heard that the LORD had visited his people and given them food. 8She told them,

“Both of you, go to your mother’s house. May the LORD deal graciously with you, as you have with the dead and with me. 9May he grant you to find a home in your husband’s house.”

She kissed them. They cried 10and said to her, “No, we’ll go with you to your people.”

11But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why go with me? Can I still have sons to become your husbands? 12I’m too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, even if I should have a husband tonight and have sons, 13would you wait till they were grown? Would you hold back from marrying? No, it’s really bitter for me that the LORD has worked against me.” 	Ruth 1:6-13

14Then they cried out loud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 15Naomi said, “See, your-sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”

16But Ruth said,

“Don’t ask me not to follow you. I’ll stay where you stay. Your people will be my people. Your God will be my God. 17I’ll die where you die and be buried there. The LORD do so to me and more if even death separates me from you.”

18When Naomi saw she was determined to go with her, she didn’t say anything more.

19The two of them went on to Bethlehem. When they got there, the whole town was stirred. The women said, “Is this Naomi?”

20“Don’t call me Naomi, call me Mara. The Almighty has dealt ‘bitterly’ with me. 21I went away full; he brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has made me suffer; the Almighty has brought me misfortune.”

22So Naomi came back, and Ruth came with her. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.	Ruth 1:14-22

Ruth Meets Boaz

2:1Naomi’s husband Elimelech had a wealthy relative named Boaz. 2Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me go glean among the heads of grain after one that might take an interest in me.”

“Go ahead, my daughter.”

3She went and gleaned behind the harvest crew. She happened to come to the part of the field that belonged to Boaz. 4He came from Bethlehem and said to the crew, “The LORD be with you.”

They said, “The LORD bless you.”

5He asked the crew chief, “Whose young woman is this?”

6“She’s the Moabite that came back with Naomi. 7She asked to glean behind the harvest crew among the bundles.  She came and stayed since morning. She’s been sitting in the house for a little while.” 	Ruth 2:1-7

8Boaz told Ruth,

“Listen carefully, my daughter. Don’t glean anywhere else. Stay here with my maids. 9Watch which field they harvest and follow them. I’ve warned the young men not to bother you. When you’re thirsty, go to the water jars and drink what the servants draw.”

10She fell on her face, bowing to the ground, “Why have I been pleasing enough to you that you’ve paid attention to me? I’m a foreigner.”

11Boaz said,

“I’ve heard what you’ve done for your mother-in-law after her husband died: you left your parents and the land where you were born and came to people you didn’t know. 12May the LORD God of Israel reward your work and pay your wages in full under whose wings you’ve taken refuge.

13She said, “You’ve been gracious to me, my lord. You’ve comforted me and talked nice to me, though I’m not one of your workers.”	Ruth 2:8-13

14At mealtime Boaz told her, “Come and eat some bread and dip your piece in the wine.” She sat beside the harvest crew, and he served her roasted grain. She ate till she was satisfied and had some left over. 15When she got up to glean, Boaz told his men, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t get after her for it. 16Pull some out from the bundles and leave it for her. Don’t fuss at her.”

17She gleaned in the field till evening. When she beat out what she’d gleaned, it was about 1.1 bushels 1 ephah of barley. 18She picked it up and went into town, and her mother-in-law saw it. She gave Naomi what she had left after she’d had enough. 	Ruth 2:14-18

19Her mother-in-law said, “Where’d you glean today? Where’d you work? May he who noticed you be fortunate.”

“I worked with a man named Boaz.”

20“The LORD bless him. He hasn’t withdrawn his kindness to the living and the dead. He’s one of our closest relatives.”

21Ruth said, “Besides, he told me to stay close to his workmen till they’ve finished his harvest.’”

22Naomi said “It’s good for you to go out with his maids so others won’t harm you in another field.”

23She gleaned close by Boaz’s maids till the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest. She was living with her mother-in-law.	Ruth 2:19-23

Ruth at the Threshing Floor

3:1Then Naomi told her,

“Let me find a permanent home for you so things will go well for you. 2Isn’t Boaz our relative the one whose maids you were with? 3Take a bath, anoint yourself, put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. Don’t make yourself known to him till he’s finished eating. 4Notice where he lies down and go uncover his feet and lie down. He’ll tell you what to do.” [5]

6She went down to the threshing floor and did that. 7When Boaz had eaten and drunk and was enjoying himself, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of grain. She came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 8In the middle of the night, he was startled and bent forward, and a woman was lying at his feet.	Ruth 3:1-8

9He said, “Who are you?”

“I’m Ruth. Spread your covering over me. You’re a close relative.”

10“The LORD bless you, my daughter. You’ve shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after younger men, rich or poor. 11Don’t worry. I’ll do what you ask, because my people in town know you’re an excellent woman. 12I am a close relative, but there’s one closer. 13Stay tonight; in the morning, if he’ll redeem you, all right. If he doesn’t want to, I will, as sure as the LORD lives. Lie down till morning.”

14She lay at his feet till morning and got up before people could recognize one another. He said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor. 15Hold out the cloak you’re wearing.” She held it out, and he laid six measures of barley on her, and she went into town.

16When she got to her mother-in-law, she asked her what happened.

She told her what he’d done, 17“He gave me these six measures of barley and said not to go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.”

18“Wait till you find out how the matter goes. He won’t rest till he’s settled it today.”

Ruth 3:9-18

Boaz Marries Ruth

4:1Boaz went up to the gate and sat down, and the close relative went past. He said, “Come over here, my friend, and have a seat.” He went over and sat down. 2He had ten elders of the town sit down there. 3He told the closest relative, “Naomi is back from Moab and has to sell the ground that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 4I thought to inform you to buy it with my people sitting here as witnesses. If you’ll redeem it, redeem it. If not, tell me so I’ll know. There’s nobody but you to redeem it. I’m after you.’”

“I’ll redeem it.”

5“When you buy the field from Naomi, you also need to acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to maintain title to his inheritance.”

6The close relative said, “I can’t do that. I’d jeopardize my own inheritance. You redeem it. Take my right of redemption.”						        	        Ruth 4:1-6

7This was the former custom in Israel when they redeemed and exchanged land. To confirm the transaction, a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other one. 8The closest relative told Boaz, “Buy it.” The other close relative took off his sandal. 9Then Boaz told the elders and the people,

“You’re witnesses today that I’ve bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. 10I’ve acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife to maintain title to his inheritance, so his name won’t disappear from his relatives or the court in his birthplace.”

11The elders and people in court said,

“We’re witnesses. May the LORD make the woman that’s coming to your home like Rachel and Leah, who built the House of Israel. May you gain wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem. 12May your house be like the House of Perez that Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring the LORD gives by this young woman.”	Ruth 4:7-12

The Genealogy of David

13Boaz married Ruth, and the LORD enabled her to have a son. 14The women said to Naomi,

“Blessed is the LORD who has given you a redeemer today. May he become famous in Israel. 15May he restore your life and sustain you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”

16Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse. 17The neighbor women said, “Naomi has a son!” They named him Obed, who became father of Jesse father of David.

18This is the genealogy of their ancestor Perez:

Perez was father of Hezron, 19father of Ram, father of

Amminadab, 20father of Nahshon, father of

Salmon, 21father of Boaz, father of

Obed, 22father of Jesse. father of David.    		Ruth 4:13-22

I SAMUEL

The Birth of Samuel

1:1Elkanah was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham son of Elihu (son of Tohu son of Zuph), an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah didn’t.

3He went up to Shiloh every year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests there. 4When Elkanah sacrificed, he’d give portions to Peninnah and her sons and daughters; 5but he’d give Hannah a double portion because he loved her. But the LORD had closed her womb, 6and her rival would bully her mercilessly about it 7year after year. As often as she went up to the LORD’s Tabernacle, Peninnah would torment her. She’d cry and wouldn’t eat. 8Elkanah asked her, “Hannah, why are you crying and not eating? Why are you sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”   	1 Sam 1:1-8

9Hannah got up after the meal, while Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the LORD’S Tabernacle. 10She was distressed, and prayed and cried bitterly. 11She took a vow,

“LORD of Hosts, if you’ll look on my grief and give me a son, I’ll give him to you all his life. He’ll never shave his head.”

12Eli was watching her mouth as she prayed. 13Her lips were moving, but she wasn’t making any sound. Eli thought she was drunk.

14“How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away.”

15“No, my lord, I’m depressed. I haven’t drunk wine or alcohol. I’m pouring out my heart to the LORD. 16Don’t consider me some worthless woman. I’ve been speaking out of my great anguish and distress.”

17“May God grant your petition.”

18“Be gracious to me.” So she went away and ate and wasn’t sad anymore.

19They got up early and worshiped in the LORD’s presence and went back to Ramah. Elkanah had relations with Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. 20In due time, she had a son and named him Samuel, “Because I’ve ‘asked’ the LORD for him.” 	1 Sam 1:9-20

Hannah Dedicates Samuel

21Elkanah went up with his whole family to offer the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. 22But Hannah wouldn’t go, “I won’t go till I’ve weaned him. Then I’ll present him to the LORD to stay there.”

23Elkanah said, “Do what you think’s best. Wait till you’ve weaned him. May the LORD confirm his word.”

She stayed and nursed him till she weaned him. 24Then she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, 1.1 bushel 1 ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She took him to the LORD’s Tabernacle in Shiloh even though the child was so young. 25They butchered the bull and took the boy to Eli. 26She said,

“As sure as you’re alive, Sir, I’m the woman that stood here beside you, praying to the LORD. 27I prayed for this boy, and the LORD gave me what I asked for. 28I’ve dedicated him to the LORD for as long as he lives.”

He worshiped the LORD there.	 1 Sam 1:21-28

Hannah’s Prayer

2:1Then Hannah prayed,

“My heart celebrates in the LORD;

you’ve honored me.

I speak boldly against my adversaries

because I celebrate over your salvation.

2There’s no one holy like the LORD;

indeed, there’s no one besides you at all.

There’s no rock like our God.

3Don’t brag anymore with such pride,

because the LORD is a God who knows;

he weighs what we do.

4The bows of the strong are shattered,

but the feeble increase strength.

5Those who were full are hiring themselves out for bread,

but those who were hungry are now full.

6The LORD kills and makes live;

he takes down to Sheol and raises up.

7He makes people poor and rich;

he brings them low and honors them.

8He lifts the poor up out of the dust;

he raises the needy off the trash pile

to seat them with nobles,

to inherit places of honor.

The pillars of the earth belong to him;

he’s set the world on them.

9He protects his holy people,

but silences the sinful in darkness

because people don’t prevail by their own power.

10The LORD shatters those who contend with him,

and thunders in the sky against them.

He’ll judge the whole earth;

he’ll give strength to his king

and elevate the one he’s anointed.”

11Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy served the LORD in Eli’s presence.

1 Sam 2:1-11

Eli’s Wicked Sons

12Eli’s sons were worthless men that didn’t know the LORD 13or the custom of priests with the people. When anybody was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork while the meat was boiling. 14He’d thrust it into the pan or kettle, caldron, or pot. Everything the fork brought up, the priests would take. They did that to all the Israelites that came to Shiloh. 15Before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would say, “Give the priest meat for roasting. He won’t accept boiled meat from you, only raw.” 16If the man said, “They have to burn the fat first, and then take as much as you want,” he’d say, “Give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.” 17The young men were sinning greatly because they didn’t respect the LORD’s offering.	1 Sam 2:12-17

18Samuel was serving the LORD as a boy wearing a linen ephod. 19His mother would make him a small robe and bring it to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the sacrifice. 20Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, “May the LORD give you children from this woman to replace the one she dedicated to him.” They went home, 21and the LORD visited Hannah; she had three more sons and two daughters. Samuel grew up in the LORD’s presence.

22Eli was old. He heard what his sons were doing—lying with the women that served at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 23He said,

“Why do you do the sinful things I’m hearing? 24Sons, the report is not good that I hear the LORD’s people spreading around. 25If one man sins against another, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?”

But they ignored him in keeping with the fact that the LORD wanted to put them to death. 26The boy Samuel was growing in height and favor with the LORD and the people.  	1 Sam 2:18-26

Warning About Eli’s Family

27Then a man of God came to Eli,

“The LORD says, ‘I revealed myself to your ancestor’s house when they were in bondage to Pharaoh. 28I chose them from Israel’s tribes to be my priests: to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod in front of me. I gave your ancestor the fire offerings of Israel. 29Why are you greedy about the sacrifices and offerings I’ve commanded? Why are you honoring your sons more than me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering my people make?’

30“So the LORD God of Israel says, ‘I did say that your house and your father’s would follow me forever, but I’m certainly not going to carry through on that now. I’ll honor the ones that honor me, and care less about the ones that despise me. 31The time’s coming when I’ll get rid of your strength and the strength of your ancestor’s house. There’ll never be an old man in your family. 32In distress you’ll see the prosperity I’ll put on Israel. 33But I won’t remove every man of yours from my altar and make your eyes fail from crying, make you grieve, make the added number in your house die in their prime. 34This will be the sign about your sons Hophni and Phinehas: they’ll die the same day. 35But I’ll raise up a faithful priest to do what’s in my heart and soul. I’ll build him a lasting lineage, and he’ll follow my anointed ways. 36Everybody that’s left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so I’ll have something to eat.”’”

1 Sam 2:27-36

The Call of Samuel

3:1The boy Samuel continued to serve the LORD with Eli. A message from the LORD rarely came at that time; visions weren’t frequent. 2Eli was lying down. (His eyesight had gotten bad.) 3The LORD’s lamp hadn’t gone out yet, and Samuel was lying down in the Tabernacle where the Ark of God was. 4The LORD called out to him. He said, “Yes?” 5He ran to Eli and said, “You called.” But he said, “I didn’t call; lie back down.” So he went and lay down. 6The LORD called out again, “Samuel.” He got up and went to Eli, “You called.” But he answered, “I didn’t call you, son; lie back down.” 7Samuel didn’t know the LORD yet, and the LORD hadn’t revealed a message to him before. 8The LORD called out to him the third time. He got up and went to Eli, “You called.” Eli surmised that the LORD was calling the boy. 9He told him, “Go lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Yes, LORD; I’m listening.’” So he went and lay down.         1 Sam 3:1-9

10The LORD came and stood and called out like before, “Samuel!”

He said, “Yes, LORD, I’m listening.”

11He said,

“I’m about to do something in Israel that will make everybody’s ears ring. 12I’ll carry out against Eli everything I’ve said about his house from beginning to end. 13I told him I’m about to condemn his house forever for the sin he knew about. His sons have brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. 14I’ve sworn to his house that sacrifice and offering won’t atone for its great sin.”

15Samuel lay down till morning. He opened the doors of the LORD’s Tabernacle, but he was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.

16Then Eli called him.

17“What did he say? Don’t hold it back from me. God do so to you and more if you keep back anything he said.”

18Samuel told him everything.

“It’s the LORD. Let him do what he thinks is right.”

19Samuel grew, the LORD was with him, and didn’t let any of his message fail. 20Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew he was confirmed as a prophet for the LORD. 21[4:1]The LORD appeared again at Shiloh and revealed himself to Samuel in a message.  	1 Sam 3:10-21

The Philistines Capture the Ark

4:1Samuel’s word went out to all Israel.

[4:1]Israel had gone out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer. The Philistines camped in Aphek 2and drew up in formation against Israel. When the battle spread, the Philistines defeated Israel and killed about 4,000. 3When the troops came to camp, Israel’s elders said,

“Why has the LORD routed us in front of the Philistines? Let’s bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh so he can come among us and save us from our enemies.”

4The people sent to Shiloh and brought the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. Hophni and Phinehas were there with it.	 1 Sam 4:1-4

5When the Ark came into camp, Israel shouted so loud the earth shook. 6The Philistines heard it, “What does that loud shouting mean in the Hebrews’ camp?” When they learned that the Ark of the LORD had come into camp, 7they were afraid,

“God has come into the camp. Nothing like this has ever happened before. 8Who can deliver us from these powerful gods? They’re the ones that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues. 9Take courage, Philistines, so you won’t become slaves to the Hebrews like they’ve been to you. Be men and fight!”

10They fought and defeated Israel, and every man fled home. There was a great massacre; 30,000 of Israel’s foot soldiers fell. 11The Philistines captured God’s Ark and killed Eli’s two sons.

1 Sam 4:5-11

The Death of Eli

12A man from Benjamin ran to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 13Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching because he was worried about the Ark. When the man came into the town with the news, the whole town cried out. 14Eli heard the outcry and asked what it was about. The man hurried over to tell him. 15He was 98 and couldn’t see.

16The man told him, “I fled from the battle today.”

“How’d it go?”

17“Israel fled. The Philistines have slain a great number, including your two sons, and they’ve captured the Ark.”

18When he mentioned the Ark, Eli fell backward off his seat by the gate, broke his neck, and died. He was old and heavy. He’d judged Israel for 40 years.	 1 Sam 4:12-18

19His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant. When she heard that the Ark had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor, kneeled, and gave birth. 20About the time she died, the women attending her said, “Don’t be afraid; you’ve had a son.” But she didn’t respond. 21She named him Ichabod, “The ‘glory is gone’ from Israel because they’ve captured God’s Ark,” and because her father-in-law and husband had died. [22] 	1 Sam 4:19-22

The Philistines and the Ark

5:1The Philistines carried the Ark from Ebenezer to Ashdod 2to Dagon’s temple and set it up beside him. 3When people got up early the next morning, Dagon had fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of the LORD. They put Dagon back in place. 4But when they got up early the next day, he’d fallen face down on the ground in front of the Ark of the LORD, and his head and hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only his trunk was left. 5That’s why Dagon’s priests and everybody that goes in his temple still don’t step on his threshold in Ashdod.

1 Sam 5:1-5

6The LORD heavily oppressed the people in Ashdod and around. He terrified them by striking them with tumors. 7When the men in Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The Ark of Israel’s God must not stay here. He’s heavily oppressing us and our god Dagon.” 8They gathered the Philistine lords, “What can we do with it?”

“Take it to Gath.”

So they did, 9but the LORD oppressed the city and caused a panic. He struck the people, young and old, with tumors. 10They sent it to Ekron. The people there cried out, “They’ve brought the Ark here to kill us.” 11They gathered the lords of the Philistines, “Send it back where it belongs so it won’t kill us.” A deathly panic gripped the city. God heavily oppressed it. 12People that didn’t die developed tumors, and the outcry from the city rose to the sky.

1 Sam 5:6-12

The Ark Returns to Israel

6:1The LORD’s Ark was in Philistine territory for seven months. 2They called for the priests and fortunetellers, “What should we do with it? Tell us how to send it back.”

3“Send it back with a guilt offering to Israel’s God. You’ll be healed, and you’ll find out why he keeps working against you.”

4“What guilt offering should we send him?”

“Five gold tumors and five gold mice, to match the number of Philistine lords. The same plague has struck you and your lords. 5So make images of your tumors and the mice that are ravaging the land and honor Israel’s God. Maybe he’ll lighten his oppression on you, your gods, and your land. 6Why harden your hearts like Pharaoh and the Egyptians did? After he’d mocked them, didn’t they end up letting the people go? 7Build a new cart and take two milk cows that have never worn a yoke. Yoke them to the cart but take their calves away from them. 8Put the Ark on the cart. In a box beside it put the gold figurines you’re returning to him as a guilt offering. Send it off, and 9watch it. If it goes on the road to Beth-shemesh in its own land, he’s the one that has done us this great harm. If not, we’ll know it happened by chance.”    	1 Sam 6:1-9

10They yoked two milk cows to the cart, shut up their calves at home, 11and put the Ark on the cart along with a box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors. 12The cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along one road without veering off, bawling as they went. The lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the outskirts of Beth-shemesh. 13The people there were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed. 14It came and stopped in a field that belonged to Joshua of Beth-shemesh. There was a large rock there. They split up the wood from the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. 15Levites took down the Ark and the box and set them on the large rock. The men of Beth-shemesh offered sacrifices and burnt offerings that day. 16The five lords of the Philistines saw it and went back to Ekron.

17As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines returned one gold tumor each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 18The gold mice matched the number of fortified towns and unwalled villages that belonged to the five Philistine lords. The large rock they set the Ark by is still a witness in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.	 1 Sam 6:10-18

19The LORD killed 70 men from Beth-shemesh because they looked in the Ark. The people mourned because he’d killed so many. 20Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who can stand against this holy God? Who will go up when he leaves us?” 21They sent messengers to Kiriath-jearim, “The Philistines have brought back the Ark of the LORD. Come down and get it.” 7:1The men came and took it to Abinadab’s house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to take charge of it. 2It was there some 20 years, and Israel mourned after the LORD.

1 Sam 6:19-7:2

Samuel Judges Israel

3Then Samuel told Israel, “If you’re coming back to the LORD with all your heart, put away the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Direct your heart to serve him only, and he’ll deliver you from the Philistines.” 4Israel got rid of the images of Baal and Ashtoreth and served the LORD only.

5Samuel said, “Gather Israel to Mizpah, and I’ll pray to the LORD for you.” 6They gathered there, drew water, and poured it out to the LORD. They fasted that day and said, “We’ve sinned against the LORD.” Samuel judged Israel at Mizpah.

7When the Philistines heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they went up to attack them. The people heard about it and were afraid. 8They told Samuel, “Don’t stop calling out to the LORD our God for us to save us from the Philistines.” 9He offered up a suckling lamb as a whole burnt offering. He appealed to the LORD for Israel, and he answered him. 10As he was offering it, the Philistines came to attack; but the LORD thundered with a loud noise that threw them into a panic. 11Israel chased them and kept striking them down as far as below Beth-car.

1 Sam 7:3-11

12Then Samuel set up a “rock” between Mizpah and Shen. He called it Ebenezer because the LORD had ‘helped’ them that far. 13The Philistines didn’t invade Israel again. The LORD opposed them Samuel’s whole life. 14The towns they’d taken reverted to Israel from Ekron to Gath. Israel rescued its territory from them. Israel and the Amorites were at peace too.

15Samuel judged Israel his whole life 16on a circuit each year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. 17Then he’d come back to his house in Ramah. He administered justice there as well and built an altar to the LORD.	 1 Sam 7:12-17

Israel Demands a King

8:1When Samuel was getting older, he made his sons judges over Israel: 2Joel his firstborn and Abijah. They judged in Beersheba, 3but they didn’t follow Samuel’s ways. They pursued dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.

4Israel’s elders gathered to Samuel at Ramah, 5“You’re getting old, and your sons don’t follow your ways. Appoint a king to govern us like the other nations. 6That displeased Samuel. He prayed to the LORD, 7and the LORD said,

“Listen to them. They’re not rejecting you as much as rejecting me from being their king. 8As they’ve done ever since I brought them out of Egypt—leaving me and serving other gods—so they’re doing to you. 9Give in to them but warn them solemnly how kings will rule.” 	1 Sam 8:1-9

Samuel Warns About Having Kings

10Samuel told the people everything the LORD said.

11“Be aware that this is how a king will rule. He’ll take your sons and appoint them to his chariots, to be his cavalry, to run ahead of his chariots. 12He’ll appoint commanders of thousands and fifties, and some to plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make weapons and equipment for his chariots. 13He’ll take your daughters for perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 14He’ll take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his officials. 15He’ll take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards, and give it to his attendants. 16He’ll take your male and female servants and the best of your livestock and donkeys and put them to his work. 17He’ll take a tenth of your flocks, and you’ll be his slaves. 18You’ll cry out because you’ve chosen a king, but the LORD won’t answer you on the matter.”

The LORD Grants Israel ‘s Request

19But the people wouldn’t listen. They said, “We want a king 20so we’ll be like other nations. He can govern us and lead us in battle.”

21When Samuel heard what they said, he repeated it to the LORD.

22The LORD said, “Give in to them and appoint a king.”

Samuel told Israel, “Every one of you, go home.”	 1 Sam 8:10-22

Saul Chosen as King

9:1A wealthy man in Benjamin named Kish son of Abiel (son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah) 2had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There wasn’t a man in Israel more handsome than he was. He was head and shoulders taller than everybody.

3Kish’s donkeys were lost so he told Saul to take a servant and look for them. 4They went through the hill country of Ephraim, through the territory around Shalishah, Shaalim, and Benjamin, but couldn’t find them.

5When they came to the area around Zuph, Saul told his servant, “Let’s go back so my father doesn’t stop caring about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”

6But the servant said, “There’s a man of God in this town that people regard highly. Everything he says comes true. Let’s go there; maybe he can tell us about the trip we’re on.”

7Saul said, “If we go, what can we take him? We don’t have any bread left in our sacks; we don’t have a present. What do we have?”

8The servant answered, “I have a tenth of an oz a fourth of a shekel of silver. I’ll give it to him to tell us where to go.” (9Earlier in Israel, when someone went to ask God, they’d say, “Let’s go to the seer.” What they call a prophet they used to call a seer.)

10Saul said, “All right.” They went to the town where the man of God was.	 1 Sam 9:1-10

11As they went up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked them if the seer was there.

12“Yes, he’s up ahead of you. Hurry; he just now got here for a sacrifice the people have on the high place today. 13As soon as you go into town, you’ll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat till he comes to bless the sacrifice. Afterwards the ones that are invited will eat. Go up; you’ll meet him right away.”

14They went up to the town. As they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way to the high place.

15The day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel,

16“About this time tomorrow I’ll send you a man from Benjamin. Anoint him to rule over my people. He’ll save them from the Philistines. I’ve seen my people’s suffering; their outcry has come to me.”

17When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, “He’s the man I told you about.”

1 Sam 9:11-17

18He approached Samuel in the gate, “Where’s the seer’s house?”

19Samuel answered him,

“I’m the seer. Go on up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me. In the morning I’ll let you go and tell you everything that’s on your mind. 20Don’t worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago. They’ve been found. Who is to receive everything that’s desirable in Israel? Isn’t it you and your father’s family?”

21Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe in Israel? Isn’t my family the least important one in the tribe? Why did you say that?”	 1 Sam 9:18-21

22Samuel took him and his servant to the hall and put them at the head of the guests, about 30 people. 23Samuel told the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you to put aside.” 24The cook picked up the leg and upper portion and put them in front of Saul. Samuel said, “See what I kept back for you till the appointed time so you could eat with the guests.” Saul ate with Samuel that day.

25When they came down from the high place into town, a bed was unrolled for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep. 26At dawn Samuel called to him, “Get up so I can send you off.” Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out into the street.

27As they were going down to the outskirts of town, Samuel told Saul, “Have the servant go on ahead. When he’s past, stop a minute so I can tell you God’s message.”  	1 Sam 9:22-27

Saul Anointed as King

10:1Samuel took a vial of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, and kissed him,

“Hasn’t the LORD anointed you to rule his people? You’ll save Israel from their enemies round about. This will be the sign that the LORD has anointed you ruler over his heritage. 2When you leave me today, you’ll meet two men by Rachel’s tomb in Benjamin at Zelzah. They’ll say, ‘The donkeys you went to look for they’ve found. Now your father has stopped caring about them and is worrying about you, “What am I going to do about my son?”’ 3You’ll go on to the Oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 4They’ll greet you and give you two loaves of bread; accept them. 5After that, you’ll come to Gibeah-elohim, where the Philistine outpost is. As you come to the town, you’ll meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place, prophesying behind a harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre. 6The Spirit of the LORD will come on you powerfully, and you’ll prophesy with them and become another man. 7When these signs meet you, do whatever you find to do, because God is with you. 8Go down to Gilgal ahead of me. I’ll come to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. Wait for a week till I come and show you what to do.”

1 Sam 10:1-8

9When he turned to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and those signs happened that day. 10When they got to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God stirred him powerfully, and he prophesied with them. 11When everybody that knew him before saw how he prophesied with them, they said to one another, “What has come over Kish’s son? Is Saul among the prophets too?” 12A man at that place answered, “Who is their father?” It became a saying, “Is Saul among the prophets too?” 13When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.

14Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where’d you go?”

“To look for the donkeys. When we couldn’t find them, we went to Samuel.”

15“What did he tell you?”

16“That they’d been found.” He didn’t tell him anything Samuel said about the kingdom.

1 Sam 10:9-16

17Samuel called the people to the LORD at Mizpah 18and told them,

“The LORD God of Israel, says, ‘I brought you out of Egypt and delivered you from the Egyptians and the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ 19But today you’ve rejected the God who saved you from your calamities and distresses. You’ve said, ‘No, install a king over us.’ Present yourselves to the LORD by tribes and by thousands.”

20Samuel brought the tribes forward, and Benjamin was taken by lot. 21He brought Benjamin forward by families, and the Matrite family was taken by lot. Finally, he brought the Matrite family forward one by one, and Saul son of Kish was taken by lot. But they couldn’t find him. 22They asked the LORD again, “Did the man come here?” The LORD said, “He hid in the baggage.” 23They ran and got him. When he stood among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.

24Samuel said to the people, “See who the LORD has chosen? There’s none like him among you.”

The people shouted, “Long live the king!”

25Samuel told them the rights and duties of kings. He wrote them in a scroll and laid it up in the LORD’s presence and sent everyone home. 26Saul went to his home in Gibeah, and brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him. 27But some worthless fellows said, “How can this fellow save us?” They scorned him and wouldn’t bring him a gift, but he didn’t react to them.	1 Sam 10:17-27

Saul Defeats the Amonites

11:1Nahash the Ammonite went up to lay siege to Jabesh-gilead. The men there said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we’ll serve you.”

2But he said, “I’ll make one with you on this condition: I’ll gouge out your right eyes so you’ll be a disgrace in Israel.”

3The elders at Jabesh said, “Give us a week so we can send messengers all over Israel. If there’s nobody to deliver us, we’ll come out to you.” 4The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and gave that message for the people; they cried out loud.

5Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen and wondered why the people were crying. When they told him what the men from Jabesh had said, 6the Spirit of God came on him powerfully, and he became angry. 7He cut the yoke of oxen in pieces and sent them all over Israel by messengers, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and Samuel will have this happen to his oxen.” Dread from the LORD fell on the people, and they came out united. 8He counted them in Bezek: 300,000 from Israel, 30,000 from Judah. 9They told the messengers, “Tell the people in Jabesh-gilead they’ll be delivered by the time the sun’s hot tomorrow.” The messengers went to tell them; they were relieved. 10They told Nahash, “We’ll come out to you tomorrow; you can do to us whatever you want to.” 11The next morning Saul put the people in three companies. They attacked the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites till the heat of the day. The survivors scattered till no two were together. 	1 Sam 11:1-11

The Kingdom Is Renewed

12Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said, ‘Will Saul rule us?’ Bring them here so we can execute them.”

13But Saul said, “We won’t execute anybody today. The LORD delivered Israel today.”

14Samuel told the people, “Let’s go to Gilgal and set up the new kingdom.” 15They went and made Saul king in the LORD’s presence. They offered peace offerings, and Saul celebrated with the people.	 1 Sam 11:12-15

Samuel’s Farewell Address

12:1Then Samuel told Israel,

“I’ve listened to you and appointed a king. 2Now here’s the king living among you, but I’m getting old and gray; my sons are with you. I’ve lived among you since I was young. 3Here I am. Accuse me in the presence of the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Who’ve I defrauded or oppressed? Who’ve I taken a bribe from to blind me? I’ll return it to you.”

4They said, “You haven’t defrauded or oppressed us, or taken anything from anybody.”

5He said, “The LORD and his anointed are witnesses that you haven’t found anything in my possession.”

They said, “They’re witnesses.”	 1 Sam 12:1-5

6Samuel told the people,

“The LORD appointed Moses and Aaron to bring your ancestors up from Egypt. 7Now, stand so I can remind you in his presence about the good things he did for you and your ancestors. 8When Jacob went to Egypt and your ancestors appealed to the LORD, he sent Moses and Aaron to settle them here. 9But they forgot him. So he sold them to Sisera, commander of Hazor’s army, to the Philistines, to the king of Moab, and they fought them. 10They appealed to the LORD, ‘We’ve sinned by leaving you and worshiping the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. But deliver us now from our enemies, and we’ll serve you.’ 11He sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and me to deliver you from enemies in every direction; so you’ve lived in security. 12When you saw Nahash threatening, you told me you wanted a king—although the LORD your God was your king. 13Here’s the king you asked for and chose, and the LORD has put over you. 14If you’ll respect, serve him, and regard his command, you and the king will be following him. 15If you disregard his command, he’ll oppose you like he did your ancestors. 16Take your stand right now and see this great thing he’ll do to you. 17Isn’t today wheat harvest? I’ll call out to him to send thunder and rain. You’ll see that he considered asking for a king a bad thing.”   	1 Sam 12:6-17

18Samuel called out to the LORD, and he sent thunder and rain that day. The people feared him and Samuel.

19They told Samuel, “Pray for us so we won’t die. We’ve added to our sins by asking for a king.”

20Samuel said,

“Don’t be afraid. You have done the wrong thing, but don’t turn aside from serving the LORD with all your heart. 21You’d be going after pointless things that can’t save. 22Because of his great name, the LORD won’t abandon you. It pleased him to make you his people. 23I’ll never sin against him by not continuing to pray for you. I’ll instruct you in the right way. 24Just respect him and serve him sincerely. Think about the great things he’s done for you. 25If you still act sinfully, he’ll sweep away you and your king.” 	1 Sam 12:18-25

Saul Fights the Philistines

13:1Saul was 40 when he began to rule and ruled for 32 years. 2He chose 3,000 men from Israel, 2,000 to be with him in Michmash and the hill country around Bethel and 1,000 to be with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent the rest home. 3Jonathan struck the Philistine garrison in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the ram’s horn all over the land and said, “Hebrews, listen.” 4All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison and that Israel had become repulsive to the Philistines. So Saul called the people to Gilgal.   	1 Sam 13:1-4

5The Philistines came together to fight Israel with 3,000LXX chariots, 6,000 cavalry, and people like sand on a shore. They camped in Michmash east of Beth-aven. 6Israel saw they were in a predicament. (The people were hard-pressed.) They hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, cellars, cisterns. 7Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to Gad in Gilead. Saul stayed in Gilgal, and the people followed him trembling.

Saul’s Ill-Advised Sacrifice

8He waited for the week Samuel appointed, but Samuel didn’t come, and the people started leaving. 9So he told them to bring him the burnt offering and peace offerings. He offered the burnt offering. 10No sooner had he finished offering it than Samuel came. Saul went out to greet him, 11but Samuel said, “What have you done?” 	1 Sam 13:5-11a

Saul said,

“The people were leaving, you didn’t come by the appointed time, and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash. 12I said the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I haven’t asked for the LORD’s blessing. I went ahead and offered the burnt offering.”

13Samuel told Saul,

“You’ve done something foolish. You haven’t kept the commandment the LORD gave you. He would’ve made your kingdom secure permanently, 14but not now. He has looked for a man after his own heart to appoint as ruler over his people, because you haven’t done what he told you.”  	1 Sam 13:11b-14

15Then Samuel went up from Gilgal to Gibeah. Saul counted the people with him, about 600 men. 16He, his son Jonathan, and the people with them were staying at Geba in Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 17Three raiding parties went out from the Philistines’: one toward Ophrah in the area around Shual, 18another toward Beth-horon, and the other toward the borderland that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim near open country.

19There weren’t any blacksmiths in Israel, so the Hebrews couldn’t make swords or spears. 20They had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen their forks, plowshares, picks, axes, and goads, and to fix their goad points. 21They charged the Israelites ¼ oz two-thirds of a shekel of silver for sharpening plowshares and picks and ⅛ oz a third of a shekel for sharpening forks, axes, and goads. 22The day of the battle, none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had swords or spears, just Saul and Jonathan. 23A Philistine contingent went out to secure the pass by Michmash.

1 Sam 13:15-23

Jonathan Defeats the Philistines

14:1One day Jonathan said to his young armor bearer, “Let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” He didn’t tell his father, 2who was staying with about 600 men on the outskirts of Gibeah around the pomegranate tree in Migron. 3Among Saul’s men was Ahijah wearing an ephod—son of Ahitub (Ichabod’s brother) son of Phinehas son of Eli the LORD’s priest at Shiloh. The people didn’t know Jonathan had gone. 4Between the passes Jonathan was planning to use to cross over to the Philistines’ outpost, there were steep cliffs on two sides named Bozez and Seneh. 5One went up to the north toward Michmash, the other one on the south toward Geba.  	1 Sam 14:1-5

6Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Let’s go over to those uncircumcised Philistines. Maybe the LORD will work for us. He’s not limited to saving by many or few.”

7“Do what you want. I’m with you.”

8Jonathan said,

“We’ll go let them know we’re here. 9If they say, ‘Wait till we come to you,’ we’ll stay put. 10If they say, ‘Come on up,’ we’ll go up. The LORD will deliver them to us. That will be our sign.”

11When they let the outpost know they were there, the Philistines said, “The Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they’ve been hiding.” 12The men in the outpost shouted, “Come on up! We’ll show you a thing or two!” Jonathan told his armor bearer, “Come on; the LORD will deliver them to Israel.” 13Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armor bearer behind him, and they fell to Jonathan. His armor bearer killed some behind him. 14That first slaughter was about 20 men on a half-acre. 15There was panic in the camp, in the field, and among the people. Even the garrison and raiding parties trembled, and the ground shook.

1 Sam 14:6-15

16Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah saw the camp scattering, running here and there. 17Saul told the people with him, “Count and see who’s not here.” They counted, and Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. 18Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s Ark here.” At that time, it was with the people in Israel. 19While he was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew, so Saul told the priest not to worry about it then. 20Saul and his people rallied and joined the battle. The Philistines were killing one another in total chaos. 21The Hebrews that had been going around with the Philistine camp joined the people with Saul and Jonathan. 22When people hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also chased them in the battle. 23The LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread past Beth-aven.

1 Sam 14:16-23

Saul’s Rash Vow

24The men in Israel were totally exhausted because Saul had put them under oath, “Accursed is the man that eats before evening, until I’ve avenged myself of my enemies.” So nobody had eaten anything. 25-26When they went into the forest, they’d found honeycomb on the ground, but nobody put any in his mouth out of respect for the oath. 27But Jonathan hadn’t heard about his father’s oath. He dipped the end of his staff in the honeycomb, and put some in his mouth, and he was refreshed. 28One of the people said, “Your father strictly put the people under oath, ‘The man that eats today is under a curse.’” The people were exhausted. 29Jonathan said,

“My father has created a problem. See how I’ve been refreshed because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much more if the people had eaten freely from the spoils! As it is, the slaughter among the Philistines wasn’t that great.”

1 Sam 14:24-30

31They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were completely exhausted. 32After dark, they rushed ravenously on the spoil, butchered sheep, cattle, and calves on the ground, and ate them with the blood. 33People told Saul, “They’re sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood.”

He said,

“You’ve acted deviously. Roll a large rock to me. 34Go out among the people and tell them to bring their ox or sheep, butcher it here and eat. Don’t sin by eating the meat with the blood.’”

The people that night brought their cattle or sheep and butchered them there. 35Saul built an altar to the LORD, his first. 	1 Sam 14:31-35

36Then Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines at night and take spoil till daylight. Don’t leave one survivor.”

They said, “Do what you like.”

So the priests said, “Let’s draw near to God here.”

37Saul asked God, “Should we go down after the Philistines? Will you give them to Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.

38Saul said,

“Come here, you chiefs of the people, and find out how this sin happened today. 39As sure as the LORD lives who delivers Israel, even if it’s Jonathan, he’ll die.”

But none of the people answered.

40Then he said to them, “You’re on one side; Jonathan and I are on the other.”

The people said, “Do what you like.”

41Saul told the LORD, “Give a clear answer.” The lot fell on Jonathan and Saul.

42Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan.” The lot fell on Jonathan.

43He said to Jonathan, “What did you do?”

Jonathan told him, “I tasted some honey with the end of my staff. So kill me!”

44Saul said, “God do this to me and more also because you’ll surely die, Jonathan.”

45But the people said to Saul,

“Does Jonathan have to die who brought about this great deliverance? Far from it! As sure as the LORD lives, not one hair of his head will fall to the ground; he’s worked with God today.”

The people rescued him. 46Saul quit chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went home.

1 Sam 14:36-46

Saul Fights Israel’s Enemies

47When Saul took over the kingship, he fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He inflicted punishment wherever he went. 48He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and delivered Israel from plunderers.

49Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua.

His daughters were Merab, the firstborn, and Michal.

50His wife was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz.

The general of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.

51His father was Kish;

Ner was son of Abiel.

52During Saul’s whole life, he was constantly at war with the Philistines. Whenever he saw a strong or brave man, he’d attach him to his staff.	 1 Sam 14:47-52

The LORD Rejects Saul

15:1Then Samuel told Saul,

“The LORD of Hosts sent me to anoint you king over his people. 2He says, ‘I’m going to settle up Amalek for opposing Israel on their way up from Egypt. 3Strike him and destroy everything he has. Don’t spare him. Put to death man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey.’”

4Saul called in the people and counted them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 5He came to Amalek’s city and set up an ambush in the valley. 6He told the Kenites, “Get away from the Amalekites so I won’t be destroying you with them. You were kind to Israel when they came up from Egypt.”

The Kenites left. 	1 Sam 15:1-6

7Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt. 8He captured Agag the king and destroyed the people with the sword. 9But he and the people spared Agag and the best sheep, cattle, grain-fed animals, lambs, and everything that was good. They didn’t want to destroy them completely, just everything despised and worthless.

10A message from the LORD came to Samuel, 11“I’ve changed my mind about having Saul as king. He’s not been doing what I’ve tell him.”

Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night. 12He got up early to meet Saul. He heard that Saul had gone to Carmel to set up a monument to himself and then went on down to Gilgal.” 	1 Sam 15:7-12

13Samuel came and Saul said to him, “The LORD’s blessed you! I’ve done what you’ve said.”

14But Samuel asked, “What’s this bleating and bawling?”

15“They’ve brought them from the Amalekites. The people spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God. The rest we’ve destroyed.”

16“Wait, let me tell you what the LORD told me last night.”

“Tell me.”

17“Isn’t it true, though you felt inadequate, the LORD made you the head over Israel? He anointed you king 18and sent you to kill off the Amalekites completely. 19Why didn’t you obey him, but rushed on the spoil and did what he considered sin.”

20“I did obey him; I went on his mission and brought back Agag the king and destroyed the Amalekites. 21But the people took some of the spoil—sheep and cattle, the best things devoted to destruction—to sacrifice to the LORD at Gilgal.”

1 Sam 15:13-21

22Samuel said,

“Does the LORD delight as much in burnt offerings and sacrifices

as he does in obedience?

Obedience is better than sacrifice,

listening than the fat of rams.

23Rebellion is like fortunetelling;

insubordination is like iniquity and idolatry.

Because you’ve refused to do what the LORD said,

he’s rejected you from being king.”

24Saul said, “I’ve sinned against his command and what you’ve said. I was afraid of the people and listened to them. 25Pardon my sin and go back with me so I can worship the LORD.”

26“I won’t go back with you. You’ve rejected the LORD’s message, and he’s rejected you from being king.”	1 Sam 15:22-26

27As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. 28Samuel said,

“The LORD has torn the kingdom from you today and given it someone better than you. 29The Glory of Israel doesn’t lie or change his mind. He’s not a mortal that he’d do that.”

30“I’ve sinned, but please honor me in front of the elders and my people. Go back with me so I can worship the LORD your God.”

31Samuel followed him back, and Saul worshiped the LORD.

32Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag.” Agag came to him relieved, “Bitter death must be past.”

33But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless.” He cut Agag to pieces in the LORD’s presence at Gilgal.

34Then he went to Ramah, but Saul went home to Gibeah. 35Samuel never saw him again; he grieved over him. The LORD changed his mind about having him be king. 	1 Sam 15:27-35

David Anointed King

16:1The LORD said to Samuel,

“How long are you going to grieve over Saul? I’ve set him aside from being king. Fill your horn with olive oil and go to Jesse of Bethlehem. I’ve selected a king from his sons.”

2Samuel said, “How can I go there? When Saul hears about it, he’ll kill me.”

“Take a heifer with you and say you’ve come to sacrifice to the LORD. 3Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I’ll show you what to do. Anoint the one I specify.”

4Samuel went to Bethlehem. The city elders came trembling, “Are you coming in peace?”

5“Yes, I’ve come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and go with me to the sacrifice.” He consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.  	1 Sam 16:1-5

6When they came in, Samuel looked at Eliab and thought, “Surely that’s the LORD’s anointed.”

7But the LORD said, “Don’t look at his height or appearance. I haven’t chosen him. I don’t see like people do. They look at appearance; I look at hearts.”

8Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel.

He said, “The LORD hasn’t chosen this one either.”

9Next, Jesse presented Shammah.

He said, “The LORD hasn’t chosen this one either.”

10Jesse presented seven of his sons, but Samuel told Jesse, “The LORD hasn’t chosen any of these. 11Are they all your young men?”

“There’s still the youngest. He’s tending sheep.”

“Send for him; we won’t sit down till he gets here.”

12He sent and brought him in, a barefaced young man with bright eyes and handsome features.

The LORD said, “Anoint him; he’s the one.”

13Samuel took the horn of olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD stirred him powerfully from then on. Samuel went to Ramah.	1 Sam 16:6-13

David in Saul’s Service

14The Spirit of the LORD left Saul, and a tormenting spirit from the LORD started coming on him. 15His servants told him. “A tormenting spirit from God is coming on you. 16Have us look for a man that’s good at playing a harp so you’ll feel better.”

17So Saul said, “Bring me a man like that.”

18One young man answered, “I’ve seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite that’s a good musician, as well as a brave man, a soldier, prudent in speech, and a handsome fellow. The LORD is with him.”

19Saul sent messengers to Jesse, “Send me your son David that tends your flock.”

20Jesse took a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a jug of wine, and sent them to Saul with David. 21He went to Saul and became his attendant. Saul liked him and made him his armor bearer.

22Saul sent to Jesse, “Let David remain with me. I like him.” 23Whenever an evil spirit from God came over Saul, David would take his harp and play it. Saul would be refreshed and feel better. The tormenting spirit would go away.	1 Sam 16:14-23

David and Goliath

17:1The Philistines gathered their army for battle at Socoh in Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. 2Saul and Israel came together, camped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle formation to meet them. 3The Philistines stood on the hill on one side of the valley, and Israel stood on the hill on the other side. 4A champion from Gath named Goliath came out from the Philistine camp. He was 9ft 9 6 cubits and a span, 5and wore a bronze helmet and scale armor that weighed 125 lbs 5,000 shekels. 6He had bronze greaves on his shins and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. 7His spear shaft was like a weaver’s beam; its spearhead weighed 15 lbs 600 shekels of iron. His shield bearer walked ahead of him. 8He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,

“Why do you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Philistine and you’re Saul’s servants? Choose a man and have him come down to me. 9If he can fight me and kill me, we’ll become your slaves. If I kill him, you’ll become our slaves. 10I defy the ranks of Israel. Give me a man, and we’ll fight.”

11When Saul and Israel heard him, they were really intimidated.  	1 Sam 17:1-11

12David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse in Bethlehem named Jesse. He had eight sons. Jesse was an old man in Saul’s day. 13His three oldest sons had followed Saul to battle: Eliab his firstborn, Abinadab, and Shammah. 14David, the youngest, 15went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem. 16The Philistine came forward morning and evening for 40 days and took his stand.

17Jesse told David,

“Take 1.1 bushels 1 ephah of this roasted grain and these 10 loaves and run to your brothers in camp. 18Take these 10 cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand. Look into the welfare of your brothers and bring back news about them. 19Saul, your brothers, and Israel’s army are fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah.”	 1 Sam 17:12-19

20David got up early and left the flock with a keeper, took the supplies, and went like Jesse said. He got to the camp as the army was moving out into battle formation, raising the battle cry. 21Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle formation, army against army. 22David left his things with the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line to greet his brothers. 23As he was talking to them, Goliath came up from the Philistines and said the same thing as before, and David heard it. 24When the Israelites saw him, they drew back, afraid.	  1 Sam 17:20-24

25They said,

“Have you seen this man that keeps coming up to defy Israel? The king will greatly enrich the man that kills him. He’ll give him his daughter and exempt his father’s family from paying taxes in Israel.”

26David asked the men standing by him,

“What will the king do for the man that kills this Philistine and takes disgrace away from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God?”

27They repeated their answer, “That’s what he’ll get.”

28Eliab heard him talking to the men, and his anger flared at David,

“What are you doing here? Who did you leave that little bunch of sheep with in the countryside? I know your insolence. You’ve come down to watch the battle.”

29But David said, “What have I done now? I just asked a question!” 30Then he turned to someone else and asked the same thing and got the same answer. 	1 Sam 17:25-30

31When what David said was heard, they told Saul, and he sent for him. 32David told him, “Nobody’s heart should fail over this Philistine. I’ll fight him.”

33“You can’t fight him; you’re just a boy. He’s been a soldier since he was your age.”

34“I’ve tended my father’s sheep. When a lion or bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 35I went after it and struck it and rescued the lamb from its mouth. When it attacked me, I grabbed its jaw and struck it and killed it. 36I’ve killed a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has taunted the armies of the living God. 37The LORD that delivered me from a lion and a bear, will deliver me from this Philistine.”

“Go on. The LORD be with you.” 	1 Sam 17:31-37

38Saul dressed David in his clothes, put a bronze helmet on his head, and put his armor on him. 39David bound his sword over his armor and tried to walk because he wasn’t used to them. He told Saul, “I can’t go with these on. I’m not used to them.” He took them off. 40He took his staff and chose five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in his shepherd’s pouch. With his sling in hand, he went toward the Philistine.

41The Philistine came toward David behind his shield bearer. 42When he looked up and saw David, he sneered. He was just a handsome barefaced boy.  	1 Sam 17:38-42

43The Philistine said, “Am I a dog that you come to me with sticks?” He cursed David by his gods. 44“Come here; I’ll give your body to the birds from the sky and the animals in the field.”

45David told the Philistine,

“You’re coming to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I’m coming to you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel that you’ve taunted. 46He will deliver you to me today. I’ll strike you down and take off your head. I’ll give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds and wild animals so the whole world will know there’s a God in Israel. 47This whole assembly will know that he doesn’t deliver by sword or spear. The battle is the LORD’s. He’ll give youpl to us.”

48When the Philistine came to meet him, David ran fast toward the battle line to meet him. 49He put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine in the forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell on his face.	1 Sam 17:43-49

50David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone. He struck him and killed him, but David didn’t have a sword. 51He ran and stood over the Philistine, drew his sword out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 52Israel and Judah rose up and raised the battle cry. They chased the Philistines to the mouth of the valley and the gates of Ekron. Slain Philistines lay along the road to Shaaraim, all the way to Gath and Ekron. 53Israel came back from chasing them and plundered their camps. 54David picked up the Philistine’s head and took it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent. 	  1 Sam 17:50-54

55When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, his general, “Whose son is he?

“By your life, king, I don’t know.”

56“Find out.”

57So when David came back from killing the Philistine, Abner took him to Saul with the Philistine’s head in his hand.

58Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?”

“The son of Jesse from Bethlehem.”	1 Sam 17:55-58

Saul’s Jealousy of David

18:1When he’d finished talking to Saul, Jonathan was drawn to David and loved him as himself. 2Saul took him that day and didn’t let him go back home. 3Jonathan made a pact with him because he loved him as himself. 4Jonathan took off his robe and gave it to him, along with his armor, sword, bow, and belt. 5So David went out wherever Saul sent him and was successful. Saul set him over the fighting men. The people and Saul liked that arrangement.

6When David came back from killing the Philistine, the women came out of the towns, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, celebration, and musical instruments. 7They sang as they played,

“Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands.”

8It made Saul mad. “They’ve attributed ten thousands to David, but thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?” 9He was suspicious of David after that. 	1 Sam 18:1-9

10The next day a tormenting spirit from God came powerfully over Saul, and he raved in the house while David was playing the harp as usual. Saul had a spear in his hand 11and threw it, thinking he’d pin David to the wall, but he dodged him twice. 12Saul was afraid of him, because the LORD was with him, but he’d left Saul. 13So Saul put him out away from him and appointed him as commander of a thousand.  David came and went with the people. [14-15] 16All Israel and Judah loved him.

David Marries Saul’s Daughter

17Then Saul told David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I’ll give her to you as a wife. Just be brave for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” Saul was thinking, “I won’t be against him; the Philistines will.” 18David said, “Who am I and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” 19At the time she would have been given to David, she was given to Adrie of Meholah.   	1 Sam 18:10-19

20Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David. They told Saul, and he liked that. 21He thought, “I’ll give her to him as a snare. The Philistines will oppose him.” Saul told David a second time, “You can be my son-in-law today.” 22He told his men, “Tell David privately, ‘The king likes you, and we do too. Go ahead and become his son-in-law.’” 23When Saul’s men told David that privately, he said, “Does it seem trivial to you to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m a poor man with no reputation.” 24Saul’s men reported what David said. 25Saul said, “Tell him the only dowry I want is 100 Philistine foreskins to avenge me of my enemies.” Saul thought he’d get David killed by the Philistines. 26When his men told David, he was glad to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline, 27David along with his men went and killed 200 Philistines and brought their foreskins to the king. So Saul gave him Michal. 28But when Saul saw that the LORD was with him and all Israel loved him, 29he was more afraid of him and became his constant enemy.

30The commanders of the Philistines kept attacking. As often as they did, David had more success than any other officer Saul had; so he was greatly respected.	 1 Sam 18:20-30

Saul Tries to Kill David

19:1Saul told Jonathan and his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan really delighted in David. 2He told David,

“My father is trying to get you killed. Be on guard in the morning. Hide in a private place. 3I’ll go out and stand beside him in the field where you are and talk about you. If I find out anything out, I’ll tell you.”

4Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul,

“Don’t sin against David. He hasn’t sinned against you; what he’s done has benefited you. 5He took his life in his hands and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and were happy. Why sin against innocent blood by putting him to death?”

6Saul listened and swore, “As surely the LORD lives, I won’t do it.”

7Then Jonathan called David and told him. He brought David to Saul, and he was with him like before.

8When war arose again, David went out and massacred the Philistines. They fled from him. 	1 Sam 19:1-8

9A tormenting spirit from the LORD came on Saul as he was sitting at home with his spear in hand. David was playing his harp. 10Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he dodged and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped that night.

11Saul sent troops to David’s house to watch him and put him to death in the morning. But David’s wife Michal told him, “If you don’t save your life tonight, you’ll be killed tomorrow.” 12She let David down through the window, and he got away. 13She took the household idol and laid it on the bed; she put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head and covered it with blankets. 14When Saul sent troops arrived, she said, “He’s sick.” 15Saul sent troops back, saying, “Bring him to me on his bed so I can put him to death.” 16When they went in, the household idol was on the bed with the pillow of goats’ hair under its head. 17Saul asked Michal, “Why did you lie to me and let my enemy escape?” Michal said, “He told me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”	1 Sam 19:9-17

18David escaped to Samuel at Ramah and told him what Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went to stay in Naioth. 19Saul heard that David was at Naioth in Ramah. 20He sent troops to take him, but when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on them and they prophesied too. 21When Saul learned about it, he sent some other troops, and they prophesied. He sent troops a third time, and they prophesied. 22Then Saul went to Ramah himself. He came to the big well in Secu and asked where Samuel and David were. One person said, “They’re at Naioth in Ramah.” 23He went on to Naioth, and the Spirit of God came on him. As he went, he kept prophesied till he got to Naioth. 24He, too, took off his clothes and prophesied in Samuel’s presence; he lay naked all day and all night. That’s why people say, “Is Saul among the prophets too?”	1 Sam 19:18-24

Jonathan Warns David

20:1Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan, “What have I done? What am I guilty of? What sin did I commit to make your father try to kill me?”

2He said,

“Far from it! You’re not going to die. My father doesn’t do anything big or small without letting me know. Why would he keep that from me? It’s not so.”

3But David answered,

“Your father knows we’re friends and thinks, ‘Don’t let Jonathan find this out so it won’t grieve him.’ But as sure as the LORD lives and you live, there’s just a step between me and death.”

4Jonathan said, “I’ll do for you whatever you say.” 	1 Sam 20:1-4

5David said,

“Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should sit at table with the king, but let me go so I can hide in the field till the evening of the third day. 6If he misses me, say, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to run to Bethlehem, his town; there’s a yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’ 7If he says, ‘Good!’ it’ll be well with me. But if he’s angry, then know that he intends to do something bad. 8Deal graciously with me; you’ve brought me into a sacred pact with you. But if I’ve done anything wrong, kill me yourself. Why take me to your father?”

9Jonathan said, “I’d never do that! If I knew that he’s determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”

10David asked, “How will I know if your father is angry?” 	1 Sam 20:5-10

11Jonathan said, “Let’s go out to the field.”

12Jonathan told David,

“The LORD God of Israel is witness! When I’ve sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day, if he’s well disposed toward you, won’t I send and let you know? 13But if he wants to harm you, the LORD do so to me and more if I don’t let you know so you can get away. The LORD be with you as he’s been with my father. 14If I’m still alive, show me the LORD’s enduring love so I won’t die. 15Don’t remove your loyalty from my house permanently. When the LORD gets rid of every enemy of yours, 16don’t remove my name from your house. May the LORD take vengeance on your enemies.” 	 1 Sam 20:11-16

17Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.

18Then Jonathan told him,

“Tomorrow is a new moon. He’ll miss you because your seat will be empty. 19On the third day, he’ll miss you for sure. Then go to where you hid when the matter was in hand and stay beside that rock pile over there. 20I’ll shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I was shooting at a target. 21I’ll send the boy, and say, ‘Go find the arrows.’ If I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then come because, as sure as the LORD lives, it’s safe. 22But if I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on past you,’ then go, because the LORD has sent you away. 23On the promises we’ve made, the LORD stands with you and me permanently.”	1 Sam 20:17-23

24David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat. 25He sat by the wall as usual. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David’s place was empty.

26Saul didn’t say anything that day because he thought, “Something’s happened. He’s not clean; surely that’s it.” 27But the second day, the day after the new moon, David’s place was empty. Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal yesterday or today?”

1 Sam 20:24-27

28Jonathan answered him,

“David earnestly asked me to let him go to Bethlehem. 29He said, ‘Our family is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother insisted that I be there. If I’m pleasing to you, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That’s why he’s not at the king’s table.”

30Saul’s anger flared at Jonathan,

“You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, don’t I know you’ve chosen Jesse’s son to your own shame and the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 31As long as he’s alive, you and your kingdom will neither one be secure. Send and bring him to me. He has to die.”

32Then Jonathan answered Saul, “Why put him to death? What’s he done?”

33Saul threw his spear at him. So Jonathan knew he was determined to kill David. 34Jonathan got up from the table mad and didn’t eat anything the second day of the month because he grieved for David. His father had put him down. 	 1 Sam 20:28-34

35The next morning, Jonathan and a boy went out to the field to the appointment with David. 36He told the boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow past him. 37When the boy came to where Jonathan had shot the arrow, he called after the boy, “Isn’t the arrow on past you?” 38Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry.” So he gathered up the arrows and came back to him. 39But he didn’t know anything; only Jonathan and David knew. 40Jonathan gave the boy his weapons and told him to take them into town. 41As soon as he’d gone, David got up from beside the rock pile and fell on his face and bowed three times. They kissed one another and cried till David composed himself. 42Then Jonathan said,

“Goodbye. We’ve sworn loyalty to one another in the LORD’s name, ‘He will always be with you and me, with my descendants and yours.’”

He got up and left, and Jonathan went into town.	  1 Sam 20:35-42

David and the Bread of the Presence

21:1Then David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. He came cringing to meet David, “Why are you by yourself?”

2David told Ahimelech, “The king commissioned me with a matter, ‘Don’t let anybody know about it. I’ve directed my young men where to meet me later.’ 3What do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.”

4The priest answered him, “There’s no ordinary bread here; there’s consecrated bread if the young men have not been with women.”

5David answered,

“Women have certainly not been with us; that’s always the case on an expedition. The young men are holy even on an ordinary journey, much less today.”

6The priest gave him the Bread of the Presence, which is removed from the LORD’s presence and replaced with fresh bread the same day. 	1 Sam 21:1-6

7Saul’s chief shepherd was there that day, detained in the LORD’s presence: Doeg the Edomite.

8David asked Ahimelech, “Is there a spear or sword here? I didn’t bring either; the king’s matter was urgent.”

9The priest said,

“The sword of Goliath that you killed in the Valley of Elah is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to, take that. It’s the only one here.”

David said, “There’s none like that one. Let me have it.”	 1 Sam 21:7-9

10David fled that day from Saul to Achish, king of Gath. 11His officers asked him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Didn’t they sing about him in dances.

“Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands!’?”

2David took those comments to heart and was afraid of Achish. 13So he acted like he was crazy. He made marks on the doors of the gate, and let spit run down his beard. 14Achish told his men, “You can tell the man’s crazy. Why did you bring him to me? 15Am I short on crazy people? Will he come into my house?” 	1 Sam 21:10-15

David at the Cave of Adullam

22:1David left and got to the cave near Adullam. When his brothers and father’s family heard, they came down. 2Everybody in distress, in debt, or disheartened gathered to him till became the captain of about 400 men.

3He went from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king, “Please let my parents stay with you till I know what God will do for me.” 4He left them with the king; they stayed with him the whole time David was in the fortress. 5The prophet Gad told David, “Don’t stay in the fortress. Go to Judah.” So David went to the Forest of Hereth.	 1 Sam 22:1-5

David at the Cave of Adullam

6Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the hill with spear in hand and his officers standing about him. 7He told them,

“Listen, you Benjamites. Will Jesse’s son give you fields and vineyards? Will he make you commanders of thousands and hundreds 8that you’ve plotted against me? Nobody lets me know when my son teams up with Jesse’s son. None of you sympathize with me or let me know that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, like now.” 	1 Sam 22:6-8

9Doeg, who was standing by Saul’s servants, said, “I saw Jesse’s son going to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub. 10He inquired from the LORD for him, and gave him provisions and Goliath’s sword.”

11The king sent for Ahimelech the priest and all his father’s family, the priests at Nob. They came to him.

12Saul said, “Son of Ahitub, 13why have you and Jesse’s son plotted against me by giving him bread and a sword, and inquiring from God for him, so that he has risen against me to lie in wait today?”

14Ahimelech answered,

“Who among your servants is as faithful as David, your son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, honored in your family? 15Is today the first time I’ve asked God for him? No! You need not accuse me or my father’s family of anything. I didn’t know anything about this.” 	1 Sam 22:9-15

16The king said, “You and your father’s family have to die.” 17He told the guard standing around him, “Kill the LORD’s priests; their hand is with David. They knew he fled and didn’t let me know.”

But his men wouldn’t do it. 18So he told Doeg to fall on them. He killed 85 men that day who wore the linen ephod. 19He put Nob, the city of priests, to the sword—men and women, children and infants, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.

20But one of Ahimelech’s sons named Abiathar escaped to David 21and told him what Saul had done to the LORD’s priests. 22David said,

“The day Doeg was there I figured he’d tell Saul. I’ve occasioned the death of everybody in your father’s family. 23Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The one that wants to kill you wants to kill me. You’ll be safe here.” 	1 Sam 22:16-23

David Saves the Town of Keilah

23:1People told David, “The Philistines are attacking Keilah and robbing the threshing floors.”

2David asked the LORD, “Should I attack these Philistines?”

“Yes, save Keilah.”

3But David’s men said, “We’re afraid here in Judah. How much more at Keilah against the Philistines!”

4David asked the LORD again.

“Go down to Keilah. I’ll deliver the Philistines to you.” 5David and his men went down and fought them, brought away their livestock, and killed a great number of them. So he delivered the people in Keilah.	 1 Sam 23:1-5

6When Abiathar fled to David at Keilah, he brought an ephod with him. 7Saul heard that David had gone there and said, “God has delivered him to me. He has shut himself in by entering a town with gates and bars.” 8Saul called the people to war, to go down to Keilah and lay siege to David and his men. 9David found out about his plot and told Abiathar to bring him the ephod.

10David said,

“LORD God of Israel, I’ve heard that Saul intends to come to destroy the town because of me. 11Please tell me if he’ll come down.”

“He will.”

12“Will the men in Keilah surrender me and my men to him.”

“Yes.” 	1 Sam 23:6-12

13David and his 600 men left and went wherever they could. When Saul found out he’d escaped from Keilah, he gave up the chase. 14David stayed in the strongholds and in the hill country in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul looked for him every day, but God didn’t deliver David to him.

Saul Pursues David

15David learned that Saul had come out to try to kill him while he was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 16Jonathan went to David and encouraged him in God: 17“Don’t worry; my father won’t find you. He knows you’ll be king, and I’ll be next to you.” 18They made a pact in the LORD’s presence. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.	1 Sam 23:13-18

19People came up from Ziph to Saul at Gibeah and said,

“Isn’t David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the Hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? 20Come down and do whatever you want to. We’ll surrender him to you.”

21Saul said,

“The LORD bless you for having mercy on me. 22Go make sure where his haunt is and who has seen him there. I’m told he’s awfully cunning. 23Learn where his hiding places are, come back with exact information, and I’ll go with you. If he’s in the land, I’ll search him out among the thousands in Judah.”

24They went to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men had moved into the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 25When Saul and his men went to look for him, people had told David, and he’d gone down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. 26Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. He was hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were surrounding him and his men to capture them. 27But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quick; the Philistines are raiding the land.” 28Saul quit chasing David and went to meet the Philistines. So they called the place The Rock of Escape [Sela Hammachleqot]. 29David went and stayed in the strongholds at En-gedi. 	Sam 23:19-29

David Spares Sual’s Life

24:1When Saul came back from chasing the Philistines, he heard that David was in the Wilderness of En-gedi. 2Saul took 3,000 chosen men from all over Israel and went to look for him and his men at the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 3He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave, and went in to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 4David’s men said, “This is the day the LORD told you he’d deliver your enemy to you.” David got up and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly. 5Afterward, his conscience bothered him over it. 6He told his men, “The LORD forbid that I should reach out against his anointed.” 7He dissuaded them with that comment and didn’t let them attack Saul. Saul got up and left the cave. 	1 Sam 24:1-7

8Afterward David went out and called, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground and prostrated himself. 9He said,

“Why listen to people that say I’m trying to harm you? 10You’ve seen that the LORD delivered you to me today. Some said to kill you, but I took pity on you and wouldn’t reach out against the LORD’s anointed. 11Now, father, look at the hem of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off its edge and didn’t kill you, know that I’m not leading a rebellion. I haven’t sinned against you even though you’re lying in wait to kill me. 12The LORD decide between us. May he avenge me on you, but I won’t oppose you. 13As the ancient proverb says, ‘Sinfulness comes from the sinful.’ I won’t oppose you. 14What did you come out against? A dead dog? A single flea? 15Let the LORD decide between us. May he argue my case and deliver me from you.”

16When David finished, Saul said,

“Is that you, David my son? 17You’re better than I am. You’ve been good to me while I’ve been bad to you. 18You’ve declared that you’ve done good to me, that the LORD delivered me to you, but you didn’t kill me. 19If someone finds his enemy, will he let him get away? May the LORD reward you with good for what you’ve done today. 20I know you’ll be king, and the kingdom will be firmly under your rule. 21Swear to me by the LORD that you won’t kill my descendants or destroy my name from my father’s family.”

22David swore to him, and he went home. David and his men went up to the stronghold.

1 Sam 24:8-22

The Death of Samuel

25:1Samuel died and Israel gathered to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah.

David and Abigail

David went down to the Wilderness of Paran. 2aA man named Nabal in Maon had a business in Carmel. He was really rich with 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. (3His wife Abigail was intelligent and beautiful, but he was harsh and rude in his dealings, a descendant of Caleb.) 2bWhile he was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 4David heard about it in the open country. 5He sent ten young men, and told them,

“Go to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name. 6Say, ‘Have a long life, peace to you, your household, and everybody you have. 7I’ve heard you have shearers. Your shepherds have been with us, and we’ve not insulted them or taken anything from them the whole time they were in Carmel. 8Ask your young men and they’ll tell you. So be gracious to my young men; we’ve come on a festive day. Whatever you have on hand please give to them and to me.’” 	1 Sam 25:1-8

9When David’s young men came, they told Nabal everything in David’s name, and waited. 10But Nabal answered them,

“Who’s David? Who’s Jesse’s son? Lots of servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 11Am I supposed to take my bread, water, and meat that I’ve butchered for my shearers, and give it to men I don’t know?”

12David’s young men retraced their steps and told him what Nabal said. 13David told them to put on their swords. David put on his sword, and about 400 men went up behind him while 200 stayed with the baggage. 	1 Sam 25:9-13

14One of the young men told Abigail,

“David sent messengers from the countryside to greet our master, and he scorned them. 15Yet the men were good to us. They didn’t insult us or take anything as we went around with them on the open range. 16They were a wall to us day and night the whole time we tended sheep together. 17Think what you should do; David’s planning to do something bad to our master and his household. Nabal is such a worthless fellow nobody can talk to him.”

1 Sam 25:14-17

18Abigail hurried and loaded donkeys with 200 loaves of bread, 2 wineskins of wine, 5 sheep already fixed, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. 19She told her young men, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow.” She didn’t tell her husband. 20As she was riding her donkey down under cover of the mountain, she met David and his men. 21David had said,

“For nothing I’ve guarded everything this man has on the open range so that he hasn’t missed anything. He’s paid me bad for good. 22God do so to me and more if by morning I leave him one male alive.”	  1 Sam 25:18-22

23-24When Abigail saw him, she hurried and dismounted. She fell on her face at his feet, bowed to the ground, and said,

“Put the blame on me, my lord. Please let me speak to you. 25Don’t pay any attention to this worthless fellow; he’s like his name Nabal, ‘a foolish man.’ I didn’t see the young men you sent. 26As sure as the LORD lives and you live, since he’s restrained you from shedding blood to avenge yourself, may your enemies be like Nabal. 27Give this gift to the young men. 28Please forgive my sin. The LORD will certainly make an enduring dynasty for you because you’re fighting his battles. There won’t be anything bad in you your whole life. 29If anybody attacks you, you’ll be in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God. He’ll throw out the lives of your enemies as from the cup in a sling. 30When he keeps his promise and appoints you ruler over Israel, 31what’s happened won’t cause you grief for having shed blood unnecessarily to avenge yourself. When the LORD deals well with you, remember me.”     	  1 Sam 25:23-31

32David told Abigail,

“Bless the LORD God of Israel, who sent you. 33Bless you for your discretion. You’ve kept me from shedding blood to avenge myself. 34Nevertheless, as sure as the LORD lives, who kept me from harming you, if you hadn’t come so soon, I wouldn’t have left Nabal one male by morning.”

35David accepted what she’d brought. “Go home on good terms. I’ve done what you asked.”	  1 Sam 25:32-35

36She went to Nabal. He was holding a feast in his house, celebrating like a king. He was half drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything till morning. 37When he’d sobered up, she told him everything. His heart died; he became like a stone. 38Some ten days later, the LORD struck him, and he died.

39When David heard Nabal was dead, he said,

“Bless the LORD, who pleaded the cause of his insult to me, and kept me from doing something bad. The LORD has brought his wrongdoing back on him.”

Then David sent a proposal to Abigail to be his wife. 40When his servants came to her at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.” 41She got up and bowed to the ground, “I’ll wash his servants’ feet.” 42She got up quick and rode a donkey with her five maids attending her. She followed David’s messengers and became his wife. 43David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel; they both became his wives. 44Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish from Gallim. 	1 Sam 25:36-44

David Spares Saul’s Life Again

26:1The people of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Isn’t David hiding on the Hill of Hachilah east of Jeshimon?” 2Saul went down to the Wilderness of Ziph with 3,000 chosen men to look for him. 3He camped on the Hill of Hachilah beside the road east of Jeshimon. David was staying in the open country. When he saw that Saul had come after him, 4he sent out spies to make sure that Saul was coming. 5He went to where Saul and his men had camped and saw where he lay beside Abner son of Ner, his general. The army was asleep around him.

6David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai said, “I’ll go.” 7They went down at night. Saul was sleeping inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. 	1 Sam 26:1-7

8Abishai told David, “God has delivered your enemy to you. Let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke. I won’t strike him a second time.”

9But David said,

“Don’t destroy him. Who can kill the LORD’s anointed and not be guilty? 10As sure as the LORD lives, he’ll strike him, or he’ll die, or he’ll go down in battle. 11The LORD forbid that I should kill him. Take the spear by his head and the jug of water, and let’s go.”

12David left with the spear and jug. Nobody saw or knew anything. Nobody woke up. A sound sleep from the LORD had fallen on them all.	1 Sam 26:8-12

13David crossed back over to the other side and stood on top of the hill a good way off. 14He shouted to the army and to Abner, “Won’t you answer, Abner?”

Abner said, “Who are you, shouting to the king?”

15David asked him,

“Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why not protect the king? Someone came over to destroy him. 16What you’ve done isn’t good. As sure as the LORD lives, you all need to die; you didn’t protect the LORD’s anointed. See the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head.” 	1 Sam 26:13-16

17Saul recognized David’s voice, “Is that you, my son?”

David said,

“It’s me, my lord the king. 18Why are you chasing me? What have I done? 19If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it’s people, they’re accursed by the LORD, because they’ve driven me out from the LORD’s inheritance and told me to go serve other gods. 20Don’t let my blood fall to the ground away from the LORD’s presence. You’ve come out to look for a single flea, like somebody hunting a partridge in the hills.”

21Saul said, “I’ve sinned. Go on back home. I won’t try to harm you again because you’ve valued my life today. I’ve played the fool and made a serious mistake.”

22David answered,

“The king’s spear! Have one of the young men come and get it. 23The LORD will repay each man for his goodness and faithfulness. He delivered you to me, and I refused to reach out against you. 24As I highly valued your life today, so may the LORD highly value my life and deliver me from all distress.”

25Saul said, “You’re blessed, son. You’ll accomplish a lot and certainly end up winning.”

David went on his way, and Saul went home. 	1 Sam 26:17-25

David Flees to the Philistines

27:1David said to himself, “Someday Saul is going to kill me. All I can do is escape to the Philistines. He’ll get tired of looking for me in Israel, and I’ll get away from him.” 2David and his 600 men crossed over to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 3They lived with Achish, each with his family and David with his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow. 4Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, so he quit looking for him.

5Then David told Achish, “If I’m pleasing to you, have them give me a place in a town out in the country. Why should I live in the royal city with you?” 6Achish gave him Ziklag. It still belongs to Judah’s kings. 7He lived among the Philistines for a year and four months.

1 Sam 27:1-7

8David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; because they had lived in the land from ancient times, toward Shur all the way to Egypt. 9He attacked the land and didn’t leave a man or woman alive. He brought back to Achish the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing. 10Achish asked, “Where did you raid today?” David said, “In the Negev of Judah, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites.” 11David didn’t leave anyone alive to bring to Gath and said, “So they won’t say about us, ‘That’s been David’s practice ever since he lived among the Philistines.’” 12Achish believed David, “He has surely made himself repulsive to his people; he’ll serve me from now on.” 	1 Sam 27:8-12

Saul Consults the Medium at En-dor

28:1At that time, the Philistines gathered their armed camps to fight Israel. Achish told David, “You can be sure that you and your men will go out with me in the camp.”

2“All right, you’ll find out what I can do.”

“I’ll make you my bodyguard for life.”

3Samuel was dead, and Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, his own town. Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. 4The Philistines gathered and camped in Shunem, and Saul gathered Israel and camped at Gilboa. 5When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 6When he asked the LORD, he didn’t answer him by dreams, Urim, or prophets. 7Saul told his advisors, “Find a medium so I can go ask through her.” They told him, “There’s a woman in En-dor.”   	1 Sam 28:1-7

8Saul disguised himself in different clothes and went to her with two men at night and said, “Conjure up for me and bring up the one I name.”

9“Surely you know Saul has expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why lay a trap to get me killed?”

10Saul swore by the LORD, “As sure as the LORD lives, you won’t be punished.”

11“Who do you want me to bring up?”

“Samuel.”

12When she saw Samuel, she cried out, “Why have you misled me? You’re Saul.”

13“Don’t be afraid; what do you see?”

“A god coming out of the ground.”

14“What’s he look like?”

“An old man, wearing a robe.”

Saul knew it was Samuel and bowed to the ground in homage.	 1 Sam 28:8-14

15Samuel said, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”

“I’m greatly distressed. The Philistines are waging war against me. God has left me and doesn’t answer me anymore by prophets or dreams. I’ve called you to tell me what I should do.”

16“Why ask me since the LORD has become your adversary? 17He’s done what he said through me: he’s torn the kingdom from you and given it to David. 18As you didn’t carry out his fierce anger on Amalek, so he has done this to you today. 19He’ll deliver you and Israel’s army to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me!”	  1 Sam 28:15-19

20Saul fell headlong on the floor terrified. There wasn’t any strength in him; he hadn’t eaten anything all day and all night. 21The woman came and saw he was terrified. She said,

“I’ve done what you asked. I’ve taken my life in my hands and listened to you.  22Let me fix you some bread so you can have strength when you leave.”

23“I’ll don’t want anything.”

But she and his advisors kept urging him, so he gave in, got up off the floor, and sat on the bed.

24The woman had a grain-fed calf in the house. She hurried and butchered it, kneaded flour, and baked bread without yeast. 25She brought it to Saul and his men to eat. He got up and left.	  1 Sam 28:20-25

The Philistines Reject David

29:1The Philistines gathered their forces to Aphek while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 2The Philistine lords were moving forward by hundreds and thousands; David and his men were moving forward in the rear with Achish. 3The commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” Achish said, “Isn’t this David, Saul’s servant, that’s been with me these days, or years? I haven’t found a fault in him from the day he deserted to me till now.” 4But the commanders were mad,

“Make him go back to where you’ve assigned him. Don’t let him go down to battle with us and become our adversary during the fight. For how could he make himself acceptable to his lord? Wouldn’t it be with the heads of these men? 5Isn’t this David they sang about in the dances,

‘Saul has slain his thousands,

David his ten thousands!’?”	   1 Sam 29:1-5

6Achish called David,

“As sure as the LORD lives, you’ve been upright. Your conduct with me in the army is fine. I haven’t found anything bad in you since you came, but the other Philistine lords don’t want you here. 7Go back quietly so you won’t upset them.”

8David asked him, “What have I done? What have you found in me since I came to you, that I can’t go and fight my king’s enemies?”

9“You’re pleasing to me, like an angel of God, but the commanders have said you can’t go into battle with us. 10Get up early with your men and leave as soon as it gets daylight.”

11David and his men got up early to go back to the land of the Philistines. Then the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 	1 Sam 29:6-11

David’s Wives Are Captured

30:1When David and his men got home to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev, attacked Ziklag, and burned it. 2They took the women captive and everybody in it, big and small, but didn’t kill anybody. 3When David and his men got there, it had been burned, and their wives, sons, and daughters had been captured. 4They cried till they couldn’t cry anymore. 5David’s two wives had been taken, Ahinoam and Abigail. 6In addition, David was distressed because the people were talking about stoning him. They were bitter over losing their sons and daughters, but David took courage in the LORD his God.

7He told Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, to bring him the ephod. 8He asked the LORD, “Should I chase this band? Will I overtake them?”

“Yes, you’ll overtake them and rescue everyone.”

9He and his 600 men went to the Brook Besor, where the ones left behind remained. 10But David and 400 men pursued on. 200 stayed behind too exhausted to cross Brook Besor.

1 Sam 30:1-10

11They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David. They gave him bread and water, 12a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. He ate them and revived. He hadn’t eaten or drunk for three days. 13David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where are you from?”

“I’m a young man from Egypt, an Amalekite’s slave. My master left me behind when I got sick three days ago. 14We raided the Negev of the Cherethites that belongs to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag.”

15David said, “Will you bring me down to this band?”

He said, “Swear to me by God that you won’t kill me or turn me over to my master, and I’ll take you down to them.”	1 Sam 30:11-15

David Defeats the Amalekites

16When he’d taken him down; they found them spread out all over the ground eating and drinking and dancing because of the large amount of spoil they’d taken from the Philistines and Judah. 17David slaughtered them from twilight till evening the next day. Not a man escaped, except for 400 young men that fled on camels. 18He recovered everything the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives. 19Nothing was missing, big or little, sons or daughters. He brought it all back. 20He’d captured the sheep and cattle the people drove ahead of the other livestock. They said, “This is David’s spoil.”	 1 Sam 30:16-20

21David came to the 200 men at Brook Besor who were too exhausted to go with him. They went out to meet him and the people that were with him, and he greeted them. 22Then some ruffians among David’s men said, “They didn’t go with us. We’re not going to give them any of the spoil we’ve recovered. Every man can take his wife and children.”

23David said, “Brothers, don’t do that with what the LORD’s given us. He protected us and delivered to us the band that attacked us. 24Who’d listen to you on this? The one that guards the luggage gets the same share as the one that goes to battle.”

25He made it an ordinance in Israel ever since.	  1 Sam 30:21-25

26When David got to Ziklag, he sent some spoil to the elders in Judah, his friends, and said, “A gift from the spoils of the LORD’s enemies,” 27and to the people in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, Jattir, 28Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 29Racal, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, Kenites, 30Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 31Hebron—everywhere he and his men circulated. 	1 Sam 30:26-31

The Death of Saul

31:1The Philistines attacked Israel, and Israel fled and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malci-shua. 3The battle pressed Saul hard, and the archers seriously wounded him. 4He told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through so these uncircumcised Philistines won’t come and run me through and torture me.” But his armor bearer was afraid to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.  5When he saw that Saul was dead, he fell on his sword too and died with him. 6Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men that day. 7When the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and beyond the Jordan, saw that Israel had fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. The Philistines came and lived in them.

1 Sam 31:1-7

8The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa. 9They cut off his head, stripped off his weapons, and sent them all over Philistine territory to carry the good news to the temple of their idols and to the people. 10They put his weapons in the temple that held Ashtoreth’s images and fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 11When the people in Jabesh-gilead heard about it, 12brave men walked all night and took down the bodies of Saul and his sons. They went to Jabesh and burned them, 13buried their bones under the tamarisk tree, and fasted a week.	1 Sam 31:8-13

2 SAMUEL

David Learns of Saul’s Death

1:1After Saul died, David came back from massacring the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag. 2The third day, a man came from Saul’s camp with torn clothes and dust on his head. He prostrated himself to David.

3David said, “Where have you come from?”

“I’ve escaped from Israel’s camp.”

4“How did things go?”

“They’ve fled from the battle; many have fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”

5“How do you know?”

6“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and Saul was leaning on his spear. The chariots and cavalry were coming up on him. 7When he looked back, he called out to me, 8‘Who are you?’

‘I’m an Amalekite.’

9He said, ‘Please finish me off. I’m in agony; my life lingers on.’

10“So I stood beside him and killed him. I knew he couldn’t live. I took the crown off his head and the armband from his arm and brought them to you.”

2 Sam 1:1-10

11David and his men tore their clothes. 12They mourned and cried and fasted till evening for Saul, Jonathan, the LORD’s people, and Israel, because they’d fallen by the sword.

13David asked the young man, “Where are you from?”

“I’m the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”

14David said, “How is it you weren’t afraid to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”

15He called one of the young men, “Cut him down.”

So he struck him.

16David told him, “Your blood is on your own head. You testified against yourself that you killed the LORD’s anointed.” 17David chanted this dirge over Saul and Jonathan. 18He told them to teach Judah The Song of the Bow; The Book of Jashar records it:   	2 Sam 1:11-18

David’s Lament for Saul and Jonathan

19“Your beauty, Israel, is slain on your high places!

How the strong have fallen!

20Don’t tell it in Gath

or announce it in the streets of Ashkelon;

the Philistines would celebrate;

the uncircumcised would be elated.

21Mountains of Gilboa,

may there be no dew or rain on you

or fields to produce offerings

because the shield of strong men was defiled there,

Saul’s shield, not anointed with oil.

22From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong,

Jonathan’s bow didn’t retreat;

Saul’s sword didn’t come back empty. 	2 Sam 1:19-22

23Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in life,

died together.

They were faster than eagles,

stronger than lions.

24Young women of Israel, mourn for Saul,

who dressed you luxuriously in scarlet,

who put gold sequins on your clothes.

25How the strong have fallen in battle!

Jonathan, slain on your high places.

26I’m distressed over you, Jonathan my brother;

you were so pleasant to me.

Your love for me was more wonderful

than the love of women.

27How the powerful have fallen,

and the weapons of war have perished!”	 2 Sam 1:23-27

David Anointed King of Judah

2:1Afterwards David asked the LORD, “Should I go up to one of the towns in Judah?”

“Go on up.”

“Where?”

“To Hebron.”

2David and his two wives went there. 3He brought his men up with their families, and they lived in towns around Hebron. 4Then the people in Judah came and anointed him king over Judah.

They told him, “The men in Jabesh-gilead have buried Saul.”

5David sent them messengers,

“The LORD bless you; you’ve been kind to Saul your lord and buried him. 6May the LORD show you enduring love and truth. I’ll also show you goodness for doing that. 7Be strong and brave. Your lord is dead, and Judah has anointed me king.”	 2 Sam 2:1-7

War Between Israel and Judah

8But Abner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, to Mahanaim, 9and made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin—all Israel. 10Ish-bosheth was 40 and ruled for 2 years, but Judah followed David. 11For 7½ years he ruled Judah from Hebron.

12Abner went from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the troops of Ish-bosheth. 13Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s troops went to meet them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat on opposite sides of the pool. 14Abner told Joab, “Let’s have the young men ‘hold a contest.’”

Joab said, “Let them get up.”

15They got up and went over by count, 12 for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth and 12 for David’s troops. 16Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword in the other’s side, so they fell down together. So the place was called Helkath-hazzurim, in Gibeon. 17That day the battle became intense. David’s forces beat Abner and the men of Israel.	2 Sam 2:8-17

18Zeruiah’s three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast as a gazelle in the field. 19He kept chasing Abner and wouldn’t turn aside.

20Abner glanced back, “Is that you, Asahel?”

“Yes.”

21“Turn aside and grab one of the young men and take his spoil.”

But Asahel wouldn’t do it.

22Abner repeated, “Turn aside. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face your brother Joab?”

23But he wouldn’t do it. So Abner jabbed him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and it came out of his back. He fell there and died. Everybody that came to where he died stood still.	2 Sam 2:18-23

24But Joab and Abishai kept chasing Abner. As the sun was going down, they came to the Hill of Ammah by Giah by way of the Wilderness of Gibeon. 25The Benjamites gathered behind Abner, became one band, and stood on a hilltop.

26He called to Joab,

“Will the sword devour forever? Don’t you know it will be bitter in the end? How long will you hold back from telling the people to quit chasing their brothers?”

27Joab said,

“As God lives, if you hadn’t said something, the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother.”

28Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the people quit chasing Israel and fighting. 29Abner and his men went through the Arabah all night, crossed the Jordan, and walked all morning to Mahanaim.

30Joab came back from chasing Abner. When he’d gathered the people, 19 of David’s troops besides Asahel were missing. 31But David’s troops had struck down 360 of Benjamin and Abner’s men. 32They picked up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night till dawn in Hebron.	2 Sam 2:24-32

3:1A long war had gone on between Saul and David. David had grown stronger; Saul had grown weaker.

2David had six sons in Hebron: Amnon his oldest by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, 3Chileab second by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel; Absalom third by Maacah daughter of Tahmai, king of Geshur; 4 Adonijah fourth by Haggith, Shephatiah fifth by Abital, 5and Ithream sixth by Eglah.

Abner Joins David

6During the war between Saul and David, Abner was making himself stronger in Saul’s house. 7Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth said, “Why have you had relations with my father’s concubine?” 8That made Abner mad,

“Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? I’ve been kind to your father’s family, to his brothers and friends, and haven’t delivered you to David. Yet you charge me with guilt over this woman. 9God do so to me and more if, since the LORD has sworn to David, I don’t 10transfer the kingdom from Saul to David to rule Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.”

11He couldn’t talk to Abner anymore; he was afraid of him. 	2 Sam 3:1-11

12Abner sent messengers to David, “Who does the land belong to? Make a treaty with me, and I’ll bring Israel over to you.”

13He said, “Okay! I’ll make a treaty with you, but I demand one thing: you won’t see me unless you bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.” 14David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, “Give me my wife Michal that I was engaged to for 100 Philistine foreskins.” 15Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 16But her husband went crying as he followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said, “Go back”; so he did.

17Abner contacted the elders in Israel,

“Before, you were looking for David to be your king. 18Now do it! The LORD has said, ‘By my servant David I’ll save my people from the Philistines and their other enemies.’”

19Abner talked to the Benjamites and went to tell David in Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and the House of Benjamin.	2 Sam 3:12-19

20He and 20 men came to David in Hebron, and David held a feast for them. 21Abner said, “Let me gather Israel to you so you’ll rule everything you desire.” David sent him away on good terms.

Joab Murders Abner

22Some of David’s troops and Joab came from a raid and brought lots of spoil, but Abner wasn’t with David in Hebron, because he’d sent him away on good terms. 23When Joab and the part of the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner came to the king, and he sent him away on good terms.”

24Joab came to the king and said,

“What have you done? Abner came to you. Why send him away already? 25You ought to know he came to deceive you and to find out about your routine and what you’re doing.”

26When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well at Sirah without David knowing it. 27When Abner came back to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to talk privately. He struck Abner in the stomach, and he died because he’d killed Joab’s brother Asahel. 28When David heard it, he said,

“In the LORD’s presence, my kingdom and I are not guilty of Abner’s blood. 29May that fall on Joab and his father’s family. May every one of them have running sores or leprosy, use crutches, die by the sword, or go hungry.”

30Joab and Abishai killed Abner because he’d killed their brother Asahel in the skirmish at Gibeon.	 2 Sam 3:20-30

31David told Joab and everybody there, “Tear your clothes and put on burlap; lament over Abner.” King David walked behind the bier. 32They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wailed at his grave and the people cried. 33He chanted a lament for Abner,

“Should Abner die like a fool?

34Your hands were not bound or your feet in stocks;

you’ve been murdered by wicked men.”

The people cried for him again. 35They came to persuade David to eat while it was still daylight, but David vowed, “God do so to me and more if I taste anything before sunset.” 36The people noticed, and it pleased them like everything he did. 37They and all Israel understood that it hadn’t been the king’s idea to kill Abner. 38He told his officials,

“Don’t you know that a prince, a great man, has fallen in Israel today? 39Even though I’m anointed as king, these sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deed!”   	2 Sam 3:31-39

Ish-Bosheth Murdered

4:1When Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and Israel lost courage too. 2Saul’s son had two men that were commanding raiding bands: Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon, a Benjamite from Beeroth (considered part of Benjamin). 3The people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and still live there as foreigners.

4Jonathan had a son Mephibosheth that was lame in both feet. He was five when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried, he fell and became lame.	2 Sam 4:1-4

5Baanah and Rechab left and arrived at Ish-bosheth’s house about noon while he was resting. 6LXX┌The doorkeeper had been cleaning wheat, but she got drowsy and nodded off. Rechab and Baanah slipped in,┐ 7struck him and killed him in bed, and cut off his head. They took his head and went by way of the Arabah all night. 8They brought it to David in Hebron, “Here’s the head of Ish-bosheth, who was trying to kill you. The LORD has avenged you on Saul and his offspring today.” 9But David answered them,

“As sure as the LORD lives who has redeemed me from every adversity, 10when a man told me Saul was dead and thought he was bringing me good news, I seized him and executed him at Ziklag. That’s the reward I gave him for his news! 11How much more when bad men kill a good man in his own house in bed! Won’t I require his blood from you now and destroy you from the earth?”

12David commanded his young men to kill them. They cut off their hands and feet, and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they buried Ish-bosheth’s head in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.

2 Sam 4:5-12

David Becomes King of Israel

5:1All the tribes came to David in Hebron and said,

“We’re your flesh and bones. 2When Saul was king, you were the one that led Israel out and back. The LORD told you you’d shepherd his people.”

3Israel’s elders came, and King David made a treaty with them in the LORD’s presence. They anointed him king over Israel. 4David was 30 and ruled for 40 years. 5He ruled Judah for 7½ years in Hebron and ruled Judah and Israel for 33 years in Jerusalem.

David Conquers Jerusalem

6The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites. They told David.

“You won’t get in here. The blind and lame will stop you.” They thought he couldn’t do it, 7but he captured the Zion fortress, The City of David. 8He said that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, reach ‘the lame and blind’ [that David hated] through the water tunnel.” That’s why people say, “‘The blind and lame’ won’t get into the house.” 9David lived in the fortress and named it The City of David [Ir-David]. He built all around from the Millo inward. 10He kept getting greater because the LORD God of Hosts was with him. 	2 Sam 5:1-10

11Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons to build him a palace. 12He realized that the LORD had established him as king and that he’d honored his kingdom for Israel’s sake.

13Meantime, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and had more sons and daughters. 14The ones born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 15Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 16Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.

2 Sam 5:11-16

David Defeats the Philistines

17When the Philistines heard they’d anointed David king over Israel, they went up to look for him.  He heard about it and went down to the fortress. 18The Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19David asked the LORD, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?”

“Yes.”

20He went to Baal-perazim and defeated them, “’The LORD has broken through’ my enemies like a flash flood”; so he named the place Baal-perazim. 21The Philistines abandoned their idols; David and his men carried them away.

22The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23When David asked the LORD, he said,

“Don’t go up directly. Circle around behind them and come at them by the balsam trees. 24When you hear marching in the balsam treetops, act immediately. I will have gone out ahead of you to strike them.”

25David did that and struck them down from Geba to Gezer.	 2 Sam 5:17-25

The Ark Brought to Jerusalem

6:1David gathered elite troops from Israel again, 30,000. 2He and the troops went to Baale-judah to bring up God’s Ark called The Name: the LORD of Hosts Enthroned Above the Cherubs. 3They placed the Ark on a new cart to bring it from Abinadab’s house that was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, 4were bringing the Ark on the cart; Ahio was walking ahead of it. 5Meanwhile, David and the House of Israel were celebrating enthusiastically in the LORD’s presence with all kinds of instruments made out of fir: lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.

6But when they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah grabbed the Ark because the oxen nearly upset it. 7The LORD lashed out and struck him down for his disrespect. He died there by the Ark. 8David was mad because the LORD had “lashed out against Uzzah.” The place is still called Perez-uzzah. 9David was afraid of the LORD that day, “How can the Ark come to me?” 10He wasn’t willing to take it to The City of David. He took it aside to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. 11It stayed there three months, and the LORD blessed him and his family.         2 Sam 6:1-11

12King David heard that the LORD had blessed Obed-edom’s house and everything he had because of the Ark, so he brought it to The City of David with celebration. 13When the ones carrying the Ark had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a grain-fed calf. 14He was dancing in the LORD’s presence with all his energy, wearing a linen ephod. 15He and the House of Israel brought up the Ark with shouting and the sound of rams’ horns. 16As it came into the city, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window and saw him leaping and dancing, and she despised him. 17They brought the Ark and set it in its place inside the tent David pitched for it, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 18When he’d finished offering them, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 19He passed out a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to every man and woman in the crowd. Then everybody went home.

2 Sam 6:12-19

20When David went back to bless his household, Michal came out,

“How Israel’s king distinguished himself today, exposing himself in front of his servant girls like a shameless fool!”

21He told her,

“I celebrated in front of the LORD, who chose me over your father and his family, and appointed me to rule his people. 22I’ll be even less dignified than this and humble in my own eyes, but I’ll be respected by the servant girls you’ve mentioned.”

23Michal didn’t have any children the rest of her life.	 2 Sam 6:20-23

God’s Promise to David

7:1The king was living in his palace, and the LORD had given him rest from his enemies. 2He told Nathan the prophet, “I live in a cedar palace, but God’s Ark sits in tent curtains.”

3Nathan said, “Do everything you’re thinking; the LORD’s with you.”

4But that night a message from the LORD came to him,

5“Go tell my servant David, ‘The LORD says, “Are you the one that should build me a temple? 6I haven’t lived in a temple since I brought Israel out of Egypt. I’ve moved around in a tent, a Tabernacle.  7Wherever I’ve gone with Israel, did I ever say to any judge that I commanded to shepherd my people, ‘Why haven’t you built me a cedar temple?’”’

8“Tell David, ‘I took you out of the pasture from following sheep, to make you ruler over Israel. 9I’ve been with you wherever you’ve gone and got rid of your enemies. I’ll make you as famous as anyone that’s ever lived in the world. 10I’ll appoint a place to plant my people so they can live there undisturbed, and sinful people won’t oppress them anymore. 11Like when I appointed judges over them, I’ll give you rest from your enemies.’

“The LORD also says he’ll make a dynasty from you. 12-13‘When you die, I’ll raise up your descendant and establish his kingdom permanently.  13He’ll build me a temple. 14I’ll be his father, and he’ll be my son. When he sins, I’ll correct him with rods like people do. 15But my enduring love won’t leave him like it did Saul, that I removed before you. 16Your family and kingdom will endure. I’ll establish your dynasty permanently.’”	 2 Sam 7:1-16

17Nathan told David those things about the vision.

God’s Promise to David

18David went in and sat in the LORD’s presence,

“Who am I, Lord GOD, and what’s my family that you’ve brought me this far? 19Yet it wasn’t a great thing to you, because you’ve also talked about my family far into the future according to human custom. 20What more can I tell you? You know me, Lord GOD! 21For your word and according to your heart, you’ve shown how great you are in letting me know. 22That’s why you’re great. There’s nobody like you, no God besides you that we’ve heard of. 23What nation is like Israel that you went to redeem for yourself, to make a name for yourself, to do a great thing for yourself and awesome things for your land, in front of the people you’ve redeemed from Egypt, from nations and their gods? 24You’ve established your people forever and become their God. 25So confirm forever what you’ve said about me and my family. Do it 26so you can be honored forever by saying, ‘The LORD of Hosts is Israel’s God.’ 27You’ve revealed to me that you’ll build me into a dynasty; so I’ve found the courage to offer this prayer.  28You’re God, your words are true, your promise is good. 29Bless my family so it can continue permanently like you’ve said.”	 2 Sam 7:17-29

David’s Victories

8:1After that, David defeated the Philistines and took Methegammah.

2He defeated Moab and counted them off in lines and made them lie down on the ground. Two lines he counted off to be put to death, and one line he let live. The Moabites served him and brought tribute.

3David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the Euphrates River. 4He took 1,700 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. He hamstrung the chariot horses but left enough for 100 chariots.

5When the Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them 6and put garrisons around Damascus, the Aramean capital. The Arameans served him and paid tribute money. 7The gold shields that Hadadezer’s officers carried, he took to Jerusalem. 8He took a large store of bronze from Betah and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer.

2 Sam 8:1-8

9Toi/Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s whole army. 10He sent his son Joram to greet him and congratulate him. Hadadezer had fought several wars with Toi/Tou. Joram brought articles made out of silver, gold, and bronze. 11David dedicated them to the LORD together with the silver and gold from the nations he subdued: 12Aram, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, along with the spoils from Hadadezer.

13David’s reputation kept growing. When he came back, he killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 14He put garrisons all over Edom, and the Edomites served him. The LORD gave him victory wherever he went.

David’s Victories

15David ruled Israel and administered justice fairly to his people.

16Joab son of Zeruiah was general over the army;

Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;

17Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests;

Seraiah was secretary;

18Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of David’s bodyguard;

David’s sons were chief administrators. 	2 Sam 8:9-18

David’s Kindness to Mephibosheth

9:1Then David asked if anybody was left from Saul’s house that he could show kindness out of regard for Jonathan. 2There was a servant named Ziba. They called him to David, and the king said, “You are Ziba?”

“I’m your servant.”

3“Is anybody left in Saul’s family I can show God’s kindness?”

“There’s still a son of Jonathan that’s crippled in both feet.”

4“Where is he?”

“In the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.”

5David had him brought in. 6He came and prostrated himself.

David said, “Mephibosheth, 7you don’t have to be afraid. I’ll treat you well out of regard for your father Jonathan, and give you back the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul; you’ll eat at my table regularly.”       	2 Sam 9:1-7

8Again he prostrated himself and said, “What am I that you should care about a dead dog like me?”

9The king called Ziba,

“I’ve given your master’s grandson what belonged to Saul and his family. 10You, your sons, and servants can cultivate his land for him and bring in the crops and produce so he has food. But he’ll eat regularly at my table.”

Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants. 11-13He told the king he’d do it. Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at David’s table like one of his sons. (Mephibosheth had a young son Mica.) Everybody in Ziba’s family was Mephibosheth’s servant. 	2 Sam 9:8-13

David Defeats the Ammonites

10:1The king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king. 2David said, “I’ll be kind to Hanun son of Nahash like his father was kind to me.” David sent some ambassadors to console him about his father. But when they got there, 3the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent consolers? Hasn’t he sent them to look over the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?” 4Hanun took David’s ambassadors and shaved off half their beards, cut off their cloaks as high as their hips, and sent them away. 5When David found out, he sent to meet them because they were really humiliated. He told them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew, and then come back.

6When the Ammonites saw they’d become repugnant to David, they hired the Arameans from Beth-rehob and Zobah with 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men. 7David heard about it, and sent Joab and the whole army, the powerful men. 8The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.	 2 Sam 10:1-8

9When Joab saw he’d have to fight front and in back, he selected elite men from Israel, and deployed them against the Arameans. 10The rest he put under the command of his brother Abishai against the Ammonites,

11“If the Arameans are too strong for me, come and help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll come and help you. 12Let’s be strong and courageous for our people and the towns of our God. May the LORD do what seems good to him.”

13Joab and his people advanced against the Arameans, and they ran. 14When the Ammonites saw them flee, they retreated into the city. Then Joab came back from fighting Ammon’s descendants and went to Jerusalem.	   2 Sam 10:9-14

15When the Arameans saw that Israel had defeated them, they gathered together. 16Hadadezer brought out the Arameans beyond the River and came to Helam. Shobach, commander of Hadadezer’s army, led them. 17David found out and gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan to Helam. The Arameans put themselves in battle formation, 18but they fled from Israel. David killed 700 charioteers, 40,000 cavalry, and struck down Shobach; he died there. 19When the kings, Hadadezer’s allies, saw Israel had defeated them, they surrendered and served Israel. The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.  	2 Sam 10:15-19

David and Bathsheba

11:1In the spring when kings normally go to war, David sent Joab and Israel’s army to destroy the Ammonites and lay siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem.

2When evening came, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman taking a bath; she was beautiful. 3David sent and asked about her. Someone said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 4David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he slept with her. When she’d purified herself, she went home. 5She got pregnant and sent and told David. 	2 Sam 11:1-5

6He sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” 7When he came, David asked how Joab and the people were doing and how the war was going. 8Then he told him, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” He left the king’s palace, and a present was sent after him. 9But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s palace with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home. 10When they told David, “Uriah didn’t go home,” he asked Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go home?”

11He said,

“The Ark, Israel, and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my commander Joab and his troops are camping in the open field. Would I go eat and drink and be with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I wouldn’t do that.”

12David told him, “Stay here today; I’ll let you go tomorrow.”

Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13David called him; he ate and drank with him and got him drunk. In the evening he went out to lie on his bed with David’s palace guard and didn’t go home.	 2 Sam 11:6-13

14In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah, 15 “Put Uriah in the front of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him so he can be struck down.” 16As Joab kept watch on the city, he put Uriah where he knew there were trained soldiers. 17Men came out of the city to fight, and some of David’s soldiers fell, including Uriah. 18Joab sent a report to David about the war 19and charged the messenger,

“When you’ve told the king everything, 20if he’s angry and says, ‘Why get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they’d shoot from the wall? 21Who struck down Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Wasn’t it a woman that threw an upper millstone on him from the wall and he died at Thebez? Why get so close to the wall?’—then say, ‘Uriah the Hittite is dead too.’”

22The messenger reported,

23“The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them up to the entrance of the gate. 24The archers shot from the wall and killed some of your soldiers, including Uriah.”

25David said,

“Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this get you down. The sword takes one as well as another. Intensify your battle against the city and overthrow it.’ Encourage him that way.”

26When Uriah’s wife heard he was dead, she mourned for him. 27When the time for mourning ended, David had her brought to his house; she became his wife and had a son. But what David had done the LORD considered sin.	  2 Sam 11:14-27

Nathan Rebukes David

12:1Then the LORD sent Nathan to David to say,

“Two men were in a town, one rich, the other poor. 2The rich man had lots of flocks and herds, 3but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb that he’d bought and raised. It grew up with him and his children; it used to eat his bread and drink from his cup and lie in his lap; it was like a daughter to him. 4A traveler came to the rich man, and he wasn’t willing to take one of his own flock or herd to fix a meal for him. He took the poor man’s lamb and fixed it.”

David was mad, and swore to Nathan, “As sure as the LORD lives, that man deserves to die. 6He’ll restore the lamb fourfold because he did that without mercy.”	 2 Sam 12:1-6

7Nathan told David,

“You’re that man.

“This is what the LORD God of Israel, says, ‘I anointed you king, and delivered you from Saul. 8I gave you your master’s family, his wives, and Israel and Judah. If that wasn’t enough, I would have doubled it. 9Why have you despised my message and done what I consider evil? You’ve killed Uriah with the Ammonites’ sword and took his wife to be your wife. 10The sword will never leave your family because you’ve despised me by taking her. 11I’ll raise up evil against you in your own family. I’ll take your wives in your presence and give them to your neighbor. He’ll lie with them in broad daylight. 12You did it secretly, but I’ll do it in front of all Israel right out in the sun.’”

13David said, “I’ve sinned against the LORD.”

Nathan said, “The LORD has set your sin aside; you won’t die. 14But by doing this, you’ve completely scorned him. The child will die.”

15Nathan left.	 2 Sam 12:7-15a

The LORD struck the child, and it got sick. 16David asked God for the child and fasted. He went in and lay all night on the floor. 17The elders in his palace stood beside him, trying to get him up off the floor. But he wouldn’t get up and didn’t eat with them. 18The seventh day, the baby died. David’s advisors were afraid to tell him. They said, “While the child was still alive, we talked to him and he didn’t listen. How can we tell him the child has died? He may harm himself.” 19But when he saw them whispering, he sensed that the child had died, “Is he dead?”

“Yes.”

20Then David got up off the floor, took a bath, anointed himself, and changed clothes. He went to the LORD’s Tabernacle and worshiped and went home. When he asked, they gave him some food and he ate. 21His advisors said, “What have you done? You fasted and cried about the child while he was alive; but when he died, you got up and ate.”

22He said,

“While he was still alive, I fasted and cried because I didn’t know if the LORD would be gracious to me and let the child live. 23But now that he’s dead, why fast? Can I bring him back? He won’t come back to me, but I’ll go to him.”

24Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and had relations with her. She had a son he named Solomon. The LORD loved him 25and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah [Beloved of the LORD] for the LORD’s sake.       	2 Sam 12:15b-25

26Joab fought the Ammonites in Rabbah and captured the royal city. 27He sent messengers to David,

“I’ve attacked Rabbah and seized the city’s water supply. 28Gather the rest of the army and capture the city so I won’t, and people name it after me.”

29David gathered the rest of the army, went to Rabbah, and captured it. 30He took their king’s crown off his head. It weighed 75½ lbs one talent of gold and was set with precious stones. They put it on David’s head. He brought large amounts of spoil out of the city. 31He also brought out its people, and put them under saws, iron picks and axes; and made them pass through the brick kilns. That’s what he did to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the whole army went back to Jerusalem.	  2 Sam 12:26-31

Amnon and Tamar

13:1David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David’s son Ammon was in love with her. 2Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister that he made himself ill, because she was a virgin and it seemed hard to do anything to her. 3But Amnon had a friend Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, and Jonadab was a shrewd fellow.

4He said to him, “Son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?

Amnon said, “I’m in love with Tamar, the sister of my half-brother Absalom.”

5Jonadab said, “Lie down on your bed and act like you’re sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister come and give me something to eat, and let her fix the food so I can see it and she can hand it to me.’

6Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king went to see him, Amnon said, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple cakes.”	 2 Sam 13:1-6

7David sent for Tamar, and said, “Go to your brother Amnon’s house and fix him some food.” 8So Tamar went to his house, and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes while he watched, and baked the cakes. 9She took the pan and dished them out for him, but he refused to eat. He said, “Have everybody leave me.” So everybody left.

10Amnon said, “Bring the food into the bedroom so you can give it to me to eat.”

Tamar took the cakes and brought them into his bedroom.

11When she brought them to him, he took hold of her and said, “Come, lie with me.”

12She answered him,

“No, don’t violate me! Such a thing is not done in Israel. Don’t do this awful thing! 13Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And you’ll be like one of the fools in Israel. Please speak to the king. He won’t withhold me from you.”

14But he wouldn’t listen to her. Since he was stronger than she was, he violated her and lay with her.	 2 Sam 13:7-14

15Then Amnon hated her more than he’d loved her. He told her, “Get up, go away!”

16She told him, “No! Sending me away is worse than the other sin you’ve done to me!”

But he wouldn’t listen to her. 17He called the young man that attended him and said, “Throw this woman out, and lock the door behind her.” 18She was wearing a long-sleeved robe, because that’s the way the king’s virgin daughters dressed in robes. His attendant took her out and locked the door behind her. 19Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment. She put her hand on her head and went away, wailing as she went.

20Then Absalom asked her, “Has Amnon been with you? Keep quiet for now, my sister, he’s your brother. Don’t take this matter to heart.” Tamar stayed as a desolate woman in her brother’s house. 21When King David heard about this, he was angry. 22Absalom wouldn’t speak to Amnon because of what he’d done to his sister. 	2 Sam 13:15-22

Absalom Kills Amnon

23Two years later Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor near Ephraim and invited all the royal sons. 24He went to the king and said, “I have sheep-shearers. You and your officials go with me.”

25“No, son, we shouldn’t all go. We’d be a burden to you.”

26“If not, let my half-brother Amnon go with us.”

“Why?”

27But when Absalom kept urging him, he let Amnon and the king’s sons go with him.

28Absalom told his men,

“When Amnon is half drunk with wine and I say, ‘Strike him down,’ put him to death. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous and brave.”

29 Absalom’s men did what he said, and the king’s sons got on their mules and fled.

2 Sam 13:23-29

30While they were on their way, the report came to David, “Absalom struck down your sons; there’s not a one left.” 31The king got up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. His servants stood by him with torn clothes. 32Jonadab, son of David’s brother Shimeah, answered,

“Don’t suppose they’ve killed all your sons—just Amnon. Absalom has intended to do that ever since Ammon violated his sister Tamar.” [33]

34Absalom had fled. The young man that was the watchman looked up and saw many people coming from the road behind him beside the mountain. 35Jonadab told the king, “Your sons are here. It’s what I said would happen.” 36As soon as he’d finished talking, the king’s sons came and cried out loud. The king and his servants also cried bitterly.

37-38Absalom fled to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, for three years. David mourned for him every day. 39He really wanted to go out to Absalom, because he was at peace over Amnon, since he was dead.	 2 Sam 13:30-39

Absalom Returns to Jerusalem

14:1Joab sensed that the king yearned for Absalom. 2So he sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman, and told her,

“Act like you’re in mourning. Put on mourning clothes, don’t anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman that’s been mourning for the dead for many days. 3Then go to the king and say such and such.”

4When she spoke to the king, she fell on her face and said, “Help me, my king.”

5“What’s your trouble?”

“I’m a widow; my husband’s dead. 6I had two sons, but they quarreled in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. 7Now the whole family has risen up and told me to hand over the one that struck his brother so they can put him to death for the life of his brother, and destroy the heir too. They’ll put out my ember that’s left and won’t leave my husband a name or a remnant.”

8“Go on home. I’ll give orders about you.” 	2 Sam 14:1-8

9The woman said, “My lord, the sin is on me and my father’s family. You and your throne are innocent.”

10He said, “Bring me whoever says anything. He won’t bother you again.”

11She said, “Invoke the LORD your God so the avenger won’t destroy my son.”

“As sure as the LORD lives, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground.” 	2 Sam 14:9-11

12Then she said, “Let me say something.”

“Go ahead.”

13“Why plan such a thing then against God’s people? In saying this, you’ve convicted yourself for not bringing back the one you’ve banished. 14We’ll die like water spilled on the ground that can’t be retrieved. Yet God doesn’t take away life but plans ways to bring back the one he banishes. 15I’ve come to you because the people have made me afraid. I thought, ‘I’ll speak to the king. Maybe he’ll do what I ask. 16He’ll deliver me from the man that would destroy me and my son from God’s inheritance.’ 17Then I thought, ‘My lord’s word will comfort me, because he’s like an angel of God in discerning good and bad.’ The LORD your God be with you.”

18He answered, “Don’t hide anything I’m about to ask you. 19Is Joab involved in this with you?”

“As sure as you’re alive, nobody can stray away from anything you’ve said. Joab told me to say that. 20He did it to change how things are going. But you are wise, like an angel of God. You know what’s going on in the world.”

21The king told Joab, “I’ll do it. Bring him back.”

22Joab fell on his face and blessed him. “I know you’re pleased with me today. You’ve done what I asked.”

23Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24But the king said, “Have him come back to his own house without seeing me.” He came back without seeing David.

2 Sam 14:12-24

25In all Israel there wasn’t anybody as handsome as Absalom—so highly praised. There wasn’t a flaw in him from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot. 26When he cut his hair (at the end of every year because it was so thick), he weighed it at 5 lbs 200 shekels, royal standard. 27He had three sons and one daughter, Tamar, a beautiful woman.

28Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king. 29Then he sent for Joab so he could send him to the king, but Joab wouldn’t come. He sent again and he wouldn’t come. 30Absalom told his servants, “Joab’s barley field is next to mine. Set it on fire.”

31Joab went to Absalom’s house and asked, “Why did your servants burn my field?”

32“I sent for you so I could send you to ask the king why I’ve come back from Geshur. It’d be better for me to still be there. Let me see him. If I’ve sinned, he can put me to death.”

33When Joab went to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. He came and prostrated himself, and the king kissed him.	 2 Sam 14:25-33

Absalom’s Conspiracy

15:1After that, Absalom provided himself a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run ahead of him. 2He’d get up early and stand by the road to the gate. When anybody had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say,

“What city are you from?”

He’d say, “I’m from a tribe in Israel.”

3Then Absalom would say,

“Your claims are right, but everybody with the king is ignoring you. 4If only somebody would appoint me judge in the land, everyone that has a suit could come to me for justice.”

5When somebody came near to prostrate himself before him, he’d put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 6That’s how he dealt with everyone in Israel that came to the king for judgment. He stole away the hearts of Israel. 	2 Sam 15:1-6

7At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king,

“Let me go pay the vow I made to the LORD in Hebron. 8I took a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram that if the LORD brought me back to Jerusalem, I’d serve him.”

9“Go ahead.”

He went to Hebron. 10But he sent spies throughout the tribes, and said, “As soon as you hear the ram’s horn, say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’” 11Then 200 men went with him from Jerusalem. They went innocently, not knowing what was going on. 12Absalom sent for Ahithophel, David’s advisor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. The conspiracy was growing strong; the people continually increased with Absalom.

David Flees

13Then a messenger came to David, “The hearts of Israel are with Absalom.”

14David told his aides in Jerusalem, “Let’s flee. Otherwise, none of us will escape from him. Hurry so he won’t overtake us right away, bring down catastrophe on us, and strike the city with the sword.”

15The king’s aides told him, “We’re ready to do whatever you decide.”	  2 Sam 15:7-15

16So he and his whole family left except for 10 concubines to take care of the palace. 17He and the people with him went out and stopped at the last house. 18His aides passed on beside him, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and the men of Gath. The 600 men that had come with him from Gath passed on ahead of him.

19The king said to Ittai of Gath,

“Why go with us? Go back to King Absalom. You’re a foreigner and an exile; go back to your place. 20You just came yesterday; will I make you wander with us today while I don’t know where I’m going? Go back and take your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”

21But Ittai answered, “As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I’ll be wherever you are, for life or death.”

22So David said, “Go on across.”

So Ittai crossed with his people and little ones. 23While the whole country cried out loud, the people passed over. The king and the people crossed the Kidron toward the countryside.

2 Sam 15:16-23

24Zadok and the Levites with him came carrying the Ark of the covenant. They set it down, and Abiathar came up till the people had finished leaving the city. 25The king told Zadok,

“Take the Ark back to the city. If I’m pleasing to the LORD, he’ll bring me back and show me it and his dwelling place. 26But if he doesn’t delight in me, here I am. Let him do to me what seems good to him.”

27He also said to Zadok,

“Aren’t you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, you and yourpl two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. 28I’ll wait at the fords in the open country till you send me word.”

29Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark back to Jerusalem and stayed there.  	2 Sam 15:24-29

30David went up the Mount of Olives and cried as he went. He covered his head and walked barefoot. Then the people that were with him covered their heads and went up crying as they went. 31Someone told David, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”

David said, “LORD, turn Ahithophel’s advice into foolishness.” 32As David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head. 33David told him,

“If you pass over with me, you’ll be a burden to me. 34But if you go back to the city and tell Absalom, ‘I’ll serve you, king, like I served your father,’ you can thwart Ahithophel’s advice for me. 35Whatever you hear from the king’s palace, report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36Their two sons are with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son; and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Use them to send me everything you hear.”

37Hushai, David’s personal advisor, went into the city as Absalom got to Jerusalem.

2 Sam 15:30-37

David and Ziba

16:1When David had gone a little past the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth’s steward, met him with a couple saddled donkeys. They were carrying 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 summer fruits, and a skin of wine.

2The king asked, “Why do you have these?”

“The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride. The bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for anybody to drink that’s become exhausted in the country.”

3“Where’s Mephibosheth?”

“In Jerusalem; he said Israel would restore his father’s kingdom to him today.”

4He told Ziba, “You can have everything Mephibosheth owns.”

“My lord the king, I prostrate myself. Thanks for being gracious to me.”	 2 Sam 16:1-4

Shimei Curses David

5When David got to Bahurim, Shimei son of Gera, a man from Saul’s family, came out cursing 6and throwing stones at David and his aides.  The troops and bodyguard were all around him. 7He cursed,

“Get out of here, you bloody, worthless fellow! 8The LORD has brought back on you the bloodshed of Saul’s family in whose place you’ve ruled. He’s given the kingdom to Absalom. You’re caught in your own evil; you’re a murderer.”

9Abishai asked the king, “Why should this dead dog curse you? Let me go over and cut off his head.”

10“What do I have to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses and the LORD has told him to, why interfere?’”

11Then David told Abishai and his aides,

“My own son wants to kill me. How much more this Benjamite! Let him curse; the LORD has told him to. 12Maybe the LORD will regard my suffering and return me good for his cursing.”

13David and his men followed the road. Shimei went along on the hillside parallel to him, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at him. 14The king and the people with him arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.	 2 Sam 16:5-14

The Advice of Hushai and Ahithophel

15Then Absalom, Ahithophel, and the men of Israel went to Jerusalem. 16Hushai the Archite, David’s personal advisor, went to Absalom and said, “Long live the king!”

17“Is this loyalty to your friend? Why didn’t you go with him?”

18“I’m for the one the LORD and his people have chosen. 19Besides, shouldn’t I serve in your presence as I’ve served in your father’s presence?

20Absalom asked Ahithophel, “What’s your advice?”

21Ahithophel said,

“Have relations with your father’s concubines that he left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you’ve made yourself repugnant to your father beyond reconciliation. That will encourage everybody that’s with you to strengthen their support for you.”

22They pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he had relations with his father’s concubines right out in the open for all Israel to see. 23By both David and Absalom, Ahithophel’s advice in those days was considered the same as inquiring from God’s oracle.	 2 Sam 16:15-23

17:1In addition, Ahithophel told Absalom,

“Let me choose 12,000 men to pursue David tonight. 2I’ll attack him while he’s exhausted and terrify him. The people with him will run. I’ll only strike down the king 3and bring the people back to you. Everybody’s return depends on the man you’re looking for. Then the people will be at peace.”

4The plan pleased Absalom and Israel’s elders.

5Then Absalom said, “Call Hushai. Let’s hear what he has to say.” 6When Hushai came, Absalom said, “

“That’s what Ahithophel said. Should we do it? If not, tell us what you think.”

7Hushai said,

“That’s not a good idea. 8Your father and his men are strong men, as fierce as a bear robbed of her cubs out in the open. He’s an expert in warfare. He won’t spend the night with the people. 9He’s probably already hid in a cave or someplace. When he falls on your men in the first attack, whoever hears about it will say he’s slaughtered your followers. 10Even a man with a lion’s heart will completely lose heart. All Israel knows your father is a strong warrior, and everybody with him is brave. 11I advise you to gather Israel from Dan to Beersheba, like sand by the sea, and go personally into battle. 12We’ll come to him in a place where he can be found. We’ll descend on him like dew on the ground and not leave a man with him. 13If he withdraws into a city, Israel will bring ropes, and drag it into the valley till there’s not a small stone left there.”

2 Sam 17:1-13

14Absalom and the men of Israel said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” That happened because the LORD had ordained to thwart Ahithophel’s good advice so the LORD could bring catastrophe on Absalom.

15Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar the priests,

“This is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and Israel’s elders to do, and this is what I’ve advised. 16Quick, send and tell David not to spend the night at the fords in the open country; he needs to cross over so he and his people won’t get destroyed.” 	2 Sam 17:14- 16

17Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel. A servant girl would go tell them, and they’d tell David, because it was dangerous for them to be seen going into the city. 18But a lad did see them and told Absalom. Jonathan and Ahimaaz left in a hurry and came to the house of a man in Bahurim that had a well in his courtyard, and they got down into it. 19The woman had covered the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it so you couldn’t tell it was there. 20Absalom’s men came to her at the house, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” She said, “They’ve crossed the river.” When they searched and couldn’t find them, they went back to Jerusalem.	 2 Sam 17:17-20

21After they left, the men came up out of the well and went to tell David. “Quick, get up and cross the water because Ahithophel has advised against you.” 22David and every person with him crossed the Jordan by sunup. 23When Ahithophel saw that Absalom hadn’t followed his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his town. He set his house in order and hanged himself. They buried him in his father’s grave.

24David went to Mahanaim. Absalom and his men crossed the Jordan. 25Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was Joab’s cousin and son of Jithra the Israelite, who married Abigail daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 26Israel and Absalom camped in Gilead.

27When David got to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim, 28brought David and the ones with him sleeping mats, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched seeds, 29honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd. They said, “The people are surely hungry, exhausted, and thirsty here in the countryside.”  	2 Sam 17:21-29

The Death of Absalom

18:1Then David counted his people and set over them commanders of thousands and hundreds. 2He sent out the troops, a third each under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He told them, “I’ll go out with you too.”

3They said,

“You shouldn’t go out. If we flee, they won’t care even if half of us die. You’re worth 10,000 of us. It’s better for you to be ready to help us from town.”

4He said, “I’ll do what you think’s best.” He stood beside the gate, and the troops went out by hundreds and thousands. 5He charged Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.” The troops heard it.

6The troops went out, and the battle took place in the Forest of Ephraim. 7David’s men defeated the people of Israel with a great slaughter—20,000 men. 8The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and more people died because of the forest than died from the sword.

2 Sam 18:1-8

9Absalom happened to meet some of David’s men. He was trying to escape on his mule, and it went under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree. His hair got tangled up in them and left him hanging as the mule kept going. 10One fellow told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging from a terebinth tree.”

11Joab said, “You saw him! Why didn’t you strike him to the ground? I would’ve given you 10 pieces of silver and a belt.”

12The man said,

“Even if you’d given me 1,000, I wouldn’t have attacked the king’s son. He charged you, Abishai, and Ittai for his sake to protect young Absalom! 13Otherwise, if I’d have dealt deviously with him (and there’s nothing hidden from the king), you wouldn’t have gotten involved.”

14Joab said, “I’m not wasting time here with you.” He took three spears and thrust them through Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the tree. 15Ten young men that carried Joab’s armor gathered around Absalom and killed him.	   2 Sam 18:9-15

16Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his troops came back from chasing Israel. 17They threw Absalom in a deep pit in the forest and piled a big mound of rocks over him. Israel fled home. 18Absalom had set up a marker in the King’s Valley. He said, “I don’t have a son to carry on my name.” So he named the marker after himself; it’s still called Absalom’s Monument.

David Mourns Absalom’s Death

19Then Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the news that the LORD has freed him from his enemies.”

20Joab told him, “You’re not the one to carry news today. You’ll carry it another day. The king’s son is dead.”

21Joab told the Nubian, “Go tell him what you’ve seen.” He bowed to Joab and ran.

22Ahimaaz said again, “Whatever happens, let me run too.”

Joab said, “Why would you run, son, since you won’t get anything for it?”

23“Whatever happens, I’ll run.”

“Go ahead.” 	2 Sam 18:16-23a

Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Nubian. 24David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town. The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and saw a man running by himself. 25He called it out to the king.

He said, “If he’s by himself, he has good news.”

He came closer and closer. 26Then the watchman saw another man running. He called to the gatekeeper, “There’s another man running by himself.”

The king said, “That one is bringing good news too.”

27The watchman said, “The first runner looks like Ahimaaz.”

The king said, “He’s a good man, bringing good news.”

28Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All’s well.” He prostrated himself to the king. “Blessed is the LORD your God, who has delivered up the rebels.”

29“Is Absalom all right?”

Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and me, I saw a big great disturbance, but I didn’t know what was going on.” 	2 Sam 18:23b-29

30The king said, “Come over and stand here.”

31The Nubian arrived and said, “Receive good news. The LORD has freed you today from your attackers.”

32“Is Absalom all right?”

The Nubian answered, “Let everyone who opposes you be like that young man!”

33The king was deeply moved and went up to the room above the gate and cried. He said as he walked, “Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! Oh that I’d have died instead of you, Absalom! My son! My son!”	2 Sam 18:30-33

19:1Then Joab heard, “The king is crying and mourning for Absalom.” 2The victory that day turned into mourning because those who heard about it said, “The king is grieving for his son.” 3So the people slipped into the city like humiliated people sneak away from battle. 4The king covered his face and cried out, “Absalom! My son! My son!”

5Then Joab went into the house and told the king,

“You’ve shamed your men today. They’ve saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives and concubines. 6By loving the ones that hate you and hating the ones that love you, you’ve shown that officers and troops don’t mean anything to you. If Absalom was alive and all of us dead, you’d be pleased. 7Get up; go speak graciously to them. I swear by the LORD, if you don’t, not a man will spend the night with you. This will be worse than all the bad things that have come on you since you were young.” 	2 Sam 19:1-7

8The king got up and sat in the gate. When they told the people, “The king is sitting in the gate,” they went to him.

The Israelites that followed Absalom had fled home, 9and the people were quarreling throughout the tribes,

“The king delivered us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 10But Absalom that we anointed has died in battle. Why be silent about bringing David back as our king as our king?”

11Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests,

“Say to the elders in Judah, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the word of all Israel has come to the king and to his house? 12You’re my kin, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to welcome him back?’ 13Tell Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and bone? God do so to me and more if you won’t command my army continually in place of Joab.’”

14He convinced the people in Judah to agree; they sent word for the king and the ones with him to come back.	 2 Sam 19:8-14

David Returns to Jerusalem

15The king started back and got as far as the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across.

16Then Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet David. 171,000 Benjamites came with him, with Ziba the steward of Saul’s household, and Ziba’s own 15 sons and 20 servants. They rushed to the Jordan ahead of the king. 18They kept going back and forth across the ford to escort the king’s household over and do what pleased him. Shimei fell down to him as he was about to cross the Jordan,

19“Forgive me. Don’t take to heart what I did when you were leaving Jerusalem. 20 I know I’ve sinned; I’ve come down, the first from the House of Joseph, to meet you.”

21But Abishai son of Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t we put him to death for cursing the LORD’s anointed?”

22David said, “What do I have to do with you that you should disagree with me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know I’m king?”

23He swore to Shimei, “You won’t die.” 	2 Sam 19:15-23

24Then Saul’s son Mephibosheth came down to meet the king. He hadn’t taken care of his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes since David left. 25When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”

26He answered,

“My lord the king, my servant deceived me. I said, ‘I’ll saddle a donkey so I can go with the king,’ because I’m lame. 27He slandered me to you, but you’re like an angel of God. Do what you think’s right. 28All my father’s family was nothing but dead men; yet you set me among the ones that ate at your own table. What right do I have to complain?”

29The king said, “Why are you still talking about your affairs? I’ve decided that you and Ziba will divide the land.”

30Mephibosheth said, “Let him have it all since you’ve come home safely.”	2 Sam 19:24-30

31Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim and went on with the king to escort him across the Jordan. 32He was old, and he’d sustained the king while he was staying at Mahanaim because he was a really wealthy man. 33The king told Barzillai,

“Cross over with me, and I’ll take care of you in Jerusalem.”

34But he said,

“How long do I have left to live that I should go up with you to Jerusalem? 35I’m 80 years old. Can I distinguish good from bad, or taste what I eat, or still hear men and women singing? Why should I be an added burden to you? 36I’d simply be crossing over the Jordan with you. Why should you compensate me with this reward? 37Let me go back so I can die in my own town near my parents’ grave. But here is my son Kimham. Let him cross over with you, and you can do for him what seems good.”	 2 Sam 19:31-37

38The king answered, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I’ll do for him what seems good to you and whatever you need me to do for you.”

39The king and the people crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he went back home.

40The king and Chimham went on to Gilgal. Judah and half of Israel crossed with the king. 41The men from Israel came to the king and said, “Why did our fellow Jews in Judah steal you away, and bring you, your family, and your men across the Jordan?”

42Then the men from Judah answered, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why are you mad about that? Have we eaten at all at the kings’ expense, or has anything been taken for us?”

43But the men of Israel said, “We have ten parts in the king, so we have more claim on David than you do. Why then did you dishonor us? Wasn’t it our advice first to bring him back?”

Yet the men from Judah were more adamant than the men of Israel. 	2 Sam 19:38-43

Sheba Rebels Against David

20:1A troublemaker happened to be there—Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite. He blew the ram’s horn and said,

“We don’t have any part with David

or any inheritance in Jesse’s son.

Everybody, go home, Israel!”

2The men from Israel deserted David and followed Sheba. But Judah stayed firmly committed to their king and escorted him from the Jordan to Jerusalem.

3David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The ten concubines he’d left behind to keep the house, he put under guard and took care of them; but didn’t have relations with them. They like widows till they died. 	2 Sam 20:1-3

4Then the king told Amasa, “Call out Judah’s army within three days and be present here with them.” 5Amasa went to call them out, but it took him longer than the appointed time. 6David told Abishai, “Sheba will do us more damage than Absalom. Take my troops and pursue him so he won’t get into fortified towns and escape from me.” 7So Joab’s men, along with the king’s bodyguard and the strong warriors, left to pursue Sheba. 8When they were at the large boulder at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a dagger in its sheath fastened at his waist. As he stepped forward, it came out. 9Joab said to Amasa, “Are you doing well, brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 10Amasa wasn’t on guard against the dagger in Joab’s left hand. He struck him in the stomach just once and poured out his entrails on the ground, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba. 11One of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever is for Joab and David, follow Joab.” 12But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood on the road. When the young man saw that everybody was standing still, he took Amasa off the road into the field and threw a cloak over him. 13Then the men went on behind Joab to pursue Sheba.

2 Sam 20:4-13

14Sheba went through the tribes of Israel to Abel, as far as Beth-maacah and the Berites. They gathered and went with him too. 15Joab’s forces laid siege to Sheba in Abel Beth-maacah and threw a siege ramp up against the city’s fortifications. The people that were with Joab were starting to knock down the wall.

16But a wise woman called out from the town, “Tell Joab to come here so I can talk to him.”

17He approached her and she said, “Are you Joab?”

“Yes”

“Listen to me	.”

“I’m listening.”

18“People have always said, ‘They’ll certainly ask advice at Abel.’ That’s how they settled disputes. 19I’m among the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You’re trying to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why swallow up the LORD’s inheritance?”	 2 Sam 20:14-19

20Joab answered, “I’d never swallow up or destroy you! 21Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has risen up against King David. Hand him over and I’ll leave.”

The woman said, “We’ll throw his head to you over the wall.”

22The woman wisely went to the people. They cut off Sheba’s head and threw it to Joab. He blew the ram’s horn, and they pulled back from the city and went home. Joab went back to the king at Jerusalem.

23Joab commanded Israel’s whole army,

Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard,

24Adoram managed forced labor,

Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was royal historian,

25Sheva was secretary,

Zadok and Abiathar were priests, and

26Ira, descendant of Jair, was David’s personal priest.	 2 Sam 20:20-26

David Avenges the Gibeonites

21:1In David’s time, a famine came that lasted three years. He sought the LORD. The LORD said, “It’s because Saul and his bloody family murdered the people in Gibeon.” 2 (The inhabitants of Gibeon weren’t part of Israel but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a treaty with them, but Saul had intended to kill them off in his zeal for Israel and Judah.) The king called them,

3“How can I make amends to you so you can bless the LORD’s inheritance again?”

4“It’s not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his family. It’s not for us to put anybody to death in Israel.”

“I’ll do whatever you say.”

5They told him,

“Give us seven descendants of the man that tried to destroy us and eliminate us from staying inside Israel’s border. 6We’ll hang them in the LORD’s presence in Gibeah of Saul, the LORD’s chosen one.”

“I’ll give them to you.”	 2 Sam 21:1-6

7But the king spared Mephibosheth because of the LORD’s oath between David and Saul’s son Jonathan. 8The king took Armoni and Mephibosheth [Merib-baal], the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah; and the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab that she had for Adriel son of Barzillai of Meholah. 9He gave them to the Gibeonites, who hanged them on the mountain in the LORD’s presence. All seven died together at the beginning of barley harvest.

10Rizpah spread burlap on the rock, from the beginning of harvest till it rained on them. She wouldn’t let birds get to them during the day or wild animals at night. 11When David found out what Saul’s concubine had done, 12he took Saul and Jonathan’s bones away from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had taken them from the open square in Beth-shan. That’s where the Philistines had hung them the day they struck Saul down in Gilboa. 13He brought their bones and the bones of the ones they hanged. 14He buried Saul and Jonathan’s bones in the country of Benjamin in Zela in the grave of Kish, Saul’s father. They did everything the king commanded. After that, God was moved by petition for the land.	   2 Sam 21:7-14

Wars with the Philistine Giants

15The Philistines were at war again with Israel. When David and his men went down and fought them, David got tired. 16Ishbi-benob, a descendant of the giants in Gath—whose spearhead weighed 7½ lbs 300 shekels—was armed with a new sword and tried to kill David. 17But Abishai son of Jeruiah helped him, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, “Do not go out with us again to battle so you won’t snuff out the lamp in Israel.”

18There was war again with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, a descendant of the giants in Gath. 19Another war with the Philistines took place at Gob. Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim from Bethlehemite killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 20In another war at Gath, there was a very big man with six digits on each hand and foot. He, too, was a descendant of the giants in Gath. 21When he defied Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimei, struck him down. 22Those four sons of the giants in Gath fell by David and his troops.	 2 Sam 21:15-22

David’s Song of Praise (Psalm 18)

22:1David sang this song to the LORD when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul:

2“The LORD is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer,

3my God, my refuge, my shield,

the horn of my salvation, my fortress,

my savior from violence.

4I called on him who deserves praise,

and he saved me from my enemies.

5The waves of death entangled me;

the torrents of destruction flooded over me;

6the cords of Sheol tied me down;

the snares of death trapped me.

7In my desperation I cried out to the LORD,

and he heard me in his temple.	2 Sam 22:1-7

8Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook

because he was angry.

9Smoke poured out of his nostrils;

consuming fire flared from his mouth;

glowing coals erupted from him.

10He lowered the sky too

and came down with dense darkness under his feet.

11He rode on a cherub

and came flying on the wings of the wind.

12He made blackness a canopy around him,

a mass of moisture, dark clouds in the sky.

13Coals of fire flamed out

from the brightness in front of him.

14The LORD thundered from the sky;

the Most High raised his voice.	2 Sam 22:8-14

15He shot arrows and scattered my enemies;

lightning flashes routed them.

16Then the water in the sea receded;

the seabed was exposed at his rebuke,

at the blast from his nostrils.

17He reached down from on high and grabbed me,

and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.

18He delivered me from powerful enemies

that hated me,

that were too strong for me.

19They attacked me in a time of catastrophe,

but the LORD supported me.

20He brought me out into a safe place

and rescued me because he delighted in me.	2 Sam 22:15-20

21“The LORD has rewarded me according to my goodness,

according to my innocence—

22because I’d kept his ways

and hadn’t sinned by leaving him,

23because his ordinances all stayed with me;

I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.

24I stood blameless in front of him

and kept away from sin.

25So the LORD has rewarded me according to my goodness—

according to my godliness toward him.

26“With the kind you’re kind;

with the blameless you’re blameless;

27with the pure you’re pure;

the devious you torture.

28You rescue the humble,

but bring down the haughty.

29You’re my lamp, LORD,

and shine light into my darkness.

30With your help I can crush a battalion;

I can scale a wall.

31God’s way is perfect;

the LORD’s promise proves true;

he’s a shield for everyone that depends on him for protection.

2 Sam 22:21-31

32“Who is God except the LORD?

Who is a rock except our God,

33who wraps me in strength

and makes my way safe,

34who makes my feet like red deer’s hooves

and sets me securely on high ground,

35who trains my hands for battle

and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow,

2 Sam 22:32-35

36who gives me his deliverance as a shield

and helps make me great,

37who widens the path for my feet

so they don’t slip.

38I chased my enemies and overtook them;

I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.

39I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again.

They fell under my feet

40because you’ve wrapped me in strength for battle;

and subdued my assailants under me.

41You’ve made my enemies retreat;

I destroyed the ones that hated me.

42They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;

they even cried out to the LORD, but he didn’t answer them.

43I pulverized them like dust,

crushed and stomped on them like dirt in the street.

2 Sam 22:36-43

44“You delivered me from conflict with my own people

and placed me at the head of nations;

people I didn’t know serve me now.

45Foreigners pretend to submit as soon as they hear me;

46they retreat and come cringing out of their fortresses.

2 Sam 22:44-46

47“The LORD lives; blessed be my Rock;

exalted be God, the rock that saves me,

48the God that carries out vengeance for me

and subdues nations under me,

49who brought me out from my enemies

and lifted me above my attackers,

who rescued me from violent people.

50So I’ll thank you among the Gentiles, LORD,

and sing praises to you.

51You’re a tower of victory for your king

and show enduring love to your anointed one—

David and his descendants forever.”	2 Sam 22:2-51 [= Ps 18:2-50]

23:1David’s last words

“The oracle of David son of Jesse,

the oracle of the man God honored,

the one anointed by Jacob’s God,

the sweet psalmist of Israel.

2“The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me;

his message is on my tongue.

3The God of Israel said,

the Rock of Israel told me,

‘He that rules justly,

that rules in respect for God,

4is like the morning light from the rising sun

on a cloudless morn,

when tender grass sprouts from the soil

in the sunshine after rain.’	2 Sam 23:1-4

5Is not my family that way with God?

He has made an everlasting covenant with me,

ordered in every respect and secure.

Won’t he make grow

my salvation and my desire?

6But godless people every one will be thrown aside like briers,

because you can’t handle them.

7If you touch them,

you have to arm yourself with iron and the shaft of a spear.

They’ll be completely burned up where they are.”	2 Sam 23:5-7

David’s Greatest Warriors

8These are David’s most elite soldiers: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite [a Hachmonite in 1 Chronicles 11:11], chief of The Three. He was called Adino the Eznite because he killed 800 men in one battle.

9After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, a descendant of Ahoah, another of The Three elite soldiers. He and David defied the Philistines that gathered for battle and Israel’s army retreated. 10He arose and struck the Philistines till his hand was worn out and cramped onto the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The rest of the army only returned to strip the slain.

11After him was Shammah son of Agee, from Harar. The Philistines had gathered into a troop on a plot of ground full of lentils, and the rest of the Israelite army had fled. 12But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck the Philistines. The LORD brought about a great victory.

13Then The Three among The Thirty chief men went down to David at harvest time to the cave near Adullam, while a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 14David was in the stronghold while the garrison of Philistines was in Bethlehem. 15David had a yearning, “If only somebody would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!” 16So The Three broke through the Philistines’ camp and drew water from the well and brought it to him. But he wouldn’t drink it. He poured it out to the LORD, 17“I couldn’t do that, LORD. Am I going to drink the blood of men who jeopardized their lives?” Those are some things The Three most elite soldiers did. 	2 Sam 23:8-17

18Abishai, brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of The Thirty. He handled his spear against 300 and killed them and had a name alongside The Three. 19He was the most honored of The Thirty, so he became their commander, but he didn’t measure up to The Three.

20Then Benaiah son of Jehoiada—son of a great warrior from Kabzeel, who had done amazing things—killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day. 21He killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and took the spear away from him and killed him with it. 22He had a name as well as The Three. 23He was honored among The Thirty, but he didn’t measure up to The Three. David appointed him over his guard.	 2 Sam 23:18-23

24Asahel, Joab’s brother, was among the 30 as well as

Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem;

25Shammah and Elika from Harod,

26Helez from Pelon,

Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,

27Abiezer from Anathoth,

Mebunnai from Hushah,

28Zalmon from Ahoah,

Maharai and 29Heleb son of Baanah from Netophah,

Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,

30Benaiah from Pirathon,

Hiddai from Nahale-gaash,

31Abialbon/Abiel?LXX from Arabah,

Azmaveth from Bahurim,

32Eliahba from Shaalbon,

the sons of Jashen,

Jonathan 33son of Shagee and Ahiam son of Sharar from Harar [1 Ch 11:34],

34Eliphelet son of Ahasbai from Maacah,

Eliam so of Ahithophel from Giloh,

35Hezro from Carmel,

Paarai from Arba,

36Igal son of Nathan from Zobah,

Bani from Gad,

37Zelek from Ammon,

Naharai from Beeroth, armor bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah;

38Ira and Gareb the Jattir,

39Uriah the Hittite—37 in all.	2 Sam 23:24-39

David’s Ill-Advised Census

24:1Again the LORD’s anger burned against Israel, and he aroused David to count the people in Israel and Judah.

2The king told Joab the commander of the army, “Go through the tribes from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people so I can know how many there are.”

3But Joab said, “May the LORD your God multiply the people 100 times while you can still see it, but why delight in this?”

4But the king’s word prevailed over Joab and his commanders; so they spread out to register the people. 5They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer in the middle of the Valley of Gad and then went on toward Jazer. 6They went to Gilead and the area around Tahtim-hodshi, to Dan-jaan and on around to Sidon, 7to the fortress of Tyre and the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites; and to the south of Judah to Beersheba. 8When they’d cycled through the country, they came to Jerusalem after 9 months and 20 days, 9and Joab reported the number of the census. 	2 Sam 24:1-9

God’s Judgment on David’s Sin

10David’s conscience got to bothering him after he’d counted the people. He told the LORD, “I’ve committed a serious sin, but please take away my guilt. I’ve acted foolishly.” 11When he got up in the morning, a message from the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, 12“Tell David I’m offering him three choices.”

13Gad went and asked David,

“Will three [1 Chronicles 21:12] years of famine come on you and your land? Will you flee from your enemies for three months? Or will there be a three-day plague in your land? Which answer will I take back to the One who sent me?”

14David told Gad,

“I’m really distressed. Let’s fall into the LORD’s hand. He has great mercy; don’t let me fall into human hands.”	                                      2 Sam 24:10-14

15So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from morning till the appointed time; 70,000 people died from Dan to Beersheba. 16When the angel held out his hand out toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented, “That’s enough. Relax your hand.” The angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17When David saw the angel, he said to the LORD, “I’m the one that sinned. I did wrong. What have these sheep done? Put yourself against me and my father’s family.”	  2 Sam 24:15-17

God’s Judgment on David’s Sin

18Gad went to David that day and said, “Go build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” 19David went up like he said. 20Araunah looked down and saw him and his men crossing over toward him. He went out and bowed to the ground. 21He said, “Why have you come to me?”

“To buy your threshing floor and build an altar to the LORD so he’ll hold back the plague from the people.”

22Araunah told him,

“Take and offer what you want to: the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and yokes for wood. 23You can have it all. May the LORD your God accept you.”

24“No, I’ll buy it from you. I won’t offer burnt offerings that don’t cost me anything.”

He bought the threshing floor and oxen for 20 oz 50 shekels of silver. 25He built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The LORD was moved by David’s petition for the country and held back the plague.	2 Sam 24:18-25

1 KINGS

David in His Old Age

1:1When King David got old, they covered him with blankets, but he still had the chills. 2His advisers told him, “Let us look for a young virgin so she can attend you, become your nurse, and lie in your arms to keep you warm.” 3They searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4She became his nurse, but he didn’t have relations with her.

Adonijah Claims the Throne

5Adonijah son of Haggithfem pushed himself forward to make himself king. He prepared chariots and horsemen with 50 men to run ahead of him. 6His father had never crossed him by asking why he did something.  7He’d conferred with Joab son of Jeruiah and Abiathar the priest. They supported him. He was a handsome man, born after Absalom. 8But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and The Three most elite soldiers, who belonged to David, didn’t join him. 9Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and young grain-fed animals by the Rock of Zoheleth next to En-rogel. He invited his half-brothers, the king’s sons; and the men of Judah, the king’s aides. 10But he didn’t invite Nathan, Benaiah, The Three most elite soldiers, or his half-brother Solomon. 	1 Kg 1:1-10

11Nathan told Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother,

“Haven’t you heard that Adonijah has become king, and David our lord doesn’t know it? 12Take my advice and save your life and your son’s life. 13Go right now to King David and say, ‘Haven’t you sworn to me that Solomon will be king after you? Why has Adonijah become king?’ 14While you’re there, I’ll come in and confirm what you say.”

15Bathsheba went to the king’s bedroom; Abishag was helping him. 16Bathsheba bowed low to him, and he asked, “What can I do for you?”

17She said,

“You swore to me by the LORD your God that my son Solomon would be the next king. 18Adonijah has made himself king without you knowing it. 19He has sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed animals, and sheep and invited your sons Abiathar and Joab, but not Solomon. 20My lord the king, Israel is looking to you to tell them who will sit on your throne. 21Otherwise, as soon as you die, my son and I will be considered adversaries.”	 1 Kg 1:11-21

22While she was talking, Nathan came. 23They told the king, “Nathan’s here.” When he came in, he bowed low 24and said,

“My lord the king, have you said Adonijah will be king? 25He’s gone down today and sacrificed lots of oxen, grain-fed calves, and sheep and invited your sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar. They’re eating and drinking with him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 26But he hasn’t invited me, Zadok, Benaiah, or Solomon. 27Have you done this without telling us?”

David Appoints Solomon as King

28King David answered, “Call Bathsheba.” She came in and faced him. 29He vowed,

“As sure as the LORD lives who has redeemed me from distress, 30as sure as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel that your son Solomon would be king after me, I’ll declare it publicly today.”

31She bowed to the floor and said, “Long live my lord King David!”           1 Kg 1:22-31

32David said, “Call Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah.” When they came in, 33he told them,

“Take my officials with you, have Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. 34Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king. Blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 35Then come up behind him. He’ll come and sit on my throne. I’ve appointed him to rule Israel and Judah.”

36Benaiah answered,

“Amen! So may the LORD your God say, 37‘As the LORD has been with you, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than yours!’”

38Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king’s bodyguard went down and had Solomon ride David’s mule to Gihon. 39Zadok took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn and the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 40The people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating. The ground shook at the sound of them.	 1 Kg 1:32-40

41Adonijah and his guests heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the ram’s horn, he said, “Why is the city in such an uproar?” 42While he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar came. Adonijah said, “Come in, brave man with good news.” 43But Jonathan answered,

“No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 44He sent with him Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the king’s bodyguard. They’ve had him ride the king’s mule. 45Zadok and Nathan anointed him king at Gihon and have come up celebrating. That’s why the city’s in an uproar. 46Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne. 47The king’s aides came to bless our lord King David and say, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name better than your name and his throne greater than yours!’ 48The king also said, ‘Bless the LORD God of Israel, who has granted a man to sit on my throne today while I can see it.’” 	1 Kg 1:41-48

49Adonijah’s guests panicked and fled. 50Adonijah was scared of Solomon. He went and held onto the horns of the altar. 51Solomon heard, “Adonijah is scared. He’s holding onto the horns of the altar and calling for you to swear to him that you won’t put him to death.”

52Solomon said, “If he’ll be a worthy man, not a hair of his will fall to the ground. But if he does anything sinful, he’ll die.” 53King Solomon had them bring him down from the altar. He came and prostrated himself to Solomon. He told him to go on home.     	     	     1 Kg 1:49-53

David’s Instructions to Solomon

2:1As David’s time to die came closer, he charged Solomon,

2“I’m going the way of all the earth. So be strong, show yourself to be a man. 3Keep the charge of the LORD your God, follow him, keep his statutes, commandments, ordinances, and testimonies written in the Law of Moses. Then you can succeed at everything you do. 4The LORD will carry out his promise to me, ‘If your descendants follow me sincerely with their heart and soul, you’ll always have one on Israel’s throne.’ 5You also know what Joab did to me and the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner and Amasa that he murdered. He shed the blood of war in the time of peace. He put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 6Act wisely; don’t let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. 7But be kind to the descendants of Barzillai the Gileadite. Have them eat at your table. They helped me when I was eluding your half-brother Absalom. 8Shimei son of Gera is with you. He cursed me with violent curses when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD that I wouldn’t put him to death with the sword. 9Don’t you let him go unpunished. You’re a wise man; send his gray hair down to Sheol with blood.”

The Death of David

10David died and they buried him in The City of David. 11He’d ruled Israel for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem. 12Solomon sat on his throne, and his kingdom became secure.					       1 Kg 2:1-12

Solomon’s Throne Established

13Adonijah went to Bathsheba.

She said, “Are you coming in peace?”

“Yes. 14I have something to say to you.”

“Say it.”

15“You know that the kingdom was mine as oldest heir and that Israel supposed I would be king. But the kingdom has been turned around and become my half-brother’s; it was his from the LORD. 16I’m making one request. Don’t refuse me.”

“What is it?”

17“Please speak to Solomon about giving me Abishag as a wife. He won’t refuse you.”

18“I’ll speak to him.”	 1 Kg 2:13-18

19Bathsheba went to King Solomon, and the king rose to meet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then he had a throne set for the queen mother on his right. 20She said, “I’m making one small request. Don’t refuse me.”

“Ask, Mother; I won’t refuse you.”

21“Give Abishag to Adonijah your half-brother as a wife.”

22“Why are you asking for Abishag for Adonijah? Ask for the kingdom too—because he’s my older half-brother—even for him, Abiathar, and Joab!” 23Solomon swore by the LORD,

“God do so to me and more if Adonijah hasn’t said that against his own life. 24As sure as the LORD lives who made me secure on my father’s throne and made me a family like he promised, I’ll execute Adonijah today.”

25He sent Benaiah to execute him.

26Then the king told Abiathar,

“Go to your farm in Anathoth. You should die, but I won’t do it now; you’ve carried the Ark of the Lord GOD in my father’s presence and suffered everything he did.”

27Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest in fulfillment of the LORD’s word about the descendants of Eli in Shiloh.	 1 Kg 2:19-27

28The news came to Joab because Joab followed Adonijah—though he hadn’t followed Absalom. Joab fled to the LORD’s tent and held onto the horns of the altar. 29King Solomon learned that he was beside the altar and sent Benaiah to execute him.

30Benaiah went and told him, “The king says to come out.”

But he said, “I’ll die here.” Benaiah brought back word to the king.

31“Do like he said and bury him so you can remove from me and my father’s family the blood he shed for no reason. 32The LORD will be bringing his blood back on his own head. He fell on two men more upright than he was and killed them with the sword unbeknownst to my father: Abner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa, commander of Judah’s army. 33Their blood will come back on the head of Joab and his descendants permanently. But may David, his descendants, his dynasty, and throne have lasting peace from the LORD.”

1 Kg 2:28-33

34Benaiah went up and fell on him, and they buried him at his house in the country. 35The king appointed Benaiah over the army and Zadok as priest to replace Abiathar.

36The king called for Shimei, “Build a house in Jerusalem and live here. 37If you cross the Kidron, you’ll be responsible for your own death.”

38“All right.” He lived in Jerusalem a good while.	 1 Kg 2:34-38

39But three years later, two of his servants ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. People told him his servants were in Gath. 40He saddled his donkey, went to Achish in Gath to look for them, and brought them back. 41Solomon found out he’d gone, 42so he called him in,

“Didn’t I make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you that the day you went anywhere else you’d surely die? You agreed. 43Why not keep your oath to the LORD and my command? 44You’ve acknowledged your sin against my father; the LORD will bring it back on your own head. 45But I’ll be blessed, and David’s throne will be secure with the LORD permanently.”

46The king told Benaiah to execute him. That’s how the kingdom became secure for Solomon.

Solomon Asks for Wisdom

3:1Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh and brought his daughter to The City of David till he’d finished building his own palace, the LORD’s Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. 2People were still sacrificing on the high places; the LORD didn’t have a temple yet.

3Solomon loved the LORD and followed his father’s statutes except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 4He’d go to Gibeon to sacrifice, the great high place. He offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar. 5The LORD appeared to him in a dream there at night,

“Ask what you want me to give you.”

6He said, “You’ve shown great enduring love to David as he followed after truth, goodness, and an upright heart toward you. You’ve given him a son to sit on his throne. 7Now, LORD my God, you’ve made me king, but I’m just a child. I don’t know how to manage affairs. 8I’m among the people you’ve chosen, people too numerous to count. 9Give me an intelligent mind to judge them, to distinguish good from bad. Who can judge this large nation?”   	1 Kg 3:1-9

10 What he asked for pleased the LORD. 11He told him,

“Because you’ve asked for that instead of a long life, wealth, or the death of your enemies, 12I’ll give you what you asked for: a wise, discerning mind; there has never been anybody like you before or will be afterwards. 13I’ll also give you what you didn’t ask for: wealth and honor like no other king as long as you live. 14If you follow my ways and keep my statutes and commandments like your father did, I’ll lengthen your life.”

15Solomon woke up; it was a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood in front of the Ark, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and held a banquet for his officials.	 1 Kg 3:10-15

Solomon’s Wise Ruling

16Two prostitutes came and stood in his presence. 17One woman said,

“My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby. 18and three days later she had one. We were the only ones there. 19Her son died during the night because she lay on him. 20While I was sleeping, she got up and took my son and laid him in her arms and laid her dead son by me. 21When I got up in the morning to nurse him, he was dead. But when I looked closely, it wasn’t my son.”

22The other woman said, “No! the living one is mine. The dead one’s yours.”

The first woman said, “No! the dead one’s yours. The living one’s mine.”

23The king said, “One says, ‘This is my son that’s alive.’ The other says, ‘No! your son’s the dead one.’ 24Get me a sword.”

They brought him one.

25He said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other.”

26The real mother spoke out because she was deeply moved over her son, “My lord, give her the living child! Don’t kill him!”

The other said, “He won’t be mine or yours. Cut him in two!”

27The king answered, “Give the first woman the living child. She’s his mother.” 28When Israel heard about the judgment he’d handed down, they respected him for the wisdom God had given him for administering justice.			1 Kg 3:16-28

Solomon’s Prosperity and Wisdom

20Judah and Israel were as numerous as sand on the shore. They were eating and drinking and celebrating. 21Solomon ruled the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served him his whole life.

22Solomon’s provisions for one day were

30 kors of fine flour and (330 bushels)

60 kors of meal, 	    (660 bushels)

2310 grain-fed oxen,

20 pasture-fed oxen, and

100 sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.

24He had dominion over the territory west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah to Gaza. He had peace all around. 25Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and fig tree from Dan to Beersheba Solomon’s whole life. 26He had 40,000 stalls for horses for his chariots and 12,000 cavalry. 27For a month at a time, the deputies provided for him and everybody that came to his table; they left, not lacking anything. 28They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to where it should be, each according to his responsibility.  	1 Kg 4:20-28

29God gave Solomon wisdom, great discernment, and breadth of mind. 30His wisdom surpassed the wisdom of men in the East and in Egypt. 31He was wiser than anyone else—than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman; or Calcol and Darda, sons of Mahol. He was famous in the nations all around. 32He authored 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. 33He knew about trees from the cedars in Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall. He talked about animals, birds, crawling things, and fish. 34People came from every nation to hear his wisdom, kings everywhere who’d heard about it. 	1 Kg 4:29-34

Preparations for Building the Temple

5:1Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to Solomon when he heard they’d anointed him king in place of his father. He’d always been a friend to David. 2Solomon sent him a message,

3“You know my father couldn’t build a temple for the LORD his God because he carried on warfare till the LORD put down his enemies. 4But now the LORD has given me peace in every direction. There’s no adversary or misfortune. 5I intend to build a temple for the LORD like he said, ‘Your son that I’ll set on your throne will build me a temple.’ 6Have your woodsmen cut cedars from Lebanon, and my workmen will work with yours. I’ll pay them whatever wages you set. You know there’s nobody among us that knows how to cut timber like Sidonians.”

7When Hiram heard what Solomon said, he was happy, “Bless the LORD that’s given David a wise son over this great people.” 8He sent word to Solomon,

“I’ve heard your message. I’ll do what you want about the cedar and cypress timber. 9My workmen will bring it down from Lebanon to the sea, and tie it together in rafts to go by sea to where you designate. I’ll have them taken apart there for you to take away. Then you’ll satisfy me by feeding my household.”

10Hiram gave him as much cedar and cypress as he wanted. 11Each year Solomon gave him 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of wheat and 1800 gallons 20 kors of pressed olive oil for his household. 12The LORD gave Solomon wisdom like he’d promised. Hiram and Solomon signed a peace treaty.     	1 Kg 5:1-12

13King Solomon conscripted 30,000 laborers from all over Israel, 14and sent them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 a month. They worked in Lebanon a month and were home two months. Adoniram oversaw them. 15Solomon had 70,000 transporters and 80,000 stone cutters in the mountains, 16besides the 3,300 foremen that oversaw the project and managed the workmen. 17He commissioned them to quarry huge, high-quality stones for the foundation of the Temple. 18His and Hiram’s builders and workmen from the town of Gebal cut them and prepared the timbers and stones for the Temple.	1 Kg 5:13-18

Solomon Builds the Temple

6:1In the 480th year after the Israelites left Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, the second month (Ziv), he started building the LORD’s Temple. 2It was 90 x 30 x 45ft high. 3The vestibule across the nave was 30ft long—equal to the Temple’s width—and 15ft deep. 4He made recessed frames for the windows. 5He also built a three-story structure against the Temple walls, going around the nave and inner sanctuary, and made side rooms around the outside. 6The first story was 7½ft wide, the middle one 9ft, and the third 10½ft; because on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the Temple all the way around so the beams didn’t insert into the Temple walls. 7While the Temple was being built, the stones were prepared at the quarry. There wasn’t any sound of hammer, axe, or iron tool on site. 8The entry for the lowest side room was on the right side of the Temple. People could go up winding stairs to the middle and third stories. 9He built the Temple and finished it with beams and cedar planks 10in addition to the three stories, each 7½ft high, resting against the Temple wall on cedar timbers. 	1 Kg 6:1-10

11A message from the LORD came to Solomon,

12“As to this Temple you’re building, if you follow my statutes, carry out my ordinances, and keep my commandments, I’ll keep the promise with you that I made to your father. 13I’ll live among the Israelites and not abandon my people.”

14Solomon finished building the Temple.

15He paneled the inside of the walls with cedar boards from floor to ceiling and overlaid the floor with cypress boards. 16Inside the back of the Temple, he separated off the inner sanctuary 30ft deep, the Holy of Holies. 17The nave in front of it was 60ft long. 18The cedar all over the inside of the Temple was decorated with carved shapes of gourds and open flowers. No stone was showing. 19He prepared the inner sanctuary for the Ark of the LORD’s Covenant, 2030 x 30 x 30ft high and overlaid with pure gold. He overlaid the altar with cedar. 21He drew gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid the rest of the interior with gold. 22He overlaid the whole Temple with gold as well as the altar by the inner sanctuary.	 1 Kg 6:11-22

23-26In the inner sanctuary he made 2 identical cherubs out of olive wood, each 15ft tall 24with wings 7½ft long and their tips 15ft apart. 27He placed the cherubs in the middle of the inner room with their wings spread out so the wing of one touched one wall, the wing of the other touched the opposite wall, and their other wings touched in the center of the Temple. 28He overlaid them with gold.

29He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on the walls of the inner and outer sanctuaries, 30and overlaid both floors with gold. 31-32The entrance to the inner sanctuary was 2 doors made out of olive wood with a lintel and 5-sided doorposts, with carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold. 33For the entrance to the nave, he made 4-sided doorposts out of olive wood 34and 2 doors of cypress wood. Both leaves of both doors folded in on pivots. 35He carved cherubs, palm trees, and open flowers on them; and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 36He built the wall of the inner court with 3 courses of cut stone capped by a layer of cedar beams.

37In the fourth year, the month Ziv, the foundation of the LORD’s Temple was in place. 38In the eleventh year, eighth month (Bul), it was finished as designed. It took 7 years to build.    	 1 Kg 6:23-38

Solomon Builds His Palace

7:1It took 13 years to build Solomon’s palace.

2He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon: 150 x 75 x 45ft high. It rested on 4 rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. 3It had cedar panels above the side-rooms that were on the 45 pillars, 15 to a row. 4There were 3 rows of window frames with window across from window in three ranks. 5All the doorways and doorposts had square frames.

6He made the Hall of Pillars: 75 x 45ft with a porch in front and pillars, and a threshold in front of them.

7He built the Hall of the Throne, where he would judge, the Hall of Judgment, paneled with cedar from floor to rafters.

8The palace where he’d live and the other court inward from the hall had the same workmanship.

He made similar quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter that he’d married. 9These were made out of expensive stones, cut to size with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and so on the outside to the great court.	1 Kg 7:1-9

10The foundation consisted of huge, expensive stones, some 12ft and 15ft long. 11Above were expensive stones cut to size—and cedar. 12The great court had 3 courses of cut stone all around capped by a layer ofcedar beams like the inner court of the LORD’s Temple and its porch.

The Temple Furnishings

13King Solomon sent for Hiram/Huram of Tyre, a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali. His father was from Tyre, a worker in bronze. 14He was filled with wisdom, insight, and skill for doing any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon to do his work.

15Hiram/Huram fashioned 2 pillars of bronze 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference. 16He made 2 capitals out of molten bronze to set on top of the pillars, each 7½ft tall. 17There were 7 sets of latticework and interwoven chains for the capitals. 18Hiram circled 200 pomegranates in 2 rows around the latticework on each capital, 19and each had a lily design 6ft tall. 20The capitals were close to the rounded projection that was beside the latticework. 21So he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave. The left pillar he named Boaz, and the right one, Jachin. 22The capitals on the pillars there were shaped like water lilies. That finished the work on the pillars. 	1 Kg 7:10-22

23Hiram/Huram made the sea out of cast metal 15ft from brim to brim. It was 7½ft tall and 45ft in circumference. 24Under its brim, gourds went all the way around it, 10 to each 1½ft. The gourds were in 2 rows, cast with the rest. 25The sea rested on 12 oxen, 3 each facing north, west, south, and east, and their hind quarters aimed inward. 26It was a handbreadth thick with a brim like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold 18,000 gallons.	     1 Kg 7:23-26

27Then Hiram/Huram made 10 bronze stands, each 6 x 6 x 4½ft high. 28They had braces between the frames 29decorated with lions, oxen, and cherubs. On the frames there was a pedestal above with lions and oxen and wreaths of hanging work below. 30Each stand had 4 bronze wheels with bronze axles. There were 4 supports under the basins with wreath decorations on each side. 31Its opening was within a crown that stuck up 18ins. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. 32The 4 wheels were under the panels, and their axels were of one piece with the stands. The wheels were 27ins tall, 33made like chariot wheels with their axels, rims, spokes, and hubs cast in one piece from molten bronze. 34There were 4 supports at the 4 corners of each stand made of one piece with the stands. 35On top of the stand was a round band 18ins high with stays and borders of one piece with it. 36On the surfaces of its stays and borders, he carved cherubs, lions, and palm trees according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. 37He made 10 such stands, cast alike, the same size and shape.	1 Kg 7:27-37

38He made 10 bronze basins, 1 for each stand. Each basin held 360 gallons and measured 6ft across. 39He set the stands 5 on the south side of the Temple and 5 on the north side, and set the sea at the southeast corner of the Temple.

40Hiram/Huram also made pots, shovels, and basins. He finished everything for King Solomon on the LORD’s Temple: 41the 2 pillars, 2 bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars, 2 networks to cover the 2 bowls—42400 pomegranates for the 2 networks in 2 rows per network; 4310 stands and the 10 lavers on them, 44the sea and the 12 oxen under it.	1 Kg 7:38-44

45He made the pots, shovels, and basins out of burnished bronze. 46The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47Solomon didn’t calculate the weight of the bronze or the items; there were too many.

48Solomon made the furniture for the LORD’s Temple: the golden altar, golden table for the Bread of the Presence, 49lampstands of pure gold—5 on the south side and 5 on the north in front of the inner sanctuary. He made the flowers, lamps, and tongs out of gold; 50the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans out of pure gold; and the sockets for the doors of the Holy of Holies and for the nave of the Temple out of gold.

51Solomon finished the work on the LORD’s Temple. He brought in the silver, gold, and articles David had dedicated, and stored them in the Temple treasuries.  	1 Kg 7:45-51

The Ark Brought to the Temple

8:1-2In Jerusalem Solomon gathered Israel’s elders, heads of tribes, and leaders of families. They gathered at the festival in the seventh month (Ethanim) to bring up the Ark of the Covenant from The City of David (Zion). 3The priests picked up the Ark 4and brought it up with the Tent of Meeting along with the holy items that were in it. The priests and Levites brought them up. 5King Solomon and the whole community sacrificed more sheep and oxen than you could count. 6The priests brought the Ark to its place in the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies. 7The cherubs spread out their wings over it and its poles. 8The poles were long enough for their ends to be visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from the outside. They’re still there. 9Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets Moses put there at Horeb/Sinai, where the LORD made covenant with Israel. 10When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the Temple. 11They couldn’t carry out their service because the LORD’s glory filled the Temple.      			      		       1 Kg 8:1-11

Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication

12Then Solomon said,

“You’ve said you’d be in the dark cloud.

13I’ve built you a glorious temple, a permanent place to live.”

14Then he faced the people and blessed the assembly standing there,

15“Bless the LORD God of Israel who told my father David, 16‘From the time I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I hadn’t chosen a city to build a temple in so my name would be there, but I chose David to rule my people.’ 17My father wanted to build him a temple, 18but the LORD said he meant well, 19but he wouldn’t build it; his son would. 20The LORD has kept that promise; I’ve risen to Israel’s throne and built him a temple. 21That’s where I’ve set the Ark that holds the covenant he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”

1 Kg 8:12-21

22Then Solomon stood at the altar and spread out his hands toward heaven.

23“LORD God of Israel, there’s no God like you in the sky or on earth because you keep covenant and show enduring love to your servants that follow you with all their heart. 24You’ve kept your promise to my father. 25Keep this one, too, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on your throne if they follow me like you have.’ 26Confirm that promise now.

27“But will you live on earth? Sky and heaven can’t contain you, much less this Temple I’ve built! 28Yet answer my prayer. Listen to my call 29so you’ll be looking toward this Temple day and night where you’ve put your name. 30Listen when your people and I pray toward here. Listen from heaven, where you live, and forgive. 	1 Kg 8:22-30

31“When someone sins against another and comes here to take an oath at your altar, 32then listen from heaven and judge them. Punish sinners by bringing their way on their own head, and justify the good by rewarding them according to their goodness.

33“When an enemy defeats your people because they’ve sinned, if they repent, confess your name, and make petition in this Temple, 34then listen from heaven, forgive them, and bring them back to the country you’ve given their ancestors.

35“When there’s no rain because they’ve sinned against you and they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you punish them, 36then listen from heaven and forgive your people. Teach them the good way to live and send rain on the land you’ve given them to inherit.	1 Kg 8:31-36

37“When there’s a famine in the country; disease, blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper; if their enemies lay siege to their towns—whatever the plague or sickness, 38whatever petition any or all your people make, each knowing the suffering in their own heart and spreading their hands toward this Temple, 39then listen from where you live, forgive, and render to each as they’ve done—only you know everyone’s heart—40so they’ll respect you as long as they live in the country you’ve given our ancestors.

41“When a foreigner comes from a distant country 42because of your great name, your powerful hand, and outstretched arm, and prays toward this Temple, 43then listen from heaven where you live, and do everything he calls to you for so every nation will know you and respect you like your people do. They’ll know that this Temple I’ve built wears your name.	 1 Kg 8:37-43

44“When your people go out to battle in whatever direction you send them, and they pray to you toward this city you’ve chosen and the Temple I’ve built, 45then listen from heaven and support their cause.

46“When they sin against you (everyone does), you’re angry, and deliver them to an enemy that takes them captive near or far, 47if they take it to heart there, repent, and petition you, ‘We’ve sinned, we’ve committed iniquity, we’ve acted perversely,’ 48if they come back to you with all their heart and soul, and pray toward the land you’ve given their ancestors, the city you’ve chosen, the Temple I’ve built, 49then listen from heaven where you live, uphold their cause, 50and forgive them. Have their captors show them mercy (51because they’re the inheritance you brought out of Egypt, the iron furnace). 52Open your eyes to my petition and to your people Israel, to listen whenever they call. 53You’ve separated them off from all the other nations as your inheritance, Lord GOD, like you said through Moses when you brought them out of Egypt.”  	  1 Kg 8:44-53

54When Solomon had finished that prayer, he stood up from kneeling with his hands spread toward heaven 55and blessed Israel with a loud voice,

56“Blessed be the LORD, who has given his people rest like he promised. Not a word of his promise through Moses has failed. 57May he be with us like he was with our ancestors, 58and incline our hearts toward him, to follow the statutes and ordinances he commanded them. 59May my petition come near him day and night so he’ll support the cause of his servant and of Israel as each day requires. 60Then the whole world can know the LORD is God and no other. 61Devote your hearts to him completely, follow his statutes, and keep his commandments like you’re doing today.”

The Dedication of the Temple

62The king and all Israel offered sacrifices and peace offerings to the LORD: 6322,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. That’s how the king and Israel dedicated the LORD’s Temple. 64The same day, he consecrated the middle of the court in front of it, because he offered there the burnt offering, grain offering, and fat of the peace offerings. The bronze altar was too small to hold them. 65Solomon and all Israel observed the festival for 14 days, a huge assembly from Lebo-hamath to the River of Egypt, in the presence of the LORD our God. 66The next day he dismissed the people, and they blessed the king. They went home happy for the goodness the LORD had shown David his servant and Israel his people.	 1 Kg 8:54-66

The LORD Appears to Solomon

9:1When Solomon had finished building the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, and everything he wanted to do, 2the LORD appeared to him a second time like he did at Gibeon.

3“I’ve heard your prayer and consecrated this Temple you’ve built by putting my name there permanently. My eyes and heart will always be there. 4If you’ll follow me like your father did in the integrity of heart and godliness, do everything I tell you, keep my statutes and ordinances, 5then I’ll make your throne secure over Israel permanently like I promised David, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on Israel’s throne.’

6“But if you or your sons turn away from me to serve and worship other gods, 7I’ll remove Israel from the land I’ve given them, and throw away the Temple I’ve consecrated. Israel will become a proverb, a byword among the nations. 8This Temple will become a pile of ruins. Everybody that goes by will be amazed and gasp, ‘Why has the LORD done this to this land and this Temple?’ 9People will say, ‘Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They adopted other gods and worshiped and served them.’”      	1 Kg 9:1-9

Solomon’s Agreement with Hiram

10At the end of the 20 years it took him to build the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, King Solomon gave Hiram 20 towns in Galilee. (11Hiram, king of Tyre, had supplied him with all the cedar, cypress, and gold he wanted.) 12Hiram came out from Tyre to see them, but he didn’t like them. 13“What are these towns you’ve given me, brother?” They’re still called The Land of Cabul [A Land as Good as Nothing]. 14Nevertheless, Hiram sent Solomon 4½ tons 120 talents of gold.

Solomon’s Other Achievements

15This is the conscripted labor King Solomon levied to build the LORD’s Temple, his own palace, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer, burned it, killed the Canaanites in it, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 17Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the Lower Beth-horon, 18Baalath, Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah, 19his storage cities, cities for his chariots and cavalry, and everything he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and the land he ruled. 20To this day Solomon has conscripted laborers from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites 21that Israel couldn’t destroy. 22But he didn’t conscript Israelites for forced labor. They were soldiers, officials, officers, captains, chariot commanders, and cavalry.  	1 Kg 9:10-22

23550 chief officers oversaw Solomon’s work.

24As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from The City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he built the Millo.

25Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he built to the LORD, burning incense with them.

And so he finished the Temple.

26He also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in Edom. 27Hiram sent experienced seamen with the fleet along with Solomon’s men. 28They went to Ophir and brought back 15¾ tons 420 talents of gold to Solomon.    	1 Kg 9:23-28

The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon

10:1When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s fame that honored the LORD, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. 2She came with a large retinue, and with camels carrying spices, lots of gold, and precious stones. She talked to him about everything that was on her mind. 3He answered all her questions and explained everything. 4She saw his wisdom, the palace he’d built, 5the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway up to the LORD’s Temple. It took her breath away.

6“What I heard in my country about your words and wisdom was true. 7But I didn’t believe it till I saw it. I hadn’t heard half of it. You exceed the report I heard about your prosperity. 8How fortunate your officials are, being around you continually and listening to your wisdom! 9Bless the LORD your God who delighted to set you on Israel’s throne. Because he loved Israel forever, he made you king to do justice and goodness.”

10She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and large amounts of spices and precious stones. Never again did such an abundance of spices come in as she brought him.

11Hiram’s ships that brought gold from Ophir also brought large quantities of almug wood and precious stones. 12From the almug wood, the king made railings for the LORD’s Temple and his own palace, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Such almug wood hasn’t come in again or been seen since.

13King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for besides what he gave her on his own. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	1 Kg 10:1-13

Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor

14Each year, 25¼ tons 666 talents of gold came in to Solomon 15besides what came in from traders, merchants’ wares, the kings of Arabia, and governors of the country. 16He made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold on each one. 17He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 3¾ lbs 3 minas of gold on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 18In addition, he made a large throne out of ivory, overlaid with refined gold. 19There were 6 steps up to it, a round top on the back of it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside them. 2012 lions stood on the 2 sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 21His drinking cups were made out of gold; the items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There weren’t any silver ones; it wasn’t considered valuable in his time. 22At sea he had the ships of Tarshish with Hiram’s ships. Every three years ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.

23King Solomon became wealthier and wiser than all the other kings in the world. 24The whole world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God had put in him. 25Everybody brought a gift, silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much each year. 	1 Kg 10:14-25

26Solomon gathered 1,400 chariots and 12,000 calvary and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 27He made silver as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lower western hills. 28His merchants obtained horses from Egypt and Kue for a price. 29He imported Egyptian chariots for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver each and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver apiece. Then he exported them to the kings of the Hittites and of Aram.  	1 Kg 10:26-29

Solomon’s Wives

11:1King Solomon loved many foreign women along with Pharaoh’s daughter: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women. 2They came from the nations the LORD had told the Israelites not to associate with, “They’ll turn your heart away after their gods.” Solomon held fast to them in love. 3He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. 4When he was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods. He wasn’t wholly devoted to the LORD like David was. 5Solomon went after Ashtoreth, goddess of the Sidonians; and Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites. 6He did what was sin and didn’t follow the LORD faithfully. 7He built a high place for Chemosh, detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain east of Jerusalem, and for Molech, detestable idol of the Ammonites. 8He did that for all his foreign wives, whopl burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.	 1 Kg 11:1-8

9The LORD was angry with him because he turned his heart away. The God of Israel had appeared to him twice 10and commanded him not to go after other gods. But he didn’t obey that command. 11God told him,

“Because you’ve done this and haven’t kept my covenant and statutes, I’ll tear the kingdom from you and give it to one of your servants. 12But for David’s sake, I won’t do it in your lifetime. I’ll tear it away from your son, 13but not all of it. I’ll give him one tribe for the sake of David and Jerusalem that I’ve chosen.”

Solomon’s Adversaries

14The LORD raised up Hadad the Edomite against Solomon. He was from the royal line. 15When David was in Edom, Joab, commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain and strike down every male in Edom. (16Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he’d killed every male in Edom.) 17Hadad fled to Egypt with some of his father’s officials when he was a boy. 18They left Midian and went to Paran. They took people with them from Paran and went on to Pharaoh. He gave him a house and land and assigned him food. 19He came to like Hadad so much that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 20She had Hadad’s son Genubath and weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace. Genubath was in Pharaoh’s palace with his sons. 21But when Hadad heard that David had died and Joab was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me leave so I can go to my own country.”

22“What have you lacked with me?”

“Nothing; but you need to let me go.”	                1 Kg 11:14-22

23God raised up another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah. 24-25He gathered men and led a marauding band after David killed the people in Zobah. They went to Damascus and ruledpl Aram from there. He hated Israel and was its adversary all of Solomon’s life like Hadad was.

Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon

26Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon. He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, one of Solomon’s officials, whose mother was Zeruah, a widow. 27He rebelled when Solomon was building the Millo and closing up the breach in The City of David. 28Jeroboam was a trained soldier. When Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over the forced labor of Joseph’s house. 29During that time, when Jeroboam left Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah had dressed in a new cloak, and both of them were alone in a field. 30Ahijah took his new cloak and tore it into 12 pieces. 31He told Jeroboam,

“Take ten pieces. The LORD says, ‘I’ll tear the kingdom away from Solomon and give you ten tribes (32but he’ll have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and Jerusalem, the city I’ve chosen from the tribes). 33They’ve left me and worshiped Ashtoreth goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh god of Moab, and Milcom god of the Ammonites. They haven’t done what I’ve considered right or observed my statutes and ordinances like David did. 34I won’t take the whole kingdom away from Solomon. I’ll let him rule all his life for David’s sake, 35but I’ll take ten tribes away from his son and give them to you. 36I’ll give his son one tribe so David will always have a lamp in Jerusalem, the city I’ve chosen to identify with. 37I’ll take you, and you’ll reign over whatever you desire and be king of Israel. 38If you listen to everything I tell you like David did, I’ll be with you and build you an enduring dynasty like I built for David. 39That’s how I’ll punish David’s descendants for this, but not forever.’”

40Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he fled to Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, and stayed there till Solomon died.

Solomon’s Death

41The rest of what Solomon did and his wisdom are recorded in The Book of the Acts of Solomon. 42He ruled Israel in Jerusalem for 40 years. 43When he died, they buried him in The City of David. His son Rehoboam reigned.	    1 Kg 11:23-43

The Northern Tribes Rebel Against Rehoboam

12:1Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had come there to make him king. 2Jeroboam heard about it in Egypt. (3They sent and called him.) Jeroboam and all Israel came and told Rehoboam, 4“Your father made our yoke hard. Lighten his hard service and his heavy yoke, and we’ll serve you.” 5He said, “Leave for three days, then come back.” So they left.

6King Rehoboam consulted with the elders that had served Solomon, “How do you advise me to answer the people?” 7They said, “If you’ll serve this nation today, grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, they’ll serve you permanently.” 8But he dismissed their advice and consulted with the young men he grew up with and served him. 9“What’s your advice about answering the people, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” 10The young men said,

“Tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 11My father loaded you with a heavy yoke; I’ll add to it. My father disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.’”

12Then Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day. 13The king answered them harshly. He didn’t take the elders’ advice 14and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice, “My father made your yoke heavy; I’ll add to it. My father disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.” 15He ignored the people, a turn of affairs the LORD let happen to bring about what he’d told Jeroboam through Ahijah of Shiloh.	 1 Kg 12:1-15

16When Israel saw that he didn’t listen, they answered him,

“What part do we have in David?

We have no inheritance in Jesse’s son;

Go home, Israel!

Look after your own house, David!”

Israel went home, 17but Rehoboam ruled the Israelites that lived in Judah. 18He sent Adoram, supervisor over forced labor, and Israel stoned him to death. Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. 19Israel has been in rebellion against David’s descendants ever since. 20When all Israel heard that Jeroboam was back, they called him to the assembly and crowned him king of all Israel. No tribe but Judah stayed with David’s dynasty. 	1 Kg 12:16-20

Shemaiah’s Prophecy

21When Rehoboam got to Jerusalem, he gathered Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen soldiers, to fight Israel to restore the kingdom to himself. 22But a message from God came to Shemaiah, the man of God,

23“Tell Rehoboam, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, 24the LORD says not to fight their relatives the Israelites: go home; this thing has his approval.”

They listened and went home.    	1 Kg 12:21-24

The Gold Calves at Bethel and Dan

25Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He went out from there and built Penuel. 26He said to himself,

“The kingdom will revert to David’s descendants. 27If the people go up to offer sacrifices in the LORD’s Temple at Jerusalem, their hearts will go back to Rehoboam, and they’ll kill me.”

28So he made two gold calves and said, “It’s too much trouble to go up to Jerusalem. Look, your gods, Israel, that brought you up from Egypt!” 29He set one in Bethel and the other in Dan. 30That thing became a sin because the people went to worship at the one as far as Dan. 31He made houses on high places and appointed priests from among the people that didn’t descend from Levi. 32-33He instituted a festival in Bethel on the fifteenth day, eighth month like the festival in Judah. He went up to burn incense on the altar there and sacrificed to the calves he’d made. He stationed priests at the high places he’d made there. 	1 Kg 12:25-33

A Prophet Denounces Jeroboam

13:1A man of God went from Judah to Bethel at the LORD’s command while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. 2He cried out against the altar by a message from the LORD,

“Altar, altar, the LORD says, ‘A son named Josiah will be born among David’s descendants. He’ll sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you. He’ll burn human bones on you.’”

3He gave a sign the same day,

“The LORD has given this sign: the altar will open up and ashes pour out.”

4When the king heard what the man of God said, he reached out from the altar and said, “Arrest him!” But his hand froze, and he couldn’t draw it back. 5The altar split apart and ashes poured out like the sign had said. 6The king answered the man of God, “Ask the LORD your God to restore my hand.”

He asked the LORD, and the king’s hand became like before. 	1 Kg 13:1-6

7The king said, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I’ll give you a reward.”

8The man of God told him,

“If you gave me half of what you own, I wouldn’t go with you, eat bread, or drink water here. 9The LORD told me not to eat bread, drink water, or come back the way I came.”

10So he went back a different way.	1 Kg 13:7-10

11An old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the man of God had done that day in Bethel and what he’d told the king. 12Their father asked them which way he went. They’d seen which way he’d gone. 13“Saddle the donkey for me.” They saddled it, and he rode 14after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth tree. “Are you the man of God from Judah?”

“Yes.”

15“Come home with me and eat bread.”

16“I can’t return with you, eat bread, or drink water with you here. 17The LORD told me not to eat bread, drink water, or go back the way I came.”

18He told him,

“I’m a prophet like you. An angel from the LORD told me to bring you back to my house so you can eat bread and drink water.” He was lying.

19He went back with him and ate bread and drank water.	 1 Kg 13:11-19

20As they were sitting at the table, a message from the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back. 21He cried out to the man from Judah, “The LORD says, ‘Because you’ve disobeyed me, 22your body won’t go to your ancestors’ grave.’” 23After he’d eaten bread and drunk water, he saddled the donkey for the prophet. 24When he’d gone, a lion met him and killed him. It threw his body on the road with the donkey standing beside it. The lion stood by the body too. 25Some men passed by and saw the body and the lion standing beside it. They went and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.      			     1 Kg 13:20-25

26When the prophet heard it, he said,

“It’s the man of God that disobeyed the LORD; he let the lion tear him apart like his message had said.”

27Then he told his sons to saddle the donkey for him. 28He went and found the body on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion hadn’t eaten the body or torn the donkey. 29The old prophet picked up the body and laid it on his donkey. He brought it back to his city 30and laid it in his own grave. They mourned for him, “Ah, my brother!” 31He told his sons,

“When I die, bury me where I buried the man of God. Lay my bones beside his. 32What he cried out by the message from the LORD against the altar in Bethel and the houses at the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly happen.”

33Even after all that, Jeroboam kept following his own sinful way. Anybody that volunteered, he ordained as a priest for the high places. 34What happened became the sin in his family that destroyed it.					    1 Kg 13:26-34

Ahijah’s Prophecy Against Jeroboam

14:1At that time, Abijah, Jeroboam’sI son, got sick. 2Jeroboam told his wife,

“Disguise yourself and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there who said I’d be king. 3Take ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. He’ll tell you what will happen to the boy.”

4She went to Ahijah’s house at Shiloh. He couldn’t see because of his age. 5The LORD had told him,

“Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask about her son that’s sick. Tell her such and such; when she gets here, she’ll pretend to be another woman.”

6When Ahijah heard her footsteps coming in the door, he said,

“Come in, Jeroboam’s wife, why pretend to be another woman? I’m sent to you with a harsh message. 7Tell Jeroboam that the LORD God of Israel says, ‘I lifted you up from among the people and made you Israel’s leader. 8I tore the kingdom away from David’s descendants and gave it to you. But you’ve not been like David. He kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart and did only what I said was right. 9You’ve done more evil than anybody before you. You’ve made other gods and molten images and tossed me aside. 10So I’ll bring catastrophe on your family: I’ll eliminate from you every male, bond or free, and consume your family like a person burns up manure. 11Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field; I’ve said so.’

He’ll scatter them beyond the Euphrates River because they’ve set up their Asherah poles and made him angry. 16He’ll give Israel up over the sins Jeroboam got Israel to do.”

Abijam Rules in Judah

15:1In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah 2and ruled for 3 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 3He did the sins his father did. His heart wasn’t wholly true to the LORD like David’s was. 4But for David’s sake the LORD gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, set up his descendant after him, and made Jerusalem secure. 5He did it because David did what was right and didn’t deviate from anything the LORD commanded him his whole life—except in the matter about Uriah the Hittite.

Asa Rules in Judah

9In the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Asa began to rule in Judah 10and ruled for 41 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 11Asa did what was right like David did. 12He

put the male cult prostitutes out of the country,

removed the idols his ancestors had made,

13removed his mother from being queen mother because she’d set up a detestable Asherah pole,

14cut it down and burned it at the Brook Kidron.

He didn’t take away the high places, but his heart was true to the LORD his whole life. 15He brought to the LORD’s Temple his and his father’s dedicated gifts—silver, gold, and various articles.			     		     	     1 Kg 15:1-15

16War went on between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, their whole lives. 17Baasha went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anybody from going out or coming to Asa. 18Then Asa took the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the LORD’s Temple and delivered it to his officials. He sent them to Benhadad son of Tabrimmon son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,

19“Let’s make a treaty like your father and my father did. I’ve sent you a gift of silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha so he’ll withdraw from me.”

20Benhadad listened to Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the towns in Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and Chinneroth, besides the land of Naphtali. 21When Baasha heard it, he stopped fortifying Ramah and stayed in Tirzah. 22Then Asa made a proclamation to Judah—no one was exempt—to carry away the stones of Ramah and its timber and fortify Geba in Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.

23The rest of the acts of Asa, the strength of his rule, the towns he built are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. In his old age, he had a disease in his feet. 24He died and they buried him with his ancestors in The City of David. His son Jehoshaphat reigned.

He didn’t leave a single male among his relatives and friends. 12So Zimri destroyed Baasha’s family like the LORD had said through the prophet Jehu.  13He delivered that message because of the sins Baasha and Elah did and got Israel to do with their idols and made the LORD angry. 14The rest of the acts of Elah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.	 1 Kg 16:8-14

“Don’t worry. Do what you’ve said but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out. Then you can make one for you and your boy. 14The LORD God of Israel says the bowl of flour won’t get empty, and the jug of oil won’t go dry before it rains.”

(Obadiah respected the LORD greatly. 4When Jezebel was destroying the LORD’s prophets, he hid 100 of them by 50s in a cave and provided them bread and water.)

5“Go to the springs and valleys in the land. Maybe we’ll find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill any livestock.”

6They divided up the land to survey it. Ahab went one way and Obadiah went another.

7Elijah met Obadiah on the road. He recognized him and fell on his face, “Is that you, Elijah?”

8“It’s me. Go tell your master I’m here.”

9He said,

“How have I sinned that you’re turning me over to Ahab to execute me? 10As the LORD your God lives, he’s searched for you in every nation and kingdom. When they said you weren’t there, he’d make the kingdom or nation swear they couldn’t find you. 11Now you’re telling me to go tell him you’re here. 12When I leave, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you where I don’t know. When I tell Ahab and he can’t find you, he’ll kill me even though I’ve respected the LORD my whole life. 13Haven’t you heard what I did when Jezebel was killing his prophets? I hid 100 of them by 50s in a cave and provided them bread and water? 14Now you want me to tell my master you’re here!”

“I’m the only prophet the LORD has left; Baal has 450 of them. 23Let us have two oxen. They can choose one, cut it up, lay it on the wood, but not put any fire under it. I’ll prepare the other, lay it on the wood, and not put fire under it. 24Then you call on your god, and I’ll call on the LORD. The one that answers by fire, is God.”

The people answered, “That’s good.”

25Elijah told the Baal prophets, “Choose an ox and prepare it first; there are lots of you. Call on your god, but don’t put fire under it.” 26They prepared their ox and called on Baal from morning till noon, “Baal, answer us.” There was no answer. They leaped around the altar they’d made. 27At about noon Elijah mocked them, “Shout, because he’s a god. Either he’s occupied or has wandered off. Maybe he’s traveling or asleep and needs to be woke up.” 28As was their custom, they shouted and cut themselves with swords and lances till blood gushed out on them. 29When noon had passed, they raved till the time for evening sacrifice. But there wasn’t any voice, nobody answered, nobody paid attention. 	1 Kg 18:22-29

30Then Elijah told the crowd to come closer. He repaired the LORD’s altar that had been torn down. 31He took 12 stones corresponding to the 12 tribes of Jacob, whose name the LORD had changed to ‘Israel.’ 32With the stones, he rebuilt the altar in the LORD’s name and dug a trench around it big enough to hold more than .73 of a bushel 2 seahs of seed. 33Then he arranged the wood, cut the ox in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He told them to fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood. 34“Do it again.” “Do it a third time.” 35The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 36Then at the time of evening sacrifice, he went up to the altar and said,

“LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, show today that you’re God in Israel, that I’m your servant, that you’ve told me to do this. 37Answer me so the people can know you’re God and that you’ve brought them back to you.”

38Fire came down from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and the water in the trench. 39The people fell on their faces, “The LORD is God! The LORD is God!” 40Elijah told them, “Seize the Baal prophets. Don’t let a one of them get away.” They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon River and killed them.

The LORD Sends Rain

41Elijah told Ahab, “Go get something to eat; there’s the sound of heavy rain.” 42Ahab went to eat. Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel and crouched down with his head between his knees. 43He told his servant to go look toward the sea. He went and looked, “There’s nothing.” He said, “Go back,” seven times. 44The seventh time, the servant said, “A cloud the size of a man’s hand is coming up from the horizon.” He said, “Go tell Ahab to get his chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn’t stop him.” 45In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a downpour came. Ahab rode to Jezreel. 46The LORD was with Elijah, and he girded up and outran Ahab to Jezreel.	1 Kg 18:38-46

Elijah Flees to Sinai

19:1Ahab told Jezebel what Elijah had done, and how he’d killed the prophets with the sword. 2She sent a messenger to Elijah, “The gods do so to me and more, if I don’t make your life like theirs by tomorrow at this time.” 3He fled for his life to Beersheba in Judah and left his attendant there. 4He went on a day’s journey into the open country and sat down under a juniper tree, “That’s enough, LORD. Take my life. I’m no better than my ancestors.” 5He lay down and slept under the tree, and an angel touched him, “Get up and eat.” 6He looked and at his head was a loaf of bread baked on hot stones and a jug of water. He ate and lay back down. 7An angel of the LORD came a second time and touched him, “Get up and eat some more, or the trip will be too much for you.” 8He ate and on the strength of that food went for 40 days to Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God.	       1 Kg 19:1-8

The LORD Speaks to Elijah

9He came upon a cave and stayed there, and a message from the LORD came to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”

10He said,

“I’ve been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to kill me.”

11He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in my presence.” The LORD was passing by! A gale was tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in the LORD’s presence, but the LORD wasn’t in the wind. After the wind an earthquake came, but the LORD wasn’t in the earthquake. 12After the earthquake, fire came, but the LORD wasn’t in the fire. After the fire the sound of a gentle whisper came. 13When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. A voice came to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”	     1 Kg 19:9-13

14He said,

“I’ve been zealous for you because Israel has abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to kill me.”

15The LORD told him,

“Go back on the road to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram, 16anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. 17The one that escapes from Hazael’s sword, Jehu will kill, and the one that escapes from Jehu’s sword, Elisha will kill. 18I’ll preserve 7,000 in Israel, whose knees haven’t bowed to Baal, whose lips haven’t kissed him.”

The Call of Elisha

19He left and found Elisha plowing with 12 yokes of oxen; he was with the twelfth. Elijah went over and threw his mantle on him. 20He left the oxen and ran after Elijah, “Let me kiss my parents. Then I’ll go with you.” He told him, “Go on back, but consider what I’ve done for you.” 21He went back, took a yoke of oxen, sacrificed them, and boiled their meat with the yokes. He gave it to the people to eat. Then he got up and followed Elijah as his assistant. 	1 Kg 19:14-21

Ahab’s War with Syria

20:1Benhadad, king of Aram, gathered his army, 32 kings with horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege to Samaria and attacked it. 2He sent ambassadors to Ahab in the city, “Benhadad says, 3‘Your silver and gold are mine. Your most beautiful wives and children are mine too.’”

4The king of Israel said, “It’s according to your message, my lord king. I and everything I have are yours.”

5The ambassadors came back,

“This is what Benhadad said, ‘I sent to you saying, “You’ll give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children,” 6but about this time tomorrow I’ll send my officials to search your palace and your officials’ houses. They’ll carry off whatever you consider valuable.’”

7The king of Israel called the elders of the land, “See how this man is looking to make trouble; he sent for my wives, my children, my silver and gold. I didn’t tell him no.”

8The elders and the people advised, “Don’t agree to anything.” 	1 Kg 20:1-8

9He said to Benhadad’s ambassadors, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Everything you sent for the first time I’ll do, but I can’t do this.” The ambassadors took him that message.

10Benhadad sent to him, “May the gods do so to me and more also, if there’s enough dust left in Samaria for each of my soldiers to have a handful.”

11The king of Israel answered, “The one that puts on his armor shouldn’t brag like the one that takes it off.”

12When Benhadad heard it, he was drinking with the kings in temporary shelters and told his officers, “Take your positions.”

They took their positions against the city.	 1 Kg 20:9-12

Ahab Defeats Ben-Hadad Again

13A prophet approached Ahab, “The LORD says, ‘I’ll deliver this big army to you today, and you’ll know I’m the LORD.’”

14Ahab said, “Who’ll do it?”

“The LORD says the young men of the rulers in the province.”

“Who’ll begin the battle?”

“You.”

15He mustered the troops of the 232 provinces, 7,000 Israelites.

16They went out at noon while Benhadad was getting drunk in temporary shelters with his allied 32 kings. 17Israel’s troops went out first.

Benhadad sent out an inquiry, and they told him, “Troops have come out of Samaria.”

18“If they’ve come out either for peace or war, take them alive.”

19The troops came out of the city along with the entire army. 20They each killed their man, the Arameans fled, and Israel chased them. Benhadad escaped on a horse with the cavalry. 21The king of Israel struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter.	1 Kg 20:13-21

22The prophet came to the king, “Make plans for another attack. At the first of the year, the king of Aram will come back.”

23Now the officers of Aram’s king told him,

“Their gods are mountain gods; so they were stronger than we were. Let’s fight them on the plains. We’ll surely be stronger than they are. 24Put a commander in place of each king. 25Muster an army like the one you’ve lost, horse for horse, chariot for chariot. Then fight them in the plain; we’ll surely be stronger than they are.”	 1 Kg 20:22-25

26At the first of the year, Benhadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight Israel. 27The Israelites mustered, gathered provisions, and went to meet them. They camped there like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the countryside. 28Then a man of God came up and told the king of Israel,

“The LORD says, ‘Because the Arameans have said I’m a mountain god, not a god of the valleys, I’ll give this great army to you; you’ll know I’m the LORD.’”

29They camped against one another for a week. The seventh day, the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 foot soldiers in one day. 30The rest fled into Aphek, and the wall fell on 27,000 more. Benhadad fled to the city into an inner room.	 1 Kg 20:26-30

31His officers told him, “We’ve heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let’s put burlap around our waists and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he’ll let you live.” 32So they put burlap around their waists and ropes on their heads, and went to the king of Israel, “Benhadad says, ‘Please don’t kill me.’”

He said, “Is my brother still alive?”

33The officers quickly picked up on his word and said, “Your brother Benhadad.” He said, “Go bring him here.” Benhadad came out, and he took him up into the chariot.

34Benhadad told him, “I’ll restore the towns my father took from your father, and you’ll make streets in Damascus like my father did in Samaria.” Ahab said, “And I’ll let you go with this treaty.” He made a treaty with him and let him go.	 1 Kg 20:31-34

A Prophet Condemns Ahab’s Release

35One man from the company of prophets said to another by a message from the LORD, “Strike me,” but he wouldn’t do it. 36“Because you’ve ignored the LORD, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.” That’s what happened.

37He found another man, “Strike me.” He struck him and wounded him.

38The prophet left and waited for the king by the road. He disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. 39As the king went by, he shouted,

“I went into the battle, and a man brought a fellow over and said, ‘Guard this man. If he’s missing for any reason, it’s your life for his, or you’ll pay 75½ lbs a talent of silver.’ 40While I was busy here and there, he got away.”

The king told him, “That’s what your judgment will be. You’ve decided it yourself.”

41Right away he took the bandage off his eyes, and the king recognized he was one of the prophets. 42He told him, “The LORD says, since you let the man go that he’d devoted to destruction, it’s your life for his and your people for his.’”

43The king of Israel went home to Samaria sullen and resentful.	1 Kg 20:35-43

Naboth’s Vineyard

21:1After this, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel beside King Ahab’s palace. 2Ahab spoke to him about it, “Give me your vineyard so I can use it for a vegetable garden; it’s close to my palace. I’ll trade you a better vineyard for it.”

3But Naboth said, “The LORD forbid me from giving you my ancestors’ inheritance.”

4Ahab went home sullen and resentful. He lay down on his bed and turned away and wouldn’t eat.

5His wife Jezebel came in, “Why are you so sullen you won’t eat?”

6“I asked Naboth to let me buy his vineyard or trade him for another one, but he wouldn’t do it.’” 	1 Kg 21:1-6

7Jezebel said, “Do you rule Israel? Get up, eat something, and be happy. I’ll get you his vineyard.” 8She wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles in Naboth’s town, 9“Declare a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place. 10Put two worthless fellows with him and have them accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him.”

11The elders and nobles 12declared a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place. 13The two worthless fellows came in and sat down with him, and started accusing him of cursing God and the king. They took him outside the city and stoned him, 14and sent word to Jezebel. 15She told Ahab, “Go take Naboth’s vineyard; he’s dead.” 16He got up to go down and take it. 	1 Kg 21:7-16

17Then a message from the LORD came to Elijah,

18“Meet Ahab in Naboth’s vineyard. He’s gone down to confiscate it. 19Tell him I’ve said, ‘Have you murdered and confiscated? Where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, they’ll lick up yours.’”

20Ahab said, “Have you found me, my enemy?”

“I’ve found you because you’ve sold yourself to doing evil in the LORD’s presence. 21‘I’ll bring evil on you and completely sweep you away. I’ll remove from you every male in Israel, bond or free, 22and make your dynasty like Jeroboam’s and Baasha’s; you’ve made me angry and got Israel to sin.’ 23The LORD has also said dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel. 24Dogs will eat any relative that dies in the city; birds will eat any that die in the field.”

25Nobody had sold himself to doing evil like Ahab did, influenced by his wife. 26He acted horribly in following idols like the Amorites had done that the LORD originally drove out.

27When Ahab heard that, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and fasted. He lay down in burlap and walked around in mourning. 28Then a message came to Elijah, 29“See how Ahab has humbled himself? Since he’s done that, I won’t do what I’d promised during his lifetime. I’ll bring it on his family during his son’s life.”	 1 Kg 21:17-29

Ahab and the False Prophets

22:1Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 2In the third year, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to visit the king of Israel. 3The king of Israel said to his officials, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we’re still not doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram?” 4He asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?”

Jehoshaphat said, “I’m like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours.” 5He added, “Let’s ask first for a message from the LORD.”

6The king of Israel gathered the prophets—about 400 men, “Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”

“Yes, the LORD will deliver it to you.”

7But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there still a prophet of the LORD we can ask?”

8The king said, “There’s still one, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I despise him; he never prophesies anything good about me.”

9“Don’t say that.”	 1 Kg 22:1-9

10The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes at the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria. The prophets were prophesying there. 11Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns for himself and said, “The LORD says you’ll gore the Arameans with these till they’re consumed.” 12The prophets were all prophesying, “Attack Ramoth-gilead. The LORD will deliver it to you.”

Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab

13The messenger to Micaiah told him, “The prophets agree in giving a favorable report to the king. Make your report like theirs.”

14But Micaiah swore, “As sure as the LORD lives, I’ll say what he tells me.”

15When he came, the king said, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”

He answered, “Go right on up there! The LORD is going to deliver it to you!!”

16The king said, “How many times do I have to make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the LORD’s name?”

17He said,

“I saw Israel scattered on the mountains

like sheep without a shepherd.

The LORD said, ‘They don’t have a master anymore;

they need to go home in peace.’”	 1 Kg 22:10-17

18The king told Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me?”

19Micaiah said,

“Listen to the LORD’s message. I saw him on his throne and the host in heaven standing on his left and right. 20He said, ‘Who will lure Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ One said this, another said that. 21Then a spirit came forward, ‘I’ll lure him.’

22‘How?’

‘By being a deceiving spirit in his prophets.’

‘Go do it.’”

23Micaiah said, “The LORD has put a deceiving spirit in your prophets. He’s declared disaster for you.”	 1 Kg 22:18-23

24Zedekiah came up and hit him on the cheek, “How did the LORD’s Spirit pass from me to speak to you?”

25“You’ll see when you’re hiding in an inner room.”

26The king said, “Take Micaiah to Amon, governor of the city, and to Joash my son. 27Tell them the king says to put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I come back safely.’”

28Micaiah said, “If you ‘come back safely,’ the LORD hasn’t spoken by me. Listen to that, all of you.”

29Ahab and Jehoshaphat went up against Ramoth-gilead.

Ahab Killed in Battle

30Ahab told Jehoshaphat, “I’ll disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 31The king of Aram had told the 32 captains of his chariots, “Don’t fight anybody great or small except the king of Israel.” 32When the captains saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they said, “That has to be the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to attack him, and he cried out. 33When they saw it wasn’t the king of Israel, they turned back.	 1 Kg 22:24-33

34An Aramean archer drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, “Turn around and get me out of the fight. I’m seriously wounded.” 35The battle raged that day; the king was propped up in his chariot in sight of the Arameans and died that evening. The blood from the wound ran down onto the bottom of the chariot. 36Then a shout went through the army just before sundown, “Every man to his city and country.”

37The king died; they took him to Samaria and buried him. 38They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood (where the prostitutes took baths) like the LORD had said. 39The rest of the acts of Ahab, the ivory palace he built, the towns he built are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 40His son Ahaziah became king.  	1 Kg 22:34-40

Jehoshaphat Rules in Judah

41Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king in Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel. 42He was 35 and ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 43He followed the ways of Asa in doing what was right, but he didn’t take away the high places. People sacrificed and burned incense there. 44He also made peace with the king of Israel.

45The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the strength he showed in his rule, the wars he fought, are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 46He expelled from the land the remnant of shrine sodomites from his father’s reign. 47There wasn’t any king in Edom; a deputy served as king. 48Jehoshaphat built ships from Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t make it; they wrecked at Ezion-geber. 49Then Ahab’s son Ahaziah said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men go with yours in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat wouldn’t let them. 50He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Jehoram became king.	 1 Kg 22:41-50

The LORD’s Judgment on Ahaziah

1:1After Ahab died, Moab revolted against Israel.

2Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper room in Samaria and seriously injured himself. He told messengers to go ask Baal-zebub, Ekron’s god, if he’d recover. 3But the angel of the LORD told Elijah the Tishbite,

“Go meet the king’s messengers and say, ‘Are you asking Baal-zebub because there’s no God in Israel?’ 4So the LORD says you won’t get out of bed. You’ll die.”

Then Elijah left.

5When the messengers came back, he said, “Why’d you come back?”

6“A man came up to us and said to go back and tell you that the LORD says, ‘Are you asking Baal-zebub because there’s no God in Israel? You won’t get out of bed.’”

7“What did he look like?”

8“He was wearing a leather belt and clothes made out of hair.”

10“If I’m a ‘man of God,’ fire from the sky will consume you and your 50 men.” That’s what happened.

11He sent another captain with his 50 men. “Man of God, the king says to come down now!”

12“If I’m a ‘man of God,’ fire from the sky will consume you and your 50 men.” That’s what happened.

13He sent a third captain with his 50 men. When the captain came up, he knelt to Elijah, begging him,

“Man of God, please value my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours. 14Fire from the sky consumed the first two captains with their men. Regard my life as worth something to you.”

15The angel of the LORD told Elijah, “Go with him; don’t be afraid of him.”

16Elijah told Ahaziah,

“The LORD says, ‘Is there no God in Israel? Since you’ve asked Baal-zebub, you won’t get out of bed.’”

17He died, and Jehoram became king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah didn’t have a son. 18The rest of his acts are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.	2 Kg 1:9-18

Elijah Taken Up to Heaven

2:1The LORD was getting ready to take Elijah up in a tornado. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal 2and told him, “Stay here. The LORD has sent me to Bethel.”

“As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won’t leave you.” They went down to Bethel. 3The company of prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha, “Do you know the LORD’s going to take your master away today?”

“Yes, I know. Keep it to yourselves.”

4Elijah told him, “Stay here. The LORD has sent me to Jericho.”

“As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won’t leave you.” They went on to Jericho. 5The company of prophets in Jericho came to Elisha, “Do you know the LORD’s going to take your master away today?”

“Yes, I know. Keep it to yourselves.”

6Elijah told him. “Stay here. The LORD has sent me to the Jordan.”

He said, “As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won’t leave you.” They continued on.

7Fifty men from the company came and stood at a distance on the other side of the Jordan while the two of them stood on this side. 8Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water. It separated from one side to the other, so the two of them crossed on dry riverbed. 9Then Elijah asked Elisha, “What should I do for you before I leave?”

“Put a double portion of your spirit on me.”

10“You’re asking for a lot. But if you see me when the LORD’s taking me away, your request will happen. If you don’t, it won’t.”

11As they went along talking, a flaming chariot with flaming horses appeared and separated them. Elijah ascended to the sky in a tornado. 12Elisha saw it and cried out, “Father! Father! The chariotry of Israel and its drivers!” He never saw him again. He tore his clothes, 13picked up the mantle that Elijah had dropped, and went back to the Jordan. 14He struck the water with it and said, “Where’s the LORD, Elijah’s God?” The water separated from one side to the other, and he went back across.	2 Kg 2:7-14

15The school of the prophets in Jericho saw what happened, “Elijah’s spirit is resting on Elisha.” They came to meet him and bowed to the ground, 16“Please let these fifty strong men go look for your master. Maybe the wind from the LORD has taken him up and dropped him on some mountain or in some valley.”

He said, “Don’t do that.” 17They urged him till he felt embarrassed, “Go ahead, then.” They sent the 50 men, who searched for three days without finding him. 18They came back while Elisha was at Jericho.

“Didn’t I tell you not to go?”

Elisha Heals the Water

19Then the men in the city told Elisha, “This city is a nice place to live in, as you can see, but the water’s bad and the ground causes barrenness.”

20He said, “Bring me a new jug and put salt in it.”

They brought one, 21and he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it, “The LORD says he’s purified the water. It won’t cause death or barrenness anymore.” 22The water is still pure.

Forty-Two Youths Jeer Elisha

23As he was climbing the road from there to Bethel, some young boys came out of the city to taunt him, “Ascend, baldy! Ascend, baldy!”

Moab Revolts

3:1JehoramII son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and ruled for 12 years. 2He did evil, though not as bad as his parents. He did put away Baal’s sacred pillar his father had built, 3but he held onto the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin.

4Mesha, king of Moab, raised sheep and was paying the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams. 5But when Ahab died, he revolted. 6JehoramII went out from Samaria and mustered all Israel. 7He sent word to Jehoshaphat, “The king of Moab has revolted against me. Will you help me fight Moab?”

“Yes, I’m like you, my troops like yours, my horses like yours.”

The LORD has called these three kings to deliver them to Moab!” 11But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of the LORD here we can ask?”

One of the king’s officials answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat. He used to pour water on Elijah’s hands.”

12Jehoshaphat agreed, “He prophesies for the LORD.”

The king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.

“As the LORD of Hosts lives that I serve, if it weren’t that I care about Jehoshaphat, I wouldn’t even look at yousg. 15Bring me a musician.”

While the musician played, the LORD came on him. 16He said,

“The LORD says to fill this valley with trenches. 17You won’t see wind or rain, but the valley will be full of water for you, your cattle, and other animals. 18This is just a little thing for the LORD to deliver the Moabites to you. 19Then strike every fortified city, every select city, cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring, and trash every cultivated piece of land with rocks.’”

20The next day about the time of morning sacrifice, water flowed down from Edom, and the country was full of water.	 2 Kg 3:14-20

21The Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight them. They called in everybody that could put on armor and stationed themselves along the border. 22When they got up early, the morning sun was reflecting off the water. From a distance it looked red like blood. 23They said, “The kings must have fought and killed one another. Now Moab, to your spoils!” 24But when they got to the camp, the Israelites rose up and struck them, and they fled. The Israelites advanced into the land, slaughtering the Moabites. 25They destroyed their towns, and each one threw a rock on every piece of cultivated land and trashed it. They stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees till in Kir-hareseth only they left its rocks alone. But the stone slingers surrounded it and attacked it. 26When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took 700 swordsmen to break through near the king of Edom, but they couldn’t. 27Then he took his oldest son, who was to reign, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. Great horror came over Israel, and they went home.	 2 Kg 3:21-27

The Widow’s Oil Jar

4:1The wife of a man from the company of prophets cried out to Elisha, “My husband’s dead. You know how he respected the LORD. A creditor has come to take my two children as his slaves.”

2“What can I do? What do you have in the house?”

“Nothing but a jug of oil.”

3He said,

“Borrow containers from your neighbors—not just a few. 4You and your sons go in and shut the door. Pour the oil into those containers and set the full ones aside.”

5She went in and shut the door. They brought her the containers, and she poured out the oil. 6When they were full, she told her son, “Bring me another one.”

He said, “There aren’t any more.” The oil stopped.

7She went and told the man of God.

He said, “Sell the oil to pay your debt. You and your sons can use the rest.” 	2 Kg 4:1-7

The Shunammite’s Son Resurrected

8Elisha passed over to Shunem, where a well-to-do woman lived. She persuaded him to eat there. So, whenever he went by, he’d stop there to eat. 9She told her husband,

“I sense that this is a holy man of God. 10Let’s build a small upper room with walls, and put a bed, table and chair, and lampstand in there for him. When he comes, he can turn in there.”

11One day he came and turned in to the upper room and rested. 12He told Gehazi his servant to call the Shunammite.

When she came, 13Elisha told him to tell her, “You’ve taken care of us so often. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you?”

She answered, “I live among my own people.”

14He asked Gehazi, “What can we do for her?”

“She doesn’t have a son, and her husband is elderly.”

15“Call her.”

She came to the doorway. 16He said, “At this time next year, you’ll be holding a son.”

“Man of God, don’t give me false hope!” 17She did get pregnant and had a son at that time the next year.	 2 Kg 4:8-17

18When the boy was growing up, he went out to his father and the harvest crew one day, 19and told him, “My head hurts! my head hurts!” He told his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 20When he got him to her, the boy sat on her lap till noon and died. 21She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, shut the door, and went out. 22She called her husband, “Send me a servant and a donkey so I can go quick to the man of God and back.”

23“Why go to him today? It’s not a new moon or Sabbath.”

She said, “It’ll be good.” 24She saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Drive the animal! Don’t slow down unless I tell you.” 25She went to the man of God on Mount Carmel. When he saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi, “That’s the Shunammite. 26Run and ask her if she and her husband and boy are all right.”

She answered, “Yes.” 	2 Kg 4:18-27

27When she came to the man of God on the hill, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came to pull her away, but he said, “Let her alone; she’s upset. The LORD hasn’t revealed it to me.”

28She said, “Did I ask you for a son? Didn’t I say not to give me false hope?”

29He told Gehazi, “Gird up*, take my staff, and go. Don’t greet anybody. If anybody greets you, don’t answer. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.” 30The mother swore, “As sure as the LORD lives and you live, I won’t leave without you.” He went along. 31Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but he didn’t make a sound or respond. Gehazi went back and told him, “The boy hasn’t woken up.” 32When Elisha went into the house, the boy was dead on the bed. 33He went in, shut the door, and prayed to the LORD. 34He went and lay down on the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands, and stretched out on him. The child’s body got warm. 35He came back and paced back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched out on him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 36He called Gehazi, “Call her.” When she came in, he said, “Pick up your boy.” 37She fell at his feet and bowed to the floor. She picked up the boy and went out.  	2 Kg 4:28-37

The Toxic Gourds

38When Elisha got back to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As men from the company of prophets were sitting with him, he told Gehazi, “Put on a large pot and heat stew for them.” 39One of them went out into the field to gather plants, found a wild vine, and gathered his lap full of gourds from it. He came and sliced them into the pot of stew. They didn’t know what they were. 40They poured it out for the people to eat. After they’d eaten a little, they cried out, “Man of God, there’s poison in this stew!” 41He said, “Bring some meal.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.”  Then there wasn’t anything harmful in it.

Bread for a Hundred Men

42A man came from Baal-shalishah and brought the man of God bread in a sack from the first fruit of his harvest: 20 barley loaves made from fresh grain. Elisha said, “Give them to the people to eat.” 43His attendant said, “What? How can I feed 100 men with this?” But he said, “Give it to them; the LORD says they’ll eat and have some left over.” 44He set it in front of them, and they ate and had some left over.	 2 Kg 4:38-44

Naaman’s Leprosy Healed

5:1Naaman, commander of Aram’s army, was a great man with his master and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a mighty soldier, but he was a leper. 2The Arameans had gone out in bands and taken captive a little girl from Israel, who became a maid for Naaman’s wife. 3She told her mistress, “I wish my master would go see the prophet that’s in Samaria. He’d cure his leprosy.”

4Naaman went in and told his master what she’d said.

5The king said, “Go ahead. I’ll send a letter to the king of Israel.”

He left with 755 lbs 10 talents of silver, 150 lbs 6,000 shekels of gold, and 10 changes of clothes. 6He took the letter to king Ahab and said, “Along with this letter, I’ve sent my servant Naaman so you can cure his leprosy.”

7When he read it, he tore his clothes,

“Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man is sending me a message to cure a man from leprosy? He’s trying to pick a fight.”	 2 Kg 5:1-7

8When Elisha heard the king had torn his clothes, he sent him a message, “Why tear your clothes? Send him to me. He’ll know there’s a prophet in Israel.” 9Naaman went with his horses and chariots, and stood at Elisha’s door. 10Elisha sent his messenger to him, “Go dip yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Your flesh will be restored, and you’ll be clean.” 11Naaman was furious and left,

“I thought surely he’d come out and call on the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place to cure a leper. 12Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than any river in Israel? Couldn’t I have dipped myself in them to be clean?”

He turned around and left in a rage.

13His officers came up to him,

“Father, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, wouldn’t you have done it? How much more when he just says to dip yourself to be clean?”

14He went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan. His flesh became like a little child’s, and he was clean. 	2 Kg 5:8-14

15He went back to the man of God with his company, stood in front of him, and said, “Now I know there’s no God except in Israel. Please accept a present from me.”

16But Elisha swore, “As sure as the LORD lives that I serve, I won’t take a thing.”

He urged him to take it, but he refused.

17Naaman said,

“If not, please let me at least have two mules’ loads of dirt, because I won’t offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD. 18May the LORD pardon me when my master goes into Rimmon’s temple to worship and leans on my hand and I bow there too.”

19He told him, “Have a good day.”

He went away to go home.	2 Kg 5:15-19

20Gehazi thought, “My master has spared this Naaman the Aramean by not accepting what he brought. As sure as the LORD lives, I’ll run and accept something from him.” 21When Naaman saw somebody running after him, he got down out of the chariot to meet him, “Is everything all right?”

22He said,

“Everything’s fine. My master sent me to say that two young men from the school of the prophets just came from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them 75½ lbs a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.”

23Naaman said, “Please take 151 lbs two talents.”	    2 Kg 5:20-23a

He urged him and put 151 lbs two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his men to carry ahead of him. 24When Gehazi got to the hill, he took them and put them in the house, and they left. 25But when he went inside, Elisha said, “Where’ve you been?”

“I didn’t go anywhere.”

26Didn’t my spirit go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and clothes, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants? 27You and your descendants will permanently have to cope with leprosy like Naaman’s.”

He went away as a leper as white as snow. 	2 Kg 5:23b-27

The Floating Axhead

6:1The school of the prophets told Elisha,

“There’s not enough room where we’re living. 2Let us go to the Jordan, and each take a log to build a place there to live.”

“Go ahead.”

3One of them asked him to come along

4He went along to the Jordan, and they started cutting down trees.

5But as one of them was cutting down a tree for a beam, the axe head fell in the water. He cried out, “Master! I borrowed it!”

6The man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.

7He said, “Pick it up.” He reached out and took it.	 2 Kg 6:1-7

Elisha Traps Blinded Arameans

8The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He advised his officers, “I’m going to camp in such and such a place.” 9The man of God sent a message to the king of Israel, “Don’t go near that place; the Arameans are coming down there.” 10The king of Israel sent to where the man of God told him. He warned him more than once, so he guarded himself there.

11The king of Aram was mad and called his officers, “Who’s been an informant for the king of Israel?”

12One of the officers said, “No, my lord the king! Elisha the prophet in Israel tells him what you say in your bedroom.”

13“Go see where he is so I can send and capture him.”

He found out he was in Dothan.

14The king of Aram sent horses, chariots, and a big army and surrounded the city at night.

2 Kg 6:8-14

15When the man of God’s attendant got up early and went out, an army was circling the city with horses and chariots. He said, “Master! What are we going to do?”

16“Don’tbe afraid. There are more with us than with them. 17Show him, LORD.”

The LORD let him see that the mountains all around were full of horses and flaming chariots. 18When they came down to him, Elisha prayed, “Strike them with blindness.” He did. 19Elisha told them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me and I’ll take you to the man you’re looking for.” He took them to Samaria.

20When they got there, Elisha said, “LORD, let them see.” He let them see again that they were in the middle of Samaria. 21When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Father! Should I kill them?”

22“No. Would you kill the ones you’ve taken captive with your sword and bow? Give them bread and water so they can eat and drink and go home to their master.”

23He prepared a big banquet for them. When they’d eaten, he sent them away. Marauding bands from Aram never came into Israel again.	 2 Kg 6:15-23

Severe Famine in Samaria

24After that, Benhadad, king of Aram, gathered his army, went up, and laid siege to Samaria. 25There was a severe famine in Samaria, and they laid siege to it till a donkey’s head sold for 2 lbs 80 shekels of silver and a pint ¼  cab of pigeon manure sold for 2 oz 5 shekels of silver.

26As the king was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help, my lord the king.” 27He said, “If the LORD doesn’t help you, where will I help you from? From the threshing floor or the winepress? 28What’s the matter with you?”

She answered,

“This woman said to me, ‘Give your son so we can eat him today, and we’ll eat my son tomorrow.’ 29We boiled my son and ate him, and I told her the next day, ‘Give your son so we can eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”

30When the king heard it, he tore his clothes—he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked, and he had burlap under his body. 31Then he said, “God do so to me and more if Elisha’s head remains on him today.”	 2 Kg 6:24-31

32Elisha and the elders were sitting in his house. The king sent a man; but before he got there, Elisha told the elders,

“Do you see how this murderer’s son has sent to take away my head? When the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”

33While he was still talking, the messenger came down to him, and he said, “This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?” 	2 Kg 6:32-33

The Siege of Samaria Lifted

7:1Elisha said, “Listen to the LORD’s message, ‘Tomorrow about now, .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour will sell for .4 oz a shekel of silver, and .73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for .4 oz a shekel in Samaria’s gate.’”

2The royal officer whose hand the king was leaning on answered, “If the LORD opened floodgates in the sky, could that be?”

He said, “You’ll see it yourself, but you won’t eat any.

3Four lepers were sitting at the entrance to the city gate. They talked among themselves, “Why are we sitting here till we die? 4If we go into the city, we’ll starve to death. If we sit here, we’ll die.” 5As it was getting dark, they went to the Arameans’ camp. When they got to the edge of it, nobody was there. 6The LORD had made the army hear the chariots and horses of a big army. They told one another, “The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.” 7They ran for their lives in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses and donkeys, and the camp just like it was. 8When the lepers got to the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothes, and hid them. They went back into another tent and carried things away and hid them.         	2 Kg 7:1-8

9Then they said,

“What we’re doing is not right. There’s good news, but we’re not telling it. If we wait till morning light, we’ll suffer for it. Come on, let’s tell the king’s household.”

10They went and called to the city gatekeepers, “We went to the Arameans’ camp, and nobody was there, not a human voice, just horses and donkeys tied up and tents standing there.”

11The gatekeepers called out to the king’s household.

12The king got up during the night and told his officers,

“The Arameans know we’re starving; they’ve left camp to hide in the countryside. When we come out of the city, they’ll capture us and get into the city.”

13One of his officers answered,

“Have some men take five of the horses left in the city. They’ll be like the great number that’s left in it anyway. They’ll be like the big number in Israel that have already perished. Let’s send and see.”

14The king sent two chariots with horses to look for the Aramean army, 15and they tracked them to the Jordan. All along the road were clothes and equipment they’d thrown away as they fled. The messengers came back and told the king.       	2 Kg 7:9-15

16The people went out and plundered Aram’s camp; .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour sold for a shekel and .73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for a shekel—like the LORD had said. 17The king appointed the royal officer he depended on to take charge of the gate, but the people trampled him. He died like the man of God had said when the king came down to him: 18“.73 bushel 2 seahs of barley for a shekel, .36 bushel 1 seah of fine flour for a shekel, will sell tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria.”

19The royal officer had answered the man of God, “If the LORD opened the floodgates in the sky, could such a thing happen?”

He said, “You’ll see it for yourself, but you won’t eat any of it.”

The LORD has called for a seven-year famine here.” 2They went to stay with the Philistines. 3Seven years later, she came back and appealed to the king for her house and farm. 4He was talking to Gehazi, the man of God’s servant, “Tell me the great things Elisha has done.” 5As he was telling him how he’d restored life to a boy, she appealed to the king for her house and farm. Gehazi said, “My lord the king, that’s the woman, and that’s her son!” 6When the king asked her, she told him about it.

Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad

7Elisha went to Damascus. Benhadad, king of Aram, was sick and heard that the man of God was there. 8He told Hazael, “Take him a gift and ask the LORD by him if I’ll recover.” 9Hazael went to meet him with a gift, every kind of good thing in Damascus—40 camel loads. He stood in front of him and said, “Your son Benhadad, king of Aram, has sent me to ask you if he’ll recover from his sickness.”

10Elisha said, “He’ll recover, but the LORD has shown me that he’ll certainly die.” 11He stared at him till he was embarrassed, and the man of God cried.

12Hazael said, “Why are you crying, Sir?”

“Because I know the terrible things you’ll do to Israel. You’ll set their fortresses on fire, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.”

13“What am I, a dog, to do things like that?”

Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you’ll be king of Aram.”

14He went back to his master, who said, “What did Elisha say to you?”

“He said you’d recover.”

Jehoram Rules in Judah

16In the fifth year of Joram/Jehoram son of Ahab, king of Israel—who ruled at the time of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah—Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king. 17He was 32 and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 18He followed Israel’s kings like Ahab had done because he’d married Ahab’s daughter. He did evil, 19but for David’s sake the LORD wasn’t willing to destroy Judah. He’d promised to always give him a lamp through his descendants.

20During his reign, Edom revolted from Judah and appointed a king. 21Joram and his chariots crossed over to Zair. He got up at night and struck at the Edomites that had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots, but his army fled to their tents. 22Edom has been in revolt against Judah ever since. 23The rest of the acts of Joram/Jehoram are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 24He died and they buried him in The City of David.

His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. 27He did evil like Ahab’s family had done because he was Ahab’s son-in-law. 28He went to war along with Joram against Hazael, king of Aram in Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded him. 29King Joram came back to Jezreel to heal up.

Tell him to get up from his companions and take him to a room inside. 3Pour the flask of olive oil on his head and say, ‘The LORD says, “I’ve anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and run.”

“You, Sir.” 	2 Kg 9:1-5

He opened the door and ran.

11Jehu came out to the other officers, and one of them asked, “Is everything all right? Why did that mad fellow come to you?”

He said, “You know very well how a man like him can babble.”

12“That’s not what happened. Tell us.”

Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah

14Jehu plotted against Joram. With all Israel, Joram had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram, 15but he’d gone back to Jezreel to heal from wounds he got from the Arameans. Jehu said, “If you agree, don’t let anybody leave the city to tell it in Jezreel.”

16Then Jehu rode a chariot to Jezreel because Joram was lying there healing. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram. 17A watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s company of soldiers, “A company is coming.”

Joram said, “Send a horseman to meet them and ask him if he’s coming in peace.”

18A horseman went to meet him, “The king asks if you’re coming in peace.”

Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Defect and follow me.”

The watchman reported, “The messenger went to them, but didn’t come back.”

19He sent out a second horseman, “The king asks if you’re coming in peace.”

Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Defect and follow me.”

20The watchman reported, “He went to them, but didn’t come back. His driving is furious like Jehu’s.”	 2 Kg 9:14-20

21Joram said, “Get my chariot ready.” They got it ready. Joram and Ahaziah went out in their chariots to meet Jehu and found him on Naboth’s property. 22When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Are you coming in peace, Jehu?”

“What peace, with so many of your mother’s prostitutions and witchcrafts?”

23Joram reined around and fled. He told Ahaziah, “It’s treason!”

24Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms. The arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot. 25Then Jehu told Bidkar his officer,

“Pick him up and throw him on Naboth’s field. Remember when we were riding behind his father Ahab, the LORD laid this oracle against him: 26‘I certainly saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday. I’ll pay you back on that property.’ Throw him on the property like the LORD said.”

27When Ahaziah saw that, he fled past the garden house. Jehu chased him and said, “Shoot him, too, in the chariot.” They shot him at the ascent of Gur, at Ibleam. He fled as far as Megiddo and died. 28His servants hauled him to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in his own grave with his ancestors in The City of David. 29Ahaziah had become king in Judah in the eleventh year of Joram.	 2 Kg 9:21-29

Jezebel Killed

30When Jehu arrived at Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, and put on eye shadow and adorned her head, and looked out the window. 31When Jehu came in the gate, she said, “Is everything all right, Zimri, your master’s murderer?”

32He looked up at the window and said, “Who’s with me?”

Two of the three officials looked down.

33“Throw her down.”

They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and the horses, and he tramped her under his horses hooves. 34He came in and ate, and said, “See to that cursed woman and bury her. She is a king’s daughter.” 35They went to bury her, but they couldn’t find any of her except skull, feet, and palms. 36They came back and told him. He said,

Ahab’s Family Killed

10:1Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters to Samaria, to the rulers in Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab’s children,

2“When you get this letter, since your master’s sons are with you—as well as the chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons—3select the best and fittest son, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s family.”

4But they were too afraid, “Two kings couldn’t stand against him. How can we?”

5The steward of the household, the mayor of the city, the elders, and the guardians of the children sent Jehu a message, “We’re your servants; we’ll do whatever you say. We won’t make anybody king. Do what you want to.” 6He wrote them a second letter,

“If you’re with me, take the heads of your master’s sons and meet me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.”	 2 Kg 10:1-6a

The chief men in the city were raising the king’s sons. 7When the letter came, they killed his 70 sons, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.

8A messenger told him, “They’ve brought the heads of the king’s sons.”

He said, “Put them in two piles at the entrance to the gate till morning.”

9In the morning he went out and told the people,

“You’re innocent. I plotted against your master and killed him, but who killed all these? 10Know then that nothing the LORD said about Ahab’s family will fall to the ground. He’s done what he said through Elijah.”

11Jehu killed everybody from Ahab’s family in Jezreel, as well as his chief men, acquaintances, and priests. There weren’t any survivors.

12He left and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 13he met the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah, “Who are you?”

“Ahaziah’s relatives. We’ve come down to greet the king’s sons and the queen mother.”

14He said, “Take them alive.”

They took them alive and then decided to kill every one of them at the pit at Beth-eked—42 men.				    2 Kg 10:6b-14

15When he left there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechad, coming to meet him. He greeted him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?”

“Yes.”

Jehu said, “Give me your hand.” He took him up into the chariot, 16“Come with me and see how devoted I am to the LORD.” He had him ride in his chariot.  17When he got to Samaria, he killed everybody that remained to Ahab there—like the LORD told Elijah.

The Baal Prophets Killed

18Then Jehu got the people together and told them,

“Ahab served Baal a little; I’ll serve him a lot. 19Call the Baal prophets, worshipers, and priests. Make sure everybody’s here because I’m holding a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever’s absent won’t live.”

But it was a trick to destroy the Baal worshipers. 20He said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” They declared it. 21He sent all over Israel and the Baal worshipers came. There wasn’t a man that didn’t go into Baal’s temple and fill it end to end. 22He told the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for the worshipers.” He did that. 23Jehu went in with Jehonadab and told the Baal worshipers, “Make sure there aren’t any worshipers of the LORD.” 24Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stationed 80 men outside, “Whoever lets a man escape that I bring to you will give his life in exchange for it.” 	2 Kg 10:15-24

25As soon as he’d finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and royal officers, “Go in, kill them; don’t let anybody get out.” They killed them with swords, and the guard and royal officers threw them out. They went to the inner room of Baal’s temple 26and brought out the sacred pillars and burned them. 27They demolished his sacred pillar, tore down his temple, and made it a toilet ever since. 28So Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.

29But, Jehu didn’t stop the sins Jeroboam caused Israel to do—the gold calves at Bethel and Dan. 30The LORD told him, “Since you’ve done to Ahab’s family what I wanted, your descendants will sit on Israel’s throne for four generations.” 31But Jehu wasn’t careful to follow the Law of the LORD with all his heart. 	2 Kg 10:25-31

32Then the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout Israel’s territory: 33from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer by the valley of the Arnon—Gilead and Bashan. 34The rest of the acts of Jehu and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 35He died and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became king. 36Jehu ruled Israel for 28 years in Samaria. 	2 Kg 10:32-36

Queen Athaliah and Joash

11:1When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw her son was dead, she destroyed the other royal offspring. 2But Jehosheba, King Joram’s daughter, Ahaziah’s sister, stole Ahaziah’s son Joash from the king’s sons they were killing. She hid him with his nurse in a bedroom, so he wasn’t killed. 3She hid him in the LORD’s Temple for 6 years while Athaliah ruled the country.

4In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of hundreds of the Carite mercenaries together with the palace guard and brought them to the LORD’s Temple. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king’s son 5and told them,

“A third of you that go on duty on the Sabbath and keep watch over the king’s palace 6will defend the palace (one-third at gate Shur and one-third at the gate behind the guards). 7Two parts of you that go on duty on the Sabbath will keep watch over the LORD’s Temple for the king. 8Then surround the king with weapons in hand. Put to death whoever approaches the ranks. Be with the king when he goes out and comes in.”

9Each commander of hundreds took his men that were to go off duty on the Sabbath, along with those that were to go on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada. 10The priest gave the commanders King David’s spears and shields, which were in the Temple complex. 11The guards stood with weapons in hand, from the south side of the Temple to the north, by the altar and by the house, around the king’s son. 12He brought him out, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony. They anointed him king, clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”

13When Athaliah heard the noise, she came to the LORD’s Temple. 14She saw the king standing by the pillar according to custom with the captains and buglers beside him. The people were celebrating and blowing the bugles. She tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 15Jehoiada told the commanders over the army, “Bring her out between the ranks. Whoever follows her put to death with the sword. Don’t execute her in the Temple.” 16They grabbed her, and when she got to the horses’ entrance at the king’s house, they put her to death.

17Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD’s people. 18They tore down Baal’s temple, broke his altars and images into small pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. The priest appointed officers over the Temple. 19He took the commanders of hundreds, the Carite mercenaries, the guards, and the people. They brought the king down from the Temple past the guards’ gate to the king’s palace, and he took his seat on the throne. 20The people celebrated and the city grew quiet.

Joash Repairs the Temple

12:1In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba. 2His whole life he did what was good like Jehoiada instructed him, 3except he didn’t take away the high places. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them.

4-5Jehoash told the priests,

“Let the priests take the money for sacred things that’s brought into the LORD’s Temple and make any repairs on the Temple—money collected from the census, payments for vows, and voluntary offerings.”

6By his twenty-third year, the priests still hadn’t made the repairs. 7He said, “Why aren’t you repairing them? Don’t take any more money from your acquaintances. Hand it over for the damages to the Temple.” 8The priests agreed not to take any more money and to let others do the repairs.							      		       2 Kg 12:1-8

9But Jehoiada took a chest, bored a hole in the lid, and put it on the right side the altar, where people come into the LORD’s Temple. The priests that guarded the threshold put the money in it that people brought in. 10When the chest was getting full, the king’s secretary and the high priest counted it and tied it up in bags. 11-12They weighed out the money to the ones that oversaw the Temple. They paid it to the carpenters, builders, masons, and stonecutters, and bought the lumber, hewn stone, and any other costs for the repairs. 13But they didn’t make silver cups, snuffers, bowls, bugles, any gold or silver items from the money. 14They gave it to the repairmen 15and didn’t require any accounting from them because they were honest. 16Money from guilt offerings and sin offerings didn’t come into the Temple because it belonged to the priests.		      							     		     2 Kg 12:9-16

17At that time, Hazael, king of Aram, went and conquered Gath, then turned toward Jerusalem. 18Jehoash/Joash took the sacred things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated, along with his own sacred things and the gold in the treasuries in the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, and sent it to Hazael. So he let Jerusalem alone.

19The rest of the acts of Joash/Jehoash are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 20-21His officers led a conspiracy, and Jozacar son of Shimeath with Jehozabad son of Shomer assassinated him at Beth-millo on the way down to Silla.

Jehoahaz Rules in Israel

13:1In the twenty-third year of Joash/Jehoash son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 17 years. 2He followed the sins of JeroboamI that got Israel to sin. 3The LORD’s anger flared; he kept delivering them to Hazael, king of Aram, and Benhadad his son. 4Jehoahaz asked for the LORD’s help and he listened to him, because he saw the oppression by the king of Aram. 5The LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped from under the Arameans and lived like before. 6But they didn’t turn away from the sins of JeroboamI that he got Israel to sin; the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria. 7The Arameans reduced Jehoahaz’s army to not more than 50 cavalry, 10 chariots, and 10,000 infantry, and made them like dust at threshing time. 8The rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and the strength of his rule are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 9He died and they buried him in Samaria.

14When Elisha took sick with the illness he’d die from, Joash, king of Israel, came down and cried over him, “Father! Father! the chariots of Israel and their drivers!”

15Elisha said, “Pick up a bow and arrows, 16and put your hand on the bow.”

Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. 17“Open the window toward the east. Shoot! The LORD’s arrow of victory over Aram! You’ll destroy the Arameans at Aphek.”

18Then he said, “Pick up some arrows and strike the floor.”

He struck it three times and stopped.

19The man of God was mad at him, “You should have struck it five or six times. Then you would have struck Aram till you’d destroyed it. But as it is, you’ll strike Aram only three times.”

20Elisha died, and they buried him.

Bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring. 21Once, as some Israelites were burying a man, they saw a marauding band. They threw him into Elisha’s tomb and ran. When he touched Elisha’s bones, he came back to life and stood up.

22Hazael, king of Aram, had oppressed Israel all the time of Jehoahaz. 23But the LORD was gracious, had mercy, and turned to them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He still hadn’t destroyed them or thrown them out of his presence. 24When Hazael died, Benhadad his son became king. 25Jehoash took back the towns Hazael had taken in war from his father.

The people still sacrificed and burned incense on them. 5As soon as the kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 6He didn’t execute their sons, as the Law said that the LORD commanded Moses, “Don’t execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person’s sin.” 7He killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt, took Sela, and changed its name to Joktheel to this day.    	2 Kg 14:1-7

11But Amaziah ignored him; Jehoash went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 12Israel defeated Judah and each man fled home. 13Jehoash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh, came to Jerusalem, and tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—600ft. 14He took the gold, silver, and utensils in the LORD’s Temple and the king’s treasuries, as well as hostages, and went back to Samaria.

Jeroboam II Rules in Israel

23In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, JeroboamII son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria and ruled for 41 years. 24He did evil and didn’t abandon the sins of JeroboamI son of Nebat that got Israel to sin. 25He restored Israel’s border from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of Arabah in keeping with the LORD’s message through Jonah son of Amittai, prophet from Gath-hepher. 26The LORD saw that Israel’s suffering was bitter, whether bond or free, and there was nobody to help them. 27Since the LORD hadn’t yet said he’d blot out Israel, he saved them by JeroboamII.

“On the great altar, burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meal offering, the king’s burnt offering and meal offering, with the people’s burnt offering, meal offering, and liquid offerings.

He’d sent ambassadors to So, king of Egypt, and withheld the annual tribute to Assyria; so Shalmaneser shut him up bound in prison. 5Then he invaded the whole country and went up to Samaria and laid siege to it for 3 years. 6In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria conquered the city and took Israel into exile in Assyria.

Israel Exiled over Sin

7That happened because they sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from Egypt from under Pharaoh. They’d feared other gods, 8followed the customs of the nations the LORD had originally driven out, and the customs Israel’s kings had brought in. 9Israel secretly did what wasn’t right:

they built high places in their towns from watchtower to fortified city;

10they put sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every tall hill under every green tree;

11they burned incense on the high places—things that provoked the LORD.

12They served idols the LORD told them not to serve, 13even though he warned Israel and Judah through his prophets and seers, “Turn from your sins and keep my commandments, my statutes—the whole Law I’ve commanded your ancestors through the prophets.” 14But they ignored him. They stiffened their necks like the ancestors who didn’t believe in the LORD. 15They rejected the statutes and the covenant he made with their ancestors and dismissed his warnings. They became vain and followed the nations around them that he commanded them not to be like.

2 Kg 17:7-15

16They made molten images, that is, two calves and an Asherah pole. They worshiped the host of heaven and served Baal. 17They burned their sons and daughters as offerings, and practiced fortunetelling and sorcery. They provoked the LORD by selling themselves to sinning. 18He was angry with them and removed them away from him. None were left except the tribe of Judah.

19Judah didn’t keep his commandments either, but followed the customs Israel brought in. 20The LORD rejected Israel’s descendants, oppressed them, and delivered them to plunderers till he’d thrown them out. 21When he’d torn Israel away from David’s dynasty, they made JeroboamI son of Nebat king. He drove them away from the LORD and got them to commit a great sin. 22Israel continued to follow in his sins 23till the LORD removed Israel away from him. Israel has been in exile in Assyria ever since.

Foreigners Settled in Samaria

24The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the towns in Samaria in place of the Israelites. 25When they first started living there, they didn’t respect the LORD. He sent lions among them and killed some of them. 26They spoke to the king of Assyria,

“The nations you exiled into the towns in Samaria don’t know the Law of the god of the land. He has sent lions among them to kill them.”

27Then the king commanded, “Bring one of the priests you exiled, and have him live there and teach them the Law of the god of the land.” 	2 Kg 17:16-27

28One of the priests they’d exiled came and lived at Bethel and taught them how to respect the LORD. 29But every nation in the towns where they lived still made gods of their own and put them at the pagan shrines the people of Samaria had made. 30The people from Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima, 31the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech their gods. 32They also feared the LORD and appointed priests for the high places, who acted for them in the shrines there. 33They feared the LORD and served their own gods like they did where they came from.    	2 Kg 17:18-33

He revolted against the king of Assyria 8and defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its territory, from outpost to fortified city.

9In the fourth year of King Hezekiah (seventh year of Hoshea), Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up and laid siege to Samaria. 10At the end of three years, he captured it (sixth year of Hezekiah, ninth year of Hoshea). 11He exiled Israel to Assyria and put them in Halah, on the Habor, the Gozan River, and in towns of the Medes. 12He did it because they wouldn’t obey the LORD their God.

They went up to Jerusalem and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. 18When they called to the king, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who managed the palace; Shebnah the secretary, and Joah son of Asah the recorder came out to them. 19The Rabshakeh said,

“Tell Hezekiah the great king of Assyria says, ‘What’s this confidence you have? 20Your advice and strength for war are empty words. Who are you relying on that you’ve rebelled against me? 21You’re relying on Egypt that crushed reed as a staff. If anyone leans on it, it will pierce their hand. That’s the way Pharaoh is to everybody that relies on him. 22But if you tell me you’re trusting in the LORD your God, isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away and told Judah and Jerusalem to worship at this altar in Jerusalem?’ 23Come now, make a deal with my master, and I’ll give you 2,000 horses if you can put riders on them. 24How can you drive off even one of my master’s least officers and rely on Egypt for chariots and cavalry? 25Haven’t I come up with the LORD’s approval to destroy this place? He told me to attack this country and destroy it.”	    					    		    		    2 Kg 18:17-25

26Then Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah told the Rabshakeh, “Speak to us in Aramaic; we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in front of the people on the wall.”

27But he shouted in Hebrew,

“Has my master sent me just to you and your master to say this? Hasn’t he sent me to the people sitting on the wall, doomed to eat their own feces and drink their own urine with you?”

28“The great king of Assyria says, 29‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; he can’t deliver you. 30Don’t let him make you trust in the LORD, “The LORD will deliver us. This city won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria.” 31Don’t listen to him. Surrender and come out to me. Eat from your own grapevines and fig trees, and drink water from your own cisterns, 32till I come and take you away to a land like yours, with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, olive trees and honey so you won’t die. 33Have any nation’s gods delivered its people from the king of Assyria? 34Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad, of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from me? 35Who among the gods of the countries have delivered them from me, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from me?’”

36The people didn’t respond; the king told them not to answer him. 37Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah went to Hezekiah with clothes torn and told him what the Rabshakeh had said.	 2 Kg 18:26-37

Jerusalem’s Deliverance Foretold

19:1When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with burlap, and went into the LORD’s Temple. 2He sent Eliakim with Shebna and the elders of the people, covered with burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 3They told him,

“Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a time of distress, rebuke, and rejection. Babies have come to term, but there’s no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe the LORD your God will hear the message from the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria has sent to disparage the living God. Maybe he’ll rebuke what he’s heard. Pray for the remnant that’s left.’” [5]

6Isaiah said,

“Tell your master, ‘The LORD says, “You don’t have to be afraid of what the Assyrian king’s messengers have blasphemed. 7I’ll put a spirit in him that makes him hear a rumor and go back to his country. He’ll fall by the sword in his own land.”’”	2 Kg 19:1-7

8The Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he’d heard that the king had left Lachish. 9When he heard them say that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him, he sent messengers back again to Hezekiah,

10“Tell Hezekiah, ‘Don’t let the god you trust in deceive you by saying Jerusalem won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria. 11You’ve heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the sons of Eden in Telassar? 13Where’s the king of Hamath, Arpad, or the towns Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”

Jerusalem’s Deliverance Foretold

14Hezekiah read the letter, went up to the LORD’s Temple, and spread it out to him. 15He prayed,

“LORD God of Israel Enthroned Above the Cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 16Incline your ear and hear; open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to disparage the living God. 17Assyria’s kings have devastated the nations and their lands. 18They’ve burned their gods because they weren’t gods, just man-made pieces of wood and stone. 19But now, LORD our God, deliver us from him so the kingdoms can know that you alone are God.”	 2 Kg 19:8-19

Isaiah Prophesies Sennacherib’s Fall

20Isaiah sent to Hezekiah, “The LORD says, ‘Because you’ve prayed about Sennacherib, I’ve listened.’ 21This is what the LORD says against him:

‘The young virgin of Zion

despises you and mocks you;

the young woman of Jerusalem

shakes her head at you!

22Who have you disparaged and blasphemed?

Who have you raised your voice at,

proudly lifted up your eyes against?

The Holy One of Israel!

23By your ambassadors you’ve disparaged the LORD.

You’ve said, “With my many chariots

I went up to the highest mountains,

to the most remote parts of Lebanon.

I cut down its tallest cedars and best cypress.

I entered its most distant lodging place, its thickest forest.

24I dug wells and drank foreign water;

with the soles of my feet, I dried up

the streams in Egypt.”                               	2 Kg 19:20-24

25‘But haven’t you heard?

I’m the one that decided that long ago;

I planned it from ancient times.

Now I’ve made it happen:

that you should turn fortified towns into piles of rubble,

26while their people are short of strength,

scared, and confounded.

They’ve become like plants in a field and green herbs,

like grass on housetops, scorched before it’s grown.

27From ancient times I’ve known

when you sit down,

when you come and go,

when you rage against me.

28Because you’ve raged against me,

because of your arrogance that I’ve heard,

I’ll put my hook in your nose,

my bridle in your jaws,

and turn you back the way you came.	2 Kg 19:25-28

29‘This will show you what I mean: this year you’ll eat what volunteers, next year what sprouts from that, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat what they produce. 30The surviving remnant of Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. 31A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD will make that happen.

32‘The LORD says the king of Assyria won’t come to this city or shoot an arrow here. He won’t approach it with a shield or build a mound against it. 33He’ll go back the way he came. 34I’ll save this city for my own sake and for David’s sake.”

35That night the angel of the LORD struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early, the Assyrians were all dead. 36Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 37As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to Ararat. His son Esarhaddon became king. 	2 Kg 19:29-37

Hezekiah’s Illness

20:1At that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, “The LORD says to set your house in order; you’re going to die.”

2He turned his face to the wall and prayed, 3“Remember how I’ve lived in your presence honestly with all my heart. I’ve done what you considered good.” He cried bitterly. 4Before Isaiah had left the middle court, a message came to him,

5“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, that the LORD God of his ancestor David, says, ‘I’ve heard your prayer and seen your tears. I’ll heal you. In three days, you’ll go up to my Temple. 6I’ll add 15 years to your life and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. I’ll defend it for my own honor and for David’s sake.’”

7Then Isaiah told them to prepare a cake of figs and apply it to the boil. He recovered.

8Hezekiah said, “What’s the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I’ll go up to the LORD’s Temple the third day?”

9“Choose the sign: the shadow going forward ten steps or back ten steps?”

10“It’s easy for it to lengthen ten steps. Let it go back ten steps.”

11Isaiah cried out to the LORD and brought the shadow on Ahaz’s stairway back ten steps from where it had gone down.	2 Kg 20:1-11

Envoys from Babylon

12At that time, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he’d heard he was sick. 13He received the ambassadors and showed them his treasure house, the silver, gold, spices, precious oil, his armor house, and everything in his treasuries. There wasn’t anything in his palace or dominion that he didn’t show them. 14Then Isaiah came, “What did those men say? Where did they come from?”

“From a distant Babylon.”

15“What have they seen in your palace?”

“I showed them everything in my treasures.”

16Isaiah said,

“Listen to a message from the LORD. 17The time’s coming when everything in your palace that your ancestors have stored up will be carried off to Babylon. 18Some of your own sons will be taken away to become officials in the king’s palace there.”

19Hezekiah said, “The LORD’s message is good.” He thought to himself, “At least there’ll be peace and truth while I’m alive.” 20The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and the strength of his rule—how he made the pool and conduit to bring water into the city—are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 21He died and his son Manasseh became king.	 2 Kg 20:12-21

Manasseh Rules in Judah

21:1Manasseh was 12 and ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah. 2He did evil like nations the LORD originally expelled. 3He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had destroyed, erected altars for Baal, and set up an Asherah pole like Ahab, king of Israel, had done. He worshiped and served the host of heaven, 4built altars in the LORD’s Temple where the LORD had said, “I’ll identify myself with Jerusalem.” 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD’s Temple. 6He burned his son as an offering, practiced witchcraft, used sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did so much evil and made the LORD angry. 7He put a carved image of Asherah in the Temple where the LORD told David and his son Solomon,

“Forever I’ll identify with this Temple and with Jerusalem, which I’ve chosen from the tribes of Israel. 8I won’t make Israel wander anymore from the country I gave their ancestors—if only they’ll observe the whole Law that I’ve commanded them through Moses.” 	2 Kg 21:1-8

9But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to sin more than the nations the LORD originally destroyed in front of them.

10Now the LORD spoke through his prophets,

11“Manasseh has done more disgusting things than the Amorites before him, and got Judah to sin with his idols. 12So I’m bringing such catastrophe on Jerusalem and Judah that both ears will ring of whoever hears it. 13I’ll stretch over Jerusalem Samaria’s measuring line and Ahab’s plumb bob. I’ll wipe Jerusalem like someone wipes a dish and turns it upside down. 14I’ll abandon the remnant of my permanent possession and deliver them to their enemies to become plunder and spoil. 15They’ve done evil and made me angry ever since I brought their ancestors out of Egypt.”

16Besides the sin he got Judah to do, Manasseh filled Jerusalem with innocent blood from one end to the other. 17The rest of his acts and sins are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 18He died and they buried him in the garden by his palace, Uzza’s garden. His son Amon became king.	2 Kg 21:9-18

Amon Rules in Judah

19Amon was 22 and ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 20He did evil like Manasseh, 21followed his ways, served the idols he’d worshiped, 22and forsook the LORD God of his ancestors. 23Amon’s officials plotted against him and assassinated him in his palace. 24The common people killed his assassins and made his son Josiah king. 25The rest of the acts of Amon are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 26They buried him in Uzza’s garden. 	2 Kg 21:19-26

The Book of the Law Found

22:1Josiah was 8 when he became king and ruled for 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath. 2He did what was good and followed the ways of David.

3In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the LORD’s Temple,

4“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest so he can count the money the people have brought to the LORD’s temple that the doorkeepers have gathered. 5Have them deliver it to the workmen that oversee the Temple so they can repair it—6carpenters, builders, and masons—and buy the timber and cut stone for repairs. 7Only they won’t need to account for the money they receive. They’re honest.”

2 Kg 22:1-7

8Then Hilkiah the priest told Shaphan the secretary, “I’ve found the Book of the Law in the Temple.” He gave it to him to read, 9and Shaphan brought word to the king, “Your officials have emptied out the money they found in the Temple and delivered it to the workmen that oversee the Temple. 10Hilkiah has also given me a scroll.” He read it to the king. 11When he heard it, he tore his clothes. 12He told Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king’s adviser,

13“Go ask the LORD for me, for the people, and for Judah about what this scroll says. The LORD’s great anger is burning against us. Our ancestors ignored what it says and haven’t done what’s written for us to do.”

14They went to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvah son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She lived in Jerusalem’s Second Quarter.) 15She told them,

“The LORD God of Israel says to tell the man that sent you, 16‘I’m going to bring disaster on this place and its people like the scroll says. 17They’ve left me and burned incense to other gods. My anger burns against this place, and it won’t be put out. [18] 19But I’ve listened to you because you became sensitive and humbled yourself when you heard about the desolation I’ve cursed this place and its people with; you tore your clothes and cried.  20I’ll let you pass on to your ancestors in peace. You won’t see the disaster I’m going to bring here.”’”

They took word back to the king.	     2 Kg 22:8-20

Josiah Renews the Covenant

23:1Then the king gathered the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 2He and the men of Judah, the residents in Jerusalem, the priests and prophets—people least and greatest—went up to the Temple. He read to them the covenant they’d found. 3He stood by the pillar and made a covenant with the LORD to keep his commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all his heart and soul—to carry out the covenant written in that scroll. The people entered into the covenant.    2 Kg 23:1-3

4Then he told Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers to remove from the Temple the items made for Baal, Asherah, and the host of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields by the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.

5He did away with the idolatrous priests Judah’s kings had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the towns of Judah and around Jerusalem, those who burned incense to Baal, the sun, moon, and constellations—the host of heaven.

6He removed the Asherah pole from the LORD’s Temple to the Kidron and burned it. He ground it to powder and threw it on the graves of the common people.

7He tore down the house of the male cult prostitutes in the LORD’s Temple, where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah pole.

8Then he brought the priests from the towns in Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from Geba to Beersheba.

He tore down the high places to the left of the gate of Joshua, governor of the city. 9The priests of the high places couldn’t serve at the LORD’s altar in Jerusalem, but they were allowed to eat bread without yeast with the other priests. 					       2 Kg 23:4-9

10He defiled Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom so nobody could burn a son or daughter as an offering to Molech.

11He removed the horses Judah’s kings had dedicated to the sun—at the entrance of the LORD’s Temple, by the quarters of Nathan-melech the official, which were in the precincts.

He burned the chariots of the sun.

12The king broke down the altars that were on the roof, the upper room of Ahaz, that the kings of Judah had made.

He broke down the altars Manasseh had made in the two courts of the LORD’s Temple. He pulverized them there and threw their dust in the Kidron.

13He defiled the high places east of Jerusalem and to the right of the Mount of Corruption that Solomon had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

14He broke the sacred pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and desecrated their places by spreading human bones in them.						   2 Kg 23:10-14

15In addition, he dismantled the altar at Bethel and the high place JeroboamI had made. He demolished its stones, ground them to lime, and burned the Asherah pole. 16When he turned around and saw tombs on the hillside, he had bones out of them burned on the altar to defile it like the message from the LORD that the man of God had delivered. 17Then he said, “What’s this monument?” The men in the city told him, “It’s the grave of the man of God from Judah that declared what you’ve done against the altar at Bethel.” 18He told them not to disturb his bones; they didn’t disturb them or the bones of the prophet from Samaria. 	   	    	    2 Kg 23:15-18

19Josiah removed the shrines from the high places in the towns of Samaria—structures the kings of Israel had built. He did to them what he’d done in Jerusalem. 20On the altars he killed the priests associated with the high places and burned human bones on them.

Then he went back to Jerusalem.

21He told the people, “Celebrate Passover to the LORD your God as written in this scroll.” 22They hadn’t celebrated it since the time of the judges or during the time of the kings of Israel and Judah. 23But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, they observed it in Jerusalem. 										   		    2 Kg 23:19-23

24Josiah removed the mediums, spiritists, household gods, idols, and detestable things in Judah and Jerusalem, to conform to what the scroll said that Hilkiah found. 25No king before or after him turned to the LORD with all his heart, soul, and might, according to the whole Law of Moses.

26But the LORD didn’t withdraw his fierce anger against Judah that Manasseh had provoked, 27“I’ll remove Judah from me like I did Israel. I’ll throw Jerusalem aside, my chosen city, and the Temple that I said I’d identify with.”

28The rest of the acts of Josiah are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 29During his reign, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up to the king of Assyria to the River Euphrates. King Josiah went to engage him. When Pharaoh saw him, he killed him at Megiddo. 30His officers hauled his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. The people took his son Jehoahaz and anointed him king.	   2 Kg 23:24-30

His mother was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 32He did evil like his ancestors. 33Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in Hamath so he couldn’t reign in Jerusalem. He imposed on the country a fine of 3¾ tons 100 talents of silver and 75½ lbs a talent of gold. 34He made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He took Jehoahaz away to Egypt, and he died there. 35Jehoiakim gave Pharaoh the silver and gold, but he taxed the land to do it. He exacted the silver and gold according to his evaluation of their wealth.

24:1In Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim served him for 3 years, then revolted. 2The LORD sent bands of Babylonians, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against him to destroy Judah like he’d warned by his prophets. 3At the LORD’s command, that all came on Judah because of Manasseh’s sins 4and the innocent blood he’d filled Jerusalem with. The LORD wouldn’t forgive. 5The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. 6He died and his son Jehoiachin became king. 7The king of Egypt didn’t come out of his country again, because the king of Babylon took everything he had from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates River. 	2 Kg 24:1-7

The king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 13He carried the treasures out of the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, and cut up the gold articles Solomon had made in the Temple—like the LORD said. 14He led into exile Jerusalem, the commanders, trained soldiers (10,000 captives), craftsmen, and smiths. Only the poorest people remained. 15He led Jehoiachin to Babylon along with his mother, his wives, officials, leading men of the country, 16the brave men (7,000), the craftsmen and smiths (1,000), the ones strong and fit for war. 17He made his uncle Mattaniah king and changed his name to Zedekiah.

Zedekiah Rules in Judah

18Zedekiah was 21 and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem.

Zedekiah Rules in Judah

25:1The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar and his army came against Jerusalem, camped against it, and built a siege wall around it. 2The city lay under siege till Zedekiah’s eleventh year. 3The ninth day, fourth month, the famine had become so severe in the city that the common people didn’t have any food. 4Then the Babylonians broke into the city, and the soldiers fled at night through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden, though the Babylonians were all around the city. They went by way of the Arabah. 5But the army chased the king and overtook him in the plains by Jericho, and his whole army scattered. 6They captured him and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him. 7They executed Zedekiah’s sons in front of him and then put out his eyes. They bound him with bronze restraints and took him to Babylon.

8The seventh day, fifth month, nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard and an official of the king, came to Jerusalem. 9He burned the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem, including every important building. 10The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 11He exiled the rest of the people in the city, the deserters, and the rest of the population. 12He left some of the very poor to take care of the vineyards and fields.	2 Kg 25:1-12

13The Babylonians broke to pieces the bronze pillars, the stands, and the bronze sea that were in the LORD’s Temple, and carried the bronze to Babylon. 14They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and bronze items used in the Temple service. 15The captain of the guard took away the firepans and basins, what was fine gold and silver, 16the two pillars, the sea, and the stands Solomon had made for the Temple; the bronze from these was more than they could weigh. 17The two pillars were bronze plated 27ft tall. Their capitals were 4½ft high with a bronze network and pomegranates all the way around.

18The commander of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, the three officers of the Temple, 191 official that oversaw the soldiers, 5 of the king’s advisers found in the city; the secretary for the commander of the army, who mustered the common people; and 60 men found in the city. 20He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 21who executed them there in Hamath. Judah was in exile from its land.

22Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor for the people he left in the country. 23When the commanders of the forces and their men heard it, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, and their men. 24Gedaliah swore to them and their men, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonians.

8:1BENJAMIN was father of Bela his firstborn, Ashbel second, Aharah third, 2Nohah fourth, and Rapha fifth.

3Bela was father of Addar, Gera, Abihud, 4Abishua, Naaman, Ahoah, 5Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram.

6These are the sons of Ehud, heads of families among the people in Geba. They were exiled to Manahath: 7Naaman, Ahijah, and Gera, father of Uzza and Ahihud.

8Shaharaim was the father of children in Moab after he’d sent away his wives Hushim and Baara. 9By his wife Hodesh he became father of Jobab, Zibia, Mesha, Malcam, 10Jeuz, Sachia, Mirmah, sons and heads of families. 11By Hushim he’d become father of Abitub and Elpaal.

1 Ch 8:1-11

12The sons of Elpaal were Eber, Misham, Shemed—who built Ono and Lod with their villages—13Beriah and Shema (heads of families among the people in Aijalon, who routed the people in Gath); 14Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth.

15Zebadiah, Arad, Eder, 16Michael, Ishpah, and Joha were sons of Beriah.

19Jakim, Zichri, Zabdi, 20Elienai, Zillethai, Eliel, 21Adaiah, Beraiah, and Shimrath were sons of Shimei.

22Ishpan, Eber, Eliel, 23Abdon, Zichri, Hanan, 24Hananiah, Elam, Anthothijah, 25Iphdeiah, and Penuel were the sons of Shashak.

26Shamsherai, Shehariah, Athaliah, 27Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri were sons of Jeroham.

28These were heads of families in their generations, chief men that lived in Jerusalem.

1 Ch 8:12-28

29Jeiel father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon; his wife was Maacah. 30His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Nadab, 31Gedor, Ahio, Zecher, and 32Mikloth father of Shimeah/Shimeam. These families lived near each other in Jerusalem. 33Ner was father of Kish father of Saul father of Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

34The son of Jonathan was Merib-baal father of 35Micah father of Pithon, Melech, Tarea, and Ahaz. 36Ahaz was father of Jehoaddah father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; Zimri was father of 37Moza father of Binea father of Raphah father of Eleasah father of Azel. 38Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. 39Azel’s brother Eshek was father of Ulam his firstborn, Jeush second, and Eliphelet third. 40The sons of Ulam were brave soldiers, archers, and had many sons and grandsons—150 of them.

Those were all descendants of Benjamin.			       1 Ch 8:29-40

9:1So Israel was enrolled by genealogies. They’re recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel. Judah was exiled to Babylon because they were unfaithful.

2The first to live again in their towns were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Temple servants. 3Some descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem:

4from the descendants of Perez son of Judah was Uthai son of Ammihud son of Omri son of Imri son of Bani;

5from the Shilonites were Asaiah the firstborn and his sons;

6from the sons of Zerah were Jeuel and their relatives: 690;

7from the descendants of Benjamin were Sallu son of Meshullam son of Hodaviah son of Hassenuah, 8and Ibneiah son of Jeroham, Elah son of Uzzi son of Michri, and Meshullam son of Shephatiah son of Reuel son of Ibnijah, 9and their relatives by generations: 956. Those were heads of families.									1 Ch 9:1-9

10From the priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 11Azariah son of Hilkiah son of Meshullam son of Zadok son of Meraioth son of Ahitub, the chief officer of God’s Temple; 12Adaiah son of Jeroham son of Pashhur son of Malchijah, Maasai son of Adiel son of Jahzerah son of Meshullam son of Meshillemith son of Immer, 13and their relatives, heads of their families: 1,760 capable men for the service of God’s Temple.

14From the Levites were Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah from the sons of Merari; 15Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, Mattaniah son of Mica son of Zichri son of Asaph, 16Obadiah son of Shemaiah son of Galal son of Jeduthun, Berechiah son of Asa son of Elkanah that lived in the villages of the Netophathites.		1 Ch 9:10-16

17The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives, (Shallum the chief) 18stationed previously at the king’s gate to the east. 19Shallum son of Kore son of Ebiasaph son of Korah, and his relatives from his family—the Korahites—were over the work of the service, who kept the thresholds of the tent like their ancestors had done over the entrance to the camp of the LORD. 20Phinehas son of Eleazar ruled them previously; the LORD was with him. 21Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 22There were 212 chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds. They were enrolled by genealogy in their villages, men that David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust. 23They and their descendants guarded the gates of the LORD’s house—when it was a tabernacle—24 on all four sides. 25Their relatives in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 26The four chief gatekeepers (Levites) were in an office of trust over the rooms and treasuries in God’s Temple. 27They spent the night around God’s Temple, because they were responsible for guarding them. They were responsible for opening the gates of the LORD’s house each morning.

28Some of them were responsible for the utensils for service. They counted them when they brought them in and took them out. 29Some were appointed to oversee the furniture and utensils for the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 30Some descendants of the priests mixed the spices. 31Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for what was baked in pans. 32Some relatives of the Kohathites prepared the showbread every Sabbath. 		1 Ch 9:17-32

33These are the singers, heads of families among the Levites. They lived in rooms in the Temple because they were on duty day and night. 34They were heads of families among the Levites according to their generations, chief men living in Jerusalem.

35Jeiel father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon; his wife was Maacah. 36His firstborn was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.

38Mikloth was father of Shimeam/Shimeah. All these families lived near each other in Jerusalem. 	1 Ch 9:33-38

39Ner was father of Kish father of Saul father of Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

40Jonathan was father of Merib-baal father of Micah 41father of Pithon, Melech,

Tahrea, 42and Ahaz father of Jarah father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and

Zimri father of Moza 43father of Binea, Rephaiah, Eleasah and Azel. 44Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan.								1 Ch 9:39-44

The Death of Szul and His Sons

10:1The Philistines attacked Israel, and they fled and fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and struck down his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua. 3The battle grew intense against Saul, and the archers wounded him. 4He told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through so these uncircumcised Philistines don’t come and torture me.” But his armor bearer was too afraid to do it; so Saul took his sword and fell on it. 5When his armor bearer saw he was dead, he fell on his sword too. 6So Saul’s whole dynasty died together.

7When the Israelites in the valley saw they’d fled and Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled; the Philistines came and lived in them. 8The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons. 9They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and the people. 10They put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 11When Jabesh-gilead heard what they’d done to Saul, 12brave men got up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons, buried their bones under the terebinth tree in Jabesh, and fasted a week.

13So Saul died for his trespass against the LORD 14and because he inquired from a medium instead of the LORD. He killed him and turned the kingdom over to David. 	1 Ch 10:1-14

David Anointed King

11:1Then Israel gathered to David in Hebron,

“We’re your flesh and bone. 2When Saul was king, you led out and brought in Israel. The LORD your God said you would shepherd his people and be their leader.”

3The elders in Israel came to him, and he made a treaty with them in the LORD’s presence. They anointed him king according to the LORD’s message through Samuel.

David Takes Jerusalem

4Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (Jebus). The Jebusites, natives in the land, lived there. 5They told David, “You won’t get in here”; but he captured the fortress of Zion (The City of David). 6He had said, “Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will be general of the army.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became the general. 7David lived in the fortress; so they called it The City of David. 8He built the city all around from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Joab repaired the rest of Jerusalem. 9David became greater and greater because the LORD was with him.	       1 Ch 11:1-9

David’s Mighty Men

10These are David’s leading powerful warriors, who greatly supported him in his kingdom, along with all Israel, in making him king. 11They were Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite, chief of the 30. He killed 300 men with his spear at one time. 12After him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three powerful men. 13He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines converged there for battle. There was a barley field, and the people were running from the Philistines. 14They took their stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. The LORD gave them a great victory.

15Three of the 30 chief men went down to the rock to David into the cave near Adullam while the Philistine army was camping in the Valley of Rephaim. 16Davd was in the stronghold while the Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem. 17David was thirsty and said, “Oh that somebody would give me a drink from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!” 18The three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at Bethlehem and took it to David. But he wouldn’t drink it; he poured it out to the LORD. 19“In the presence of my God, I can’t do that. Should I, in effect, drink these men’s blood who risked their lives to bring it?” Those were exploits the three powerful men did.	1 Ch 11:10-19

20Abishai, Joab’s brother, was leader of the 30. He killed 300 with a spear; he had a reputation as well as the 30. 21Of the three in the second rank, he had the greatest honor and became their commander. But he didn’t measure up to the three.

22Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a fearless warrior from Kabzeel, powerful in deeds, struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day. 23He killed an Egyptian that was 7ft 6. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from him and killed him with it.   24-25Benaiah was renowned among the 30, but he didn’t measure up to the three. David appointed him over his guard.	1 Ch 11:20-25

26The elite soldiers in the armies were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 27Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 28Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 29Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 30Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, 31Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 32Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 33Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 34the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite, 35Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur, 36Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 37Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai, 38Joel brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri, 39Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah, 40Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 41Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai; 42Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief in Reuben and 30 with him; 43Hanan son of Maacah and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 44Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 45Jediael son of Shimri and Joha his brother, the Tizite; 46Eliel the Mahavite and Jeribai and Joshaviah sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 47Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.	1 Ch 11:26-47

Warriors Join David

12:1These are men that came over to David at Ziklag, while he still couldn’t move around freely because of Saul. They were among the elite soldiers that helped him during war. 2They used bows. With either hand they could sling stones and shoot arrows. They were Saul’s relatives from Benjamin. 3The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite; 4Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, an elite soldier among the 30 and a leader over them. Then came Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, 5Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite; 6Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites; 7Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jerobam of Gedor.

8From Gad, brave soldiers came over to David in the stronghold in the open country. They were men trained in war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like lions’ faces. They were as fast as gazelles on the mountains. 9Numbered 1-11, they were Ezer, Obadiah, Eliab, 10Mishmannah, Jeremiah, 11Attai, Eliel, 12Johanan, Elzabad, 13Jeremiah, and Machbannai. 14They were commanders in the army. The least was worth 100; the best was worth 1,000. 15They crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was flooding and put to flight everybody in the valleys to the east and the west.	1 Ch 12:1-15

16Then some men from Benjamin and Judah came to David’s stronghold. 17He went out to meet them,

“If you come peacefully to help me, my heart will be with yours. But if you’ve come to betray me to my adversaries, since I haven’t done anything wrong, may the God of our ancestors look at it and decide.”

18The Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the 30,

“We’re yours, David;

we’re with you, son of Jesse!

Peace, peace to you,

and peace to the One that helps you.

Indeed, your God helps you!”

David accepted them and made them captains of the band.	1 Ch 12:16-18

19From Manasseh also some came over to David when he was going with the Philistines to fight Saul. (But he didn’t end up helping them, because the lords of the Philistines conferred and sent him away, “He might desert to his Saul and turn on us.”) 20As he was going to Ziklag, these came over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, commanders of thousands in Manasseh. 21They helped him against the bands of raiders, because they were fearless soldiers and commanders in the army. 22Daily, men kept coming over to help David, till there was a large army like God’s army.

23These are the divisions of armed troops that came to David in Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him like the LORD said:

24from Judah: 6,800 armed troops that carried shield and spear;

25from Simeon: 7,100 fearless soldiers;

26from Levi: 4,600;

27from Jehoiada, leader of Aaron’s house: 3,700;

28and Zadok, a fearless young soldier, of his family: 22 captains;

29from Benjamin: 3,000 of Saul’s relatives, the greater part previously allied with Saul’s house.

30from Ephraim: 20,800 fearless soldiers, famous in their families;

31from the Manasseh half-tribe: 18,000 men picked by name to make David king;

32from Issachar: 200 chiefs that understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do; with their relatives at their command;

33from Zebulun: 50,000 seasoned troops, ready for battle and equipped with all kinds of weapons; who helped David wholeheartedly.

34from Naphtali: 1,000 captains and 37,000 that carried shield and spear;

35from Dan: 28,600 equipped for battle;

36from Asher: 40,000 seasoned troops ready for battle;

37from beyond the Jordan—Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe:  120,000 armed with all kinds of weapons.	 1 Ch 12:19-37

38These battle-ready men came to Hebron fully intending to make David king over all Israel. The rest in Israel were also intent on making him king. 39They were there with him three days, eating and drinking, because their relatives had made preparations for them. 40People nearby and as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—great amounts of cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, olive oil, oxen, and sheep. There was happiness in Israel.	1 Ch 12:38-40

The Ark Brought from Kiriath-Jearim

13:1Then David consulted with every commander of thousands and hundreds, 2and told the whole assembly,

“If it seems good to you and if the LORD our God wills, let’s send around to our relatives that are still in Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites that are with them in their towns and pastures, to have them meet with us. 3Let’s bring the Ark back. We neglected it in Saul’s time.”

4The assembly agreed because it seemed right to them. 5He brought Israel together from the Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring God’s Ark from Kiriath-jearim. 6He and all Israel went up to Baalah (Kiriath-jearim) on the edge of Judah to bring up God’s Ark, which wears the name the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubs. 7They hauled the Ark on a new cart from Abinadab’s house; Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 8David and all Israel were celebrating to God with all their energy—with songs and lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.

9When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon/Nachon, Uzza reached out to steady the Ark, because the oxen stumbled. 10The LORD’s anger burned against him, so he struck him down, and he died there in front of God. 11David was mad because the LORD “lashed out against Uzza,” and has called the place Perez-uzza ever since. 12David was afraid of God that day, “How can I bring the Ark home to me?” 13So he didn’t take it to The City of David but to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite nearby. 14It stayed with his family for 3 months, and the LORD blessed them and everybody he had. 	1 Ch 13:1-14

David’s Wives and Children

14:1Hiram, king of Tyre, sent ambassadors to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a palace. 2David saw that the LORD had made him secure as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly regarded for Israel’s sake. 3He took more wives at Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. 4His children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 5Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 6Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 7Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.	 1 Ch 14:1-7

Philistines Defeated

8When the Philistines heard they’d anointed David king over all Israel, they went up to look for him. He heard about it and went out against them. 9They’d made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 10David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them to me?” The LORD said, “Yes, go on up.” 11They went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them. He said. “God has used me to ‘break through’ my enemies like a flash flood”; so they named the place Baal-perazim. 12The Philistines abandoned their gods there; David had them burned.

13The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 14David asked God again, and he said,

“Don’t attack them head on. Circle around behind them and come at them across from the balsam trees. 15When you hear marching in the tops of the balsam trees, attack. God will have gone out ahead of you to strike their army.”

16David did that, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 17His fame went out to all the countries, and the LORD made them afraid of him.	 1 Ch 14:8-17

The Ark Brought to Jerusalem

15:1David built houses for himself in The City of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 2He said, “Don’t anybody carry the Ark but Levites. The LORD chose them to carry it and serve him permanently.” 3He gathered Israel to Jerusalem to bring the Ark up to the place he’d prepared. 4He gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:

5from the descendants of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives;

6from the descendant of Merari, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;

7from the descendants of Gershom, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;

8from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;

9from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;

10from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.

11David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests and for the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,

12“You’re heads of families among the Levites. Consecrate yourselves and your relatives so you can bring the Ark up to the place I’ve prepared. 13You didn’t carry it the first time, so the LORD lashed out on us; we didn’t look to him according to the ordinance.”

14The priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Ark. 15The Levites carried it on their shoulders, with the poles on it like Moses had commanded by the LORD’s message.

1 Ch 15:1-15

16David told the chiefs among the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers and the ones with musical instruments—harps, lyres, loud cymbals—to make joyful music. 17The Levites appointed Heman son of Joel and his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the descendants of Merari their relatives. 18The Levites appointed with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. 19The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to sound loud bronze cymbals. 20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth. 21Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres pitched to The Sheminith. 22Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing. He taught singing because he was good at it. 23Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 24Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests blew bugles ahead of the Ark. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also gatekeepers for the Ark.   1 Ch 15:16-24

25David, with the elders in Israel and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the Ark from Obed-edom’s house with joy. 26Because God was helping the Levites that were carrying the Ark, they sacrificed 7 bulls and 7 rams. 27David dressed in a fine linen robe with the Levites that were carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chenaniah, who led the singing. David also wore a linen ephod. 28Israel brought up the Ark with shouting, blowing rams’ horns and trumpets, crashing cymbals, and playing harps and lyres. 29When the Ark came to The City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked out the window, and saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she despised him.	1 Ch 15:25-29

16:1They put the Ark in the tent David had pitched for it and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. 2When David had finished offering them, he blessed the people in the LORD’s name. 3To every man and woman in Israel, he passed out a loaf of bread, a helping of meat, and a raisin cake.

4He appointed some Levites to serve at the Ark—to celebrate, thank, and praise the LORD God of Israel: 5Asaph the chief, second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel with musical instruments—harps and lyres. Asaph played the loud cymbals; 6Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew bugles constantly in front of the Ark.

7That day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the LORD.

1 Ch 16:1-7

David’s Song of Thanks

8Thank the LORD; call on him;

tell the nations what he’s done.

9Sing to him, sing praises to him;

talk about his wonderful works.

10Take pride in his holy name;

let the people that look to him be happy.

11Look to the LORD and his strength;

look to him continually.

12Remember the wonderful things he’s done,

the miracles and judgments he’s spoken,

13descendants of Israel his servant,

sons of Jacob his chosen ones.	1 Ch 16:8-13

14He’s the LORD our God;

his judgments are all over the world.

15Remember his covenant forever,

the message he commanded to a thousand generations,

16his covenant with Abraham,

his oath to Isaac.

17He confirmed it to Jacob as a statute,

to Israel as an everlasting covenant,

18“I’ll give you Canaan for an inheritance.”

19When they were just a few

with temporary residents included,

20they wandered about from nation to nation,

from one kingdom to another.                        	1 Ch 16:14-20

21He didn’t let anybody oppress them;

he reproved kings for their sakes:

22“Don’t touch my anointed ones;

don’t harm my prophets.”

23Sing to the LORD, all the earth;

tell the good news about his salvation every day.

24Tell about his glory the world over,

his wonderful deeds among the nations.

25The LORD is great, and deserves great praise;

he’s to be feared more than all other gods.

26The people’s gods are idols,

but the LORD made the sky.

27Honor and majesty are with him;

strength and joy belong to him.	1 Ch 16:21-27

28Attribute to the LORD, families of the nations,

attribute to him honor and strength.

29Attribute to the LORD the honor that’s due him;

bring him an offering;

worship him in his holy splendor.

30Tremble in his presence, all the earth;

yes, the world stands firm; it won’t be moved.

31Let the sky be happy and the earth celebrate;

let them say among the nations, “The LORD reigns!”

32Let the sea roar and everything that fills it;

let the field celebrate and everything in it.	1 Ch 16:28-32

33Then the trees in the forest will sing for joy,

because the LORD’s coming to judge the world.

34Give thanks to the LORD because he’s good;

his love endures forever.

35Then say, “Save us, our saving God;

gather us and deliver us from the nations

to give thanks to your holy name

and take pride in praising you.”

36Bless the LORD God of Israel,

from everlasting to everlasting.

The people said “Amen” and praised the LORD.	 1 Ch 16:33-36

37He left Asaph and his relatives at the Ark to serve continually as each day’s work required. 38He left Obed-edom with his 68 relatives and Hosah with the son of Jeduthun as gatekeepers. 39He left Zadok the priest and his relatives at the Tabernacle in the high place at Gibeon 40to offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, according to the Law the LORD commanded Israel. 41With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest that were designated by name to give thanks to the LORD because his love endures forever. 42With them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for the ones that sounded out loud, with instruments for the songs of God and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate. 43Then the people left for home and David went back to bless his household.     	     1 Ch 16:37-43

The LORD’s Covenant with David

17:1While David was living in his palace, he told Nathan the prophet, “I’m living in a cedar palace, but the LORD’s Ark is under curtains.”

2Nathan said, “Do what’s in your mind. God is with you.”

3That same night, the message from God came to him,

4“Go tell my servant David, ‘The LORD says, “You’re not to build me a temple. 5I haven’t lived in a temple since I brought Israel up. I’ve gone from tent to tent and place to place. 6In all the places where I’ve lived with Israel, have I asked any judge that I’ve commanded to shepherd my people why he hasn’t built me a cedar temple?”’ 7Tell David, ‘The LORD of Hosts says, “I took you out of the pasture from behind sheep and made you a leader over Israel. 8I’ve been with you wherever you’ve gone and removed your enemies from you. I’ll make you as famous as anyone that’s ever lived in the world. 9I’ll appoint you a place for my people, and plant them so they won’t have to move anymore. Sinful people won’t lay waste to them like they did before, 10including the time I put judges over them. I’ll subdue your enemies and build you a dynasty. 11When your life’s over and you’ve gone to your ancestors, I’ll set up one of your sons and secure his throne permanently. 12He’ll build me a temple. 13I’ll be his father, and he’ll be my son. I won’t take my enduring love away from him like I did with your predecessor. 14I’ll settle him in my house and kingdom permanently.”’”	  1 Ch 17:1-14

15Nathan told David everything in his vision.

David’s Prayer

16Then David went in and sat in the LORD’s presence,

“Who am I, LORD God, and what’s my family that you’ve brought me this far? 17It’s a small thing for you, but you’ve talked about my dynasty for a long time to come and regarded me by the standard for men of high degree. 18What more can I say about the honor you’ve put on me? You know me. 19For my sake and from your own heart, you’ve done these great things and made them known. 20Nobody’s like you; there’s no God besides you. From everything we’ve heard, 21what nation is like Israel? You went to redeem them out of Egypt to make a name for yourself with great and terrifying acts, in driving out nations ahead of your people. 22You made Israel your people permanently and became their God. 23Now make permanent your promise about me and my dynasty. 24Establish your name and make it great forever. 25-26It’s a good thing that you’ve revealed to me that you’ll build a dynasty for me. That’s encouraged me to pray to you. 27It has pleased you to bless my family so it will continue permanently. You’ve blessed it forever.”  	1 Ch 17:15-27

David’s Military Victories

18:1After that, David defeated the Philistines and took Gath and its surrounding towns. 2He defeated Moab and they brought tribute. 3He defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath and secured his rule all the way to the Euphrates River. 4He took 1,000 chariots, 7,000 cavalry, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He hamstrung the chariot horses but reserved enough for 100 chariots.

5When the Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 6He put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans brought tribute. 7He took the gold shields that Hadadezer’s officers carried and brought them to Jerusalem. 8From Tibhath and Cun, towns of Hadadezer, he took a large amount of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, pillars, and bronze utensils.	 1 Ch 18:1-8

9Tou/Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s whole army. 10He sent his son Hadoram to greet him and bless him for it. Hadoram brought all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze articles. 11David dedicated them to the LORD with the silver and gold he’d carried off from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalek.

12In addition, Abishai son of Zeruiah defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 13He put garrisons in Edom, and the Edomites served him. The LORD helped him wherever he went.

14David ruled Israel and administered justice and goodness for his people.

15Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army;

Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;

16Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests;

Shavsha was secretary;

17Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of David’s bodyguard;

David’s sons were chiefs at his side.	1 Ch 18:9-17

David Defeats the Ammonites and Syrians

19:1After this, Nahash, king of the Ammonites, died and his son became king. 2David said, “I’ll be kind to Hanun because his father was kind to me.” He sent ambassadors to console him about his father. 3But the officials in Ammon told Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending ambassadors to comfort you? Haven’t they come to spy out the land to overthrow it?” 4Hanun took David’s ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their cloaks as high as their hips, and sent them away. 5Some people came and told David about the men. He sent to meet them because they were humiliated. He told them to stay in Jericho till their beards grew back; then come home.

6When the Ammonites saw they’d been offensive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 37¾ tons 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah and Zobah. 7They hired 32,000 chariots, the king of Maacah, and his soldiers. They camped by Medeba. The Ammonites gathered from their towns and came to battle. 8When David heard it, he sent Joab and the whole army, the strongest soldiers. 9The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to the city. The kings that had come were by themselves in the field.      	1 Ch 19:1-9

10When Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he selected elite soldiers and arrayed them against the Arameans. 11The rest he placed under his brother Abishai, and they arrayed themselves against the Ammonites. 12He said,

“If the Arameans are too strong for me, you help me. If the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you. 13Be strong; let’s show ourselves courageous for our people and the towns of our God. May the LORD do what seems good to him.”

14Joab and his troops engaged the Arameans, and they fled. 15When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they retreated from Abishai into the city. Then Joab made a trip to Jerusalem.

16When the Arameans saw Israel had defeated them, they sent ambassadors to bring out the Arameans from the other side of the River with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. 17When David heard it, he mustered Israel, crossed the Jordan, and came on them. He drew up in formation against them and they fought him. 18They fled, and he killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put Shophach to death. 19When Hadadezer’s vassals saw Israel had defeated them, they surrendered and served David. The Arameans weren’t willing to help the Ammonites anymore.	1 Ch 19:10-19

David Defeats the Ammonites

20:1In the spring, when kings go to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and overthrew it. 2Then David went to Rabbah and took the crown off their king’s head, and found that it weighed 75½ lbs a talent of gold, and was set with precious stones. They placed it on David’s head, and he brought out a really large amount of spoil from the city. 3He brought the people out, and cut them with saws, sharp instruments, and axes. He did that to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and the people came back to Jerusalem.

4About this time, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and they were subdued. 5There was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 6Another time there was war at Gath, where there was a huge man with six digits on each hand and foot. He had descended from the giants too. 7When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimea, killed him. 8Those three descended from the giants in Gath that David and his warriors killed. 	1 Ch 20:1-8

David’s Ill-Advised Census

21:1Satan stood up against Israel and tempted David to take a census. 2David told Joab and the commanders of the troops,

“Go count Israel from Dan to Beersheba and bring me the results so I can know how many there are.”

3Joab said, “May the LORD add to his people 100 times as many as they are! But my lord the king, aren’t they all serving you? Why do you want to know this? Why bring guilt on Israel?”

4But the king’s word prevailed. So Joab went all over Israel and came back to Jerusalem. 5He gave David the census number: 1,100,000 swordsmen in Israel and 470,000 in Judah. 6He didn’t count Levi and Benjamin because he abhorred the king’s command. 7God was displeased with this thing, so he struck Israel. 	1 Ch 21:1-7

8David said to God, “I’ve committed an awful sin. Please take it away. I’ve done something really foolish.”

9The LORD told Gad, David’s seer, 10“Tell David,

‘The LORD says 11to take 12either three years of famine, three months of being swept away by your enemies’ sword, or three days of the sword of the LORD when his angel destroys throughout Israel.’ What should I report to the One that sent me?” 	1 Ch 21:8-12

13David told Gad, “I’m in great distress. I’ll cast myself on the LORD’s mercy because it’s so great. Don’t let me fall into human hands.” 14The LORD sent a plague on Israel; 70,000 people died. 15He sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem; but as he was about to do it, he looked and was sad over the catastrophe. He told the destroying angel, “That’s enough; relax your hand.” The angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan/Araunah the Jebusite. 16David looked up and saw him standing between earth and sky with his sword held out over Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with burlap, fell on their faces. 17He told God, “I’m the one that sinned. What have these sheep done? LORD my God, please plague me and my father’s family, not your people.” 	1 Ch 21:13-17

David Builds an Altar

18Then the angel of the LORD had Gad tell David to build an altar to the LORD on Ornan’s/Araunah’s threshing floor. 19David went up. 20Ornan/Araunah turned and saw the angel, and his four sons hid. He was threshing wheat. 21As David came to him, he left the threshing floor and prostrated himself. 22David told him, “Sell me this threshing floor so I can build an altar on it. Give it to me at full price so God will restrain the plague.”

23Ornan/Araunah said,

“Take it and do what seems good. I’ll give the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, the wheat for the grain offering—all of it.”

24But King David said, “I won’t take what’s yours for the LORD or offer a burnt offering that doesn’t cost me anything.” 25He paid him 15 lbs 600 shekels of gold for the site. 26He built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called to the LORD, and he answered him with fire from the sky on the altar. 27The LORD told the angel to sheath his sword.

28When David saw that the LORD had answered him, he offered sacrifice there, 29because the Tabernacle and altar that Moses made in the countryside were at Gibeon. 30But David couldn’t go to it to ask God because the angel’s sword terrified him. 22:1David said, “This will be the Temple of the LORD God and the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 		 1 Ch 21:18-22:1

David’s Preparations for the Temple

2David issued an order to gather the foreigners in Israel and set stonecutters to dress stones for God’s Temple. 3He provided large stores of iron for making nails for the doors in the gates and for clamps, more bronze than could be weighed, 4and cedar logs without number. The Sidonians and Tyrians brought him large supplies of cedar timber. 5He said,

“My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the LORD’s Temple will be magnificent, famous, and glorious all over the world. I’ll stockpile materials for it.”

David gathered lots of material for it before he died.	1 Ch 22:2-5

6Then he called Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the LORD God of Israel,

7“Son, I intended to build a temple for the LORD, 8but his message came to me, ‘You won’t build me a temple; you’ve shed so much blood and fought great wars. 9You’ll have a son that’s not a military figure. I’ll give him rest from his enemies everywhere. His name will be Solomon because I’ll give Israel ‘peace’ and quiet during his life. 10He’ll build a temple for me. He’ll be my son, and I’ll be his father. I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure.’ 11The LORD be with you so you can succeed at building it. 12May he give you discretion and intelligence, and give you charge over Israel so you can keep his Law. 13You’ll prosper if you observe carefully the statutes and ordinances he commanded Moses. Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated. 14I’ve taken great pains to stockpile materials: 3775 tons 100,000 talents of gold, 37,750 tons 1,000,000 talents of silver, bronze and iron past weighing, timber, and stone. You can add to that. 15You have lots of stonecutters, stonemasons, and carpenters skilled in all kinds of work. 16There’s no limit to the gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get started. The LORD be with you.” 	1 Ch 22:6-16

17He directed Israel’s leaders to help Solomon,

18“Isn’t the LORD with you? Hasn’t he given you rest in every direction? He’s delivered to you the nations in the land, and it’s under control. 19Set your heart and soul to look to him. Build his sanctuary so you can bring the Ark and God’s holy articles into it.”	1 Ch 22:17-19

Duties of Levites

23:1When David got old, he appointed Solomon king over Israel. 2He gathered the leaders with the priests and Levites. 3The Levites 30 years old and up numbered 38,000. 4Of these, 24,000 oversaw the work, 6,000 were officers and judges, 54,000 were gatekeepers, and 4,000 praised the LORD with instruments David made for that purpose. 6He divided them according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 	1 Ch 23:1-6

7The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.

8Three sons of Ladan were Jehiel the oldest, Jetham, and Joel.

9Three sons of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.

These were the heads of families in Ladan/Libni.

10-11The other sons of Shimei were Jahath, first; Zina/Zizah, second. Jeush and Beriah didn’t have very many sons, so they were all counted as one family.	 1 Ch 23:7-11

12The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

13The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses.

Aaron and his sons were set apart permanently to sanctify the LORD as most

holy, to burn incense to him, to perform service to him, and to bless in his

name.

14The sons of Moses, the man of God, were included in the tribe of Levi.

15The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.

16The son of Gershom was Shebuel the chief.

17The only son of Eliezer was Rehabiah.

Rehabiah had lots of sons.

18The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief.

19The sons of Hebron were Jeriah, first; then Amariah, then Jahaziel, then Jekameam.

20The sons of Uzziel were Micah, first, then Isshiah.

21The descendants of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.

The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.

22Eleazar died and had only daughters, so their cousins, Kish’s sons, married them.

23The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.	1 Ch 23:12-23

24Those were Levi’s descendants by heads of families as counted in their census. They served in the LORD’s Temple from 20 years old and up. 25David said, “The LORD God of Israel has given his people rest, and he lives in Jerusalem permanently. 26The Levites won’t need to carry the Tabernacle and the utensils for its service.” 27By David’s last words, Levi’s descendants were counted from 20 years old and up. 28They were to assist Aaron’s descendants with the service in the courts and rooms in the LORD’s Temple. They were to purify the holy things 29and help with the showbread, the fine flour for grain offerings, wafers without yeast, what’s baked in the pan, or what’s well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size. 30They were to stand each morning and evening to thank and praise the LORD. 31They offered burnt offerings on Sabbaths, new moons, and scheduled festivals in the number set by the Law. 32They maintained the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place and helped Aaron’s descendants with the service in the LORD’s house. 	1 Ch 23:24-32

Duties of Priests

24:1These were the divisions of Aaron’s descendants. His sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they didn’t have any sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 3David—with Zadok from Eleazar’s descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar’s descendants—divided them by their offices for their service. 4Since there were more chief men descended from Eleazar than from Ithamar, they divided them into 16 heads descended from Eleazar and 8 from Ithamar. 5They divided them alike by lot because they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God. 6Shemaiah son of Nethanel the secretary from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families among the priests and Levites—one family taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. 	1 Ch 24:1-6

7The first lot came out for Jehoiarib,	the second for Jedaiah,

8the third for Harim, 				the fourth for Seorim,

9the fifth for Malchijah, 			the sixth for Mijamin,

10the seventh for Hakkoz, 			the eighth for Abijah,

11the ninth for Jeshua, 			the tenth for Shecaniah,

12the eleventh for Eliashib, 			twelfth for Jakim,

13the thirteenth for Huppah, 			the fourteenth for Jeshebeab,

14the fifteenth for Bilgah, 			the sixteenth for Immer,

15the seventeenth for Hezir, 			the eighteenth for Happizzez,

16the nineteenth for Pethahiah, 	the twentieth for Jehezkel,

17the twenty-first for Jachin, 	the twenty-second for Gamul,

18the twenty-third for Delaiah, 	the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.

19Those were their officers for ministry when they came to the LORD’s Temple according to the ordinance Aaron their ancestor gave them by the LORD God’s command.     	1 Ch 24:7-19

20Now about the rest of Levi’s descendants:

from the descendants of Amram, Shubael;

from the descendants of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

21from Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.

22from the Izharites, Shelomoth;

from the descendants of Shelomoth, Jahath.

23the descendants of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, Jekameam fourth.  	1 Ch 24:20-23

24the descendants of Uzziel, Micah;

from the descendants of Micah, Shamir.

25the brother of Micah, Isshiah;

from the descendants of Isshiah, Zechariah.

26the descendants of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.

the descendants by Jaaziah: Beno.

27the descendants of Merari: by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.

28by Mahli: Eleazar, who didn’t have any sons.

29by Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.

30the descendants of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.

Those were the Levites by families. 31They also cast lots—the head of each family and his younger brother alike—like their relatives the descendants of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families among the priests and Levites.	1 Ch 24:24-31

Duties of Musicians

25:1David and the commanders of the army set apart some from sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. Those who performed their service were as follows:

2from the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king;

3from the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah—6 were under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied by giving thanks and praising the LORD;

4from the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

5Those were sons of Heman, the king’s seer, to honor him according to God’s message, because God gave Heman 14 sons and 3 daughters.

6Those were under their father’s direction to sing in the LORD’s Temple, with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman served under the king’s direction. 7There were 288 trained in singing to the LORD with their relatives, talented men. 8They cast lots for their duties, least and greatest, teacher and pupil. 	1 Ch 25:1-8

9The first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph—he and his relatives made 12;

the second for Gedaliah—he and his relatives made 12;

10the third came out for Zaccur—he, his relatives, and sons made 12;

11the fourth came out for Izri, who with sons and relatives made 12;

12the fifth came out for Nethaniah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

13the sixth came out for Bukkiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

14the seventh came out for Jesharelah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

15the eighth came out for Jeshaiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

16the ninth came out for Mattaniah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

17the tenth came out for Shimei, who with sons and relatives made 12;

18the eleventh came out for Azarel, who with sons and relatives made 12;

19the twelfth came out for Hashabiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;   	1 Ch 25:9-19

20for the thirteenth came out for Shubael, who with sons and relative made 12;

21for the fourteenth came out for Mattithiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

22the fifteenth came out for Jeremoth, who with sons and relatives made 12;

23the sixteenth came out for Hananiah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

24the seventeenth came out for Joshbekashah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

25the eighteenth came out for Hanani, who with sons and relatives made 12;

26the nineteenth came out for Mallothi, who with sons and relatives made 12;

27the twentieth came out for Eliathah, who with sons and relatives made 12;

28the twenty-first came out for Hothir, who with sons and relatives made 12;

29the twenty-second came out for Giddalti, who with sons and relatives made 12;

30the twenty-third came out for Mahazioth, who with sons and relatives made 12;

31the twenty-fourth came out for Romamti-ezer, who with sons and relatives made 12.

1 Ch 25:20-31

Duties of Gatekeepers

26:1For the divisions of the gatekeepers, from the Korahites there was Meshelemiah son of Kore from the sons of Asaph. 2Meshelemiah/Shelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael second, Zebadiah third, Jathniel fourth, 3Elam fifth, Johanan sixth, Eliehoenai seventh.

4Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad second, Joah third, Sacar fourth, Nethanel fifth, 5Ammiel sixth, Issachar seventh, and Peullethai eighth. God had blessed him. 6Shemaiah had sons who governed their family because they were brave soldiers: 7Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were brave men. 8Obed-edom’s sons, their sons and relatives were capable and strong for the service—62.

9Meshelemiah had sons and relatives—18 brave men.

10Hosah son of Merari had sons: Shimri the first (though not born first; his father made him first), 11Hilkiah second, Tebaliah third, and Zechariah fourth. Hosah had 13 sons and relatives.

1 Ch 26:1-11

12To these divisions of the gatekeepers, the chief men were given duties like their relatives to serve in the LORD’s Temple. 13According to their families, they cast lots, without regard for age, for each gate. 14The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, an advisor with insight; his lot came out for the north gate. 15Obed-edom’s lot fell for the south; the storehouse went to his sons. 16For Shuppim and Hosah the lot fell for the west gate, by Shallecheth’s gate on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard. 17There were six Levites on the east, four on the north and south each day, and at the storehouse two and two. 18At the Parbar on the west there were four at the highway and two at the Parbar. 19Those are the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of Korah and Merari.	 1 Ch 26:12-19

Treasurers and Other Officials

20The Levites were responsible for the treasures in God’s Temple and the dedicated gifts. 21The sons of Ladan, descendants of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, that is, the Jehielites, were the heads of families. 22The sons of Jehieli—Zetham and Joel—were responsible for God’s Temple. 23As to the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites, 24Shebuel son of Gershom son of Moses was officer over the treasures. 25His relatives by Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 26That Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for the treasures from the dedicated gifts that King David, the heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and commanders of the army had donated. 27They dedicated part of the spoils of war for repairing the LORD’s Temple. 28Shelomoth and his relatives were responsible for everything Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, Joab son of Zeruiah, and everybody had donated. 29The Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons, were assigned to duties away from the LORD’s house as officers and judges. 30The Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives—1,700 capable men, oversaw Israel west of the Jordan, for the work of the LORD and the service of the king. 31-32The Hebronites, Jerijah the chief and his relatives, capable men, were 2,700, heads of families. King David had them oversee Reuben, Gad, and the Manasseh half-tribe for the affairs of God and the king. (These Hebronites were investigated according to their genealogies and families in the fortieth year of David’s reign. Men with outstanding capability were found among them at Jazer in Gilead.)	1 Ch 26:20-32

Military Divisions

27:1These were the heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in regard to the divisions that came in and went out month by month all year. Each division numbered 24,000.

Those were the officers of the tribes of Israel.	 1 Ch 27:16-22

23But David didn’t count the ones under 20 because the LORD had said he would multiply Israel like stars in the sky. 24Joab son of Zeruiah had started to count them but didn’t finish. Wrath came on Israel because of it, and the number wasn’t included in The Chronicles of King David.

David’s Charge to Israel

28:1David gathered to Jerusalem the officials in Israel, the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, the overseers of the property and livestock that belong to the king and his sons, the officials and elite soldiers, all the brave warriors. 2He stood up and said,

“My relatives, my people, I intended to build a permanent temple for the Ark of the Covenant and for a footstool of our God; so I made preparations. 3But he told me, ‘You won’t build me a house; you’re a soldier that’s shed blood.’ 4But the LORD chose me from my father’s family to rule Israel permanently. He chose Judah to lead, chose my father’s family in Judah, and delighted in me among my brothers. 5From my sons he’s chosen Solomon to sit on the throne. (The LORD has given me many sons.) 6He told me, ‘Solomon will build my temple and courts. I’ve chosen him to be my son, and I’ll be his father. 7I’ll make his kingdom permanently secure if he’s resolute in keeping my commandments and ordinances, like he is today.’ 8In front of Israel, in the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, endeavor to follow all his commandments so you can keep the good land and leave it for your descendants.

David’s Charge to Solomon

9“Solomon, son, know your father’s God. Serve him with all your heart and a willing mind, because the LORD examines every heart and understands every intent. 10Be diligent about that because he has chosen you to build a temple for the sanctuary. Have the courage to do it.”

1 Ch 28:1-10

11Then David gave Solomon

the plans for the vestibule, its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms,

the room for the mercy seat;

12the plan for everything he had in mind—the courts, surrounding rooms,

storehouses, and rooms for dedicated things;

13the layout for the divisions of priests and Levites,

the plans for the work of service,	1 Ch 28:11-13

the utensils for the service,

14the golden utensils, the weight of gold for them;

the silver utensils, the weight of silver for them;

15the weight of gold for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, the

weight of each lampstand and its lamps;

the weight of silver for the silver lampstands, the weight of each lampstand

and its lamps;

16the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and

the silver for the silver tables;

17pure gold for the forks, basins, and pitchers,

the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl, and for

the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl; 18and

for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and

gold for the model of the chariot for the cherubs that spread out their

wings and cover the Ark of the Covenant.

19The details of this pattern he made clear in writing from the LORD’s hand.	1 Ch 28:14-19

20Then David told Solomon,

“Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated. The LORD’s with you. He won’t fail you or abandon you till the work is done. 21There are divisions of priests and Levites for serving in God’s Temple, and every willing man with skill will be with you for all kinds of service. The officials and the people will be entirely at your command.”	1 Ch 28:20-21

Offerings for the Temple

29:1David told the assembly,

“God alone has chosen Solomon.  He’s young and new to the work. It’s an important undertaking; the Temple won’t be for some mortal but for the LORD God. 2I’ve provided as much material as I could: gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood—plus large amounts of onyx, gems for settings, antimony, colored stones, marble—all kinds of precious stones. 3In addition, I’m giving my own gold and silver: 4113¼ tons 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir, 264¼ tons 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the Temple, 5and the gold and silver items the craftsmen will make. Who will offer willingly, consecrating himself to the LORD today?” 	1 Ch 29:1-5

6The heads of families made freewill offerings, as did the tribal leaders, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work. 7They gave for the service of God’s Temple 188¾ tons 5,000 talents of gold, 185 lbs 10,000 darics of gold, 377½ tons 10,000 talents of silver, 679½ tons 18,000 talents of brass, and 3775 tons 100,000 talents of iron. 8Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9The people celebrated because they had given willingly and offered freely with all their heart. David also celebrated greatly.	 1 Ch 29:6-9

David’s Prayer of Praise

10He blessed the LORD in the presence of the assembly,

“You’re blessed forever, LORD God of our ancestor Israel. 11You have the greatness, the power, the honor, the victory, and the majesty because everything in the sky and on earth belongs to you. The kingdom belongs to you, the honored head over everything. 12Wealth and honor come from you. Power and strength are with you. Your control makes everyone great and strong. 13We thank you and praise your glorious name.

14“But who am I and what’s my people that we can offer as willingly as this? Everything comes from you, and what we’ve given you is from your own things. 15We’re foreigners, nomads like our ancestors. Our time on earth is like a shadow; it’s not permanent. 16This abundance we’ve provided for building you a temple comes from you and belongs to you. 17I know you test the heart and are delighted with godliness. With a godly heart I’ve freely offered everything and seen your people offering freely and joyfully. 18 LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always keep such purposes and thoughts in your people’s hearts and direct their hearts to you. 19Give Solomon my son a whole heart for keeping your commandments, testimonies, and statutes; and for accomplishing everything so he can build the Temple I’ve made provisions for.”	    1 Ch 29:10-19

Solomon Anointed as King

20Then David told the assembly, “Bless the LORD your God.” The whole assembly blessed the LORD God of their ancestors. They bowed their heads in worship to him and paid homage to the king. 21They sacrificed to the LORD and the next day offered burnt offerings—1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs with their liquid offerings, and abundant sacrifices for all Israel. 22They ate and drank in the LORD’s presence that day with great happiness.

They confirmed Solomon as king and anointed him as ruler for the LORD and Zadok as priest. 23Solomon replaced David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him. 24The leaders, elite soldiers, and King David’s sons pledged allegiance to him. 25The LORD highly elevated him in front of Israel and placed such royal majesty on him as hasn’t been on any other king in Israel.

The Death of David

26David ruled all Israel 27for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and for 33 in Jerusalem. 28He died at a good old age, full of wealth and honor, and Solomon reigned. 29The acts of King David, from first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, The Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and The Chronicles of Gad the Seer, 30with accounts of his rule and strength, and the circumstances that came on him, on Israel, and on the surrounding kingdoms. 	    1 Ch 29:20-30

2 CHRONICLES

Solomon Asks for Wisdom

1:1Solomon secured himself in his kingdom; the LORD God was with him and made him great. 2He called together all Israel--the commanders of thousands and hundreds, the judges and every leader, the heads of families. 3He led the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon; God’s Tent of Meeting was there that Moses had made in the countryside. 4But David had brought the Ark up from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he’d made for it in Jerusalem. 5The bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur had made, was there in front of the Tabernacle. Solomon and the assembly went to it, 6and he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.  	2 Ch 1:1-6

7That night God appeared to him,

“Ask me what you want me to give you.”

8He said,

“You’ve dealt with my father David with great enduring love and made me king in his place. 9You’ve fulfilled your promise to him and made me king over a people as numerous as dust on the ground. 10Give me wisdom and knowledge so I can carry on my work for them. Who can rule such a great people as yours?”

11God said,

“Since that was in your mind and you haven’t asked for possessions, wealth, honor, a long life, or your enemies’ lives, 12I’ll give you wisdom and knowledge; and I’ll give you possessions, wealth, and honor like no other king ever had or will have.”

13He came back to Jerusalem and reigned over Israel.   	2 Ch 1:7-13

14Solomon amassed 1,400 chariots and 12,000 cavalry and stationed them in chariot cities and in Jerusalem. 15He made silver and gold as common as stone in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as sycamores in the western foothills. 16He imported horses from Egypt, and his traders bought them from Kue. 17They brought in chariots from Egypt for 15 lbs 600 shekels of silver apiece and horses for 3¾ lbs 150 shekels of silver each. They also exported them to kings of the Hittites and Aram.	2 Ch 2:14-17

Preparations for Building the Temple

2:1Solomon decided to build a temple for the LORD’s name and a royal palace for himself. 2He assigned 70,000 to transport materials, 80,000 to quarry stone in the mountains, and 3,600 to supervise them. 3He sent word to Hiram, king of Tyre,

“As you sent my father David cedars for his palace, do for me. 4I’m getting ready to build a temple for the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense and offering burnt offerings morning and evening on Sabbaths, new moons, and the LORD’s appointed festivals—items of worship required permanently in Israel. 5The temple I’m going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. 6But who can build him a temple? The sky, the highest heavens, can’t contain him; who am I to build him a temple, except for burning incense to him? 7Send me a man skilled at working in gold, silver, brass, and iron; in purple, crimson, and violet fabrics; a man that knows how to engrave and work with the skilled men I have in Judah and Jerusalem that my father provided. 8Send me cedar, cypress, and algum wood from Lebanon; your woodsmen know how to cut timber in Lebanon. My men will work with yours 9to prepare an abundance of it for the great, wonderful temple I’m going to build. 10I’ll give your woodsmen that cut the logs 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of crushed wheat, 220,000 bushels 20,000 kors of barley, 189,000 gallons 20,000 baths of wine, and 189,000 gallons 20,000 baths of oil.”	 2 Ch 2:1-10

11Hiram wrote back,

“Since the LORD loves his people, he’s made you their king. 12Bless the LORD God of Israel that made earth and sky and gave King David a wise son endowed with discretion and intelligence, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself. 13I’m sending Huram-abi, an intelligent master craftsman, 14the son of a woman from Dan and a father from Tyre. He knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, as well as in purple, violet, linen, and crimson fabrics. He knows how to do all kinds of engravings and carry out any design you assign him. He can work with your skilled men and those of my lord David. 15 Send us the wheat and barley, olive oil and wine you’ve offered. 16We’ll cut whatever timber you need and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa so you can transport it up to Jerusalem.”

17Solomon counted the foreigners in Israel according to David’s census and found there were 153,600 of them. 18He appointed 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, 70,000 to transport materials, and 3,600 to supervise the workmen.	2 Ch 2:11-18

Solomon Builds the Temple

3:1Solomon started building the LORD’s Temple on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to David, the place David prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan/Araunah the Jebusite. 2He began construction on the second day, second month, fourth year of his reign.

3The foundation for God’s Temple was 30 x 90ft.

4The porch in front of it was 30ft wide and 180ft tall, overlaid with pure gold inside.

5He lined the Temple itself with cypress wood overlaid with fine gold and decorated with palm trees and chains;

6adorned the Temple with precious stones—the gold was from Parvaim;

7overlaid the Temple with gold—the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors—and carved cherubs on the walls;

8made the Holy of Holies—30ft square, equaling the width of the Temple—and overlaid it with 22 2/3 tons 600 talents of fine gold—9the spikes weighed 20 oz 50 shekels of gold;

overlaid the upper rooms with gold.	 2 Ch 3:1-9

10He made 2 sculpted cherubs in the Holy of Holies and overlaid them with gold. 11The combined wingspan of the cherubs was 30ft. The wing of one (7½ft) touched the wall of the Temple. The other wing (7½ft) touched the wing of the second cherub. 12The wing of the second cherub (7½ft) touched the opposite wall. The other wing (7½ft) was attached to the wing of the first cherub. 13They stood on their feet facing the nave.

14He made a curtain out of violet, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and worked cherubs on it;

15two pillars in front of the Temple 53ft tall, with 7½ft capitals on top of each one;

16chains in the inner sanctuary and on top of the pillars;

100 pomegranates and put them on the chains;

17He set up the pillars on the right and left that he named Jachin and Boaz respectively.

2 Ch 3:10-17

Temple Furnishings

4:1He made

a bronze altar 30 x 30 x 15ft high;

2a circular, cast-metal sea 15ft from brim to brim, 7½ft deep and 45ft around.

3Figures of gourds were under it, entirely circling the sea (45ft). The oxen were in 2 rows cast in one piece with the Sea. 4It stood on 12 oxen, 3 facing out in each direction with their hindquarters inward. 5It was 4ins thick, with a brim like a cup—like a lily blossom. It could hold 27,000 gallons 3,000 baths.

6He made 10 basins to wash in, and set 5 on each side for rinsing things for the burnt offering; but the sea was for the priests to wash in;

710 golden lampstands in the way prescribed, and set them in the Temple, 5 on each side; 		2 Ch 4:1-7

810 tables placed in the Temple, 5 on each side;

100 gold bowls;

9the court of priests, the great court, and bronze-plated doors for the court.

10He set the sea on the right side of the Temple toward the southeast.	2 Ch 4:8-10

11Huram made the pails, shovels, and bowls, and finished the work for King Solomon on God’s Temple: 12the 2 pillars, the bowls and 2 capitals on top of the pillars, the 2 networks to cover the 2 bowls on the capitals; 13the 400 pomegranates for the 2 networks, 2 rows for each network to cover the 2 bowls of the capitals, 14the stands and the basins on the stands, 15the sea with 12 oxen under it.

16Huram made the pails, shovels, forks, and utensils out of polished bronze. 17The king had them cast in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah on the Jordan plain. 18Solomon made these utensils in great numbers. The weight of the bronze couldn’t be calculated.

19Solomon made everything in God’s Temple out of purest gold:  the altar, the tables for the Bread of the Presence, 20the lampstands with their lamps to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed, 21the flowers, lamps, tongs; 22the snuffers, bowls, spoons, firepans; the entrance to the Temple, its inner doors for the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the Temple (the nave).	     2 Ch 4:11-22

5:1When Solomon finished the work on the LORD’s Temple, he brought in the silver, gold, and utensils David had dedicated, and put them in the treasuries in God’s Temple.

The Ark Brought to the Temple

2Then he gathered to Jerusalem the elders in Israel, the leaders of tribes and families, in preparation for bringing up the Ark from The City of David (Zion). 3The men of Israel gathered to him at the festival in the seventh month. 4The elders came, and the Levites picked up the Ark 5and brought it up. They brought up the Tent of Meeting and the holy utensils that were in it. 6King Solomon and the community were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they couldn’t keep count of them. 7The priests brought the Ark to its place in the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, under the cherubs. 8They spread their wings over it and covered it and its poles. 9The poles were long enough to be visible in front of the inner sanctuary, but not outside; they’re still there. 10The only things in the Ark were the two tablets Moses put there at Horeb/Sinai, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. 	2 Ch 5:1-10

11When the priests came out of the Holy Place, they’d sanctified themselves without regard to divisions. 12The Levitical singers Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. They stood east of the altar with 120 priests blowing trumpets. 13The singers made themselves heard to the LORD’s praise and honor, and sang out accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments. When they praised the LORD and said, “He’s good because his love endures forever,” his Temple filled with such a cloud 14the priests couldn’t carry out their service. The LORD’s glory filled his Temple.

2 Ch 5:11-14

Solomon Praises the LORD

6:1Then Solomon said,

“You’ve said you’d be in the dense cloud.

2I’ve built you a lofty temple,

a permanent place for you to live.”

3Then he faced the people and blessed the assembly standing there,

4“Bless the LORD God of Israel, who said to my father David, 5‘From the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I hadn’t chosen a city to build a temple in for my name. I hadn’t chosen any man as a leader over Israel. 6But I’ve chosen Jerusalem as the place to identify with and David as leader over Israel. 7My father wanted to build him a temple, 8but the LORD said, ‘You meant well, 9but you won’t build me a temple; your son will.’ 10He has fulfilled that promise; I’ve risen to the throne and built the temple for his name. 11That’s where I’ve set the Ark that holds the covenant he made with Israel.”

Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication

12-13Solomon had built a bronze platform 7½ x 7½ x 4½ft high beside the altar in the middle of the court. He stood on it, knelt, and spread out his hands toward heaven. 	2 Ch 6:1-13

14“LORD God of Israel, there’s no God like you in heaven or on earth. You keep covenant and show enduring love to everyone that follows you with all their heart. 15You’ve kept your promise to David. You’ve said it with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hand. 16Keep this promise too, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on Israel’s throne if they follow my Law like you have.’ 17Confirm that promise now.

18“But will you live with people on earth? The sky and highest heaven can’t contain you, much less this Temple I’ve built. 19Yet attend to my petition. Listen to my call 20so you’ll be looking toward this Temple day and night where you’ve said you’d put your name. 21Listen when your people and I pray toward this place. Listen from heaven and forgive.

22“When someone sins against another and comes here to take an oath at your altar, 23then listen from heaven and judge them. Punish the sinful by bringing their way on their own head and justify the good by rewarding them according to their goodness. 	2 Ch 6:14-23

24“When an enemy defeats your people because they’ve sinned, if they repent, confess your name, and petition you in this Temple, 25then listen from heaven, forgive them, and bring them back to the country you’ve given them and their ancestors.

26“When there’s no rain because they’ve sinned against you and they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you punish them, 27then listen from heaven and forgive your people. Teach them the good way to live and send rain on the land you’ve given them to inherit.	2 Ch 6:24-27

28“When there’s a famine in the country; disease, blight or mildew; locust or grasshopper; a sickness, or an enemy laying siege to our towns—29whatever petition your people make, each knowing their own suffering and pain and spreading their hands toward this Temple, 30then listen from where you live, forgive, and render to each as they’ve done—only you know everyone’s heart—31so they’ll respect you and follow your ways as long as they live in the country you’ve given their ancestors.

32“When foreigners come from a distant country because of your great name, your powerful hand and outstretched arm, and pray toward this Temple, 33then listen from where you live, and do everything they call to you for, so every nation will know you and respect you like your people do, and so they’ll know that the Temple I’ve built wears your name.

34“When your people go out to battle by whatever way you send them and they pray to you toward this city you’ve chosen and the Temple I’ve built, 35then listen from heaven and support them. 	2 Ch 6:28-35

36“When they sin against you (everybody sins), you’re angry with them, and deliver them to an enemy that takes them captive near or far, 37if they take it to heart, repent, and petition you, ‘We’ve sinned, we’ve committed iniquity, we’ve acted wickedly’; 38if they come back to you with all their heart and soul, and pray toward the land you’ve given their ancestors, the city you’ve chosen, the Temple I’ve built, 39then listen from where you live, support them, and forgive them.

40“Open your eyes and ears to answer the prayer I’ve offered here. 41Rise, LORD God, to your resting place, you and your powerful Ark. Cover your priests with salvation; may your holy people celebrate what’s good. 42Don’t turn away from your anointed one. Remember your enduring love for your servant David.”

2 Ch 6:36-42

The Dedication of the Temple

7:1When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from the sky and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices, and the LORD’s glory filled the Temple. 2The priests couldn’t go in because of it. 3When the Israelites saw the fire and the LORD’s glory come down on the Temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground in worship and praised him, “He’s truly good; his love endures forever.”

4Then the king and the people sacrificed to the LORD 522,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. That’s how he and the people dedicated God’s Temple. 6The priests and Levites stood at their positions with the musical instruments King David had made for praising the LORD—“his love endures forever”—whenever he gave praise by their means, while the priests on the other side blew trumpets, and Israel stood. 7Solomon consecrated the middle of the court in front of the LORD’s Temple, because that’s where he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, and because the bronze altar he’d made couldn’t hold the burnt offering, grain offering, and fat.	 2 Ch 7:1-7

8Solomon and all Israel observed the festival for a week, a huge assembly from Lebo-hamath to the River of Egypt. 9They observed the dedication of the altar, kept the festival, and held a solemn assembly on the eighth day. 10The twenty-third day, seventh month, Solomon sent the people home, celebrating and happy over the LORD’s goodness to David, Solomon, and his people.

The LORD’s Response to Solomon

11Solomon finished the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, and everything he’d planned to do with them. 12Then the LORD appeared to him at night and said,

“I’ve heard your prayer, and I’ve chosen this place as a temple for sacrificing. 13If I shut up the sky so there’s no rain, or command locusts to devour the land, or send a plague among my people, 14and they humble themselves and pray, I’ll hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and restore their land. 15My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayers offered here. 16I’ve chosen and consecrated this Temple so my name will be here permanently. 17If yousg conduct yourself like your father and do everything I’ve commanded you and keep my statutes and ordinances, 18I’ll make your throne secure like I agreed with David to do, ‘You’ll always have a descendant on Israel’s throne if they follow my Law like you have.’

19“But if youpl leave my statutes and commandments and worship and serve other gods, 20I’ll uproot you from the country I’ve given you and throw aside this Temple I’ve consecrated to me. I’ll make it an object of mockery, a byword the world over. 21Everybody that goes by will be amazed at this Temple that had been so highly praised, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this country and this Temple?’ 22People will answer, ‘They abandoned the LORD God who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They adopted other gods, worshiped and served them.’”   	       2 Ch 7:8-22

Solomon’s Other Activities

8:1At the end of the 20 years it took Solomon to build the LORD’s Temple and his own palace, 2he rebuilt the towns Hiram had given him and settled Israelites in them. 3Then he captured Hamath-zobah 4and built Tadmor in the open country and storage cities in Hamath. 5He built Upper and Lower Beth-horon, fortified towns with walls, gates, and bars. 6He built Baalath, the storage cities he had, towns for his chariots and cavalry, and everything he delighted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and the rest of the territory he ruled.

7The people left over from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who weren’t Israelites 8the Israelites hadn’t destroyed, Solomon has made forced laborers ever since. 9He didn’t make slaves out of Israelites for his work. They were soldiers, chief captains, and commanders of his chariots and cavalry. 10Solomon had 250 chief officers that oversaw the people. 11Then he brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from The City of David to the palace he’d built for her, because he said, “My wife won’t live in David’s palace, because the places are holy where the LORD’s Ark has been.”	2 Ch 8:1-11

12Then Solomon offered burnt offerings on the altar he’d built in front of the vestibule. 13He followed the daily rule, offering them according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, new moons, and the three annual festivals: The Festival of Unleavened Bread, The Festival of Weeks, and The Festival of Booths.

14He followed David’s ordinance and appointed the priestly divisions for their service: the Levites for their duties of praise and serving in the presence of the priests by the daily rule; the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate. 15They kept his commandments to the priests and Levites about the treasuries.

16Solomon carried out his work from the day he laid the foundation of the LORD’s Temple till he finished it. 17Then he went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore in Edom. 18By his own officers, Hiram sent him ships and sailors that knew the sea. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and brought back 17 tons 450 talents of gold.	2 Ch 8:12-18

The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon

9:1When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She brought a large contingent of camels carrying spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. When she got there, she talked to him about everything on her mind. 2He answered her questions; there wasn’t anything he couldn’t explain to her. 3When she’d seen his wisdom, the palace he’d built, 4the food at his table, the seating of his officials, the attendance by his servers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, the stairway he used to go up to the LORD’s Temple, she was breathless,

5“The report was true that I heard in my country about your words and wisdom. 6But I didn’t believe it till I saw it. They didn’t tell me half of it. 7How fortunate your officers must feel, being around you continually and listening to your wisdom. 8Bless the LORD your God that delighted in you and set you on his throne. He loved Israel and established the nation permanently; that’s why he made you their king—to do justice and goodness.” 	2 Ch 9:1-8

9She gave him 4½ tons 120 talents of gold and a large amount of spices and precious stones. There’d never been spices like what she gave him. 10Then Hiram and Solomon’s crews brought gold from Ophir plus algum wood and precious stones. 11From the algum wood he made steps for the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace as well as lyres and harps for the singers. Nobody in Judah had ever seen anything like them. 12King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for—more than what she’d brought him. Then she and her attendants went back to her country.	 2 Ch 9:9-12

Solomon’s Wealth and Spendor

13The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 25 tons 666 talents 14besides what traders and merchants brought, and besides the gold and silver the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought. 15King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 15 lbs 600 shekels of beaten gold on each one. 16He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using 300 gold shekels on each one. He put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 17He made a large throne out of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 18It had 6 steps leading up to it, a gold footstool attached to it, arms on each side of the seat, and 2 lions standing beside the arms. 1912 lions stood on opposite sides of the 6 steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any other kingdom. 20King Solomon’s drinking cups were made out of gold. The items for the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver wasn’t considered valuable in his time. 21He had ships that went to Tarshish every three years with Hiram’s sailors, and brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.	 2 Ch 9:13-21

22King Solomon became greater than any other king anywhere in wealth and wisdom. 23Kings from all over the world wanted to be around him to hear the wisdom God put in him. 24Each one brought his gift: silver and gold articles, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules—so much a year.

25Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 cavalry. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with him in Jerusalem. 26He ruled the kings from the Euphrates River to the Philistine border and the border of Egypt. 27He made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the western foothills. 28They brought horses for Solomon from Egypt and every country.

Summary of Solomon’s Reign

29The rest of the acts of Solomon, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, The Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and The Visions of Iddo the Seer about Jeroboam son of Nebat. 30He ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem over all Israel. 31He died and they buried him in The City of David. His son Rehoboam reigned.	 2 Ch 9:22-31

The Northern Tribes Revolt

10:1Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2When Jeroboam heard about it, he came back. (He was in Egypt where he’d fled from Solomon.) 3They sent for him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they said to Rehoboam, 4“Your father made our yoke heavy. Lighten his hard service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we’ll serve you.”

5“Come back in three days.”

The people left.

6He consulted the elders that had served his father Solomon, “How do you advise me to answer the people?”

7“If you’ll be kind to them, please them, and speak good words to them, they’ll serve you permanently.”

8But he disregarded their advice and consulted the young men he grew up with and served him. 9He asked them, “What’s your advice?”

10“Tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s thighs! 11He loaded you with a heavy yoke; I’ll make it heavier. He disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.’”	2 Ch 10:1-11

12Jeroboam and the people came to Rehoboam on the third day like he’d directed them. 13The king answered them harshly and didn’t take the elders’ advice. 14“My father made your yoke heavy; I’ll make it heavier. My father disciplined you with whips; I’ll discipline you with scorpions.” 15He ignored the people, a turn of events the LORD allowed with the result that he would bring about his message through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam.

16When Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, they answered,

“What part do we have with David?

What inheritance do we have in Jesse’s son?

Everybody, go home, Israel!”

Look after your own house, David!”

Israel left and went home. 17But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites in the towns in Judah. 18He sent Hadoram, who oversaw forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam hurried and got in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. 19Israel has been in rebellion against David’s dynasty ever since.    	2 Ch 10:12-19

Shemaiah’s Prophecy

11:1When Rehoboam got to Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 soldiers from Judah and Benjamin to fight Israel to restore the kingdom to himself. 2But a message from the LORD came to Shemaiah, the man of God,

3“Tell Rehoboam and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 4‘The LORD says, “Don’t fight your kin. Go back home. I’m going to let this happen.”’”

They listened to him and went back from attacking Jeroboam.

5-10Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified towns for defense in Judah and Benjamin: Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 9Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 10Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. 11He reinforced the fortresses and put officers in them along with stores of food, olive oil, and wine. 12He put shields and spears in every city and reinforced them greatly. He held onto Judah and Benjamin. 	2 Ch 11:1-12

13The priests and Levites throughout Israel stood with him from all their districts. 14The Levites abandoned their pastures and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the LORD. 15He set up his own priests for the high places, satyrs, and calves he’d made. 16People from all the tribes that set their hearts on looking to the LORD God of Israel, followed the priests and Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their ancestors. 17They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam for three years; they followed the way of David and Solomon.

Rehoboam’s Family

18Then Rehoboam married Mahalath daughter of Jerimoth son of David and Abihail daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab. 19She bore him Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 20After her, he married Absalom’s daughter Maacah. She bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 21Rehoboam loved Maacah more than his other wives and concubines. He’d married 18 wives and 60 concubines and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters. 22He appointed Abijah as leader among his brothers because he intended to make him king. 23He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified towns, and gave them food in abundance, and sought many wives for them.	    2 Ch 11:13-23

Shishak [Shoshenq I] Invades Judah

12:1When Rehoboam’s kingdom got secure and strong, he and Israel turned away from the Law of the LORD. 2In his fifth year, because they weren’t faithful to the LORD, Shishak [Shoshenq I], king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem 3with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 cavalry. The Lybians, Sukkites, and Nubians came with him without number. 4He captured the fortified towns in Judah and advanced to Jerusalem. 5Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and Judah’s officials that had fled to Jerusalem to escape Shishak, “The LORD says you’ve left him, so he’s left you to Shishak.” 6The officials of Israel and the king humbled themselves, “The LORD is good.”

7When the LORD saw that, he told Shemaiah,

“They’ve humbled themselves, so I won’t destroy them. I’ll grant them some measure of deliverance and not pour out my anger on Jerusalem by Shishak. 8But they’ll become his slaves so they’ll learn the difference between serving me and serving other countries.” 	2 Ch 12:1-8

9Shishak [Shoshenq I] came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures out of LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 10King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them to the commanders of the guard that guarded the king’s palace. 11As often as the king went into the LORD’s Temple, the guards would carry them and then bring them back to the guard room. 12When he humbled himself, the LORD turned his anger away, so he didn’t destroy him completely. Conditions in Judah were tolerable.

13King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem. He was 41 when he began to rule, and he ruled for 17 years in the city where the LORD had chosen to identify with. Rehoboam’s mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 14He did evil because he didn’t set his heart to look to the LORD. 15The acts of Rehoboam, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and The Chronicles of Iddo the Seer by genealogical enrollment. There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam constantly. 16Rehoboam died and they buried him in The City of David, and his son Abijah became king.	     2 Ch 12:9-16

Abijah Rules Judah

13:1In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king in Judah. 2He ruled for 3 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah, daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. War arose between Abijah and Jeroboam. 3Abijah entered the battle with 400,000 trained soldiers; Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 trained soldiers.	 2 Ch 13:1-3

4Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and shouted,

“Jeroboam and all Israel, 5don’t you know that the LORD God of Israel gave the rule over Israel permanently to David and his descendants by a covenant of salt? 6Yet Jeroboam rebelled against him. 7Worthless men gathered around him, scoundrels that proved to be too strong for the son of Solomon when he was young and timid and couldn’t hold his own against them. 8So now you intend to resist the kingdom of the LORD by the descendants of David because you have a big army and the golden calves Jeroboam made as your gods. 9Haven’t you driven out the LORD’s priests, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites, and made your own priests like people in other countries? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, can become a priest for what aren’t gods. 10The LORD is our God. We haven’t left him. The descendants of Aaron are serving him as priests and the Levites are doing their work. 11Every morning they burn burnt offerings and fragrant incense to him. They set the showbread on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is ready to light every evening, because we’re keeping the charge of the LORD our God. But you’ve left him. 12God is at our head and his priests with the signal bugles to sound the alarm against you, Israel. Don’t fight with the LORD God of your ancestors; you won’t prevail.”	 2 Ch 13:4-12

13But Jeroboam had set an ambush from the rear, so Israel lay in front of Judah and behind. 14When Judah turned around, Israel attacked them from the front and back. Israel cried out to the LORD, the priests blew the bugles, 15and Judah’s soldiers raised the battle cry. When they did, God routed Jeroboam and Israel in front of Abijah and Judah. 16When the Israelites fled, God delivered them to Judah. 17Abijah and his army defeated them with a massacre of 500,000 elite troops. 18Israel was subdued because Judah trusted in the LORD. 19Abijah chased Jeroboam and captured several towns: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron with their villages. 20Jeroboam didn’t regain strength during Abijah’s reign. The LORD struck him, and he died.

21Abijah became more powerful and took 14 wives and became father of 22 sons and 16 daughters. 22The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and words, are recorded in The Account of the Prophet Iddo.	 2 Ch 13:13-22

14:1When Abijah died, they buried him in The City of David, and his son Asa became king. The country had peace for 10 years.

Asa Rules Judah

2Asa did what was good. 3He removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the scared pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, 4and commanded Judah to look to the LORD God of their ancestors and to observe the Law and the commandments. 5He removed the high places and incense altars from the towns in Judah. 6He built fortified towns in Judah since the LORD had given the country rest. 7He said to Judah,

“Let’s build these towns and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The country is still ours because we’ve sought the LORD, and he’s given us rest all around.”

They built and prospered. 8Asa had a standing army of 300,000 from Judah that carried spears and large shields and 280,000 from Benjamin that carried shields and handled bows—fearless soldiers.	2 Ch 14:1-8

9Now Zerah the Nubian came out against them at Mareshah with 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. 10Asa went out to engage him. They drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zaphathah at Mareshah. 11Asa called to the LORD,

“No one but you can help us in this battle of the weak against the strong. You’re our God. Help us against this army. Don’t let any mortal prevail against you.”

12The LORD routed the Nubians in front of Asa and Judah. 13Asa and the people chased them as far as Gerar. So many Nubians fell that they couldn’t recover. The LORD and his army shattered them. Judah carried away a lot of plunder. 14They destroyed the towns around Gerar because the dread of the LORD had fallen on them. They plundered them all, a lot of plunder. 15They also struck down the livestock owners and took away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they went back to Jerusalem.	      2 Ch 14:9-15

Asa’s Reforms

15:1The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded, 2and he went out to meet Asa,

“Listen, Asa, Judah, and Benjamin, the LORD is with you when you’re with him. If you look for him, he’ll let you find him. If you leave him, he’ll leave you. 3For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, without law. 4But in their distress they turned to the LORD and looked for him, and he let them find him. 5In those times, there wasn’t any peace to the ones who traveled; disturbances troubled the people in many countries. 6Nation crushed nation, city crushed city, because God distressed them with all kinds of problems. 7But you, be strong. Don’t lose courage; there’s reward for your work.”

8When Asa heard Azariah’s prophecy, he gathered the courage to remove the detestable idols from Judah and Benjamin and the towns he’d captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He restored the LORD’s altar that was in front of the vestibule. 9He gathered Judah, Benjamin, and people from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon that lived with them; because many had defected to him from Israel when they saw the LORD was with him. 10They came together at Jerusalem in the third month of Asa’s fifteenth year. 11That day they sacrificed 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from the spoils they’d brought. 12They entered into a covenant to look to the LORD God of their ancestors with all their heart and soul. 13Whoever wouldn’t look to him would be executed, man or woman, great or small. 14In addition, they shouted an oath to the LORD with trumpets and rams’ horns. 15Judah celebrated the oath, because they’d sworn with all their heart and sought him earnestly, and he let them find him. The LORD gave them rest in every direction.  2 Ch 15:1-15

16Asa even removed his mother Maacah from being queen mother, because she’d set up a detestable Asherah pole. Asa cut it down, pulverized it, and burned it at the Brook Kidron. 17He did not remove the high places from Israel, but his heart was blameless his whole life. 18He brought to God’s Temple his and his fathers’ dedicated things: silver, gold, and various items. 19There wasn’t any war till his thirty-fifth year.	 2 Ch 15:16-19

Asa’s Final Years

16:1In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha, king of Israel, came up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa. 2Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the LORD’s Temple and the king’s palace, and sent them to Benhadad, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, and said, 3“Let’s make a treaty between us, like the one between our fathers. I’ve sent you silver and gold; go break your treaty with Baasha so he’ll withdraw from me.” 4Benhadad listened and sent his armies against the towns in Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and the store towns in Naphtali. 5When Baasha heard about it, he stopped fortifying Ramah. 6Then King Asa brought Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber from Ramah that Baasha had been using, and with them Asa fortified Geba and Mizpah. 	2 Ch 16:1-6

7At that time, Hanani the seer came to Asa,

“Because you’ve relied on the king of Aram instead of me, his army has escaped. 8Weren’t the Nubians and Lybians an immense army with lots of chariots and cavalry? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he delivered them to you. 9His eyes scan over the world so he can strongly support the ones whose hearts are completely his. You’ve acted foolishly in this. From now on you’ll have wars.”

10Asa was mad at the seer for saying that and put him in stocks in prison. At the same time, he perpetrated cruelties on some of the people.

11The acts of Asa, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 12In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa got a serious infection in his feet; yet even in his disease he didn’t look to the LORD but to doctors. 13He died in the forty-first year of his reign. 14They buried him in a tomb he’d hewn out for himself in The City of David. They laid him on a bier he’d filled with various spices prepared by incense makers. They built a big fire in his honor.	2 Ch 16:7-14

Jehoshaphat Rules Judah

17:1His son Jehoshaphat became king and secured his position against Israel. 2He placed troops in Judah’s fortified towns and set garrisons in Judah and the towns in Ephraim his father had captured. 3The LORD was with him because he followed his ancestor David’s earlier days and didn’t look to the images of Baal. 4He sought his father’s God, followed his commandments, and didn’t do like Israel. 5The LORD secured the kingdom under him, Judah brought tributes to him, and he had great wealth and honor. 6He took pride in the ways of the LORD and removed again the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.

7In his third year, he sent his officials Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the towns in Judah. 8He sent with them Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, who were Levites, and with them the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 9They taught the people throughout Judah, having the Book of the Law with them. 	2 Ch 17:1-9

10The kingdoms around Judah dreaded the LORD; so they didn’t start any wars with Jehoshaphat. 11Some Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute. The Arabians brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 12He grew greater and greater, and built fortresses and store towns in Judah. 13He had large supplies in the towns in Judah and trained soldiers in Jerusalem. 14This was their muster according to their families:

Judah had commanders of thousands; Adnah was the commander with 300,000 soldiers. 15Beside him was Johanan the commander with 280,000.

16Beside him was Amasiah son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, with 200,000

trained soldiers.

17In Benjamin, Eliada a fearless soldier, had 200,000 armed with bow and shield.

18Beside him was Jehozabad with 180,000 equipped for war.

19Those served the king, not counting the ones he put in the fortified towns all around Judah.

2 Ch 17:10-19

Jehoshaphat and Ahab

18:1Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and allied himself by marriage with Ahab. 2Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered lots of sheep and oxen for him and the people with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. 3He asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?”

He told him, “I’m like you, my people like yours. We’ll go with you into the battle.”

4In addition, he said, “First let’s ask for a message from the LORD.” 5He gathered the prophets, 400 men, and asked, “Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?” They said, “Go up. God will deliver it to you.”

6But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there still a prophet of the LORD here that we can ask?”

7Ahab told him, “There’s one, Micaiah son of Imla, but I despise the guy; he never prophesies anything good about me.”

But Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t say that.” 	2 Ch 18:1-7

8The king of Israel called an officer and said, “Quick, bring Micaiah, Imla’s son.”

Micaiah’s Prophecy Against Ahab

9The two kings were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, and the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 10Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns and said, “The LORD says you’ll gore the Arameans with these till they’re consumed.” 11The prophets kept prophesying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prevail. The LORD will deliver it to you.”

12The messenger that went to summon Micaiah told him, “The prophets are all speaking favorably for the king; so please say what they’re saying.”

13“As sure as the LORD lives, I’ll say what my God says.” 	2 Ch 18:8-13

14When he came, the king said, “Should we attack Ramoth-gilead?”

“Go right on up there! Prevail! The LORD’s going deliver it to you for sure!!”

15The king said, “How many times do I have to demand that you not tell me anything but the truth in the LORD’s name?”

16So he said,

“I saw Israel scattered on the mountains

like sheep without a shepherd.

The LORD said,

‘They don’t have a master;

they need to go home in peace.’”

17Ahab said, “Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me?”

18Micaiah said,

“Listen to the LORD’s message. I saw him sitting on his throne, and the host of heaven was standing on his right and left. 19He said, ‘Who will lure Ahab into going up and falling at Ramoth-gilead?’

“One said one thing, another said another.

20“Then a spirit came forward and said, ‘I’ll do it.’

‘How?’

21‘I’ll be a deceiving spirit in his prophets.’

‘Go do it.’

22The LORD has put a deceiving spirit in your prophets and declared disaster on you.”	2 Ch 18:14-22

23Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came and hit Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the LORD leave me to speak to you?”

24“You’ll see when you go hide in an inner room.”

25The king said,

“Take Micaiah back to Amon, governor of the city, and to my son Joash. 26Tell them to put him in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water till I come back safely.”

27Micaiah said, “If you come back safely, the LORD hasn’t spoken by me. You all need to listen.”	2 Ch 18:23-27

Micaiah’s Prophecy Against Ahab

28The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat went on up against Ramoth-gilead. 29Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I’ll disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes.” The king disguised himself, and they went into battle. 30The king of Aram had told the captains of his chariots, “Don’t fight anybody great or small, just the king of Israel.” 31When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, “It’s the king of Israel!” They turned aside to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him by diverting them away. 32When the captains saw it wasn’t Ahab, they quit chasing him. 33A man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint in the armor. He told the chariot driver, “Turn around, and get me out of the fight. I’m seriously wounded.” 34The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans till evening. He died at sundown.	2 Ch 18:28-34

Jehoshaphat Appoints Judges

19:1Jehoshaphat went back safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 2Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said,

“Should you help the sinful, love the ones that hate the LORD, and bring his wrath on you? 3But there’s some good in you: you’ve removed the Asherah poles from the country and set your heart to look to God.”

4Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, circulated again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their ancestors. 5He appointed judges in each fortified city in Judah,

6“Consider what you’re doing. You’re not just judging for people but for the LORD that’s with you. 7Respect him; he won’t take part in sin, partiality, or bribery.”           	2 Ch 19:1-7

8In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and heads of families to judge disputes,

9“Do this in respect for the LORD, faithfully and wholeheartedly. 10Whenever a dispute comes to you from your relatives that live in their towns, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, warn them so they won’t be guilty to the LORD and wrath won’t come on you or them. 11Amariah the chief priest will manage everything that has to do with the LORD. Zebadiah son of Ishmael, ruler of Judah, will manage everything that has to do with the king. The Levites will be officers in your presence. Act resolutely; the LORD be with the godly.” 	2 Ch 19:8-11

Jehoshaphat Defeats Moab and Ammon

20:1After that, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some Meunites came to attack Jehoshaphat. 2Some people brought him a report, “A large army is coming out of Edom from the other side of the sea. They’re in Hazazon-tamar (En-gedi).” 3He was afraid, set himself to look to the LORD, and declared a fast throughout Judah. 4Judah gathered from all the towns to look to the LORD for help.	2 Ch 20:1-4

5Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the LORD’s Temple in front of the new court,

6“LORD our ancestors’ God, aren’t you God in the sky? Don’t you rule every nation? You have such power and strength that nobody can stand against you. 7Didn’t you drive out the people in this land, and give it to the descendants of Abraham your friend forever? 8They’ve lived in it, built a sanctuary there for your name, and said, 9‘Should misfortune come on us—the sword, judgment, disease, or famine—we’ll present ourselves at this Temple (because your name is here), and call out to you in our distress. You’ll hear us and deliver us. 10You didn’t let Israel invade the Ammonites, Moabites, or Mount Seir when they came out of Egypt. (They turned aside and didn’t destroy them.) 11Now they’re rewarding us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us. 12Our God, won’t you judge them? We’re powerless in the face of such a big army. We don’t know what to do but look to you for help.”  	2 Ch 20:5-12

13All Judah was standing before the LORD with their infants, wives, and children.

14Then in the assembly, the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah (son of Benaiah son of Jeiel son of Mattaniah the Levite, descendant of Asaph).

15“Listen, Judah, people in Jerusalem, King Jehoshaphat. The LORD says, ‘Don’t be afraid or intimidated by that big army. The battle is not yours but mine. 16Go down against them tomorrow. They’ll come up by the ascent of Ziz. You’ll find them at the end of the valley east of the Wilderness of Jeruel. 17You won’t need to fight in this battle. Take your positions. Stand and watch my salvation for you.’ Don’t be afraid or intimidated. Go out to face them tomorrow; the LORD’s with you.”

18Jehoshaphat bowed to the ground, and Judah and the people in Jerusalem fell down in worship to the LORD. 19The Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to give loud praise to the LORD God of Israel.	2 Ch 20:13-19

20They got up early the next morning and went out to the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they went, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Judah and Jerusalem, trust the LORD and you’ll be safe. Trust his prophets and you’ll succeed.” 21When he’d advised the people, he appointed the ones that sang and praised the LORD in holy attire to go out ahead of the army, “Thank the LORD, because his love endures forever.” 22When they began singing and praising, he set ambushes against the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mount Seir; and they were routed. 23The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the people from Mount Seir and destroyed them completely. When they’d finished that, they helped destroy one another.

24When Judah came to the watchtower over the countryside, they looked toward the army. Corpses were lying everywhere; nobody had escaped. 25When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found lots of equipment, clothes, and valuable things, more than they could carry. They gathered spoil for three days, there was so much of it. 26On the fourth day, they met in the Valley of Beracah to “bless” the LORD. That’s still its name. 27Everyonem in Judah and Jerusalem came back happy with Jehoshaphat in the lead, because the LORD made them celebrate over their enemies. 28They came to Jerusalem to the Temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets. 29All the kingdoms dreaded God when they heard that he had fought Israel’s enemies. 30Jehoshaphat’s kingdom had peace because his God gave him rest in every direction.             	2 Ch 20:20-30

Summary of Jehoshaphat’s Reign

31Jehoshaphat was 35 when he became king and ruled Judah in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 32He followed the way of his father Asa. He did what was good, 33but he didn’t take away the high places. The people hadn’t yet directed their hearts to their ancestors’ God. 34The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, are recorded in The Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani and The Book of the Kings of Israel.

35After that, Jehoshaphat allied himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel. That was a bad decision. 36He did it to build ships in Ezion-geber for going to Tarshish. 37Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against him, “Because you’ve allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed what you’ve built.”	2 Ch 20:31-37

Jehoram Rules Judah

21:1Jehoshaphat died, and they buried him in The City of David. His son Jehoram became king. 2His brothers were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariyahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. 3Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and other precious things along with fortified towns in Judah. But he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, his firstborn.

4When Jehoram had taken over the kingdom and made himself secure, he killed his brothers with the sword and some of the rulers too. 5He was 32 when he became king and ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 6He followed the ways of Israel’s kings like Ahab did. (His wife was Ahab’s daughter.) He did evil, 7but because of his covenant with David, the LORD wouldn’t destroy David’s house. He’d promised to give him and his descendants a lamp permanently.

2 Ch 21:1-7

8During his reign Edom revolted and set up its own king. 9So Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. He got up at night and struck down the Edomites and the commanders of the chariots that were surrounding him. 10But Edom is still independent from Judah.

Libnah revolted at the same time because Jehoram had left the LORD God of his ancestors. 11Besides, he made high places in the mountains in Judah, and led the people in Jerusalem to carry on religious prostitution.

12Elijah the prophet sent him a letter:

“The LORD, God of your ancestor David, says, ‘You’ve not followed the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and Asa king of Judah. 13You’ve followed the kings of Israel and made Judah and Israel carry on religious prostitution like Ahab’s house did. You’ve even killed your own brothers, who were better than you. 14I’m going to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and everything you own with catastrophe. 15You’ll suffer with a severe intestinal disease till your bowels come out.’”	2 Ch 21:8-15

16Then the LORD stirred up the Philistines and Arabs that bordered the Nubians. 17They invaded Judah and carried away everything in the king’s palace, including his sons and wives. He didn’t have any son left except Jehoahaz, the youngest.

18In addition, the LORD struck him with an incurable disease. 19In two years, his bowels came out, and he died in severe pain. His people built no fire for him like they did for his ancestors. 20He died with nobody’s regret. They buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.	2 Ch 21:16-20

Ahaziah Rules Judah

22:1Then the people in Jerusalem made Ahaziah/Jehoahaz, his youngest son, king. The band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp had killed the older sons. 2Ahaziah was 22 and ruled for 1 year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri. 3To his destruction, he also followed Ahab’s practices because his mother gave him bad advice. 4He sinned in 5going with Jehoram son of Ahab to fight Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram/Jehoram. 6He came back to heal in Jezreel from his wounds at Ramah. Ahaziah son of Joram/Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram/Jehoram in Jezreel because he was wounded.	 2 Ch 22:1-6

7The destruction of Ahaziah was from God for going to Joram/Jehoram. He went out with Jehoram against Jehu son of Nimshi that the LORD had anointed to eliminate Ahab’s family. 8When Jehu was executing judgment on that family, he found Judah’s officials and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers serving Ahaziah and killed them. 9His men also looked for Ahaziah and caught him hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, put him to death, and buried him; because they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” There wasn’t anybody from Ahaziah’s family capable of ruling the kingdom.

Queen Athaliah Rules Judah

10When his mother Athaliah saw he was dead, she killed the royal offspring in Judah. 11But Jehoshabeath, King Joram/Jehoram’s daughter, stole Ahaziah’s son Joash from among the king’s sons—who were being murdered—and placed him and his nurse in a bedroom. Jehoshabeath, wife of Jehoiada the priest and Ahaziah’s sister, hid him so Athaliah couldn’t kill him. 12They hid him in God’s Temple for 6 years while Athaliah ruled the country. 	2 Ch 22:7-12

Revolt Against Athaliah

23:1In the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the courage to make a pact with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah son of Joram/Jeroham, Ishmael son of Johanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. 2They gathered to Jerusalem the Levites from the towns in Judah and the heads of families. 3When the assembly made a pact with the king in God’s Temple, Jehoiada told them,

“The king’s son will reign like the LORD has said regarding David’s descendants. 4A third of you, priests and Levites that come in on the Sabbath, will be gatekeepers. 5A third will be at the king’s palace, and a third at the Foundation Gate. The people will be in the courts of the Temple. 6Don’t let anybody go into the Temple except the priests and servicing Levites. They can go in because they’re holy. Have the people keep the charge of the LORD. 7The Levites will surround the king with weapons in hand. Kill whoever comes into the Temple. Be with the king when he comes in and goes out.”

8The Levites and Judah did what he said. Each one brought his men that were to come in on the Sabbath with the ones that were to go out on the Sabbath, because Jehoiada didn’t dismiss any of the divisions. 9Jehoiada gave the commanders of hundreds King David’s spears and large and small shields that were in the Temple. 10He stationed the men around the king from the south side of the Temple to the north, near the altar. 11Then they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and declared him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, “Long live the king!”	2 Ch 23:1-11

The Death of Athaliah

12When Athaliah heard people running and praising the king, she came into the Temple. 13She saw the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the commanders and trumpeters beside him. The common people were celebrating and blowing trumpets. The singers with their musical instruments were leading the praise. She tore her clothes, “Treason! Treason!” 14Jehoiada brought out the commanders over the army and told them, “Bring her out between the ranks and put to death with a sword anybody that tries to rescue her.” The priests said, “Don’t do it in the Temple.” 15They seized her, and when she got to the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s palace, they put her to death.	 2 Ch 23:12-15

Jehoiadah’s Reforms

16Jehoiada made a covenant with the people and the king that they’d be the LORD’s people. 17The people tore down Baal’s temple, broke his altars and images into pieces, and killed Mattan his priest by the altars. 18He placed the officers of the Temple under the Levitical priests that David had assigned over the Temple, as written in the Law of Moses—with celebration and singing according to David’s order. 19He stationed gatekeepers for the Temple so nobody ceremonially unclean could go in. 20He took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, rulers of the people, and common people, and brought the king down from the LORD’s Temple through the upper gate to the king’s palace and placed him on the throne. 21So the people celebrated, and the city grew quiet because they’d put Athaliah to death with a sword. 	2 Ch 23:16-21

Joash Repairs the Temple

24:1Joash was 7 when he became king and ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2He did what was good all the time Jehoiada was alive. 3Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.

4After that, Joash decided to restore the LORD’s Temple. 5He gathered the priests and Levites, and said, “Go out to the towns in Judah and collect money to repair your God’s Temple annually; do it right away.” But the Levites didn’t act right away. 6He summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax Moses laid on Israel for the Tent of Testimony?” 7The sons of Athaliah had broken into God’s Temple and used the holy things for the images of Baal.	2 Ch 24:1-7

8The king had them make a chest to set outside by the gate into the Temple. 9They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the tax Moses had levied in the desert. 10The officers and common people celebrated and brought in their levies and dropped them in the chest till they’d finished. 11Whenever the Levites saw there was a lot in the chest, they‘d bring it to the king’s officer, and his secretary and the chief priest’s officer would empty it and take it back to its place. They did that daily and collected a lot of money. 12The king and Jehoiada gave it to the ones that serviced the Temple. They hired masons, carpenters, and artisans in iron and bronze to repair the Temple, 13and the work progressed. They restored it to its specifications and reinforced it. 14When they finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada. They made it into utensils for the Temple, for its service, the burnt offering, gold and silver pans and utensils. They offered burnt offerings continually all the time Jehoiada was alive. 	2 Ch 24:8-14

15Jehoiada died at the good old age of 130. 16They buried him in The City of David among the kings because he’d done well in Israel for God and his Temple.

Jehoiadah’s Reforms Reversed

17But after Jehoiada’s death, the officials of Judah came and bowed to the king, and he listened to them. 18They abandoned the Temple of the LORD God and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. So wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem. 19He sent prophets to bring them back to him, but they wouldn’t listen. 20Then God’s Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood above the people and said, “God says, ‘Why do you sin against the LORD’s commands and not prosper? Because you’ve left him, he’s left you.’” 21They plotted against him, and at the king’s command stoned him to death in the Temple court; 22so Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him; he murdered his son. As he died, he said, “May the LORD see and repay you!”          	2 Ch 24:15-22

The End of Joash’s Reign

23At the turn of the year, the Aramean army came up against him. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, killed the people’s officials, and sent their spoil to the king in Damascus. 24Though the Arameans came with a small army, the LORD delivered a large army to them because they’d left him. They carried out judgment on Joash.

25They left him seriously wounded. When they’d gone, his own officials plotted against him for murdering Jehoiada’s son. They assassinated him in his bed and buried him in The City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 26The ones that plotted against him were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 27The Commentary on the Book of the King gives accounts about his sons, the many oracles against him, and the restoration of God’s Temple. His son Amaziah became king.	    2 Ch 24:23-27

Amaziah Rules Judah

25:1Amaziah was 25 and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2He did what was good, but not with all his heart. 3As soon as his kingdom was firmly in hand, he executed the officials that had assassinated his father. 4He didn’t put their children to death, like the LORD commanded in the Law of Moses: “Don’t execute parents for offspring or offspring for parents. Execute each person for that person’s sin.”

5Amaziah gathered Judah and appointed them according to their families under commanders of thousands and hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin. He took a census of men 20 and older and found 300,000 elite men, fit for war and handling spear and shield. 6He hired 100,000 trained soldiers out of Israel for 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver. 7But a man of God came to him and said,

“Don’t let Israel’s army go with you; the LORD is not with Israel or Ephraim. 8Even if you go strong into the battle, God will still make you stumble in front of the enemy. He has power to help or hinder.”

9Amaziah said, “But what will we do for the 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver I’ve given Israel’s troops?”

The man of God answered, “The LORD has a lot more to give you than that.”

10Amaziah dismissed the troops from Ephraim, and they went home disgruntled. 	2 Ch 25:1-10

11Amaziah gathered his courage, led his people to the Valley of Salt, and struck down 10,000 people from Seir. 12Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down to their death. 13But Israel’s troops that Amaziah sent back, raided the towns in Judah between Beth-horon and Samaria, struck down 3,000 of them, and plundered a lot of spoil.

14After Amaziah came from slaying the Edomites, he brought the gods from Seir. He set them up as gods, bowed to them, and burned incense to them. 15The LORD’s anger burned against him. He sent him a prophet, “Why seek gods that haven’t delivered their own people from you?”

2 Ch 25:11-15

16As he was talking to him, the king said, “Did we appoint you a royal advisor? Shut up! Why get struck down?”

The prophet stopped and said, “God has planned to destroy you because you’ve done that and ignored my advice.”

17Amaziah took counsel and sent to Joash (son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel), “Come. Let’s face each other.”

18Joash sent back to him,

“A thistle in Lebanon sent to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and tramped down the thistle. 19You said, ‘I’ve defeated Edom.’ You’ve become proud. Stay home. Why stir up trouble to make yourself and Judah fall?” 	2 Ch 25:16-19

20But Amaziah ignored him because it fit with the LORD’s plan to deliver them to Joash because they’d looked to Edom’s gods. 21Joash king of Israel went up and faced Amaziah at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 22He defeated Judah, and they fled to their tents. 23Joash captured Amaziah at Beth-shemesh and took him to Jerusalem. He tore down the wall from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 600ft. 24He took all the gold and silver, the items in God’s Temple with Obed-edom, the treasures of the king’s palace, and hostages too, and went back to Samaria.

25Amaziah lived 15 years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 26The rest of the acts of Amaziah, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 27From the time Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they plotted against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent assassins after him and killed him. 28They brought him back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in The City of Davidms.           2 Ch 25:20-28

Uzziah Rules Judah

26:1The people in Judah took Uzziah/Azariah at 16 and made him king after his father Amaziah. 2He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, 3and ruled for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. 4He did what was good like everything good his father Amaziah had done. 5He continued to look to God in the time of Zechariah, who had understanding through the vision of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God caused him to flourish.	      									       2 Ch 26:1-5

6He went out and fought the Philistines, and tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built towns around Ashdod among the Philistines. 7God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabians in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. 8The Ammonites paid him tribute, and his reputation extended to the border of Egypt, because he became very strong. 9In addition, he built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and the Valley Gate at the Angle, and fortified them. 10He built towers in the countryside and hewed out many cisterns, because he had lots of livestock in the western foothills and in the plains. He had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and fertile fields because he loved the soil. 11Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions, according to the number of their muster, prepared by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the official under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s officers. 12The number of family leaders over trained soldiers was 2,600. 13They directed an elite army of 307,500 that could wage war with great power against the king’s enemies. 14For the whole army, Uzziah/Azariah prepared shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and sling stones. 15In Jerusalem he constructed engines of war invented by skilled men, and put them on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and catapult large stones. His reputation spread because he was marvelously helped until he became strong.	     2 Ch 26:6-15

16But when he became strong, his pride led him to act corruptly. He became unfaithful by going into the LORD’s Temple and burning incense on the incense altar. 17Azariah the priest came in after him with 80 of the priests, brave men, 18to oppose him,

“You’re not supposed to burn incense. That’s for the priests to do, consecrated descendants of Aaron. Get out of the sanctuary. You’ve been unfaithful and won’t have any honor from the LORD God.”

19But Uzziah/Azariah, with a censer in hand for burning incense, was mad. While he ranted at the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead beside the altar of incense. 20Azariah and the priests saw it and hurried him out of there. He hurried to get out himself because the LORD had struck him. 21For the rest of his life, he lived as a leper in a house separate from the Temple. His son Jotham managed the king’s palace and judged the people. 22The rest of the acts of Uzziah/Azariah, first to last, the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz has recorded. 23Uzziah died, and they buried him in a burial field the kings owned, because he was a leper. His son Jotham became king.	2 Ch 26:16-23

Jotham Rules Judah

27:1Jotham was 25 and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerushah daughter of Zadok. 2He did what was good like his father, but he didn’t go into the Temple. The people kept acting corruptly. 3He built the upper gate of the LORD’s Temple and built extensively the wall of Ophel. 4He built towns in the hill country of Judah, and fortresses and towers on the wooded hills. 5He fought the Ammonites and prevailed; for three years they paid him 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 110,000 bushels 10,000 kors of wheat, and 110,000 bushels 10,000 kors of barley a year. 6He became powerful because he ordered his ways in the LORD his God. 7The rest of the acts of Jotham, including his wars, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. [8] 9He died, and they buried him in The City of David. His son Ahaz became king.           2 Ch 27:1-9

Ahaz Rules Judah

28:1Ahaz was 20 and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do what was good like David did. 2He followed the kings of Israel, made molten images for the worshipping Baal, 3burned incense in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, and burned his sons like the nations the LORD had driven out. 4He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places on the hills under every green tree.

5The LORD delivered him to the king of Aram. They defeated Ahaz and took a large number of captives to Damascus. God also delivered him to the king of Israel, who inflicted great casualties on him. 6Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day, all trained soldiers, because they’d left the LORD God of their ancestors. 7Zichri, a powerful man in Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the king’s son; Azrikam, the palace commander; and Elkanah, the king’s second in command.	2 Ch 28:1-7

8Then Israel took away 200,000 women, sons, and daughters; and a great deal of spoil. 9But the LORD’s prophet Oded met the army coming to Samaria,

“Because the LORD God was angry with Judah, he delivered them to you. You’ve killed them in a rage that has reached heaven. 10Now you intend to make slaves out of the men and women from Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t you have sins of your own against your God? 11Take back the ones you’ve captured from your kin. The LORD’s furious anger has turned against you.”

12Some leaders of Ephraim—Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those returning from battle,

13“Don’t bring the captives in here. You’re about to bring guilt on us against the LORD and add to our sins. We have a lot of guilt, so his furious anger has turned against us.”

14The armed men left the captives and spoil with the officers and the assembly. 15Designated men took the captives and put clothes from the spoil on the naked ones. They gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them something to drink, put olive oil on their wounds, led their feeble ones on donkeys, and took the captives to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms. Then they came back to Samaria.	2 Ch 28:8-15

Ahaz Closes the Temple

16At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help. 17The Edomites had attacked Judah again and taken captives. 18The Philistines had invaded the towns in the western foothills and the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, and settled there. 19That was because the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz; he’d brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was terribly unfaithful to the LORD. 20Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came and attacked him instead of reinforcing him. 21Ahaz took a portion out of the Temple, the king’s palace, and the officials’ houses and gave it to the king of Assyria; but he didn’t help him. 	2 Ch 28:16-21

22In his distress, this same King Ahaz became more unfaithful to the LORD. 23He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, “Since the gods of Aram helped them, I’ll sacrifice to them so they’ll help me.” But they became his and Israel’s downfall. 24When Ahaz gathered the utensils from God’s Temple, he cut them in pieces. He closed the doors of the Temple and built altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25In every city in Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and made the LORD angry. 26The rest of his ways and deeds, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 27Ahaz died, and they buried him in Jerusalem but not in the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah reigned.

2 Ch 28:22-27

Hezekiah Rules Judah

29:1Hezekiah became king when he was 25 and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. 2He did what was right like David did.

Hezekiah Reopens the Temple

3In the first month of his first year, he reopened the doors of the LORD’s Temple and repaired them. 4He brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the courtyard on the east. 5He said,

“Listen, Levites. Consecrate yourselves and the Temple of the LORD God of our ancestors. Remove ceremonial uncleanness from the Holy Place. 6Our ancestors have been unfaithful and done what he forbids. They’ve turned their backs on where he lives. 7They’ve shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps. They haven’t burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place. 8So God’s wrath has been against Judah and Jerusalem. He’s made them something to abhor, be amazed at, hissed at, as you can see. 9Our ancestors fell by the sword. Our sons, daughters, and wives are in captivity because of it. 10I intend to renew the covenant with the LORD God of Israel so his furious anger will turn away from us. 11Sons, don’t neglect your responsibilities any longer. The LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, perform service to him and his people, and burn incense.” 	2 Ch 29:1-11

12The Levites got to work:

Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites;

Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the descendants of Merari;

Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;

13Shimri and Jeiel from the descendants of Elizaphan;

Zechariah and Mattaniah from the descendants of Asaph;

14Jehiel and Shimei from the descendants of Heman; and

Shemaiah and Uzziel from the descendants of Jeduthun. 	2 Ch 29:12-14

15They gathered their relatives, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the LORD’s Temple like the king said by the LORD’s words. 16The priests went into the inner part of the Temple to cleanse it. Everything unclean they found they brought out to the court, and the Levites carried it down to the Kidron valley. 17They began the consecration on the first day, first month. On the eighth day, they went into the vestibule. They consecrated the LORD’s Temple in eight days and finished on the sixteenth.

The Temple Rededicated

18Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said,

“We’ve cleansed the whole Temple, the altar for burnt offering with its utensils, and the table for the showbread with its utensils. 19We’ve prepared and consecrated the utensils King Ahaz discarded during his unfaithfulness. They’re in front of the altar.”	2 Ch 29:15-19

20Then King Hezekiah got up early and gathered the city officials and went up to the LORD’s Temple. 21They brought seven bulls, rams, lambs, and male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. He told the priests, descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar. 22They slaughtered the bulls, rams, and lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 23They brought the male goats for the sin offering in the presence of the king and the assembly, and laid their hands on them. 24The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for Israel, because the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.

25Then he stationed the Levites in the LORD’s Temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres like David, Gad the seer, and Nathan the prophet had commanded. The command came from the LORD through his prophets. 26The Levites stood with David’s musical instruments and the priests with their trumpets. 27Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets accompanied by David’s instruments. 28While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang and the trumpets blew till the burnt offering finished. 29Then the king and everybody present with him bowed in worship. 30King Hezekiah and the officials directed the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. They sang praises with joy and bowed in worship. 	2 Ch 29:20-30

31Hezekiah said, “Now that you’ve consecrated yourselves, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the LORD’s Temple.” The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and everybody that wanted to brought burnt offerings. 32The assembly brought 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs as burnt offerings. 33The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 34There weren’t enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them till they finished and more priests had consecrated themselves. The Levites were more conscientious about consecrating themselves than the priests were. 35Besides the large number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings and the liquids for the burnt offerings. In that way, they restored the service in the LORD’s Temple. 36Then Hezekiah and the people celebrated what God had prepared for them, because the thing had come about suddenly.

2 Ch 29:31-36

Hezekiah Celebrates the Passover

30:1Hezekiah wrote letters to everywhere in Israel and Judah, to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the LORD’s Temple in Jerusalem, to keep Passover to the God of Israel. 2The king, his officials, and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided to keep Passover in the second month. 3They couldn’t keep it at its regular time because the priests hadn’t sanctified themselves in sufficient numbers, and the people hadn’t gathered in Jerusalem. 4The plan seemed right to the king and the whole assembly. 5They circulated a proclamation from Dan to Beersheba to come and keep Passover at Jerusalem; they hadn’t kept it in great numbers as written. 6So runners went everywhere in Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials:

“People of Israel, come back to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so he’ll come back to the remnant of you that have escaped from the kings of Assyria. 7Don’t be like your ancestors and fellow Jews that weren’t faithful to him. He made them desolate, as you can see. 8Don’t stiffen your neck like they did. Yield to him and go into the sanctuary he’s consecrated permanently. Serve him so his furious anger will turn away from you. 9If you come back to him, your fellow Jews and descendants will receive mercy from their captors and come back to this land. The LORD is gracious and merciful. He won’t turn away from you if you come back to him.” 	2 Ch 30:1-9

10Runners went from city to city throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun, but the people scorned and mocked them. 11Only a few from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came. 12God’s hand was on Judah to give them a united heart to do what the king and his officials said.

13A really large assembly came together in Jerusalem to keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month. 14They removed the altars in the city, took away the incense altars, and threw them in the Kidron valley. 15They killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day, second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed; so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the LORD’s Temple. 16They took their accustomed stations according to the Law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites 17because many in the assembly hadn’t sanctified themselves. To make the Passover lamb holy to the LORD, the Levites had to kill it for everybody that wasn’t clean. 18A great number of people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, hadn’t purified themselves; yet they ate the Passover other than as prescribed. Hezekiah had prayed for them,

“The good LORD pardon everybody 19that sets his heart to look to you, even though not according to the sanctuary’s rules for cleanness.” 	2 Ch 30:10-19

20The LORD listened to Hezekiah and purified them. 21The people present in Jerusalem kept the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week with great celebration. The Levites and priests praised the LORD daily, singing to him with all their energy. 22Hezekiah encouraged the Levites that showed skill in serving the LORD. The people observed the festival for a week, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD.

23Then the whole assembly agreed to keep the festival for another week with happiness, 24because Hezekiah gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings. The officials gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. The priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. 25The whole assembly celebrated—the ones from Judah, the priests and Levites, the ones that came out of Israel, the temporary residents in Israel and Judah. 26There was great celebrating in Jerusalem; since Solomon’s time, nothing like this had happened there. 27Then the priests and Levites got up and blessed the people, and the LORD heard them. Their prayer went up to the Holy Place where he lives in heaven.	2 Ch 30:20-27

Hezekiah’s Reforms

31:1When that finished, Israel went out and broke down the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, pulled down the high places and altars, and destroyed them everywhere in Judah and Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh. Then they returned to their towns and properties.

2Hezekiah appointed the divisions of priests and Levites, according to each one’s service: for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, give thanks and praise in the camp of the LORD. 3He also appointed the kings’ portion of goods for the burnt offerings—for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the Sabbaths, new moons, and fixed festivals like the Law says. 4He commanded the people in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD. 5As soon as the order spread, the Israelites provided in abundance a tenth of the first part of the harvest of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and produce.  6The ones that lived in the towns in Judah also brought in a tenth of the oxen and sheep, and a tenth of the sacred gifts consecrated to the LORD and placed them in piles. 7In the third month, they began to make the piles and finished them by the seventh. 8When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the piles, they blessed the LORD and his people. 9Hezekiah asked the chief priests and Levites about the piles. 10Azariah, the chief priest from the House of Zadok, said, “Since the contributions started coming to the LORD’s Temple, we’ve had enough to eat with this amount left over. He has blessed his people.”	 2 Ch 31:1-10

11Then Hezekiah told them to prepare rooms in the Temple. 12They faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and consecrated things.

Conaniah the Levite had charge of them; his brother Shimei was second in rank.

13Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under Conaniah and Shimei his brother.

Azariah was the chief officer for God’s Temple.

14Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the eastern gate, oversaw the freewill offerings and apportioned the contributions for the LORD and the most holy things. 	2 Ch 31:11-14

15Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah assisted him in the priestly towns to distribute faithfully the portions to their fellow Jews by divisions, young and old alike. 16Without regard to their genealogical enrollment, they were to do it for males 30 and older for their duties in their divisions—everybody that entered the LORD’s Temple for his daily obligations. 17They were to do it as well to the priests genealogically enrolled by families, and the Levites 20 years and older, according to their duties and divisions. 18The genealogical enrollment included their little children, wives, sons, and daughters for the whole assembly, because they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness. 19For the descendants of Aaron (the priests that were in their towns’ pastures or in each city), there were men designated to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everybody genealogically enrolled among the Levites.

20Hezekiah did that throughout Judah. What he did was good, right, and true in front of the LORD. 21He looked to his God in the service of God’s Temple in law and commandment, and did everything with all his heart and succeeded.   	    2 Ch 31:15:21

Assyria Invades Judah

32:1After those faithful acts, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invaded Judah, laid siege to fortified towns, and intended to break into them. 2When Hezekiah saw he’d come and meant to attack Jerusalem, 3he, his officers, and soldiers decided to cut off the water supply from the springs outside the city. 4Many people came together and stopped up the springs feeding the stream that flowed through the region, “Why should Assyria’s kings come and find abundant water?” 5He took courage and rebuilt the wall that had been torn down, erected towers on it, built an outside wall, strengthened the Millo in The City of David, and made a great number of weapons and shields. 6He appointed military officers over the people, and gathered them in the square at the city gate to encourage them,

7“Be strong and courageous; don’t be afraid or intimidated by Assyria’s king or his army. The One that’s with us is greater than the one that’s with him. 8All he’s got is a physical army, but we have the LORD our God to help us and fight our battles.”

The people trusted what he said.	 2 Ch 32:1-8

Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem

9After that, Sennacherib sent officers to Jerusalem while he was laying siege to Lachish with his forces. He sent them against Hezekiah and all Judah that were in Jerusalem,

10“Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says, ‘What are you trusting in that you stay in Jerusalem under siege? 11Isn’t Hezekiah misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and thirst, and saying the LORD your God will deliver you from the king of Assyria? 12Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and altars, and told Judah and Jerusalem to worship at one altar and burn incense on it? 13Don’t you know what my predecessors and I have done to all the countries? Were their gods able to deliver their land from me? 14Who among them that my predecessors destroyed, could deliver his people from me? 15Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you. No god could deliver his people from me and the kings before me. How much less your God?’” 	2 Ch 32:9-15

16His officers spoke against the LORD God and Hezekiah. 17He wrote letters to insult the LORD God of Israel:

“None of the nations’ gods have delivered their people from me. Hezekiah’s god won’t deliver his people either.”

18They shouted it out in the language of Judah to the people on the wall to terrify them so they could take the city. 19They talked about the God of Jerusalem like the other people’s hand-made gods.

20But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, prayed about that and appealed to Heaven. 21The LORD sent an angel that destroyed every powerful soldier, commander, and officer in the camp. Sennacherib went back to his own land humiliated. When he entered the temple of his god, two of his own sons killed him with a sword. 22The LORD saved Hezekiah, the people in Jerusalem, and the rest and guided them on every side. 23Many people started bringing gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem and special presents to Hezekiah so that all the nations regarded him highly after that.   	2 Ch 32:16-23

Hezekiah’s Sickness and Recovery

24At that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign. 25-26Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem humbled themselves, so the LORD’s wrath didn’t come on them during his lifetime.

27Hezekiah had immense wealth and honor. He made treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles; 28as well as storehouses for grain, wine, and olive oil; pens for all kinds of livestock, and shepherds for the flocks. 29He built towns and acquired flocks and herds in abundance. 30Hezekiah was the one that stopped the upper outlet of Gihon and diverted the water to the west side of The City of David. He succeeded at everything. 31Even in regard to envoys from Babylon who asked about the wonder that had happened, God left him alone to test him, to know what was in his heart.

Summary of Hezekiah’s Reign

32The rest of his acts and deeds of devotion are recorded in The Vision of the Prophet Isaiah Son of Amoz and The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 33He died and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of David’s descendants. The people in Judah and Jerusalem honored him when he died. His son Manasseh became king.    	    2 Ch 32:24-33

Manasseh Rules Judah

33:1Manasseh was 12 and ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem. 2He did evil like the nations the LORD drove out. 3He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had torn down, erected altars for the images of Baal, set up Asherah poles, and worshiped and served the stars in the sky. 4He built altars in the LORD’s Temple where the LORD had said, “I will identify with Jerusalem permanently.” 5He built altars for the host of heaven in the two courts of the LORD’s Temple. 6He burned his sons as an offering in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom. He angered the LORD with lots of sins he did: witchcraft, fortunetelling, sorcery, consulting mediums and spiritists. 7Then he put in God’s Temple the carved image of the idol he’d made about which God had told David and Solomon his son,

“I’ve chosen to identify myself permanently with this Temple and with Jerusalem out of all the tribes in Israel. 8I won’t again remove Israel from the land I’ve appointed for their ancestors, if only they’ll observe everything I’ve commanded them in the Law, statutes, and ordinances I gave through Moses.”

9Manasseh misled Judah and Jerusalem to sin than the nations the LORD originally destroyed in front of the Israelites.	2 Ch 33:1-9

10The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they didn’t pay any attention. 11So he brought the commanders of Assyria’s army against them. They captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon. 12When he was in distress, he appealed to the LORD and humbled himself greatly in the presence of his ancestors’ God. 13When he prayed to him, God was moved by his appeal and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew the LORD was God.

14After that, he built an outer wall for The City of David on the west side of the Gihon in the valley, as far as the entrance to the Fish Gate. It encircled Ophel and was very tall. Then he put army commanders in the fortified towns of Judah. 15He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the LORD’s Temple as well as the altars he’d built earlier on the mountain of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and dumped them outside the city. 16He set up the LORD’s altar and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it. He ordered Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 17The people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to the LORD. 	2 Ch 33:10-17

18The rest of the acts of Manasseh, including his prayer to God and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the LORD’s name, are in The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 19Also recorded in The Chronicles of the Seers are his sin and unfaithfulness, the sites where he built high places, set up Asherah poles and carved images before he humbled himself and appealed to God.  20Manasseh died, and they buried him in his own house. His son Amon became king.

Amon Rules Judah

21Amon was 22 and ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. 22He did evil like Manasseh had done. He sacrificed to the carved images his father had made and served them. 23He didn’t humble himself like his father did, but multiplied his guilt. 24Finally, his own officials murdered him in his own house, 25but the people killed them and made his son Josiah king. 	2 Ch 33:18-25

Josiah Rules Judah

34:1Josiah was 8 and ruled for 31 years in Jerusalem. 2He did what was good and didn’t stray from the ways of David. 3In his eighth year, while he was still young, he began to look to David’s God. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, Asherah poles, and carved and molten images. 4The people tore down the Baal altars and chopped down the incense altars above them. The Asherah poles, carved images, and molten images he broke in pieces, ground into powder, and scattered on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 5He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. 6In the towns and surrounding ruins in Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon as far as Naphtali, 7he destroyed the altars and Asherah poles, beat the carved images into powder, and chopped down the incense altars everywhere in Israel. 	       2 Ch 34:1-7

8In his eighteenth year, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah; Maaseiah. an official of the city; and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the Temple. 9They delivered to Hilkiah the high priest the money that came into God’s Temple that the Levites, the doorkeepers, had collected from Manasseh, Ephraim, the remnant of Israel, Judah and Benjamin, and the people in Jerusalem. 10They gave it to the workmen that oversaw the Temple. 11They in turn gave it to the carpenters and builders to buy quarried stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses the kings of Judah had let fall into ruin. 12The men did the work faithfully under their foremen: Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari; Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites, and the Levites skillful with musical instruments. 13They also supervised the carriers and workmen from job to job. Some Levites were secretaries, officials, and gatekeepers.

2 Ch 34:8-13

The Book of the Law Discovered

14When they were bringing out the money that had come in, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law that Moses gave. 15He told Shaphan the secretary, “I’ve found the Book of the Law in the Temple.” He gave it to him 16to take to the king,

“Your officials are doing everything you entrusted to them. 17They’ve emptied out the money they found in the Temple and delivered it to the foremen and workmen. 18Hilkiah gave me a scroll.”

He read it to the king. 19When the king heard what the Law said, he tore his clothes. 20He told Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king’s aide,

21“Go ask the LORD and the ones left in Israel and Judah about what the scroll says. The LORD has poured out his great anger on us because our ancestors haven’t observed what’s written here.”	2 Ch 34:14-21

22Hilkiah and the others spoke to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tokhath son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe. (She lived in Jerusalem’s Second Quarter.) 23She said,

“The LORD God of Israel says to tell the man that sent you, 24‘I’m bringing disaster on this place and its people, the curses written in the scroll they’ve read to the king. 25They’ve left me and burned incense to other gods to offend me. My anger won’t be quenched.’

26“But tell the king the LORD says, 27‘I’ve heard you because your heart was sensitive. You humbled yourself when you heard what I said against this place and its people. You tore your clothes and cried.  28I’ll gather you to your ancestors in peace so you won’t see the disaster I’m going to bring on this place and its people.’”

They brought the message back to the king.	2 Ch 34:22-28

Josiah’s Reforms

29Then the king gathered the elders in Judah 30and went up to the LORD’s Temple with the people of Judah and Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and the people from least to greatest. He read to them everything in the Book of the Covenant that Hilkiah found. 31He stood in his place to renew the covenant to follow the LORD and keep his commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all his heart and soul—like the covenant said in that scroll. 32He made everybody present in Jerusalem and Benjamin stand with him. The people in Jerusalem obeyed the covenant with their ancestors’ God. 33Josiah removed the detestable things from the territory that belonged to the Israelites and made everybody in Israel serve the LORD their God. They followed him his whole life.	    2 Ch 34:29-33

Josiah Celebrates the Passover

35:1Then Josiah celebrated Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover animals on the fourteenth of the first month. 2He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service for the Temple. 3He told the Levites that taught Israel and were holy to the LORD,

“Put the holy Ark in the Temple Solomon built. It won’t be a burden on your shoulder anymore. Serve the LORD your God and his people Israel. 4Prepare yourselves by divisions within families like David and Solomon wrote. 5Stand in the Holy Place by those divisions of your relatives the lay people. With the Levites make divisions within families. 6Slaughter the Passover animals, sanctify yourselves, and be ready to do for your relatives what the LORD said by Moses.”

2 Ch 35:1-6

7For Passover offerings, Josiah contributed out of his own stock 30,000 lambs and kids for the lay people that were present plus 3,000 bulls. 8His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people, priests, and Levites. For the Passover, Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials of God’s Temple, gave the priests 2,600 from flocks and 300 bulls. 9For the Passover, Conaniah—and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel—and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites 5,000 from the flocks and 500 bulls.

10So the service was ready, and the priests and Levites stood at their stations by their divisions. 11They killed the Passover animals. While the priests sprinkled the blood, the Levites skinned them. 12Then they removed the burnt offerings so they could give them to the divisions of families in the lay people to present to the LORD the way the Book of Moses says. They did the same thing with the bulls. 13They roasted the Passover animals on the fire as required by the Law, boiled the holy things in pots, kettles, and pans; and carried them quickly away to the people. 14Afterward they prepared for themselves and the priests, because the priests, descendants of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and fat till dark. So the Levites prepared for themselves and the priests. 15The singers, descendants of Asaph, were also at their stations like David commanded: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. The gatekeepers didn’t have to step aside from serving at each gate because their relatives, the Levites, prepared for them. 	2 Ch 35:7-15

16So the service of the LORD was ready that day to celebrate Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the LORD’s altar like King Josiah commanded. 17The Israelites that were present celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week. 18Israelites hadn’t celebrated Passover like that since Samuel the prophet. No king in Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, Levites, Judah, and Israel present with the people in Jerusalem. 19They celebrated it in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign. 	2 Ch 35:16-19

Josiah Dies in Battle

20After Josiah had set the Temple in order, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him. 21Neco sent ambassadors to him,

“What do we have to do with each other, King of Judah? I’m not coming against you; I’m fighting another nation, and God has ordered me to hurry. For your own sake, stop interfering with God, who is with me, so he doesn’t destroy you.” 	2 Ch 35:20-21

22But Josiah wouldn’t turn away. He disguised himself and ignored what God said from Neco and went ahead to fight him on the plain of Megiddo. 23The archers shot him, and he told his officers, “Take me away; I’m badly wounded.” 24They took him out of the chariot, put him in a second one he had, and took him to Jerusalem, where he died. They buried him in the tombs of his ancestors. Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. 25Jeremiah chanted a lament for him. The male and female singers still speak about him in The Lamentations. They made them an ordinance in Israel; they’re written in The Lamentations. 26The rest of the deeds and devotions of Josiah are written in The Law of the LORD. 27His acts, first to last, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.	 2 Ch 35:22-27

Jehoahaz Rules Judah

36:1The people took Joahaz son of Josiah and made him king. 2He was 23 and ruled for 3 months in Jerusalem. 3The king of Egypt deposed him and imposed on the land a fine of 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver and 75.5 lbs a talent of gold. 4The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz to Egypt. 5Jehoiakim was 25. He eHeHeruled for 11 years in Jerusalem and did evil. 6Nebuchadnezzar came up against him, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon. 7He took some articles from the Temple to Babylon and put them in his temple. 8The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, his disgusting deeds, and the charges against him are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiachin became king.	2 Ch 36:1-8

Jehoiachin Rules Judah

9Jehoiachin was 8 and ruled for 3 months and 10 days in Jerusalem. He did evil. 10At the beginning of the new year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and took him to Babylon with the valuable articles from the Temple. He made his relative Zedekiah king of Judah and Jerusalem.

Zedekiah Rules Judah

11Zedekiah was 21 and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. 12He did evil and didn’t humble himself toward Jeremiah the LORD’s prophet. 13He also revolted against Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel. 14In addition, the officials of the priests and the people were unfaithful and followed the detestable things of the nations. They defiled the LORD’s Temple that he’d sanctified in Jerusalem.

15The LORD God of their ancestors sent word to them repeatedly by his messengers, because he had mercy on them and the place where he lived. 16But they despised his messages and scoffed at his prophets till his wrath rose up against them without remedy. 	2 Ch 36:9-16

The Fall of Jerusalem

17So he brought up the king of the Babylonians against them. He killed their young men with the sword in their sanctuary. He didn’t show mercy to young man or virgin, old man or infirm. The LORD delivered them all to him. 18He took to Babylon the articles from the Temple, large and small, the treasures in the Temple, and the treasures the king and his officers had. 19Then they burned God’s Temple, tore down the wall around Jerusalem, burned its fortified buildings, and destroyed its valuable articles. 20The ones that escaped the sword he took as servants to himself and his sons till the kingdom of Persia. 21That fulfilled Jeremiah’s message that the land would keep sabbath for 70 years, the days of its desolation.   	2 Ch 36:17-21

Cyrus Lets the Exiles Return

22In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in fulfillment of the LORD’s message through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up Cyrus. He sent a written proclamation everywhere in his kingdom:

23“Cyrus, king of Persia, says, ‘The LORD God of heaven has given me the kingdoms of the world and has appointed me to build him a temple in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you from his people, the LORD your God be with you! Go up!’” 	2 Ch 36:22-23

EZRA

Cyrus Lets the Exiles Return

1:1In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfill his message through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up Cyrus. He sent a written proclamation everywhere in his kingdom:

2“Cyrus, king of Persia, says, ‘The LORD God of heaven has given me the kingdoms of the world and appointed me to build him a temple in Jerusalem, in Judah. 3Whoever is from his people, your God be with you! Go up and rebuild the Temple of the LORD God of Israel, the God in Jerusalem. 4Wherever there’s a survivor, support him with silver and gold, supplies and livestock, plus freewill offerings.’” 	       Ezra 1:1-4

5God stirred up the leaders of the tribes from Judah and Benjamin along with the priests and Levites to go to Jerusalem to rebuild his Temple. 6Their neighbors encouraged them with silver and gold items, with goods, livestock, and valuables, plus freewill offerings. 7Cyrus brought out the items from the LORD’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had carried to the temple of his gods. 8He had Mithredath the treasurer bring them out and count them out to Sheshbazzar, ruler of Judah: 930 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins, 29 censers, 1030 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls, 1,000 other articles—115,400 gold and silver items in all. Sheshbazzar took them up with the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.        	  Ezra 1:5-11

58All the Temple servants and descendants of Solomon’s servants 		     392

59The following went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but couldn’t provide evidence that their families and their descendants were from Israel. This group included 60descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 	      652.

61descendants of the priests: descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (This Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and took Barzillai’s name.)

62They searched among their genealogical records, but they couldn’t locate them. They were considered unqualified for the priesthood. 63The governor said they shouldn’t eat the most holy things till a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.

64The whole assembly numbered 		42,360

65plus their male and female servants 		7,337

and men and women singers. 	200

66They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 67435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.

68When some heads of families arrived at the LORD’s Temple in Jerusalem, they offered willingly for restoring God’s Temple on its foundation. 69According to their ability they gave to the treasury 1100 lbs 61,000 drachmas of gold, 6250 lbs 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly vestments.

70The priests and Levites, some of the people, singers, gatekeepers, Temple servants, and all Israel lived in their towns.	  Ezra 2:1-70

The Altar Is Rebuilt

3:1When the seventh month came and the Israelites were in the towns, they came together in Jerusalem. 2Jeshua son of Jozadak, his brothers the priests, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and his brothers built God’s altar for offering burnt offerings as written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 3They set up the altar on its original site despite their fear of the people around them. They offered burnt offerings to the LORD morning and evening. 4They celebrated the Festival of Booths as written and offered the set number of burnt offerings daily as required by the Law. 5From then on, there was continual burnt offering for new moons and the annual festivals the LORD had consecrated. Everyone offered a freewill offering to the LORD. 6From the first day, seventh month, they offered burnt offerings, but the foundation of the Temple hadn’t been laid. 7Then they donated money to the masons and carpenters as well as food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians to bring cedar from Lebanon by sea to Joppa with permission from Cyrus.     	  Ezra 3:1-7

8The second month, second year after arriving at God’s Temple, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, the rest of the priests and Levites, and everybody from the captivity began the work. They appointed the Levites 20 years and older as supervisors. 9To oversee the workmen, Jeshua with his sons and relatives stood united with Kadmiel and his sons (all descendants of Judah/Hodaviah) and with the Levites from the family of Henadad. 10When the builders had laid the foundation, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets. The Levites, descendants of Asaph, stood with cymbals to praise the LORD according to King David’s directions. 11They sang, praising and thanking the LORD, “He’s good; his love for Israel endures forever.” The people shouted when they praised him because the foundation had been laid. 12Yet many priests, Levites, and heads of families—old men who’d seen the first Temple—cried out loud. Many others shouted out loud with so much joy 13that people couldn’t tell the shout of joy from the outcry of weeping. They could be heard for a long way.	  Ezra 3:8-13

Enemies Oppose the Rebuilding

4:1When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a temple to the LORD God of Israel, 2they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders, “Let us build with you. We worship your God too. We’ve been sacrificing to him since Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, sent us here.” 3But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders said, “You don’t have anything in common with us building a temple to our God. We’ll build it like King Cyrus decreed.”

4Other residents in the land tried to discourage the people and scare them away from building. 5They bribed advisors to work against them all during Cyrus’ reign till the reign of Darius, king of Persia.         	  Ezra 4:1-5

Later Opposition Under Xerxes and Artaxerxes

6Years later, at the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus/Xerxes, they lodged a complaint against Judah and Jerusalem.

7Still later, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote to Artaxerxes. The letter was in Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language for the king. 8Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote out the letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes—9they and their associates on behalf of the judges and local leaders, officials, and secretaries over the people of Erech, Babylonia, and Susa (Elam), 10and the rest of the nations that the great and honorable Osnappar/Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River [Avar-naharah, Aramaic]. 11Here’s a copy of the letter:

Ezra 4:6-11a

“To King Artaxerxes

From your subjects in Beyond the River

12The Jews that came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They’re rebuilding the rebellious, evil city, finishing its walls and repairing its foundation. 13If it’s rebuilt and its walls are finished, they won’t pay tribute, custom, or toll, and it’ll damage the king’s revenue. 14Because we serve the palace, it’s not fitting for us to see your dishonor. We’ve sent to inform you 15so a search can be made in your ancestors’ records. You’ll discover that the city has been rebellious and damaging to kings and provinces, that they’ve incited revolt in the past, and that’s why it was destroyed. 16If it’s rebuilt and its walls finished, you won’t have any possession in Beyond the River.”   	        Ezra 4:11b-16

17The king answered Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates in Samaria and the rest of Beyond the River:

“Greetings,

18The document you sent us has been translated and read to me. 19I’ve issued a decree. A search has been made, and it’s been discovered that the city has rebelled against kings in the past, that revolution and sedition have occurred in it; 20that strong kings have ruled Jerusalem, governing the whole province Beyond the River; and that they received tribute, custom, and toll. 21So issue a decree to stop those men from rebuilding the city till I issue a decree. 22Take care of this matter promptly. We must not let this situation harm the royal interests

23As soon as Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates read a copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter, they hurried to Jerusalem and stopped the Jews by force. 24The work on the Temple halted till the second year of Darius, king of Persia.	  Ezra 4:17-24

Tattenai’s Letter to Darius

5:1The prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo served as prophets to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. 2Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua started again to rebuild God’s Temple. His prophets supported them. 3At that time, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues came and asked, “Who issued a decree for you to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?” 4We told them the names of the men that were reconstructing it. 5But God kept an eye on the elders of the Jews. They didn’t stop them till a report could go to Darius and a written reply could come back.

Ezra 5:1-6

6Here’s a copy of Tattenai’s letter to King Darius:

7“To King Darius, all peace.

8We have gone to the province Judah, to the Temple of the great God, which is being built with huge stones and with beams that are being laid in the walls. This work is progressing with great care and is getting done. 9We asked those elders who issued them a decree to rebuild that Temple. 10We asked for their names so we could write down who was in charge and inform you.

11“They answered, ‘We serve the God of earth and sky. We’re rebuilding the Temple that was built many years ago by a great king in Israel. 12But because our ancestors provoked the God of earth and sky, he delivered them to Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian. He destroyed that Temple and deported the people to Babylon. 13But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this Temple. 14He also took out the gold and silver utensils from God’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had taken to the temple in Babylon. He gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, who’d been appointed governor. 15He told him to take those items and deposit them in the Temple in Jerusalem and let God’s Temple be rebuilt on its site. 16Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations. From then till now, it’s been under construction and isn’t finished.’

17“If it pleases you, conduct a search in the royal treasure house there in Babylon to see if King Cyrus did issue a decree to rebuild that Temple, and send us your decision on the matter.”		  Ezra 5:7-17

Darius’ Decree

6:1King Darius issued an order to search the Babylonian archives, which were housed in the treasury. 2But in the fortress in Ecbatana, in the province of Media, they found a scroll with the following written in it:

“Record:

3In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree:

‘As to God’s Temple in Jerusalem, rebuild it, where sacrifices are offered. Keep its foundations the same. Its height and width are 90ft 4with three courses of large stones alternating with one course of timbers. Pay for it out of the royal treasury. 5Take back to God’s Temple the gold and silver articles Nebuchadnezzar took from it.’			         Ezra 6:1-5

6“Now then, Tattenai, governor of Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, officials in the provinces Beyond the River, don’t interfere. 7Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild God’s Temple on its site. 8And, I decree what you’re to do for those elders in rebuilding this Temple: without delay pay them the full cost out of the royal treasury from taxes in the provinces Beyond the River. 9As the priests in Jerusalem request, give daily whatever they need: young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings, wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil. 10Then they can offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 11For anybody who violates this edict, I decree that a timber be pulled out of his house, he be impaled on it, and his house be made a garbage pile. 12May the God that has put his name there overthrow any king or people that tries to violate this decree and destroy that Temple of God. I, Darius, have made this decree. Carry it out diligently.”	  Ezra 6:6-12

Completion and Dedication of the Temple

13Tattenai, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates carried out the decree diligently. 14The elders of the Jews succeeded in the construction by the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah. By God’s command and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, 15they completed it the third day, the month Adar, sixth year of King Darius.

16Israel, the priests, Levites, and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of God’s Temple. 17They offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for Israel 12 male goats corresponding to the 12 tribes in Israel. 18Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God as written in the Book of Moses.

Passover Celebrated

19The exiles observed Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. 20The priests and Levites had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 21The Israelites from the exile and the ones that had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations in the land, joined them in reaching out to the LORD God of Israel by eating the Passover. 22They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for a week with joy because the LORD had given them reason to celebrate. He had inclined the heart of the Assyrian king to encourage them in the work on his Temple.	     Ezra 6:13-22

Ezra Arrives in Jerusalem

7:1After that, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, came Ezra son of Seraiah (son of Azariah son of Hilkiah 2son of Shallum son of Zadok son of Ahitub 3son of Amariah son of Azariah son of Meraioth 4son of Zerahiah son of Uzzi son of Bukki 5son of Abishua son of Phinehas son of Eleazar) son of Aaron the chief priest. 6Ezra, a scribe, an expert in the Law of Moses, came up from Babylon. The king granted him everything he requested because the LORD’s hand was on him. 7Some Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. [8] 9On the first day, first month, Ezra started out from Babylon. On the first day, fifth month he arrived at Jerusalem because God’s good hand was on him. 10He had set his heart on studying the Law of the LORD, practicing it, and teaching its statutes and ordinances in Israel.		  Ezra 7:1-10

11 The Decree King Artaxerxes Gave Ezra the Priest and Scribe,

One Learned in the LORD’s Commandments

12“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra, priest and scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, greeting.

13“I’ve decreed that any of the Israelites, their priests, and Levites in my kingdom that want to go to Jerusalem, can go with you. 14The king and his seven advisors have sent you to ask about Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God that you have with you. 15They’ve sent you as well to take the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel, who lives in Jerusalem. 16That’s accompanied by all the silver and gold you’ll find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering by the people and priests that donated for their God’s Temple in Jerusalem. 17With this money diligently buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and liquid offerings, and offer them on the altar in the Temple of your God. 18Whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you can do according to the will of your God. 19To the God in Jerusalem deliver in full the utensils you’ve received for the service of your God’s Temple. 20The rest of the needs for his Temple that you have occasion to provide for, do so from the royal treasury.    		    Ezra 7:11-20

21“I, King Artaxerxes, decree to the treasurers in Beyond the River, that you provide diligently whatever Ezra requires from you, 22up to 7550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 1100 bushels 100 kors of wheat, 900 gallons 100 baths of wine, 900 gallons 100 baths of olive oil, and salt as needed. 23Whatever the God of heaven commands, do with zeal for his Temple so there won’t be any anger against the realm of the king and his sons. 24We also inform you not to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, or workmen in that Temple of God. 25And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that’s available to you, appoint magistrates and judges in Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. You can teach anybody that doesn’t know them. 26On whoever doesn’t observe the Law of your God and the law of the king, carry out judgment strictly, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of possessions, or imprisonment.”

Ezra Praises the LORD

27Bless the LORD God of our ancestors, who has put such a thing in the king’s heart, to adorn the LORD’s Temple in Jerusalem. 28He has extended enduring love to me in the presence of the king, his advisors, and powerful officials. In that way the LORD gave me courage, and I assembled leading men from Israel to go up with me.		  Ezra 7:21-28

Ezra Journey to Jerusalem

15I assembled them at the canal that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. When I looked over the people and the priests, I didn’t find any Levites. 16So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam (leaders), and for Joiarib and Elnathan (teachers). 17I sent them to Iddo, leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to tell him and his brothers (the Temple servants at that place) to bring ministers to us for God’s Temple. 18By God’s good hand on us, they brought

Sherebiah (an insightful son of Mahli, descendant of Levi) as well as his sons and brothers, 18 men;

19Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men;

20220 Temple servants that David and the officials had given to assist the Levites—all identified by name.

21Then I declared a fast at the Ahava Canal, to humble ourselves toward God and look to him for a safe journey for us, our little ones, and our possessions. 22I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and cavalry to protect us, because we’d told him, “God favors those who look to him. His power and anger oppose those who leave him.” 23We fasted and looked to God on the matter, and he listened to our plea. 		   Ezra 8:15-23

24Then I set apart 12 leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 others. 25I weighed out to them the silver and gold, the utensils, and the offering for God’s Temple that the king, his advisors, officials, and all Israel present there had offered: 2624½ tons 650 talents of silver, utensils worth 7,550 lbs 100 talents of silver, 7,550 lbs 100 talents of gold, 2720 bowls worth 19 lbs 1,000 darics of gold; and 2 utensils of fine, shiny bronze, precious as gold. 28Then I said,

“You’re holy to the LORD; the utensils are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your ancestors. 29Keep them till you weigh them in the presence of the leading priests, Levites, and heads of families at Jerusalem, in the rooms in the LORD’s Temple.”

30The priests and Levites received the silver, gold, and utensils, to take to Jerusalem.

31Then we left the Ahava River on the twelfth day, first month to go to Jerusalem. God watched over us and delivered us from enemies and ambushes along the way. 32We arrived at Jerusalem and rested three days. 33On the fourth day, we weighed out in God’s Temple the silver, gold, and utensils to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, Eleazar son of Phinehas, and the Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34We numbered and weighed everything, and recorded the total.

35The exiles offered burnt offerings to God: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering. 36Then they delivered the king’s edicts to his satraps and governors of Beyond the River [Ever-hannahar, Hebrew], and they supported the people and God’s Temple.         		   Ezra 8:24-36

Ezra’s Prayer About Intermarriage

9:1When these things had been completed, the officials approached me,

“The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites haven’t separated from the foreigners and the disgusting things of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 2They’ve taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons. The holy race has intermingled with foreigners. The officials and rulers have been the most prominent in this unfaithfulness.”

3When I heard that, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled some hair from my head and beard, and sat down appalled. 4Everybody gathered around me that trembled at God’s message about the exiles’ unfaithfulness. I sat appalled till the evening offering. 	  Ezra 9:1-4

5Then I got up from my humbled condition with my cloak and shirt torn. I fell on my knees and held out my hands to the LORD:

6“I’m ashamed to look at you. Our sins have piled up higher than our heads. Our guilt has grown as high as the sky. 7Since the time of our ancestors, we’ve had serious guilt. Because of our sins, you’ve delivered us, our kings, and our priests to the kings of nations, to the sword, to captivity, plunder, and open disgrace like today. 8But now for a little while, you’ve shown grace and left us a remnant and given us a stake in your holy place to enlighten us and grant us a little reviving in our bondage. 9We’re slaves; yet in our bondage, you haven’t left us. You’ve extended enduring love to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, to revive us for building your Temple, restoring its ruins, and giving us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem. 10What can we say now, God? We’ve abandoned what you’ve commanded 11through your prophets, ‘The land you’re going in to possess is ceremonially unclean because of its unclean people and disgusting things that fill it end to end. 12Don’t intermarry with them. Never search for their peace or prosperity so you can be strong, eat the good things of the land, and leave it as a permanent inheritance to your descendants.’ 13After everything that’s happened to us because of our sinful deeds and great guilt—you’ve paid us back less than our sins deserve and have given us a remnant like this—14will we again break your commandments and intermarry with people that commit those disgusting things? Wouldn’t you be angry with us to the point of destroying us till there was no remnant to escape? 15LORD God of Israel, you’re good, because you left us a remnant. We’re guilty in your presence because nobody can withstand you on that account.”                   	       	  Ezra 9:5-15

The People Confess Their Sins

10:1While Ezra was praying and confessing, crying and prostrating himself in front of God’s Temple, a big crowd of men, women, and children gathered around him, sobbing with him. 2Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of Elam’s sons, told him,

“We’ve been unfaithful to our God and married foreign women from the land. But there’s still hope for Israel. 3Let’s make a covenant with God to put away the wives and their children as you’ve advised and do it according to the Law. 4Get up! This is your responsibility. We’ll be with you. Have the courage to do it.”

5Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel swear that they’d adopt that proposal. They took the oath. 6Then he went from in front of God’s Temple to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He didn’t eat or drink; he was mourning over the exiles’ unfaithfulness. 7They issued a proclamation for the exiles throughout Judah and Jerusalem to assemble at Jerusalem. 8Whoever wouldn’t come within three days like the leaders and elders said, would forfeit his possessions and be excluded from the community of exiles.	 Ezra 10:1-8

9The men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in the three days. It was the twentieth day, ninth month, and the people sat down in the open square in front of God’s Temple. They were shivering because of this matter and the heavy rain. 10Ezra stood up and said,

“You’ve been unfaithful in marrying foreign wives and adding to Israel’s guilt. 11Confess to the LORD God of your ancestors, do his will, and separate from the native people and your foreign wives.”

12The whole assembly answered out loud,

“That’s true! We have to do that. 13But there are lots of people here, it’s raining, and we can’t stand outside. We can’t take care of this problem in a day or two; a lot of us have sinned in this. 14Have leaders represent the assembly and have the ones in our towns that have foreign wives meet at scheduled times with the elders and judges in each city till God’s fierce anger turns away.”

15Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed it. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported it.		  Ezra 10:9-15

Men Guilty of Intermarriage

16The exiles agreed. Ezra selected leaders of each family by name. They met ton first day, tenth month, to look into the matter. 17By the first day, first month, they’d finished dealing with the men that had married foreign wives.

18Among the priests with foreign wives were the following:

from the family of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jerib, and

Gedaliah. 19They pledged to divorce their wives and offer a ram for their guilt.

20from the family of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;

21from the family of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;

22from the family of Pashur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

23among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

24among the singers: Eliashib;

among the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri;		  Ezra 10:16-24

25among the Israelites:

NEHEMIAH

1;1The Memoirs of Nehemiah Son of Hacaliah

Report from Jerusalem

In the month Chislev, the twentieth year, I was in Susa, the capital. 2Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men came from Judah. I asked them about the Jews that had survived the captivity and about Jerusalem. 3They told me, “The remnant in the province is in dire straits and dishonor. The wall around Jerusalem has been torn down and its gates burned.”

Nehemiah’s Prayer

4When I heard it, I sat down and cried and mourned for days. I fasted and prayed,

5“LORD God of heaven, great awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love for those who love you and keep your commandments, 6let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to my praying day and night for the Israelites your servants, and for confessing our sins against you. Even I and my father’s family have sinned. 7We’ve acted corruptly and not kept the commandments, statutes, or ordinances you gave Moses. 8Remember your promise to him, ‘If you’re not faithful, I’ll scatter you among the nations. 9But if you come back to me and keep my commandments—though scattered beyond the horizons—I’ll gather you up and bring you to the place where I’ve put my name.’ 10They’re the people you’ve redeemed by your power and strength. 11Please listen to my prayer and the prayer of your servants who delight in honoring you. Make me successful today; grant me mercy from this man.”

I was the king’s cupbearer.		   Neh 1:1-11

Nehemiah Sent to Jerusalem

2:1In the month Nisan, twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, wine was present, and I took it up to him. I hadn’t been sad in his presence before. 2So he asked me, “Why do you look sad, but you’re not sick? This is nothing but sadness in you.”

I was apprehensive. 3“Long live the King! Why wouldn’t I look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates are burned?”

4“What would you ask?”

I prayed to the God of heaven 5and told the king, “If it pleases you, if I am pleasing to you, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ tombs so I can rebuild it.”

6(The queen was sitting beside him.) He asked me, “How long will it take? When will you be back?”

I set a time, and he agreed to send me.

7“If it pleases you, give me letters to the governors of Beyond the River to let me travel through to Judah. 8Also, give me a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress that’s by the Temple, for the city wall and a house for myself.”

He granted them because my God’s good hand was on me.	 Neh 2:1-8

Nehemiah Inspects the Walls of Jerusalem

9I delivered the king’s letters to the governors of Beyond the River. He’d sent officers of the army and cavalry for my protection. 10When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, they didn’t like it that someone had come to help the Israelites.

11I arrived at Jerusalem and was there three days. 12Then I and a few men got up during the night without telling anybody what God had put in my mind to do for Jerusalem. The only animal with us was the one I was riding. 13I went out by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls that were torn down and the gates that were burned up. 14I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there wasn’t any way for the animal I was riding to get past. 15I went up the valley and inspected the wall. Then I went in the Valley Gate again and came back. 16The officials didn’t know where I’d gone or what I’d done. I hadn’t told the Jews, the priests, nobles, officials, or anyone that would be doing the work.

17Then I told them, “You can see the bad situation we’re in. Jerusalem lies in ruins; its gates are burned. Let’s rebuild the wall so we can put an end to this disgrace.” 18I told them how God had helped me, and what the king had told me. They said, “Let’s build”; so they started on the good work. 19But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and despised us, “What are you doing? Revolting against the king?” 20I answered them, “The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will do the building; you don’t have any part, any legal or historical claim in Jerusalem.”     	   Neh 2:9-20

Opposition to the Work

4:1When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and ridiculed the Jews. 2In front of his relatives and wealthy men in Samaria, he asked,

“What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can they remake something out of the charred stones from dusty rubble?”

3Tobiah the Ammonite was close by and said, “Even a fox could jump on that stone wall they’re building and break it down!”

4“Listen how they despise us, God! Turn their mockery back on their heads and give them up for plunder in a land that takes them captive. 5Don’t forgive them; don’t blot out their sin. They’ve tried to demoralize the builders.”

6We were able to join the whole wall together to half its original height because the people were willing to work. 		  Neh 4:1-6

7Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that repairing the walls was continuing and that we were closing up the breaks in it. They were really mad. 8They conspired to fight Jerusalem and create confusion in it, 9but we prayed to God and set up a guard day and night. 10The people from Judah were saying, “The laborers were getting worn out, but there’s still a lot of rubble to move. We can’t rebuild the wall ourselves.”

11Our enemies said, “They won’t know it till we attack them, kill them, and stop the work.” 12When the Jews that lived close to them came and told us ten times, “They’ll come up against us from every direction,” 13I stationed men behind the wall in the lowest parts, the exposed places. I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows. 14When I saw how afraid they were, I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “You don’t have to be afraid of them. Remember our great awesome Lord. Fight for your brothers, your children, your wives and houses.”		 Neh 4:7-14

15When our enemies heard that we knew about their plans and that God had frustrated it, each of us went back to work on the wall. 16From then on, half of my men worked while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the people of Judah. 17The ones that were rebuilding the wall and carrying burdens did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other. 18Each one attached his sword to his side as he built while the bugler stood close to me. 19I told the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,

“The work is important and extensive, and we’re a long way apart on the wall. 20Wherever you hear the bugle, rally there. Our God will fight for us.”

21We carried out the work with half of them holding spears from dawn till the stars came out. 22I told the people then, “Each man and his servant, spend the night inside Jerusalem so you can be guards at night and workmen during the day.” 23I, my brothers, servants, and guards didn’t change clothes. Everybody kept a weapon on them.      		 Neh 4:15-23

Nehemiah Stops the Oppression of the Poor

5:1There was a loud outcry by husbands and wives against their fellow Jews. 2Some were saying, “There are a lot of us along with our sons and daughters. We need more food to survive.” 3Others said, “We’re mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and houses for grain because of the famine.” 4Yet others were saying,

“We’ve borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. 5Our flesh is like our brothers’ flesh, our children like their children; yet we’re forcing our children to be slaves. Some of our daughters have already been forced into slavery. We’re helpless because we’ve mortgaged our fields and vineyards to other people.”

6I was irate when I heard their outcries. 7I thought it over and contended with the nobles and rulers, “You’re charging your fellow Jews interest?!” I convened a large assembly against them 8and said, “As far as we were able, we’ve redeemed our Jewish brothers that were sold to Gentiles. Would you even sell your fellow Jews so they can be sold to us?”

They couldn’t think of anything to say. 		           Neh 5:1-8

9Again I said,

“What you’re doing is not right. Shouldn’t you fear God over the mockery by other nations, our enemies? 10I, my brothers, and servants are also lending them money and grain. Quit charging interest! 11Right now, give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves, houses, the hundredth part of the money and grain, new wine, and olive oil that you’ve been taxing them.”

12They said they’d do it. I called the priests and made them swear to it. 13I shook out the front of my garment, “May God shake out every man’s house and possessions who doesn’t fulfill that oath. May he shake him out this way and empty him.”

The assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the LORD.

The offenders did what they vowed.		   Neh 5:9-13

Nehemiah’s Generosity

14From the day the king appointed me governor of Judah, my kinsmen and I had never eaten the governor’s food allowance—from the twentieth to thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes (12 years). 15The former governors had laid burdens on the people and took bread and wine from them besides 1 lb 40 shekels of silver. Even their assistants lorded it over the people. I didn’t do that because I respected God. 16I applied myself to the work on the wall. We didn’t buy any land; my servants gathered there to work. 17There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides those who came from nations around. 18I had an ox and six choice sheep prepared each day as well as birds; every ten days I provided wine in abundance. But I still didn’t demand the governor’s food allowance; the people were in heavy servitude. 19God, remember me for the good I’ve done for them.	      	  Neh 5:14-19

Conspiracy Against Nehemiah

6:1Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out I’d rebuilt the wall so there wasn’t any break in it—although I hadn’t set up the doors in the gates yet. 2Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, “Meet us at Chephirim in the Plain of Ono.” They were planning to harm me. 3I sent messengers, “I’m in an extensive project. Why should the work stop while I’m with you?” 4They sent me four messages like that; I answered them the same way. 5Then Sanballat sent his servant a fifth time with an open letter in hand. 6He’d written,

“It’s reported among the countries—and Gashmu tells me it’s true—that you and the Jews plan to revolt; that’s why you’re rebuilding the wall. Those reports say you’ll be their king. 7You’ve also appointed prophets to make a declaration in Jerusalem about you, ‘There’s a king in Judah!’ Those reports will be passed on to the king. Come; let’s talk about it.” 	     	    Neh 6:1-7

8I sent him a message, “We haven’t done things like what you’re saying. You’ve made them up.” 9They were trying to scare us so we’d get discouraged and quit. But now, God, give me courage.

10When I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let’s meet in God’s Temple and close the doors; they’re going to come during the night to kill you.” 11I said, “Should a man like me run to the Temple to save my life? I won’t do that.” 12I sensed that God hadn’t sent him. He gave me that warning because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him 13to scare me so I’d act accordingly and sin. They’d have a bad report to accuse me of. 14God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they’ve done, as well as Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets that were trying to scare me.      Neh 6:8-14

15The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul (in 52 days). 16When our enemies heard it and the nations around us saw it, they lost their confidence. They recognized that our God had helped accomplish the work. 17During that time lots of letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles in Judah. 18Many in Judah were bound to him under oath because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 19In addition, they kept telling me about the good things he’s done and reporting to him how I responded. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me. 		   Neh 6:15-19

The Walls Are Finished

7:1The wall had been rebuilt, and I’d set up the doors and appointed gatekeepers, singers, and Levites. 2I put Hanani my brother—along with Hananiah commander of the fortress—in charge of Jerusalem because he was a reliable man that respected God more than most. 3I told them,

“Don’t open the gates till the sun is hot. While they’re standing guard, shut and bolt the doors. Appoint guards from the people that live inside Jerusalem, each at his post by his own house.”

4The city was big and open, but there weren’t many people in it, and houses hadn’t been built.

5Then God put it in my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. I found the scroll with the genealogies for the ones that came up first; it read as follows:			  Neh 7:1-5

Lists of Returning Exiles

57the sons of Solomon’s servants: the descendants of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 58Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, 59Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth-hazzebaim, and Amon. 60All the Temple servants and sons of Solomon’s servants numbered 		392.		  Neh 7:40-60

61These were the ones that came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but couldn’t show that their ancestors’ houses or their descendants were from Israel: 62the sons of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 	642.

63from the priests: the families of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, Barzillai. (This Barzillai had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gileadite and took his name.) 64They searched the genealogical records but couldn’t find their names. So they were considered unqualified and excluded from the priesthood. 65The governor told them not to eat the priests’ portion of the sacrifices till a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.

Totals of People and Gifts

66The whole assembly numbered 	42,360,

67plus the male and female servants   (7,337)

and male and female singers 	   (245).

68They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 69435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.

70The governor donated to the treasury 19 lbs 1,000 drachmas of gold, 50 basins, and 530 priests’ vestments.

71For the work, some leaders of families donated to the treasury 375 lbs 20,000 darics of gold and 2,750 lbs 2,200 minas of silver.

72The rest of the people gave 375 lbs 20,000 drachmas of gold, 2,500 lbs 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests’ vestments.

73The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some of the people, the Temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.

By the seventh month, the Israelites were in their towns. 	Neh 7:61-73

Ezra Reads the Law

8:1The people congregated in the square by the Water Gate, and asked Ezra to bring The Book of the Law of Moses the LORD had given Israel. 2On the first day, seventh month, he brought it to the assembly of men and women—anybody that could understand. 3He read from early morning till noon, and the people listened. 4He stood on a wooden podium built for that purpose. Beside him stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left; and Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. 5He unrolled the scroll where everybody could see it, because he was standing above them. When he unrolled it, they stood up. 6He blessed the LORD the great God, and the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” and raised their hands. Then they bowed low in worship with their faces toward the ground. 7Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites explained the Law while they stood in their places. 8As they read the Law, they translated it so the people could understand it. 		Neh 8:1-8

A Holy Day Declared

9Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said, “Today is set aside to the LORD your God. Don’t mourn or cry.” (The people had been crying when they heard what the Law said.) 10He told them,

“Go eat the tasty food, drink the sweet things, and share with anyone that doesn’t have anything fixed. Don’t grieve; the joy of the LORD makes you strong.”

11The Levites calmed the people, 12and they went away to eat, drink, share, and celebrate a great feast because they understood what had been explained to them.	Neh 8:9-12

Festival of Booths Celebrated

13The next day the heads of families, the priests, and the Levites gathered to Ezra to gain greater insight into the Law. 14They found how the LORD had commanded the Israelites to camp in booths during the festival of the seventh month. 15So they circulated a proclamation in their towns and in Jerusalem, “Go out to the hills, get olive branches, wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches from leafy trees to make booths, like it’s written.” 16So the people went out and brought them in to make booths on their roofs, in their courts, in the courts of God’s Temple, in the square by the Water Gate and the square by the Ephraim Gate. 17The whole assembly that had come back from the captivity made booths and camped in them. Israelites hadn’t done that since Joshua’s time. There was a lot of celebrating. 18Ezra read from God’s Law every day first to last. They celebrated the festival for a week, and on the eighth day held a solemn assembly as required by the Law. 		Neh 8:13-18

The People Confess Their Sin

9:1On the twenty-fourth of that month, the Israelites gathered with fasting in burlap and doused with dust. 2They separated from foreigners and confessed their and their ancestors’ sins. 3While they stood in their place, they read from the Law for a fourth of the day. For another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. 4On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and appealed to the LORD their God.		Neh 9:1-4

5Then the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said,

“Bless the LORD your God forever!

“May your glorious name be blessed

and regarded above all blessing and praise!

6You alone are the LORD.

You made earth and sky,

the highest heavens with all their host,

the earth and everything on it,

the oceans and what’s in them.

The heavenly host bows to you.

7You’re the LORD God

who chose Abram

and brought him from Ur of the Chaldees,

and named him Abraham.

8You found him faithful

and made a covenant with him

to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites,

Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites.

You fulfilled your promise

because you’re good.	Neh 9:5-8

9“You saw our ancestors’ suffering in Egypt

and heard their outcry by the Red Sea.

10You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,

his officials, and his people.

You knew they acted arrogantly toward them

and made a name for yourself till now.

11You separated the sea

so they went through it on dry seabed;

but you threw their pursuers into the depths

like stones into raging water.

12You led them during the day with a pillar of cloud

and at night with a pillar of fire to light the way.			Neh 9:9-12

13Then you came down on Mount Sinai

and spoke to them from heaven;

you gave them just ordinances and true laws,

good statutes and commandments.

14You told them about your holy Sabbath

and laid down commandments, statutes, and law

through your servant Moses.

15You gave them bread from the sky for their hunger

and brought water out of rock for their thirst.

You told them to go in and take possession of

the land you swore to give them.		Neh 9:13-15

16“But our ancestors acted arrogantly;

they became stubborn

and ignored your commandments.

17They didn’t remember the awesome deeds

you did among them.

They became stubborn and appointed a leader

to take them back to slavery in Egypt.

But you’re a forgiving God,

gracious and merciful,

slow to get angry and full of enduring love:

you didn’t abandon them.

18Even when they made a calf out of molten metal

and said, ‘This is your God

that brought you up from Egypt,’

and committed extreme blasphemies,

19in your great mercy

you didn’t abandon them in the desert.

The pillar of cloud didn’t leave them during the day

to guide them on their way;

the pillar of fire didn’t leave them at night

to light the way.		Neh 9:16-19

20You gave them your good Spirit to teach them;

you didn’t withhold your manna from them;

you gave them water for their thirst.

21For 40 years you provided for them in the desert,

and they had what they needed.

Their clothes didn’t wear out,

and their feet didn’t swell.

22You delivered kingdoms and nations to them

and allotted every corner to them.

They took the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon,

and the land of Og, king of Bashan.

23You made their descendants as numerous as the stars

and took them into the land

you told their ancestors to possess.

24So their descendants went in and took possession of it;

you subdued its people, the Canaanites;

you delivered them to your people along with their kings

to do with them whatever they wanted.

25They captured fortified towns and a fertile land;

they took possession of houses full of every good thing:

hewn cisterns, vineyards,

olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance.

They ate their fill, got fat,

and reveled in your great goodness.			Neh 9:20-25

26“But they became disobedient,

rebelled against you,

tossed your Law aside,

and killed the prophets that admonished them

to come back to you;

they committed great blasphemies.

27So you delivered them to their oppressors;

but when they appealed to you in their distress,

you heard them from heaven, and with your great mercy,

gave them deliverers to rescue them.		Neh 9:26-27

28But as soon as they got comfortable,

they sinned again;

so you abandoned them to their enemies

to rule them over.

When they appealed to you again, you heard from heaven

and rescued them many times in your great mercy,

29and admonished them to return to your Law.

But they acted arrogantly

ignored your commandments,

sinned against your ordinances

that if people observe, they’ll live.

They turned a stubborn shoulder,

stiffened their neck,

and wouldn’t listen.

30But you bore with them for many years

and admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets;

yet they wouldn’t listen.

So you delivered them to the nations that lived in the lands.

31But in your great mercy

you didn’t make an end to them or abandon them,

because you’re a gracious and merciful God. 	Neh 9:28-31

32“Now, great, powerful, awesome God

that keeps covenant and enduring love,

don’t consider the hardship insignificant

that has come on us, our kings, officials, and priests,

our prophets, ancestors, and all your people

from the time of the kings of Assyria till now.

33You’re justified in everything that’s happened to us,

because you’ve dealt faithfully;

but we’ve acted sinfully.

34Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors

haven’t kept your Law

or paid attention to your commandments and admonitions.

35But they, in their own kingdom,

with your great goodness that you gave them,

with the wide, rich land you set in front of them,

did not serve you or turn from their sins.			Neh 9:32-35

36We’re slaves today

in the land you gave our ancestors to eat its fruit and bounty.

37Its abundant produce is for the kings

that you set over us because of our sins.

They rule our bodies and our livestock as they please;

we’re in great distress.

38Because of that, we’re signing a covenant;

and our officials, Levites, and priests have set their seal to it.”	Neh 9:36-38

People That Sealed the Covenant

10:1-8The sealed document showed the names of these priests: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah; Zedekiah, Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah;

9the Levites: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the family of Henadad, Kadmiel; 10and their brothers Shebanaih, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 11Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 12Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 13Hodiah, Bani, Beninu;

14the leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 15Bunni Azgad, Bebai, 16Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 17Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 18Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 19Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 20Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 21Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 22Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 23Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 24Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 25Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 26Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 27Malluch, Harim, Baanah.		Neh 10:1-27

Obligations of the Covenant

28The rest of the people—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, Temple servants, everybody that separated from the people in the land, their wives, their sons and daughters, everybody that had knowledge and understanding—29are joining their kinsmen and nobles in taking a curse and an oath. They swear to follow God’s Law through Moses, to observe his commandments, 30and not to intermarry with the people in the territory. 31If any people in the land bring wares or grain to sell on the Sabbath or a holy day, we won’t buy them. We won’t plant crops in the seventh year or exact any debt that year.

32We’ve obligated ourselves to contribute yearly .13 oz ⅓ of a shekel of silver for the service in God’s Temple: 33for the showbread, the continual grain offering and burnt offering; the Sabbaths, new moons, and appointed times; for the holy things, the sin offerings to atone for Israel, and the work on God’s Temple.		  Neh 10:28-33

34Likewise, we cast lots for supplying wood to the priests, Levites, and the people so they could bring it to God’s Temple by families at set times each year. It was for burning on the altar as the Law requires. 35We committed to bringing the first part of the harvest from our ground and trees to the LORD’s Temple every year; 36to bringing our male firstborns, cattle, herds, and flocks as the Law requires, especially in written form, for the priests that minister in God’s Temple. 37We’ll also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the olive oil to the priests at the rooms of God’s Temple. We’ll bring a tenth from our ground to the Levites, because they’re the ones that receive the tithes in the rural towns. 38The priest, the descendant of Aaron, will be with the Levites when they receive the tithes. The Levites will bring up a tenth of the tithes to the storerooms in God’s Temple. 39The people of Israel and the Levites will bring the contribution of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the chambers.  There are the utensils for the sanctuary, the priests that are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers.  That way we won’t neglect the Temple of our God.	 	 Neh 10:34-39

The Leaders in Jerusalem

11:1The people’s leaders already lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one in ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths stayed in the other towns. 2The people commended those who volunteered to move to Jerusalem.

3These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem, but in the towns of Judah each lived on his own property: the Israelites, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants. 4Some of the people of Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.

From Judah was Athaiah son of Uzziah (son of Zechariah son of Amariah son of Shephatiah) son of Mahalalel.

From Perez was 5Maaseiah (son of Baruch son of Col-hozeh son of Hazaiah son of Adaiah son of Joiarib son of Zechariah) son of the Shilonite. 6The descendants of Perez that lived in Jerusalem were 468 capable men.

7These are the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam (son of Joed son of Pedaiah son of Kolaiah son of Maaseiah son of Ithiel) son of Jeshaiah; 8and after him Gabbai and Sallai: 928. 9Joel son of Zichri was their overseer. Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command in the city.			Neh 11:1-9

10From the priests:

Jedaiah Ben-Joiarib, Jachin, 11Seraiah Ben-Hilkiah (Ben-Meshullam Ben-Zadok Ben-Meraioth Ben-Ahitub), supervisor of God’s Temple, 12and their relatives that did the work on the Temple, 822;

Adaiah Ben-Jeroham (Ben-Pelaliah Ben-Amzi Ben-Zechariah Ben-Pashhur Ben-Malchijah), 13and his associates, leaders of families: 242,

Amashsai (Ben-Azarel Ben-Ahzai Ben-Meshillemoth Ben-Immer,) 14and their brothers, trained soldiers: 128.

Zabdiel Ben-Haggedolim was their officer.

15From the Levites:

Shemaiah Ben-Hasshub Ben-Azrikam Ben-Hashabiah Ben-Bunni;

16Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who supervised the outside work on God’s Temple;

17Mattaniah Ben-Mica Ben-Zabdi Ben-Asaph, who led in thanksgiving;

Bakbukiah, the second among his relatives;

Abda Ben-Shammua Ben-Galal Ben-Jeduthun.

18The Levites in the holy city numbered 284.    	Neh 11:10-18

19The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their relatives, who guarded the gates, were 172. 20The rest of Israel, the priests, and Levites lived in towns in Judah on their own inheritances, 21but the Temple servants lived in Ophel. Ziha and Gishpa supervised them.

22The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani (son of Hashabiah son of Mattaniah son of Mica) from the descendants of Asaph, singers for the service of God’s Temple. 23The king laid out the daily responsibilities for the song leaders. 24Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s advisor in everything that had to do with public administration.		     Neh 11:19-24

Villages Outside Jerusalem

25The villages with their fields: some people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba, Dibon, Jekabzeel; 26in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth-pelet 27in Hazar-shual, Beersheba, 28in Ziklag, Meconah, 29Enrimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, 30Zanoah, Adullam, Lachis, Azekah, each with their fields, settlements, and villages. They camped from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom. 31Some people of Benjamin lived at Geba, Michmash and Aija, Bethel and its settlements, 32at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 36Some divisions of Levites that lived in Judah moved to live in Benjamin. 	      	Neh 11:25-36

Priests and Levites

12:1These are the priests and Levites that came up with Zerubbabel the king, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the high priest: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 2Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 3Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 4Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 5Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 6Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 7Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their relatives at the time of Jeshua.

8The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brothers was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 9Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood across from them in their service divisions. 10Jeshua was father of Joiakim (father of Eliashib father of Joiada 11father of Jonathan father of Jaddua).		 Neh 12:1-11

12At the time of Joiakim the priests, the family leaders were:

of Seraiah, Meraiah;

of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

13of Ezra, Meshullam;

of Amariah, Jehohanan;

14of Malluchi, Jonathan;

of Shebaniah, Joseph;

15of Harim, Adna;

of Meraioth, Helkai;

16of Iddo, Zechariah;

of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

17of Abijah, Zichri;

of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 		Neh 12:12-17

18of Bilgah, Shammua;

of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

19of Joiarib, Mattenai;

of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

20of Sallai, Kallai;

of Amok, Eber;

21of Hilkiah, Hashabiah;

of Jedaiah, Nethanel.		Neh 12:18-21

22The heads of the Levites’ families were registered at the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua; so were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian. 23The Levites, heads of families, were registered in The Book of Chronicles up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib. 24The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite to them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David, the man of God, division corresponding to division. 25Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub watched over the storehouses by the gates. 26These served at the time of Joiakim son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe.

Dedication of the Walls

27At the dedication of the wall at Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from wherever they were living, to bring them to Jerusalem so they could celebrate the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 28The singers gathered from the district around Jerusalem and the villages around Netophah, 29from Beth-gilgal and their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, because the singers had built villages around Jerusalem. 30The priests and Levites purified themselves, the people, the gates, and the wall.	   Neh 12:22-30

31Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on the wall, and I appointed two large choirs. The first choir went right on the wall toward the Refuse Gate. 32Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, 33with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 35some of the priests with trumpets; Zechariah son of Jonathan (son of Shemaiah son of Mattaniah son of Micaiah son of Zaccur son of Asaph, 36and his relatives), Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe went ahead of them. 37At the Fountain Gate they went up the steps of The City of David by the stairway of the wall above David’s palace to the Water Gate on the east.

38The second choir went left, while I followed them with half the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the broad wall, 39and above the Ephraim Gate, by the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Guard Gate. 40Then the two choirs took their place in God’s Temple. So did I and half of the officials with me; 41and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with the trumpets; 42and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang with Jezrahiah their leader, 43and on that day they offered a great number of sacrifices and celebrated because God had made them happy. The women and children celebrated too; the joy in Jerusalem was heard a long way off.

Neh 12:31-43

Provisions for Temple Worship

44On that day, men were also appointed to oversee the rooms for storing contributions, harvest firstfruits, and tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites; because Judah celebrated over the priests and Levites that served. 45They performed the worship of God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers according to the command of David and Solomon. 46In the time of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers, and there were songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. 47Israel at the time of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and gatekeepers as each day required. They set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the descendants of Aaron.  		    Neh 12:44-47

Nehemiah’s Final Reforms

13:1That day they read out loud from the Book of Moses so the people could hear it. There they found that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter God’s assembly. 2That was because they didn’t provide the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam to curse them. But our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3When they heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.

4Before this, Eliashib the priest—who was responsible for the rooms of God’s Temple and related to Tobiah—5had provided him a large room where they used to put the grain offerings, frankincense, utensils; the tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers; and the contributions for the priests. 6During that time I wasn’t in Jerusalem.

In the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I’d gone back to the king and after some time asked leave from him. 7I returned to Jerusalem and learned what evil Eliashib had done by providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the Temple. 8I threw out his belongings 9and ordered the rooms purified. I put back in there the utensils for God’s Temple, the grain offerings, and the frankincense.		  Neh 13:1-9

10I also discovered that the Levites hadn’t been receiving their portions, so they and the singers that performed service had gone to their fields. 11I reprimanded the officials, “Why is God’s Temple abandoned?” I gathered them together and restored them to their posts. 12Then Judah brought a tenth of the grain, wine, and olive oil to the storehouses. 13I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Hanan son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, and Pedaiah from the Levites to oversee the storehouses because I considered them reliable. They were responsible for distributing to their fellow Levites. 14Remember me for this, God. Don’t blot out my loyal efforts for your Temple and its services.

15At that time, I saw some people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath. They were bringing into Jerusalem sacks of grain loaded on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs—all kinds of merchandise on the Sabbath. I admonished them the day they sold the food. 16Men from Tyre were living there too. They were importing fish and other merchandise, and selling them to Judah on the Sabbath, right in Jerusalem. 17I reprimanded the nobles of Judah,

“What’s this sin you’re committing, profaning the Sabbath? 18Didn’t your ancestors do the same thing, and our God brought this trouble on us and this city? You’re adding to his wrath on Israel.”	    	     Neh 13:10-18

19I commanded that the gates be shut the day before Sabbath at dusk and not opened till after Sabbath. I stationed some of my guards at the gates so no merchandise would come in on the Sabbath. 20Once or twice the traders and merchants spent the night just outside Jerusalem. 21I warned them, “Why are you spending the night by the wall? Do it again, and I’ll use force on you.” From then on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath. 22I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the Sabbath. Remember me for this too, God. Have mercy on me in keeping with your great enduring love.

23At that time, I saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 24Half of their children spoke in the language of Ashdod and couldn’t speak the language of Judah. 25I contended with them, cursed them, struck some of them, pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God,

“Don’t intermarry with them. 26Didn’t Solomon sin in this matter? Among the nations there wasn’t a king like him. God loved him and made him king over all Israel, but foreign women caused even him to sin. 27Do we then hear that he acted unfaithfully against our God?”

28Even one of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat; so I banished him. 29Remember them, God, for defiling the priesthood and the covenant between the priesthood and the Levites.

30I purified them from everything foreign and appointed specific duties for the priests and the Levites. 31I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the firstfruits of harvest to be brought in at the appointed times. Remember me, God, for the good I’ve done.

Neh 13:19-31

ESTHER

King Xerxes’ Banquet

1:1Ahasuerus/Xerxes ruled from India to Nubia over 127 provinces [486-65 B.C.]. 2In his third year on his throne in Susa the capital, 3he held a banquet for his nobles and officials, the army chiefs of Persia and Media, and the nobles and governors of the provinces. 4For 180 days he showed the wealth of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty. 5After that, he gave everybody there—least and greatest—a banquet that lasted a week in the court of his palace garden. 6There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings held up by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble pillars. There were gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement made out of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. 7Drinks were served in gold cups of different kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty. 8The drinking was done by law: attendees were not compelled, because the king had ordered each official of his household to follow each person’s wishes. 9Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the king’s palace.	Esther 1:1-9

Queen Vashti Deposed

10On the seventh day, when the king was half drunk from wine, he told Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—the seven eunuchs serving in his presence—11to bring him Queen Vashti with her royal crown to show the people and princes how beautiful she was. 12But she wouldn’t come. He was mad and it smoldered in him. 13He consulted the wise men who understood customs.  It was his custom so to speak to everybody that knew law and justice. 14Those close to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to him and sat in first place in the kingdom. 15He asked them, “By law, what should be done with Queen Vashti? She didn’t obey my command sent through the eunuchs.” 16In the presence of the king and princes, Memucan said, 	Esther 1:10-16a

“She has not only wronged you but your officials and the people groups in your provinces. 17Women will find out what she’s done and look with contempt on their husbands and say King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought into his presence, but she didn’t come. 18Today the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard about what she did will speak the same way to your officials, and there’ll be plenty of contempt and anger. 19If it pleases you, issue a royal edict—written in the laws of Persia and Media so it can’t be altered—that Vashti should not come into your presence anymore. Give her royal position to someone more worthy. 20When they hear your edict throughout your great kingdom, women will respect their husbands, greatm and small.”

21The king and the officials liked the idea, and he did what Memucan proposed. 22He sent letters to all his provinces, to each province in its script and to every people in their language, that every man should be the master in his house and speak in the language of his own people.

Esther 1:16b-22

Esther Becomes Queen

2:1After that, when King Ahasuerus calmed down, he remembered what Vashti had done and what he’d decreed against her. 2Then the king’s advisors that attended him said,

“Have beautiful young virgins be sought for you. 3Appoint officers in all the provinces to gather them to the harem in Susa under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women. Give them ointments, 4and have the young woman that pleases you replace Vashti as queen.”

He liked that; so that’s what he did.		Esther 2:1-4

5There was a Jew in Susa named Mordecai son of Jair (son of Shimei son of Kish), a Benjamite. 6He was among the captives Nebuchadnezzar took from Jerusalem with Jeconiah, king of Judah. 7He’d raised Hadassah (Esther), his uncle’s daughter, because she didn’t have any parents. She was beautiful and lovely. Mordecai adopted her when her parents died. 8When the king declared his edict and many young women were brought to Susa and put in Hegai’s custody, Esther was also taken to his palace. 9The young woman pleased him and won his approval. Right away he provided her with her ointments, her portion of food, and seven chosen maids from the king’s palace. He advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem. 10Esther hadn’t told anybody who her people or relatives were; Mordecai had charged her not to. 11Every day he walked past the court of the harem to find out how she was doing. 		  Esther 2:5-11

12Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women.  Their time of beautification lasted six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and women’s cosmetics.  13She’d go in to the king with anything she wanted to take from the harem to his palace. 14In the evening she’d go in, and in the morning she’d go to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She wouldn’t go in to the king again unless he delighted in her and summoned her by name. 15When Esther’s turn came—the daughter of Abihail, Mordecai’s uncle—she didn’t ask for anything except what Hegai advised.  She was pleasing to everybody that saw her. 16She was taken to the king’s royal palace in the tenth month (Tebeth), seventh year of his reign. 17He liked Esther more than any of the other women. He showed her more kindness, and she was more pleasing to him than the other virgins. So he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 18Then he held a grand banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts with royal liberality. 	    Esther 2:12-18

Mordecai’s Uncovers a Conspiracy

19When the virgins had become part of the second harem, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. 20Esther hadn’t yet told anybody about her relatives and what her nationality was. She did what Mordecai told her like she’d done under his care. 21During that time, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s officials that guarded the door, got mad and tried to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. 22But Mordecai found out about it and told Queen Esther. She informed the king in Mordecai’s name. 23When the plot was investigated and found to be true, they were both hung on gallows. It was recorded in The Book of Chronicles in the king’s presence.		Esther 2:19-23

Haman’s Plot to Destroy the Jews

3:1After that, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and made his authority secure over his fellow officials. 2The king’s aides at the king’s gate bowed in homage to Haman because that’s what the king commanded. But Mordecai didn’t bow. 3The king’s aides at the king’s gate said, “Why aren’t you obeying the king?” 4When they’d spoken every day to him and he ignored them they told Haman to see if he would tolerate Mordecai’s reason for not bowing to him: he’d told them he was a Jew. 5When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow in homage, it made him mad. 6But he thought it was beneath his station to arrest only Mordecai. Since they’d told him what Mordecai’s nationality was, he made an effort to destroy all the Jews in the kingdom.	      Esther 3:1-6

7In the first month (Nisan), twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (the lot) in front of Haman daily and from month to month, till the twelfth month (Adar). 8Then Haman told King Ahasuerus,

“There’s a nation scattered around the provinces whose laws are different from other people’s laws. They don’t observe your laws; so it’s not in your interest to let them stay. 9If it pleases you, issue a decree to destroy them. I’ll pay 377½ tons 10,000 talents of silver to the ones that carry out your business, and I’ll put it in your treasuries.” 	 	Esther 3:7-9

10The king took off his signet ring and gave it to Haman, enemy of the Jews. 11He told him, “The silver is yours, and the people too. Do what you want to with them.” 12Then the king’s scribes were summoned the thirteenth day, first month. They wrote what Haman told the king’s satraps, the governors in each province, the rulers of each people group—each province in its script, each people in its language—in the king’s name, sealed with his signet ring. 13Letters went out by couriers to the king’s provinces to destroy, kill, and annihilate the Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day, twelfth month (Adar), and to confiscate their possessions. 14A copy of the edict was issued in every province and published to all the people so they’d be ready on that day. 15The couriers went out, urged by the king’s command, while the decree was issued in Susa. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, Susa was in confusion.           		Esther 3:10-15

Mordecai Persuades Esther to Help

4:1When Mordecai found out what had happened, he tore his clothes, put on burlap and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. 2He went as far as the king’s gate, because nobody was supposed to enter the king’s gate dressed in burlap. 3In every province where the decree had gone, the Jews were mourning greatly with fasting, crying, wailing. Many were lying on burlap and ashes.

4Then Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and she writhed in anguish. She sent clothes to Mordecai so he’d take off his burlap, but he didn’t accept them. 5Then she summoned Hathach from the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and told him to go to Mordecai and find out why he was in mourning. 6He went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate. 7Mordecai told him what had happened, and the amount of money Haman promised to pay the king’s treasuries for destroying the Jews. 8He gave Hathach a copy of the edict issued in Susa for their destruction. That way he could show Esther and have her go in to the king and implore his help and plead with him for her people.

Esther 4:1-8

9Hathach came back with Mordecai’s message. 10She told him to answer Mordecai.

11“All the king’s aides and the people in his provinces know that he has just one law for any man or woman who comes to his inner court without being summoned: he’s to be executed unless the king extends the gold scepter to him. I haven’t been summoned to him for 30 days.”

12They relayed that message to Mordecai.

13He told them to tell her,

“Don’t imagine that in the king’s palace you can escape any more than the other Jews. 14If you don’t speak up, deliverance will come from someplace else. You and your father’s family will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for a time like this.”

15She told them to answer Mordecai,

16“Get the Jews together that are in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will do the same. I’ll go in to the king, which is against the law. If I die, I die.”

17Mordecai did what she said.		Esther 4:9-17

Esther’s Request to the King

5:1On the third day, Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace by his rooms. He was sitting on his throne across from the entrance to the palace. 2When he saw her, he was pleased and extended the gold scepter that was in his hand. She came and touched the top of it.

3He asked her,

“What’s troubling you, Queen Esther?

What’s your request? I’ll give it to you up to half the kingdom.”

4She said, “If it pleases you, may you and Haman come to the banquet I’ve prepared for yousg today.”

5He said, “Bring Haman right away so we can do what Esther wants.” The king and Haman went to the banquet she’d prepared. 6As they drank their wine, the king asked her,

“What’s your petition; I’ll grant it.

What’s your request? I’ll do it up to half the kingdom.” 	Esther 5:1-6

7Esther answered,

“My petition is: 8if I’ve found favor with you, if it pleases you to grant my petition, may you and Haman come to the banquet I’ll prepare for you, and tomorrow I’ll do like you ask.”

Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai

9Haman went out happy and pleased. But when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate not standing up or nervous in his presence, it made him mad. 10He controlled himself, though, went home and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 11He recounted his glorious wealth, how many sons he had, every instance where the king had honored him and promoted him above the king’s other nobles and officials. 12He added,

“Even Queen Esther didn’t have anybody but me come with the king to the banquet she’d prepared. She’s also invited me with him tomorrow. 13Yet none of this satisfies me whenever I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”

14Zeresh and his friends said, “Have gallows built 75ft high. In the morning, ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go happy with him to the banquet.”

Haman liked that, so he had them built.		Esther 5:7-14

The King Honors Mordecai

6:1That night the king couldn’t get to sleep, so he had them bring the record book and read it to him. 2The Chronicles wrote that Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers that had tried to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.

3The king asked, “What honor’s been given to him for that?”

His attendants said, “Nothing.”

4The king said, “Who’s in the court?” Haman had just come into the outer court of the king’s palace to speak to him about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he’d built.

5The king’s aides said, “Haman’s standing in the court.”

“Let him come in.” 		Esther 6:1-5

6When Haman came in, the king asked him, “What should be done for a man the king wants to honor?”

Haman said to himself, “Who would he want to honor more than me?” 7He said,

8“Have them bring a royal robe you’ve worn, a horse you have ridden, and a royal crown that’s been on your head. 9Hand the robe and the horse to one of your most noble princes and have them array him. Have them lead him on horseback through the city square and proclaim, ‘This is what should be done for a man the king wants to honor.’”		Esther 6:6-9

10The king told Haman,

“Hurry and take the robes and the horse like you said, and do that for Mordecai the Jew that’s sitting at my gate. That’s what I’ll do for the man I want to honor.”

11Haman took the robe and horse and arrayed Mordecai. He led him on horseback through the city square and proclaimed, “This is what’s done for the man the king wants to honor.” 12Then Mordecai went back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried home, mourning with his head covered. 13He told Zeresh and his friends what happened. His wise men and Zeresh said, “If Mordecai is a Jew that you’ve begun to fall in front of, you won’t overcome him. You’ll fall to him.” 14While they were still talking, the king’s eunuchs arrived and took him to the banquet Esther had prepared.		Esther 6:10-14

Esther Reveals Haman’s Plot

7:1The king and Haman came to drink wine with Queen Esther. 2The king asked her that second day as they drank their wine,

“What’s your petition, Queen Esther; I’ll grant it.

What’s your request? Up to half the kingdom I’ll do it.”

3She answered,

“If I’m pleasing to you, my king,

if it pleases you,

have my life given to me as my petition,

and my people as my request.

4My people and I have been sold to be destroyed, killed, annihilated. If we’d only been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet; the trouble wouldn’t compare with the annoyance to the king.”

5King Ahasuerus asked her, “Who is he and where is he, that would presume to do such a thing?”

6She said, “A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman!” Haman panicked.           Esther 7:1-6

Haman Hanged

7The king got up angry and went to the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther. He saw that the king had determined to harm him. 8When the king came back, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. The king said, “Will he even assault the queen with me in the palace?” As the word left his mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 9Harbonah, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, “Look at the gallows by Haman’s house standing 75ft high that he made for Mordecai, who spoke good on behalf of the king!”

The king said, “Hang him on it!”

10They hanged Haman on the gallows he’d built for Mordecai, and the king calmed down.				Esther 7:6-10

Esther Saves the Jews

8:1That day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, enemy of the Jews. Mordecai came into the king’s presence because she revealed how he was related to her. 2The king took off the signet ring he’d taken away from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai over Haman’s house.

3She spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, cried, and implored him to overturn the plot Haman had devised against the Jews. 4He extended the gold scepter to her. She got up and stood in front of him,

5“If it pleases you,

if I’ve found favor with you,

if the matter seems proper to you,

if I’m pleasing to you,

have it written to revoke the letters Haman wrote in his plot to destroy the Jews in your provinces. 6How can I endure to see the misfortune that will fall on my people and the destruction of my kin?”

7He told her and Mordecai,

“I’ve given Haman’s house to Esther. They’ve hanged him on the gallows because he reached out against the Jews. 8Now write to the Jews as you see fit in my name and seal it with my signet ring; a decree written in the king’s name and sealed with his seal can’t be revoked.” 	      Esther 8:1-8

9They called in the king’s scribes on the twenty-third day, third month (Sivan). They wrote what Mordecai commanded the Jews, satraps, governors, and rulers of the 127 provinces from India to Nubia. They wrote to every province in its script and every people group in their language as well as to the Jews in their script and language. 10Mordecai wrote in the name of Ahasuerus, sealed it with his signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses sired by the royal stud. 11In the letters the king allowed the Jews in every city to gather and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate the entire army of any people or province that would attack them, including women and children, and to plunder their spoil. 12That could happen on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus: the thirteenth day, twelfth month (Adar). 13A copy of the edict was issued as law in every province so the Jews would be ready that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 14The couriers, hurried by the king’s command, went out, riding on steeds used for the king’s service. The decree circulated in Susa as well.

15Then Mordecai went out from the king in blue and white royal robes, a large gold crown, and a purple, fine-linen cloak. 16The Jews had light and honor. 17In every province and city where the king’s decree went, they had happiness and joy, a festival and holiday. Many people in the empire became Jews because they had come to dread them.	Esther 8:9-17

The Jews Destroy Their Enemies

9:1The thirteenth day, twelfth month, when the king’s edict was about to be carried out and the Jews’ enemies hoped to gain mastery over them, fortunes reversed. The Jews gained mastery over those who hated them. 2They gathered in their towns throughout the provinces to seize the ones that tried to harm them. Nobody could stand up against them, because the dread of the Jews had fallen on the people. 3Even the rulers of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the ones that were doing the king’s business helped the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 4He became greater and greater in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces. 5The Jews struck their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying, and doing what they pleased to the ones that hated them.

6They killed 500 men in Susa, 7, 10aincluding Haman’s 10 sons:

Parshandatha,

Dalphon,

Aspatha,

8Poratha,

Adalia,

Aridatha,

9Parmashta,

Arisai,

Aridai, and

Vaizatha. 10bBut they didn’t take any plunder.		Esther 9:1-10

11That day, the number killed in Susa was reported to the king. 12He told Queen Esther,

“The Jews have killed 500 men in Susa plus Haman’s 10 sons.

What have they done in the rest of the provinces!?

What’s your petition? I’ll grant it.

What’s your added request; I’ll do it.”

13She said, “If it pleases the king, have the Jews in Susa do tomorrow what the edict said for today. Have the dead bodies of Haman’s 10 sons hanged on the gallows.”

14So he had it done. He issued the edict in Susa, and they hanged Haman’s 10 sons. 15The Jews in Susa gathered on the fourteenth of Adar and killed 300 men. But they didn’t take plunder.

16The Jews in the provinces came together to defend themselves and rid themselves of their enemies. They killed 75,000 that hated them, but they didn’t take plunder. 17They did that on the thirteenth of Adar and rested on the fourteenth with feasting and celebrating. 18The Jews in Susa gathered on both days and rested on the fifteenth with feasting and celebrating. 19The Jews in the rural towns made the fourteenth day of Adar a holiday for feasting and celebrating and sending dishes of food to one another.	Esther 9:11-19

The Festival of Purim Inaugurated

20Mordecdai recorded those events and sent letters to all the Jews in the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near and far. 21He obliged them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar each year, 22the days the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies. It was a month for them that turned sorrow into happiness, mourning into a holiday. They were to make them days of feasting and celebrating and sending dishes of food to one another and gifts to the poor. 23The Jews undertook to do what Mordecai had written. 24Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, enemy of the Jews, had schemed to destroy them. He’d cast Pur (the lot) to disturb them and destroy them. 25But when it came to the king’s attention, he commanded by letter that Haman’s scheme should come back on his own head; he and his sons would be hanged on the gallows. 26They called those days Purim after the Pur. Because of the instruction in this letter—what they’d seen in this regard and what had happened to them—27the Jews established a custom for themselves, their descendants, and their allies: to celebrate those two days according to their regulation at the appointed time each year. 28Those days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, family, province, and city. The days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews or their memory from their descendants.		   Esther 9:20-28

29Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. 30Mordecai sent letters to the Jews in the 127 provinces, a message of peace and truth, 31to establish those days of Purim at their appointed times, like Mordecai and Esther had set for themselves and their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and mourning. 32Esther’s command established those customs for Purim, and it was written in the records.		Esther 9:29-32

The Greatness of Mordecai

10:1King Ahasuerus put under tribute the territory and lands by the Sea. 2His accomplishments by his authority and strength—as well as the full account of Mordecai’s status that the king advanced him to—are recorded in The Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia. 3Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, great among the Jews, and favored by his host of relatives. He sought the good of his people and spoke for the welfare of his whole nation.	Esther 10:1-3

JOB

1:1Job lived in the land of Uz, a blameless, godly man that respected God and shunned evil. 2He had seven sons and three daughters; 3and owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys; and servants. 4His sons would hold feasts in each other’s houses and invite their three sisters. 5When the feasting days had completed their cycle, Job would consecrate them, getting up early and offering burnt offerings for each one, “Maybe my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.”

6One day when the sons of God came to present themselves to the LORD, Satan came too. 7The LORD asked him,

“Where’d you come from?”

“From roaming around in the world.”

8“Have you noticed my servant Job? There’s nobody in the world like him, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil.”

9“Does he respect you for nothing? 10Haven’t you planted a hedge around him, his home, and everything he owns? You’ve blessed his work, and his possessions have increased in the world. 11Reach out and touch everything he has, and he’ll curse you to your face.”

12“Everything he has is under your authority. Just don’t do anything to him.”

So Satan left.      	 Job 1:1-12

13One day when his sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house, 14a messenger came to Job, “The oxen were plowing, the donkeys were feeding alongside them, 15and the Sabeans attacked and stole them. They killed the servants with the sword. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 16While he was still talking, another servant came, “God’s fire fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 17While he was still talking, another servant came, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, and raided the camels, stole them, and killed the servants with the sword. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.” 18While he was still talking, another servant came,

“Your sons and daughters were drinking wine and eating in their oldest brother’s house. 19A violent gale from the desert demolished the house. It collapsed on the young people and killed them. I’m the only one that escaped to tell you.”	                                                                        Job 1:13-19

20Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; he fell on the ground and worshiped,

21 “I came naked from my mother’s womb, LORD

and I’ll leave naked.

The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away.

Bless the LORD.”

22Through all that, Job didn’t sin by blaming God.                                  	    Job 1:20-22

2:1On another day when the sons of God came to present themselves to the LORD, Satan came with them. 2The LORD asked him,

“Where’d you come from?”

“From roaming around in the world.”

3“Have you noticed my servant Job? There’s nobody like him in the world, a blameless, godly man that respects me and shuns evil. He still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to ruin him for no reason.”

4“Skin for skin! Everything mortalsm have they’ll give for their life. 5Reach out and touch his flesh and bone, and he’ll curse you to your face.”

6“He’s under your authority. Just don’t take his life.”

7Satan went out from the LORD and struck Job with sore boils from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. 8He was using a potsherd to scrape himself, sitting in ashes.

9His wife said, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Curse God and die!”

10But he told her, “You talk like a foolish woman. Will we accept good from God and not adversity?”

In all that, Job didn’t sin in what he said.	Job 2:1-10

11His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him. They made an appointment together to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. 12When they looked up from a distance and didn’t recognize him, they wailed loudly, tore their robes, and threw dust over their heads. 13They sat down on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw he was in so much pain.	  Job 2:11-13

3:1Afterward Job cursed the day he was born: [2]

3“Perish the day I was born,

the night I was conceived.

4May that be a dark day;

let God above not care about it

or any light shine on it.

5Let darkness and gloom claim it,

dark clouds cover it, and darkness make it terrifying.

6Let darkness seize that night;

let it not celebrate among the days of the year

or be counted among the months.

7Let that night be barren,

and no joyful shout be heard in it.

8Let them curse it who curse the daytime,

who dare to arouse Leviathan.

9Let its morning stars be blacked out;

let it hope for light, but not get any,

or see the eyelids of the morning;

10because it didn’t shut my mother’s womb

or hide trouble from me.	Job 3:1-10

11“Why didn’t I die at birth—

just come out of the womb and die?

12Why did the knees receive me

and the breasts that nursed me?

13Then I would’ve lain down in peace;

I would’ve slept and been at rest

14with kings and advisors

that rebuilt ruins for themselves,

15with rulers that had gold

and filled their houses with silver.

16Why wasn’t I a miscarriage that was discarded,

that never saw the light of day?

17Sinners stop raging in death,

and the weary rest.

18Captives are at ease together;

they don’t hear a taskmaster.

19The least and the greatest are there;

slaves are free from their masters.	Job 3:11-19

20“Why does light come to those who are suffering,

and life to the bitter;

21to people who long for death and it doesn’t come,

who dig for it more than for hidden treasure;

22who celebrate greatly,

glad to find the grave?

23Why is light given to someone with no future,

someone God has hemmed in with difficulties?

24I sigh at the sight of food

and pour out groans like water;

25because what I’m afraid of comes at me,

and what I dread happens to me.

26I’m not at ease, I’m not at peace;

I’m not at rest; only trouble is coming.”	Job 3:20-26

4:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

2“Will you be offended if someone offers you advice?

Who can help speaking up?

3You’ve admonished many people

and encouraged the weak.

4What you’ve said has helped the tottering stand

and weak knees hold firm.

5But now difficulty has come to you,

and you’re impatient and distressed.

6Isn’t your reverence for God your confidence,

and the integrity of your ways your hope?	Job 4:1-6

7“Think now, who ever perished that was innocent?

Where were the godly ever destroyed?

8In my experience, those who plow sin

and sow trouble, reap it.

9They perish by God’s breath;

a blast of his anger consumes them.

10A lion roars; it can roar loud;

but even the teeth of a young lion can be broken.

11A lion perishes because there’s no prey,

and the cubs of a lioness scatter.	Job 4:7-11

12“A message crept in quietly to me;

I heard it whisper.

13In my dreams at night when deep sleep comes,

14dread overwhelmed me, and I trembled all over.

15A spirit glided by my face

and made my hair stand up.

16It stood still,

but I couldn’t make out what it looked like;

a form hovered in front of me;

everything was quiet; then I heard a voice:

17‘Can mortals be good in God’s presence?

Can they be as pure as their Maker?

18God doesn’t trust his own servants;

he even brings charges against his angels,

19much more those who live in clay houses,

whose foundations lie in dust,

who get crushed as easy as a moth!

20In one day they’re broken to pieces;

they perish forever without anyone noticing.

21Isn’t their tent-rope pulled up inside them?

They die in ignorance.’	Job 4:12-21

5:1“Call out for help now; will anybody answer you?

Which of the angels will you turn to?

2Adversity slays the foolish;

anger kills the simpleminded.

3I’ve seen the foolish taking root

and having their progress immediately cursed.

4Their children are never safe,

they’re oppressed in the courts,

and there’s nobody to deliver them.

5The hungry eat up their harvest;

briers take over it;

schemers are eager to get their wealth;

6because adversity doesn’t sprout from the dirt,

and trouble doesn’t grow out of the ground. 	Job 5:1-6

7“Mortals are born for trouble

like sparks fly up from burning wood.

8“I would seek God;

I’d place my cause in front of him

9who does great, unsearchable things,

wonders without number.

10He sends rain

to water the fields.

11He sets the humble up high

and lifts mourners to safety.

12He frustrates devious plots

so they can’t succeed.

13He catches the wise in their own shrewdness

and quickly thwarts wily people’s schemes.

14They run into darkness in the daytime

and grope at noon as at night.

15But he saves people from the sword

and the poor from the powerful.

16So the helpless have hope;

the sinful have to shut their mouths.	Job 5:7-16

17“How happy they are that God corrects;

so don’t despise discipline by the Almighty,

18because he inflicts pain but gives relief,			he wounds in order to heal.

19He’ll deliver you from six troubles;

even in seven, tragedy won’t touch you.

20In famine he’ll redeem you from death;

in war he’ll save you from the sword.

21He’ll hide you from the scourge of the tongue;

you won’t panic when violence comes.

22You’ll laugh at destruction and famine;

wild animals won’t scare you. 			Job 5:17-22

23You’ll be at peace with the rocks in the field;

the wild animals will be at peace with you.

24You’ll know your tent is secure;

you’ll inventory your holdings and find nothing missing.

25You’ll have lots of children,

offspring like grass on the ground.

26You’ll come to your grave at a ripe old age,

like a bundle of wheat at harvest time.

27We’ve examined this and found it’s true;

listen to it for your own good.”	Job 5:23-27

6:1Job answered:

2“Oh that my adversity was properly weighed

in the balances with my sins!

3It would outweigh the sand by the seashore;

that’s why I’ve been rash.

4The arrows of the Almighty are piercing me;

my spirit is absorbing their poison;

God’s terrors are attacking me.

5Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass?

Does an ox bawl over its hay?

6Does anyone eat tasteless food without salting it?

Is there any flavor in egg whites?

7My mouth won’t touch them;

they’re disgusting to me.	Job 6:1-7

8“Oh that I could receive what I ask for,

that God would grant me what I long for!

9Oh that he’d be willing to crush me,

that he’d reach out and kill me!

10This is my consolation:

I can take comfort in my unsparing pain

because I haven’t denied the words of the Holy One.

11I don’t have enough strength to endure.

What hope do I have that I should be patient?

12Am I as hard as rock?

Is my body as firm as bronze?

13I can’t get any help from inside me;

I can’t deliver myself.				Job 6:8-13

14“Friends should be kind to people in despair;

otherwise, they’ll lose reverence for the Almighty.

15My brothers have been unreliable,

like water in wadis you can’t depend on.

16Now they’re turbulent with melting ice and snow;

17now they’re dry and silent;

when it’s hot, they stop running.

18Their course winds into wasteland and disappears.

19Caravans from Tema look for them;

travelers from Sheba hope to find them.

20They’re disappointed;

when they arrive, they’re frustrated.

21You’ve been like that to me;

you see my misfortune and get scared.

22Have I said, ‘Give me something’;

‘pay a ransom for me from your wealth’;

23‘deliver me from my adversary’;

or ‘ransom me from oppressors’?	Job 6:14-23

24“Teach me and I’ll be quiet;

show me where I’m wrong.

25Honest words carry force,

but what does your criticism show?

26Do you think you can rebuke me

by treating my despairing words like wind?

27You’d cast lots for orphans

and barter your friend!

28Look me in the eye;

am I’m lying to your face?

29Just stop supposing I’ve done something wrong;

my good reputation is at stake here.

30Has there been anything false about what I’ve said?

Can’t I distinguish guilt from disaster?	Job 6:24-30

7:1“Aren’t people forced into hard labor?

Aren’t their days like those of a hired hand?

2Like a slave panting for shade,

like an employee waiting for wages,

3I’ve been allotted months of emptiness

and given restless nights.

4When I‘m in bed, I say, ‘When is morning ever going to get here?’

But night goes on and on, and I toss and turn till dawn.

5My body is covered with maggots and scabs;

my skin hardens and breaks open and festers.	Job 7:1-5

6My days fly by faster than a weaver’s shuttle

and end without hope.

7“Remember that my life is only a breath, God;

I won’t see good times again.

8People won’t see me for long

because I’ll be gone.

9Like a dissipating cloud,

those who go down to Sheol don’t come up again.

10They won’t come home

or ever be seen again.		Job 7:6-10

11“So I won’t hold back;

I’ll speak with anguished spirit;

I’ll complain from my bitter soul.

12Am I the sea or a sea monster

that you set a guard over me?

13If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,

my couch will ease my discomfort,’

14then you scare me with dreams

and terrify me with nightmares;

15so I’d have chosen strangulation

and death instead of these pains.

16I’m wasting away; I won’t live forever;

leave me alone; my life is just a breath.		Job 7:11-16

17“What are people that you pay so much attention to them,

that you concern yourself with them,

18that you examine them every morning

and test them all day?

19Won’t you ever look the other way

or let me alone long enough to swallow?

20Have I sinned? What have I ever done to you

that you keep hounding me?

Why do you target me

and burden yourself with me?

21Why don’t you just pardon my sin

take away my guilt?

Soon I’ll lie down in the ground and die;

you’ll look for me, but I wouldn’t be there.”	Job 7:17-21

8:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“How long will you talk like that?

You make your mouth a blustering wind?

3Does God pervert justice?

Does the Almighty twist the truth?

4When your children sinned against him,

he delivered them to the consequences of their sin.

5If you look for God and beg for mercy from the Almighty,

6if you’re pure and just,

he’ll certainly act on your behalf

and restore you to your good position.

7Though you started with little,

you’ll end up with a lot.		Job 8:1-7

8“Ask previous generations

and find out what the ancestors learned;

9we’re only like yesterday and don’t know much;

our short time on earth has been like a shadow.

10Won’t they teach you

and offer their thoughts?		Job 8:8-10

11“Can papyrus grow where there’s no marsh?

Can reeds grow without water?

12While they’re still growing and not ready to be cut,

they wither sooner than grass.

13The paths of everyone that forgets God are like that;

the hopes of godless people perish.

14What they depend on breaks down;

what they trust is like a spider’s web.

15They trust it, but it doesn’t hold firm;

when they take hold of it, it mashes in their hand.

16It’s like a lush plant that thrives in the sunshine

and spreads its shoots across the garden,

17whose roots twine around a rock pile

and grow among the stones.

18But if it’s pulled loose,

you can’t tell it was ever there.

19That’s the extent of its ‘joy’;

others sprout up to replace it.	Job 8:11-19

20“God doesn’t reject blameless people

or give sinners a hand.

21Yet he’ll fill your mouth with laughter,

your lips with shouting.

22In the end, those who hate you he’ll cover with disgrace;

the tents of sinners won’t exist anymore.”	Job 8:20-22

9:1Job answered:

2“I know that’s true,

but how can anyone be innocent in God’s sight?

3If you wanted to dispute with him,

you couldn’t answer him once in a thousand times.

4He’s so wise and powerful;

who has ever defied him and succeeded?	Job 9:1-4

5“It’s God that moves mountains;

they don’t know it when he overturns them in his anger.

6He can shake the earth and make its pillars tremble;

7he can tell the sun not to rise and the stars not to shine.

8He alone stretched out the sky

and tramped on the ocean waves.

9He made the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades,

and constellations in the southern hemisphere.

10He does great, unimaginable things,

countless amazing deeds. 				Job 9:5-10

11“If he passes by me, I don’t see him;

if he goes by, I can’t sense him.

12He snatches away; who can stop him?

Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’

13God won’t turn away his anger;

Rahab’s helpers cower below him.		Job 9:11-13

14“How then can I answer him

or argue with him?

15Even if I were innocent, I couldn’t answer him;

I’d have to appeal to my accuser for mercy.

16If I called and he answered me,

I wouldn’t expect him to pay attention to me.

17He attacks me with a storm

and multiplies my wounds for no reason.

18He won’t let me catch my breath,

but saturates me with bitterness.

19If it’s a matter of power, look at him!

If it’s a matter of justice, who can sue him?

20Though I’m good, my mouth will condemn me;

though I’m innocent, it’ll pronounce me guilty. 	Job 9:14-20

21“I’m innocent, but it doesn’t matter;

I despise my life.

22Innocent and guilty are the same to him; so I say,

‘He destroys the innocent with the guilty.’

23When disaster brings sudden death,

he mocks innocent people’s despair.

24The earth has been turned over to sinners;

he blinds the eyes of judges.

If it’s not him, who is it?		Job 9:21-24

25“Now my days go past faster than a runner;

they hurry away; they don’t see anything good.

26They slip by like a reed skiff,

like an eagle swooping on prey.

27If I say, ‘I’ll forget about my complaint;

I’ll leave my sad countenance and be cheerful,’

28I’m afraid of my sufferings;

I know he won’t declare me innocent.

29He’ll condemn me anyway;

why should I try for nothing?

30Even if I wash myself with snow

and clean my hands with lye,

31he’d still throw me into a pit;

even my clothes would abhor me.		Job 9:25-31

32“He’s not a mortal like me that I can argue with,

that I could go to court against.

33There’s no mediator between us

that could hold us apart.

34Let him take his rod away from me;

don’t let my dread of him terrify me.

35Then I’d speak without fearing him,

but I can’t do that on my own.	Job 9:32-35

10:1“I detest my life;

so I’ll fully vent my complaint

and speak out of my total frustration.

2I’ll tell God, ‘Don’t just condemn me;

tell me why you’re contending with me.

3Is it right for you to oppress me, to reject my toil,

to look favorably on sinners’ schemes?

4Do you just have physical eyes

and only see like people see?

5Are your days like a mortal’s,

your years like a human’s,

6that you should look all around for my guilt

and search diligently for my every sin?

7You know I’m not guilty;

yet nobody can deliver me from you.	Job 10:1-7

8“‘You fashioned me and made me;

now you want to kill me?

9Remember, you made me out of clay;

you want to turn me back to dust?

10Didn’t you pour me out like milk,

curdle me like cheese,

11dress me in skin and flesh,

knit me together with bones and tendons?

12You’ve granted me enduring love

and preserved my spirit with your care;

13yet you hid other things in your heart too.

I know that was your real purpose.	Job 10:8-13

14If I sin, you mark me

and won’t acquit me.

15If I’m sinful, misfortune awaits me!

Even if I’m good, I dare not hold my head up

because I still feel ashamed and look miserable.

16If I do hold my head up, you hunt me down like a lion

and show me how powerful you are.

17You multiply your accusations against me;

you increase your anger at me

and bring hardship after hardship on me.

18Why let me be born?

I wish I’d died and nobody’d seen me!

19It would have been like I never existed,

carried from the womb to the tomb.’	Job 10:14-19

20“‘Couldn’t you have left my few days alone

and stayed away from me so I could have a little cheer

21before I leave permanently

for the land of darkness and deep shadow,

22the realm of gloom and doom,

where darkness is as intense as light at noon?’”	Job 10:20-22

11:1Zophar the Naamathite answered:

2“Should your barrage of words go unchallenged,

and you exonerate yourself by talking a lot?

3Will your babble shut people up?

Will you mock and nobody rebuke you?

4You claim your beliefs are pure

and you’re innocent in God’s presence;

5but I just wish God would speak out against you

6and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,

because sound wisdom is not simple;

be assured that God doesn’t remember

just one part of your sin. 	Job 11:1-6

7“Can you find out the deep things of God

or probe the limits of the Almighty?

8They’re higher than the sky—what can you do?

They’re deeper than Sheol—what can you know?

9They measure longer than the world

and wider than the sea.

10If he passes through or imprisons

or calls to judgment, who can stop him?

11He knows worthless people;

he knows about their sin without having to investigate.

12A stupid man can no more become intelligent

than a wild donkey can have a baby. 	Job 11:7-12

13“If you set your heart right,

you can raise your hands and pray to him.

14If there’s sin in you, get rid of it;

don’t let it live in your house.

15Then you can hold your head up,

be steadfast and unafraid.

16You can forget your misery

and remember it like water gone by.

17Your life will become brighter than noonday;

darkness will be like morning.

18Then you’ll have confidence because of hope,

be protected, and rest in safety.

19You’ll lie down, and no one will disturb you;

others will ask for your blessing.

20But the eyes of sinners will be blinded;

they can’t escape;

their only hope is death.”		Job 11:13-20

12:1Job answered:

2“No doubt, you’re the people,

and wisdom will die with you!

3But I’m as smart as you are;

I’m not your inferior.

Who doesn’t know things like that?

4I’m a laughingstock to my friends,

one who called on God and he answered,

a just and blameless man;

yet I’m a laughingstock.

5In the thoughts of people at ease,

there’s contempt for disaster;

they’re ready to give a shove to those whose feet are slipping.

6Destroyers prosper;

those who provoke God may feel secure,

but he’ll bring them under his control.	Job 12:1-6

7“Ask the animals, they’ll teach you;

the birds will explain.

8Speak to the earth; it will inform you;

have the fish in the sea tell you.

9Who among them doesn’t know

that the LORD has brought this disaster on me?

10The life of every living thing lies in his hand,

including the breath of each person.

11Doesn’t the ear test words

like the palate tastes food?

12Old people have wisdom;

long life brings insight. 		Job 12:7-12

13“He has wisdom and power;

counsel and insight lie in him.

14He tears down, and no one can rebuild;

he shuts people in, and nobody can release them.

15If he withholds water, things dry up;

if he sends it, the land floods.

16Strength and sound wisdom lie in him;

deceived and deceiver are under his control.

17He makes advisors walk barefoot

and makes fools out of judges.

18He takes off kings’ belts

and binds their waists with a rope.	Job 12:13-18

19He makes priests walk barefoot

and overthrows those who feel secure.

20He silences the ones that people trust

and takes away the discernment of elders.

21He pours contempt on nobles

and disarms the strong.

22He reveals what’s deep in the dark

and brings darkness into light.

23He makes nations great, then destroys them;

he enlarges nations, then lets them go into exile.

24He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people

and makes them wander in pathless desolation.

25They grope in the dark with no light;

he makes them stagger like drunks.		Job 12:19-25

13:1“I’ve seen that;

I’ve heard it and understand it.

2What you know, I know too;

I’m not more ignorant than you.	Job 13:1-2

3“But I’m willing to speak to the Almighty himself;

I want to argue with God.

4You men are smearing me with things that aren’t true;

you’re untrained doctors.

5Oh that you’d just be quiet

and show your wisdom that way!

6Hear me out;

listen to what I’m arguing.

7Will you lie to defend God?

Will you speak deceitfully on his behalf?

8Will you favor him by how you testify?

Will you argue his case for him?	Job 13:3-8

9How will you fare when he examines you?

Will you try to deceive him like you deceive people?

10He’ll rebuke you for sure

if you secretly skew your testimony to favor him.

11Doesn’t his majesty terrify you,

and the dread of him fall on you?

12Your memorable sayings are proverbs made of ashes,

defenses made of clay.		Job 13:9-12

13“Be quiet so I can talk;

then let come on me what may.

14Why should I bite my body

and take my life in my hands?

15Even if he kills me, I’ll trust him;

but I’ll still defend myself to him.

16That will also be to my salvation

because godless people can’t approach him.

17Listen carefully to what I’m saying;

let what I’m claiming fill your minds.

18I’ve prepared my case;

I know I’ll be acquitted.

19Will you defeat me in this argument?

If so, I’ll shut up and die.		Job 13:13-19

20“Just grant me two things, God;

then I can face you:

21don’t remove your hand from me

or let my dread of you terrify me.

22Then call and I’ll answer;

or let me speak, then reply to me.

23How many iniquities do I have?

Tell me what my rebellions are.

24Why do you hide from me

and treat me like your enemy?

25Do you make a driven leaf tremble

or chase dry chaff?

26You list bitter accusations against me

and charge me with sins from my youth.

27You put my feet in shackles

and hover over the path as I walk.

You set a boundary for where I could go

28while I was decaying like something rotten,

like a moth-eaten shirt.		Job 13:20-28

14:1“Mortals born of women

are short-lived and filled with turmoil.

2They come out and wither like a flower;

they pass away like a shadow and don’t last.

3You keep your eyes open at them

and bring them under your judgment.

4Who can make unclean into clean?

Nobody!

5Since their days are set,

you determine the number of their months

and set limits they can’t pass.

6Turn your gaze away so they can relax

and finish their day in peace like a hired hand.	Job 14: 1-6

7“There’s hope for a tree when it’s cut down

that it will sprout again and grow new branches.

8Though its roots grow old in the ground

and its stump dies in the dry soil,

9at the scent of water it revives

and puts out new sprouts like a plant.

10But people die and just lie there;

they expire; where are they?

11As water evaporates from the sea

and a river dries up,

12people lie down and don’t get up.

Until the sky ceases to be,

they don’t wake up.		Job 14:7-12

13“Oh that you’d hide me in Sheol,

that you’d conceal me till your anger’s over,

that you’d set a limit on it for me and remember me!

14Can the dead live again?

I’d have hope, then, all the days I struggle

till my release came.

15You’d call and I’d answer;

you’d look forward to what I’d do,

16because then you’d number my steps

instead of counting my sins.

17You’d seal up my sin in a bag

and wrap up my iniquity.		Job 14:13-17

18“Like a mountain crumbles and falls

and a rock slides from its place,

19like water erodes stone

and its torrents wash away soil,

so you destroy people’s hope.

20You overpower them and they pass away;

you disfigure them and send them off.

21If their offspring achieve honor, they don’t know it;

if they’re insignificant, they’re not aware of it.

22They feel only the pains in their own body

and mourn only for themselves.”	Job 14:18-22

15:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

2“Should you answer with empty talk

and fill yourself with the east wind?

3Should you argue with useless speech,

with words that do no good?

4You’re losing reverence for God

and hindering meditation in front of him.

5Your sin is telling you what you say,

and you’re choosing misleading language.

6You condemn yourself; I don’t;

you’re testifying against yourself.	Job 15:1-6

7“Were you the first person ever born?

Were you brought forth before the hills?

8Can you hear God’s secret counsel?

Do you think you’re the only one that’s wise?

9What do you know that we don’t know?

What do you understand that we don’t?

10There are gray-haired, aged men around here

that are older than your father.

11Are God’s consolations too small for you

or spoken too gently to you?	Job 15:7-11

12Why does your heart carry you away?

Why do your eyes flash

13that you turn against God,

and say such things?

14Can mortals be pure?

Who born of women can be good?

15God doesn’t even trust his angels absolutely

or regard the sky as perfectly pure.

16How much less someone disgusting and corrupt

that drinks sin like water!	Job 15:12-16

17“Listen, I’ll tell you something;

I’ll tell you what I’ve seen—

18what the wise have said,

and their ancestors haven’t kept to themselves,

19people the land was given to

and no foreigners passed through—

20the sinful writhe in pain their whole life;

the ruthless have a limited number of years.

21They hear terrifying sounds coming;

while they’re at peace, destroyers attack them.

22They don’t expect to come back from darkness;

they feel destined for the sword.

23They wander around asking for food;

they know darkness is on its way.	Job 15:17-23

24Distress and anguish terrify them

like a king preparing for battle,

25because they shake their fists at God

and defy the Almighty.

26They attack him with abandon,

with reinforced shields.

27They’re stout in face and thigh,

28but they’ll live in desolate towns,

in houses nobody wants to occupy,

homes destined for demolition.

29They won’t get rich, their wealth won’t last;

their grain won’t be so heavy it bends over.

30They won’t escape from darkness;

the hot sun will wither their roots;

the wind will blow away their blossoms.	Job 15:24-30

31They shouldn’t trust in emptiness and deceive themselves;

emptiness will be their payback.

32It will be paid in full before their time;

their palm fronds won’t turn green again.

33Their unripe grapes will fall from the vine;

their olive trees will lose their blossoms.

34The godless live in barren company;

fire consumes the tents of those who bribe.

35They conceive schemes and give birth to evil;

their mind prepares deceit.”	Job 15:31-35

16:1Job answered:

2“I’ve heard a lot of things like that;

you’re miserable comforters.

3Is there no end to windy words?

What’s your problem that you answer me like that?

4I could talk to you like you’re talking if I was in your place.

I could string out words and shake my head at you.

5Or, I could encourage you

so my comfort could lessen your pain.	Job 16:1-5

6“If I speak, it doesn’t take away my pain;

if I don’t speak, how much of it goes away?

7God has worn me out;

he’s taken away my family.

8He has made me skin and bones

and used it as a witness against me.

My haggard body shows in my gaunt face.

9His anger hunts me down and tears me up;

he gnashes his teeth at me;

my adversary glares at me.

10People gape at me with their mouth

and slap me on the cheek in their contempt;

they gang up on me.	 	Job 16:6-10

11God has handed me over to ungodly people

and thrown me away to sinners.

12I was at ease, but he tore me apart;

he grabbed me by the neck and dashed me to pieces.

13His arrows have pierced me all over;

he’s slashed open my kidneys without mercy

and poured out my gall on the ground.

14He’s broken me down time after time

and charged at me like a soldier.

15I sewed burlap on my skin

and laid my strength in the dust.

16My face is flushed from crying;

I have dark circles around my eyes

17although I haven’t been violent,

and my prayer is pure.	Job 16:11-17

18“Earth, don’t cover up my blood;

don’t let my outcry cease.

19Even now my witness is in heaven;

my Advocate is on high.

20My friends make fun of me;

I shed my tears to God.

21Oh that I could plead with him

like a person does with his friend!

22In a few years, I’ll go the way of no return.

17:1My spirit’s broken; my days are snuffed out;

people have already dug my grave.

2Mockers sit around

and taunt me to my face.		Job 16:18-17:2

3“God, sign a pledge for me;

who else will put up security for me?

4You’ve kept them from understanding;

so don’t let them triumph.

5They inform against their friends

to get a share of their property;

so let their children pass out from hunger.	Job 17:3-5

6“God has made me a byword among people;

I’m someone they spit at.

7My sight is blurry from grieving;

my neighbors look like shadows.

8Godly people are appalled at such a thing;

innocent people oppose the godless.

9The righteous hold onto their way;

the ones with clean hands grow stronger. 	Job 17:6-9

10“All of you, if you come again,

I still won’t find a wise man among you.

11My days are done;

my hopes are dashed;

my heart’s desires are gone.

12You friends claim night is day and say,

‘Light amounts to darkness.’

13If I look for the grave to be my house

and spread my couch in the darkness,

14if I say to the pit, ‘My mother,’

or ‘My sister,’

15where’s my hope?

Who even cares about my hope?

16It’ll go down to Sheol with me;

we’ll go down in the ground together.”	Job 17:10-16

18:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“How long will you stumble around for words?

Make some sense so we can talk.

3Why do you treat us like animals?

You think we’re stupid?

4Are you going to tear yourself to pieces in your anger?

Are we supposed to leave the world for fear of you?

Should ledge rocks quake out of place?

5“The light of the wicked goes out;

their flame stops giving light.

6Their tent is dark inside;

the lamp above them has gone out.

7Their long strides have shortened;

their schemes have tripped them up.		Job 18:1-7

8They get caught in a net by their feet

when they step on its mesh.

9A trap seizes them by the heel;

a snare snaps shut on them.

10A noose for them is hidden on the ground;

a trap lies on their path.

11Panic all around terrifies them

and nips at their heels.

12Their strength is famished;

disaster is ready to knock them down.

13Disease eats away at their skin;

their rigid limbs are the first signs of death.

14They’re torn from their secure tent

and taken to the king of terrors.

15Nothing of theirs stays in their tent;

sulfur rains on their houses.			Job 18:8-15

16Their roots have dried up below;

their branches break off above.

17The memory of them fades from the land;

they don’t have a name people keep in mind.

18They’ve been driven from light into darkness

and chased out of the world.

19They don’t have any offspring among their people,

no survivors where they used to live.

20People to the west are appalled at their fate;

those to the east are gripped with horror.

21Surely that’s the kind of house ungodly people have;

such is the place of those who don’t know God.” Job 18:16-21

19:1Job answered:

2“How long are you going to torment me

and shatter me with a barrage of words?

3You’ve insulted me ten times over;

aren’t you ashamed of treating me wrong?

4Even if I did make mistakes,

that’s on me.

5If you’re acting superior to me

and using my humiliation to argue against me,

6know that God is the One that’s put me in the wrong

and closed his net around me.	Job 19:1-6

7“I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I don’t get an answer;

I call for help, but justice doesn’t come.

8He has blocked my way so I can’t go on;

he’s darkened my path.

9He has stripped me of my honor

and taken off my crown.

10He has destroyed me on every side; I’m finished;

he’s uprooted my hope like a tree.

11He has flashed his anger at me

and considered me his enemy.

12His troops have come at me in force;

they’ve camped around my tent

and thrown siege works up against me.	Job 19:7-12

13“He has taken my brothers away from me;

my acquaintances are alienated.

14My relatives are gone;

my friends have forgotten me.

15The ones who live in my house

consider me a stranger;

I’m a foreigner to my maids.

16When I call to my servant, he doesn’t answer me;

I have to beg him.

17My breath is repulsive to my wife;

my own brothers detest me.

18Even kids despise me

and contradict me when I stand up.

19My associates abhor me;

the ones I love have turned against me.	Job 19:13-19

20I’m skin and bones;

my skin is sloughing off;

my teeth are coming loose.

21Show me some mercy, friends;

God’s hand has struck me.

22Do you have to harass me like he does?

Haven’t you chewed on me enough?	Job 19:20-22

23“Oh that my words were written down,

inscribed in a scroll!

24Oh that they were engraved permanently on a rock

with an iron chisel and inlaid with lead!

25I know my Redeemer’s alive,

and in the end he’ll stand on the earth.

26Even after my skin decays,

without my body I’ll see God.

27I’ll see him myself;

the thought of that overwhelms me.

28If you say, ‘Can we find a way to harass him?’

What pretext can we use for a case against him?’

29fear the sword

because wrath punishes with a sword;

you’ll find out there’s a judgment!”	Job 19:23-29

20:1Zophar the Naamathite answered:

2“My thoughts make me answer

because I’m in turmoil inside.

3I’ve listened to your insults,

and I’m answering from what I understand.

4Don’t you know from of old—

from the time God put people on earth—

5that the triumph of sinners is short-lived;

the joy of the godless is temporary.	Job 20:1-5

6Though they’re as tall as the sky,

though their heads are in the clouds,

7they’ll perish forever like their own feces;

people that saw them before will say, ‘Where’d they go?’

8They’ll fly away like a dream,

and nobody will find them;

they’ll vanish like a nightmare.

9People that saw them before won’t see them again;

their family won’t have them around anymore.

10Their offspring will have to give back

the wealth they’d confiscated

and beg from the poor

11They may have youthful health,

but it’ll lie down with them in the dust.	Job 20:6-11

12“Though evil is sweet in their mouth

and they hide it under their tongue,

13though they like the taste of it

and won’t spit it out,

14yet the food in their stomach will ferment

into the venom of asps.

15Though they swallow wealth, they’ll vomit it up;

God will purge it from their stomach.

16They’ll suck the poison of asps;

the viper’s tongue will slay them.

17They won’t admire the streams

that flow with honey and curds.

18They’ll lose everything they worked for and couldn’t swallow;

they won’t even enjoy the profits from their trading,

19because they’ve oppressed the poor

and seized houses they didn’t build.	Job 20:12-19

20“Since their greed is never satisfied,

they won’t keep anything they enjoy.

21There won’t be anything left for them to devour;

their prosperity won’t last.

22They’ll have so much stuff they can’t move;

the full force of their misery will stack up against them.

23While they’re filling their stomach,

God will be sending his fierce anger at them

and raining it on them.

24They may escape an iron weapon

only to have a bronze arrow point run them through.

25It’s thrust will come out of their back;

the glittering point will puncture their gall;

death-terrors will descend on them.	Job 20:20-25

26Their treasures are destined for total darkness;

unfanned flames will consume them;

whatever’s left in their tent will burn up.

27Sky will reveal their sin;

earth will condemn them.

28Others will carry off what’s in their house

at the time when God demonstrates his anger.

29That’s sinful people’s plight,

the inheritance God decrees for them.”	Job 20:26-29

21:1Job answered:

2“Listen carefully;

let this be your consolation.

3Bear with me;

after I’ve spoken, you can mock me.

4Am I just complaining about people?

Why shouldn’t I be impatient?

5Be appalled at the way I look;

put your hand over your mouth in shock.

6When I think about it,

I get scared and shaky.

7Why do bad people keep on living

and become so powerful?	Job 21:1-7

8Their descendants are secure in their presence;

their offspring are near them.

9They have safe houses,

and God’s not beating them with a rod.

10Their bulls breed without fail,

and their cows don’t miscarry.

11They let out their little ones like a flock

to skip around and play.

12They sing to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps

and celebrate with a flute.

13They’e prosperous their whole life

and go down to Sheol in peace.

14They tell God, ‘Get away!

We don’t want you telling us what to do.’

15‘Who is the Almighty that we should serve him anyway?’

‘What good would it do to pray?’

16They think they produce their own prosperity;

I won’t have anything to do with such thinking.	Job 21:8-16

17“Yet how often do sinful people’s lamps get put out,

does calamity fall on them,

does God measure out destruction in his anger,

18and they’re like straw in the wind,

like chaff in a storm?

19You say, ‘Well, God stores up their sins for their children.’

Let him pay it back to the parents so they know it’s happening.

20Let them experience their own destruction

and drink the Almighty’s wrath themselves.	Job 21:17-20

21What do they care about their families after they die,

when they can’t talk anymore?

22Can anybody teach God anything

since he judges even the most powerful?

23They die in full strength,

completely at ease and satisfied.

24Their bodies are healthy;

their bone marrow is moist,

25while others die in bitterness

without tasting anything good.

26They all lie down in the ground the same way

with maggots all over them.			Job 21:21-26

27“I know what you’re thinking about:

schemes for doing me wrong.

28You say, ‘Where’s the nobleman’s house?

Where are the tents sinners live in?’

29Haven’t you asked travelers?

Don’t you believe what they tell you?	Job 21:27-29

30Sinners are reserved for disaster,

to be led out into the fury when it comes.

31Who confronts them openly about their sins?

Who repays them for what they do?

32When they’re carried to their graves,

an honor guard keeps watch over their tombs.

33The soil in the valley gives them sweet repose;

a countless throng precedes and follows them,

paying their respects.

34Do you think you can comfort me with clichés?

Your explanations don’t make any sense.”	Job 21:30-34

22:1Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

2“What benefit can a mortal be to God?

Aren’t even the wise only useful to themselves?

3Is the Almighty delighted if you’re good?

What good is it to him if you’re perfect?

4Surely it’s not because you revere him that he’s reproving you,

that he’s bringing judgment against you.

5Isn’t it more likely that you’re sinful,

that your sins are endless?

6Maybe you’ve exacted pledges from your friends

and stripped off their clothes as security.

7Maybe you’ve withheld water from the fainting

and food from the hungry.

8Maybe you think the land belongs to the powerful,

that only you honorable types have a right to live in it.

9Maybe you’ve sent widows away with nothing

and crushed the fatherless.

10So, there are traps everywhere around you,

and panic overwhelms you.

11Your light’s so dim you can’t see,

and a flood is surging over you.	Job 22:1-11

12“Isn’t God high in the sky,

higher than the stars?

13But you say, ‘So how can he see what I’m doing?

Can he judge through such darkness?

14Dark clouds wrap around him so he can’t see;

he walks on the vaulted sky.’

15Will you stay on the ancient way

that sinful people have walked,

16people snatched away before their time,

whose foundations a river washed away?

17They tell God, ‘Get away!’

‘What good is the Almighty to us?’

18Yet he’s filled their houses with good things—

(but I stay away from sinners’ counsel).

19Good people are glad to see the wicked get destroyed;

the innocent laugh and say,

20‘Our adversaries are destroyed;

fire has consumed their wealth.’	Job 22:12-20

21“Submit to God; make peace with him,

and good things will happen to you.

22Accept his instruction;

take his words to heart.

23If you come back to the Almighty, he’ll restore you;

if you remove sinfulness far from your home,

24if you throw your gold in the dust,

the gold of Ophir among the stones in the wadis,

25then the Almighty will be your gold;

he’ll become your choice silver.

26Then you’ll delight in the Almighty

and look up at God.

27You’ll pray to him, and he’ll hear you;

and you’ll keep your vows.

28When you decide something, it’ll happen;

light will shine on your path.

29When people put you down, you’ll still be confident

because he saves the humble.

30He delivers innocent people;

so you’ll be delivered because you have clean hands.”

Job 22:21-30

23:1Job answered:

2“My complaint is still bitter;

God’s hand weighs heavily on me despite my groaning.

3If only I knew where to find him

so I could go to his courtroom!

4I’d present my case

and offer my arguments.

5I’d find out what he’d answer

and understand what he’d say.

6Would he oppose me with his great power?

No, he’d listen!

7Someone godly would be reasoning with him,

and my Judge would acquit me permanently.	Job 23:1-7

8“I go east, but he’s not there;

I go west, but I can’t find him.

9When he acts in the north, I can’t see it;

when he turns to the south, he’s hidden there too.

10But he knows where I’m going;

when he tests me, I’ll come out like pure gold.

11I’ve stayed close to his steps

and kept to his ways without turning aside.

12I haven’t veered off from his commands;

I’ve treasured up what he says more than food.

13But once he’s made up his mind, who can change it?

He’ll go ahead and do to me what he wants.

14He’ll do fulfill his plans;

he has intentions for my whole destiny.

15So I’m intimidated by him;

when I think about all this, it scares me.

16It’s God that’s made my heart faint,

the Almighty that’s terrified me.

17Yet the darkness doesn’t silence me

or the deep gloom that covers me.	Job 23:8-17

24:1“Why doesn’t the Almighty maintain

a regular court schedule for judging?

Why do those who know him wait for him in vain?

2Some remove landmarks,

seize flocks and eat them,

3drive away donkeys that belong to the fatherless,

take widows’ oxen for pledges.

4They run the needy off the road;

the poor people have to hide from them.

5Like wild donkeys in the desert,

the poor labor at foraging for food,

looking for prey in the wild to feed their children.

6They gather fodder in the field

and glean sinners’ vineyards.

7They spend the night without enough clothes

to protect them against the cold.

8They’re soaked from mountain rain

and huddle in the rocks for lack of shelter.	Job 24:1-8

9“Others snatch the fatherless from the breast

and take pledges against the poor.

10They make the naked go without clothes

and take away sheaves from the hungry.

11They press out oil between the olive rows

and tread winepresses for others yet suffer thirst.

12From the city, the people groan,

the wounded cry out for help,

but God ignores their prayers.	Job 24:9-12

13“Others rebel against the light;

they refuse to know its ways or stay on them.

14A murderer gets up at dawn

to kill the poor and needy;

at night he’s a thief.

15An adulterer waits for twilight and says,

‘Nobody will see me’;

he disguises himself.

16In the dark they break into houses

and sleep in the daytime;

they’re not accustomed to light.

17Morning is the same to them as dense darkness;

they’re allies with the terrors of deep gloom.	Job 24:13-17

18“But they’re swiftly carried away like foam on a creek;

their land is cursed;

they’re afraid to go in their own vineyards.

19Sheol consumes sinners

like drought and heat consume snow.

20Their mothers forget about them,

maggots feed on them till they’re not remembered;

they’re blown over like trees in a windstorm.

21They prey on barren and childless women

and fail to help needy widows.

22But God uses his power to drag away the rich;

they may get established,

but they have no guarantee of life

23He may let them live in security,

but he keeps an eye on their progress in life.

24They’re honored for a little while; then they’re gone;

they’re brought low and fade away like everything else,

cut off like heads of grain.

25If that’s not so, who can prove me wrong

and make my speech pointless?”	Job 24:18-25

25:1Bildad the Shuhite answered:

2“Dominion and awe belong to God,

who establishes order high in his sky.

3Who can count his troops?

Who doesn’t his light rise on?

4How can anyone be innocent in his presence?

How can anyone born of woman be pure?

5If the moon isn’t bright

and the stars aren’t pure to God,

6how much less people—like maggots,

and their offspring—mere worms.”	Job 25:1-6

26:1Job answered:

2“What a help you are to the weak!

How you’ve saved arms with no strength!

3What counsel you’ve given me in my stupidity!

What brilliant insight you’ve provided!

4Who’ve you been talking to?

Whose spirit has been speaking through you?!	Job 26:1-4

5“The departed spirits tremble

below the water and its inhabitants.

6Sheol is naked in front of him;

Abaddon has no covering before him.

7He stretches out the north over empty space

and hangs the earth on nothing.

8He wraps up water in his clouds,

and they don’t burst under its weight.

9He shrouds the full moon in clouds.

10He has set the horizon between the water above and below

and put a boundary between light and darkness.

11The mountains, pillars of the sky, tremble

and shudder at his rebuke.

12He calms the sea monster with his power

and breaks Rahab in pieces with his intelligence.

13He clears clouds from the sky with his breath

and wounds the celestial fleeing Serpent with his hand.

14These are just fringes of what he does:

his faint whisper!

his loud thunder!

Who can comprehend his power?”	Job 26:5-14

27:1Job continued his comments:

2“As God lives, who has taken away my rights,

the Almighty, who has made me bitter,

3as long as I’m alive and God’s breath is in me,

4I won’t speak wickedness or lie.

5I’ll never concede that you’re right;

I’ll defend my integrity till I die.

6I’ll hold onto my claim about my goodness,

and my conscience won’t accuse me for it.	Job 27:1-6

7“May my enemies be like the wicked;

may my attackers be like the sinful.

8What hope do the godless have when God cuts them off,

when he takes their life away?

9Will he listen to their outcry

when they get in trouble?

10Will they be able to delight in the Almighty

and call on him at any time?

11Let me teach you about God’s power;

I won’t conceal anything about the Almighty.

12You’ve all seen that;

so why are you saying such foolish things to me? Job 27:7-12

13“This is sinful people’s lot from God,

the fate tyrants receive from the Almighty:

14their many sons he destines for the sword;

their descendants won’t have enough to eat;

15disease buries the ones that outlive them;

their widows won’t feel like crying.

16Though sinners pile up silver like dust

and make clothes as plentiful as clay,

17the good are the ones that will wear them;

the innocent will divide up their silver.

18The house they build is as fragile as a spider’s web

or a watchman’s hut.

19They go to bed rich, but only once;

when they open their eyes, their wealth is gone.

20Panic overwhelms them like a flood;

a tornado carries them off at night.

21The east wind picks them up

and sweeps them away;

22it whirls around them without sparing

though they try to escape its power.

23People will clap their hands and jeer at them.	Job 27:13-23

28:1“There’s a mine for silver

and a refinery for gold.

2Iron comes out of the ground,

and people can smelt copper.

3They use a torch in the darkness

and go in as far they can,

searching for the ore in gloom and deep shadow.

4They sink mine shafts far from where people live

and go down them, dangling on ropes,

swinging back and forth.

5People grow food on top of the ground;

but far below, the ground melts as if by fire.	Job 28:1-5

6Its rocks yield lapis lazuli,

whose flecks glitter like gold.

7Birds of prey can’t get to it;

no falcon has seen it.

8Proud animals don’t set foot in it;

fierce lions don’t prowl there.

9Miners find flint

and tear down mountains to get at it.

10They chisel out tunnels in the rock

to discover precious stones.

11They dam up trickling streams

and bring hidden treasure out to light.	Job 28:6-11

12“But where can people discover wisdom?

Where is intelligence located?

13People don’t know what it’s worth;

they can’t find it where people live.

14The deep says, ‘It’s not here’;

the sea says, ‘It’s not inside me.’

15Pure gold doesn’t exchange for it;

silver doesn’t weigh out equal to its price.

16Its value can’t be calculated in the gold from Ophir,

in precious onyx or lapis lazuli.	Job 28:12-16

17Gold or crystal can’t match it;

it can’t be traded for articles made from fine gold.

18Coral and crystal can’t be mentioned with it;

acquiring wisdom is more important than buying pearls.

19The topaz in Nubia can’t compare to it;

it can’t be measured in terms of pure gold.

20Where then does wisdom come from?

Where’s it located?

21Nothing alive can see it;

it’s hid from the birds in the sky.

22Abaddon and Death say,

‘We haven’t heard any report about it.’	Job 28:17-22

23“God knows where it is

and understands how to get to it.

24He can see all the way to the end of the earth

and everything that’s under the sky.

25When he decided how hard the wind should blow

and how much rain should fall,

26when he decreed the way rain should form

and the course a thunderbolt should follow,

27then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;

he put it in place and tested it.

28He told humanity, ‘Respecting the Lord shows wisdom;

getting away from sin brings insight.’”	Job 28:23-28

29:1Job took up his discourse again:

2“Oh that I could be like I was just a few months ago

when God was watching over me,

3when his lamp shined above my head

and I walked through darkness by his light,

4while I was in the prime of life

and his friendship hovered above my tent,

5when the Almighty was still with me

and my children were around me,

6when my feet were drenched with cream

and the millstone poured out streams of olive oil for me!

7when I went to the city gate

and took my seat in the town square.	Job 29:1-7

8Young men saw me and stepped aside,

old men stood up,

9officials stopped talking

and put their hands over their mouths;

10nobles’ voices got quiet

and put their tongues against their palates.

11When people heard me, they praised me;

when they saw me, they spoke well of me

12because I helped the poor that asked for it

and the orphan that had no advocate.

13People about to die blessed me;

I made widows sing for joy.

14I dressed in goodness;

justice covered me like a robe and turban.	Job 29:8-14

15I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.

16I became a father to the needy

and helped strangers I didn’t know.

17I broke the jaws of the wicked

and snatched the prey from their teeth.

18Then I supposed, ‘I’ll die in my nest

and multiply my days like sand.

19My roots reach out to the water;

dew lies all night on my branches.

20My honor is always fresh;

my bow stays new in my hand.’	Job 29:15-20

21“They listened to me, waited,

and kept quiet to hear my advice.

22When I spoke, they had nothing to add;

what I said was sufficient for them.

23They waited for me like spring rain

and drank in my words like fresh showers.

24I smiled at them when they weren’t sure what to do;

they valued my approval.

25I told them what course of action to take

and sat as their chief;

I lived like a king among his troops,

like somebody that comforted mourners.	Job 29:21-25

30:1“But now people younger than me make fun of me,

people whose fathers I wouldn’t let

run with my sheep dogs.

2What good was their strength to me,

fellows whose vigor was gone?

3They were haggard from hunger and want

and clawed the dry ground in the wastelands.

4They picked wild greens from among the bushes

and ate the roots of broom shrubs.

5People drove them away;

they shouted at them like they were thieves.

6So they lived in ravines, caves, and rocks;

7they sounded like animals in the bushes

and huddled together under the nettles.

8A senseless, unnamed bunch,

they were outcasts from society.	Job 30:1-8

9“Now their sons mock me with songs

and use my name as a byword.

10They’re appalled at me and shrink back;

they don’t hesitate to spit in my face.

11Because God has removed my bowstring and cast me down,

people don’t hesitate to argue with me.

12This rabble opposes me,

drives me out, lays traps for me.

13They tear up my road and profit from my misfortune;

nobody restrains them.

14They come at me as if through a wide breach;

they roll in like a storm.

15They terrorize me

and chase my honor like the wind;

my prosperity dissipates like a cloud.	Job 30:9-15

16“My life ebbs out of me;

depression has taken hold of me.

17At night my bones ache,

and soreness gnaws at me.

18My clothes are tattered from violence;

they hang on me like a coat.	Job 30:16-18

19“You’ve thrown me in the mud;

you’ve made me like dust and ashes.

20I call out to you, but you don’t answer;

I stand up, but you turn your attention elsewhere.

21You’ve become cruel

and use your power to persecute.

22You pick me up and blow me around in the wind;

you destroy me in the storm.

23I know you’re going to bring me to death,

the destiny of all the living. 			Job 30:19-23

24“Don’t people in a pile of ruins hold out their hands

and in their misery call out for help?

25Haven’t I cried for people whose life is hard?

Wasn’t I grieved for the needy?

26When I expected good, evil came;

when I needed light, darkness arrived.

27I’m in turmoil inside; I can’t relax;

days of misery lie ahead of me.

28I go around mourning without comfort;

I stand up in the assembly and call out for help.

29I’ve become a brother to jackals,

a companion of owls.

30My skin is ashen,

and I’m burning up with fever.

31My harp plays music for mourning;

my flute moans with those who weep.	Job 30:24-31

31:1“I’ve made a covenant with my eyes

not to look with lust at a young woman?

2What is our portion from God above,

our inheritance from the Almighty on high?

3Isn’t it misfortune for the unjust,

disaster for sinners?

4Doesn’t he see everything I do

and count every step I take?

5“If I’ve supposedly conducted myself falsely

and tried to deceive,

6let him weigh me with accurate scales

and he’ll find out my integrity.

7If I’ve strayed off the road,

if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen,

if any other blemish has stuck to me,

8let somebody else eat what I sow;

let them uproot my crops.	Job 31:1-8

9“If a woman enticed me,

if I’ve lurked at my neighbor’s doorway,

10may my wife grind for somebody else,

and let others sleep with her.

11That would be shameful,

a crime judges would punish.

12a fire that would consume all the way to Abaddon

and completely burn up everything I own.	Job 31:9-12

13“If I’ve denied claim by my male or female servants,

complaints they filed against me,

14how could I face God?

What could I say when he questioned me?

15Didn’t the One that made me in the womb make the accuser too?

Didn’t the same One make us both?	Job 31:13-15

16“If I’ve withheld from the poor what they needed

or stifled widows’ hopes,

17if I’ve eaten my morsel alone

and a fatherless child hadn’t shared it

(18from my youth I reared him like a father,

and from infancy I guided her),

19if I’ve seen anybody perish for lack of clothing

or the needy go without clothes,

20if their loins haven’t thanked me

and been warmed with wool from my sheep,

21if I’ve mistreated the fatherless

because I knew the courts would support me—

22pull my shoulder out of its socket

and break off my arm at the elbow,

23because calamity from God scares me,

because I can’t resist his majesty. 		Job 31:16-23

24“If I’ve put confidence in gold

and called fine gold my trust,

25if I’ve gloated because I was wealthy

and had secured so much,

26if I’ve looked at the shining sun

or the moon moving in splendor,

27and became secretly enticed

and threw it a kiss—

28that too would’ve been a sin the judges punish,

because I’d have been disloyal to God above. Job 31:24-28

29“Have I celebrated my enemy’s ruin

or been happy when disaster fell on him?

30No, I haven’t let my mouth sin

by asking for his life in a curse.

31“Haven’t the ones in my tent said

there’s no one he’s let go hungry?

32No foreigner has had to lodge outside;

I’ve opened my doors to travelers. 	Job 31:29-32

33“Have I covered up my sins like people do

by hiding my iniquity in my heart,

34because I was afraid of the big crowd

and the contempt of families terrified me,

so I kept quiet and didn’t go outside?

35Oh that somebody would listen!

Here’s my signature on my defense;

let the Almighty answer me!

Oh that my adversary would write out my indictment;

36I’d carry it openly on my shoulder

or wear it proudly like a crown.

37I’d declare to God every step I’d taken

and approach him confidently like a prince.	Job 31:33-37

38“If my land cries out against me

and my furrows are all wet with tears,

39if I’ve eaten more than my share of the crops

or broken the spirit of its tenants—

40let briars grow on my land instead of wheat,

stinkweeds in place of barley.”

Job’s words end here.	Job 31:38-40

32:1The three men stopped replying to Job, because he was certain he was innocent. 2Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram, was mad at Job because he’d justified himself to God. 3He was mad at his three friends because they couldn’t answer Job but still condemned him. 4Elihu had waited to speak because they were years older than he was. 5When he saw they didn’t provide an answer, his anger burned inside him. 6So he spoke up:

“I’m young and you’re old;

so I’ve been reluctant to tell you what I believed.

7I thought age should speak

because wisdom should come with age.

8But it’s the spirit in a person

and the breath of the Almighty that give insight.

9Abundant years may not bring wisdom;

elders may not understand what’s just.

10So listen and I’ll say what I think too.		Job 32:1-10

11“I waited for your words;

I listened to your reasoning

while you thought about what to say.

12I paid careful attention;

none of you refuted Job

or answered his arguments.

13Don’t say, ‘We’ve found him too wise for us;

God alone will have to refute him, not mortals.’

14Job hasn’t been arguing with me;

but I wouldn’t have answered him with your arguments.

Job 32:11-14

15“You’re discredited;

you don’t have anything else to say.

16Should I keep waiting

when you’re not speaking anymore?

17I’ll give my answer too

and express my opinion.

18I have so many things I want to say;

my spirit constrains me to speak.

19My stomach is like an unvented wine cask;

it’s about to burst like a new wineskin.

20I have to say something so I can get relief;

let me answer.

21I won’t show partiality to anybody

or flatter anyone.

22I don’t know how to flatter;

otherwise, my Maker would put an end to me.” 	Job 32:15-22

33:1“But now, Job, listen to what I have to say;

hear me out.

2I’m opening my mouth now;

the tongue in my mouth is speaking.

3What I’m saying expresses my uprightness;

my lips declare knowledge sincerely.

4The Spirit of God has made me;

the breath of the Almighty gives me breath.

5Answer me if you can;

state your case; take your stand.

6I belong to God like you do;

I’ve been formed out of clay too.

7I shouldn’t be a threat to you;

I won’t come down hard on you.	Job 33:1-7

8“You’ve spoken where I could hear you;

I’ve heard what you said:

9‘I’m pure, without sin,

innocent, not guilty of anything.

10He invents pretexts against me

and considers me his enemy.

11He puts my feet in stocks

and watches my paths.’	Job 33:8-11

12“Let me tell you, you’re not right in this,

because God is greater than you are.

13Why do you complain

that he won’t account for everything he does?

14God speaks in one way, maybe two;

though people don’t notice it—

15in a dream, in a vision at night,

when people are sound asleep in bed.

16Then he opens their ears and warns them,

17so he can turn them aside from doing wrong

and keep them from their pride.

18He holds them back from the Pit

and their lives from death by the sword.		Job 33:12-18

19“God disciplines people with pain on their beds,

with constant aching in their bones;

20so they lose their appetites

and even their favorite food disgusts them.

21Their bodies waste away,

and their bones show.

22Then they draw near the Pit;

they come close to the angels that bring death.	Job 33:19-22

23“If there’s an angel to mediate for some people—

one out of a thousand—

to say what’s right about them,

24then let him be gracious to them and say,

‘Deliver them from the Pit;

I’ve found a ransom for these lives.’

25Let their bodies become fresh with youth

and return to their youthful vigor.

26Then they’ll pray to God, and he’ll accept them

so they can see his face with joy

and restore their good standing.

27They’ll sing to other people and say,

‘I sinned and perverted what’s right,

but he didn’t hold it against me.

28He’s rescued me from the Pit,

and I’ll see the light.’	Job 33:23-28

29“God does these things more than once for people;

30he brings them back from the Pit

so they can see the light of life.

31Pay attention, Job; listen;

keep quiet and let me talk.

32Then if you have anything to say, you can answer me,

because I want to see you justified.

33If not, listen, and I’ll teach you wisdom.”		Job 33:29-33

34:1Elihu continued:

2“Listen, you wise men;

pay attention, you that ‘know’;

3the ear tests words

like the palate tastes food.

4Let’s choose what’s right;

let’s determine for ourselves what’s good;

5because Job has said, ‘I’m good,

but God has disregarded my goodness.

6Should I lie about my goodness?

I have a wound that won’t heal,

but I haven’t done anything wrong.’

7Who is like Job

that drinks scorn like water,

8that pals around with sinners,

that associates with bad people—

9because he said, ‘What good does it do

to try to please God’?	Job 34:1-9

10“So, listen, you that ‘understand.’

God would not sin;

the Almighty would never do what’s wrong.

11He pays everyone according to what they’ve done

and treats them the way their living deserves.

12God doesn’t act wickedly;

the Almighty won’t pervert justice.

13Who gave him authority over the earth?

Who laid the whole world on him?

14If he’d take back his spirit,

if he’d gather his breath to himself,

15everybody would die;

mortals would return to dust.	Job 34:10-15

16“But if you understand,

listen to what I’m saying.

17Would God be ruling if he hated justice?

Will you condemn someone great that’s good,

18who tells kings, ‘You’re worthless,’

or nobles, ‘You’re corrupt,’

19who doesn’t show deference to officials

or care more about the rich than the poor?

They’re all God’s work.

20They die quickly;

at midnight they shudder and pass away;

the powerful are taken away without human hand. Job 34:16-20

21“He watches what people do;

he sees their every step.

22There’s no darkness or deep shadow

where sinners can hide.

23He doesn’t have to investigate anyone

and bring them in to find out what they’ve done.

24He brings the mighty to ruin without an investigation

and replaces them with others.

25He knows what they’ve done;

he overthrows them at night and destroys them.	Job 34:21-25

26He strikes them down openly for their sinfulness

27because they’ve turned aside from following him

and don’t care about his ways;

28they’ve made the poor cry out to him,

so he hears the call of the oppressed—

29if he does keep quiet, who can condemn him?

when he hides, who can see him,

whether individual or nation?—

30so the godless won’t rule

or become a snare to other people.	Job 34:26-30

31“Has anybody told God,

‘I’ve been disciplined; I won’t offend anymore’;

32or, ‘Show me what I didn’t notice;

if I’ve sinned, I won’t do it again’?

33Will God punish in a way that suits you

when you’re the one that rejected him?

You have to make the choice, not me;

say what you know.

34People with insight say to me—

the wise, who listen to me—

35‘Job doesn’t know what he’s talking about;

his words don’t make sense.

36He deserves the maximum penalty

because of the sinful way he answers.

37He’s adding rebellion to his sins;

he scornfully claps his hands at us

and multiplies his words against God.’”	Job 34:31-37

35:1Elihu continued:

2“Do you think it’s righteous

for you to say you’re upright before God?

3You say, ‘What advantage will I have?

What benefit will I get more than if I’d sinned?’

4I’ll answer you and your friends.

5Look at the sky;

the clouds are higher than you are.

6If you’ve sinned, what do you gain against God?

if you have lots of sins, what harm are you doing to him?

7If you’re good, what good are you doing for him?

What good does he get out of you?

8Your goodness is for other people like you.	Job 35:1-8

9“They cry out because they’re oppressed;

they call for help against powerful people.

10But nobody says, ‘Where’s God my Maker,

who gives songs at night,

11who teaches us more than the animals on the ground

and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’

12There bad people call out, but he doesn’t answer

because they’re arrogant.

13Indeed, God will ignore empty cries;

the Almighty doesn’t pay any attention to them.

14How much less when you say you don’t see him;

he has your case,

but you’re having to wait for him to give notice!

15Now, since he hasn’t visited in his anger

and acknowledged sin enough,

16you open your mouth with empty talk, Job,

not knowing what you’re talking about.” 	Job 35:9-16

36:1Elihu continued:

2“Bear with me a little longer, and I’ll show you

what I have to say on God’s behalf.

3I’ll bring my knowledge from afar

and credit goodness to my Maker.

4What I’m saying is true;

I know perfectly well what I’m talking about.

5God is powerful, but he doesn’t despise anybody;

he’s mighty in his power to understand.

6He doesn’t keep sinners alive,

but gives justice to the oppressed.

7He doesn’t take his eyes off of good people,

but enthrones them with kings

and exalts them permanently.

8If they’re bound in chains

and held tight in a web of difficulties,

9he tells them the reason:

it’s because they’ve acted arrogantly.

10He opens their ears to instruction

and commands them to turn away from sin. 	Job 36:1-10

11If they listen and serve him,

they’ll end their days in prosperity,

their years in pleasantness.

12But if they ignore him,

they’ll perish by the sword and die ignorant.

13But the godless in heart store up anger;

they don’t call out for help when he restrains them.

14They die young;

their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.

15He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions

and opens their ears with adversity. 		Job 36:11-15

16So he’s luring you with distress

into a safe space that’s not crowded

and has set delicious food on your table.

17“But you’ve become obsessed with condemning sinners,

obsessed with judgment and justice.

18Be careful that anger doesn’t lure you into scoffing;

don’t let the great cost of the ransom turn you aside.

19Will your wealth or strength

keep you away from troubles?

20Don’t long for the cover of night

when people disappear unnoticed.

21Make sure not to turn to evil,

which you’ve preferred to affliction.

22God is honored by his power;

who can teach like him?

23Who has prescribed his conduct

or said, ‘You’ve done something wrong’?	Job 36:16-23

24“Remember to extol his work

that people sing about.

25Everybody has seen it;

they can look at it from a long way off.

26God is so great we don’t understand him;

we can’t find out how old he is.

27He evaporates water drops

and distills his mist into rain,

28which the clouds

pour down on people abundantly.	Job 36:24-28

29Can anyone understand how clouds spread out

or how thunder claps in his pavilion?

30He spreads out lightning all around him

and covers the depths of the ocean.

31They’re how he governs nations

and supplies food abundantly.

32He fills his hands with lightning bolts

and hurls them at their marks.

33Thunder announces his presence

and warns livestock that a storm is coming.	Job 36:29-33

37:1“My heart pounds when I think about this;

it feels like it’s out of place.

2Listen closely to his thundering,

the rumbling that comes from his mouth.

3He unleashes his lightning under the whole sky;

it travels to the horizon in every direction.

4After it his roars;

he thunders with his majestic voice

and doesn’t hold anything back.

5God thunders wondrously

and does extraordinary things we can’t comprehend.

6He tells the snow to fall on the ground

and the rain to be heavy.

7He stops everyone’s labor

so they can watch his work.	Job 37:1-7

8Animals head for their dens

and stay in their lairs.

9The stormy wind comes from its rooms,

and the driving winds bring the cold.

10God’s breath makes ice,

and the wide expanse of water freezes.

11He loads up dark clouds with moisture;

they disperse his lightning flashes.

12They change direction by his guidance;

they do whatever he commands across the world.

13He makes these things happen either to punish his people

or to water the earth and show his love.	Job 37:8-13

14“Listen, Job,

stop and think about God’s wondrous works.

15Do you know how he controls the clouds

or makes lightning flash in them?

16Can you explain the layers of dark clouds,

the wonders of One that knows everything,

17you whose clothes are hot

because the south wind isn’t blowing?

18Can you spread out the sky like he does,

as hard as a bronze mirror?

19Teach us what to say to him;

we can’t draw up our case without your help!

20Should somebody let him know I want to speak?

Does anyone ever want to be destroyed?

21“We can’t look at the bright light in the sky

after the wind has cleared it.

22Golden splendor comes from the north;

awesome majesty surrounds God.

23We can’t imagine how extremely powerful the Almighty is;

yet he doesn’t violate justice and abundant goodness.

24So people everywhere revere him

because he doesn’t value people that are wise in their own conceit.”

Job 37:14-24

38:1God answered Job out of the whirlwind:

2“Who is this that confuses my counsel

with ignorant words?

3Gird up* like a man;

I’ll ask you some questions, and you answer me.

4Where were you when I laid the foundation for the earth?

Tell me if you have any idea.

5Who specified its measurements

or stretched out a line on it?

Surely you know!

6What did its pylons rest on?

Who laid its cornerstone

7when the morning stars sang together

and all God’s angels shouted for joy?	Job 38:1-7

8“Who shut the ocean in boundaries,

when it came bursting out of the womb,

9when I clothed it with clouds

and swaddled it with deep darkness,

10when I set its boundaries,

bolted its doors,

11and said, ‘You can’t go beyond this point;

here’s where your proud waves stop’?	Job 38:8-11

12“Have you ever commanded the morning

and made dawn happen

13so it can spread to the ends of the earth

and bring to an end night’s evil?

14The earth is stamped like clay under a seal;

its features stand out like folds in a robe.

15Light is withheld from sinners,

and their uplifted arm is broken.	Job 38:12-15

16“Have you traveled to the springs of the ocean

or walked in the recesses of the deep?

17Have the gates of death been revealed to you;

have you seen the doors into deep darkness?

18Do you have any idea how big the earth is?

Tell me if you know that.	Job 38:16-18

19“Where’s the road to where light lives?

Where’s the place for darkness,

20so you can take it to its territory

and make out the paths to its home?

21You know because you were born there, right!

and you’ve lived so long!

22Have you entered the storehouses for snow

or seen where I keep the hail

23I reserve for troubled times,

for the time of war and battle?

24Where’s the road to the source of light

or where the east wind scatters over the earth?	Job 38:19-24

25“Who carved a channel for the flood

or laid out the course of a thunderbolt

26to bring rain on land with no people—

on a vacant desert—

27to satisfy desolate land

and make grass sprout?

28Does rain have a father?

Who has begotten the drops of dew?

29Whose womb did ice come out of?

Who gave birth to frost from the sky?

30Water gets as hard as rock;

its surface freezes over and imprisons the deep. 	Job 38:25-30

31“Can you tie up the chains of the Pleiades

or untie the cords of Orion?

32Can you lead out the signs of the Zodiac in their seasons

and guide the Bear with her cubs?

33Do you know the laws of the sky

or manage the earth with them?

34“Can you shout to the clouds

to get enough water to cover you?

35Do you send out lightning bolts on their way?

Do they report to you, ‘We’re here’?	Job 38:31-35

36“Who endowed the heart with wisdom

or gave intelligence to the mind?

37Who can count the clouds

or tip over the water jars in the sky

38when dust hardens into clumps

and forms clods?	Job 38:36-38

39“Can you stalk prey for a lion

or satisfy the appetite of young lions

40when they crouch in their dens

and lie in wait in their lairs?

41Who fixes feed for the ravens

when their young call out to God

and wander around with nothing to eat?	Job 38:39-41

39:1“Do you know when mountain goats give birth?

Do you ever see a deer calving?

2Can you count the months of their gestation

or learn when they have their fawns?

3They crouch down to deliver their young.

4Their offspring grow strong out in the open;

they leave home and never return.	Job 39:1-4

5“Who turned the wild donkey loose?

Who untied its ropes?

6I gave it the open country for a home,

desert land to live in?

7It scorns city turmoil

and doesn’t have to listen to a driver shout at it.

8It roams the mountains for pasture,

looking for anything green.	Job 39:5-8

9“Will a wild ox consent to serve you

and spend the night at your manger?

10Can you harness it to plow in a furrow?

Will it harrow your fields?

11Will you depend on it because it’s strong

and leave your work for it to do?

12Will you trust it to bring your grain home

and deliver it to your threshing floor?	Job 39:9-12

13“The ostrich’s wings flap happily,

but they don’t compare

with the wings and feathers of a stork.

14She abandons her eggs in the ground

to stay warm in the sand.

15She forgets that a foot may crush them

or a wild ox may tramp on them.

16She’s harsh toward her young as if they weren’t hers;

though her work may be pointless, she doesn’t care,

17because God hasn’t made her wise

or given her intelligence.

18When she jumps up to run,

she laughs at a horse and its rider.	Job 39:13-18

19“Do you give a horse its strength

or cover its neck with a mane?

20Can you make it leap like a locust?

Its majestic snorting is terrifying!

21It paws in the valley and frolics in its strength

and charges out to battle.

22It mocks fear and

doesn’t shy away from the sword.

23The quiver rattles against it,

the flashing spear and javelin too.

24It doesn’t stand still when the bugle signals;

with trembling rage, it races over the ground.

25As often as the bugle blows, it says, ‘Aha!’

It smells a battle a long way off,

the captain’s thundering, and the battle cry.	Job 39:19-25

26“Does a hawk soar because you’re so smart

as it stretches its wings toward the south?

27Does an eagle mount up at your command

and build its nest up high?

28It lives and lodges on the cliffs,

in inaccessible places on the rocky crag.

29From there it spies out prey

that it can see from far away.

30Even its young gulp down blood;

they’re right there when the kill goes down.	Job 39:26-30

40:1The LORD said to Job,

2“Will a faultfinder spar with the Almighty?

Let the one that argues with God answer that.”

3Job said,

4“I’m insignificant; what kind of answer can I give?

I’ve put my hand over my mouth.

5I’ve spoken once or twice; that’s enough;

I don’t have anything else to say.”	Job 40:1-5

6The LORD answered him out of the storm:

7“Gird up* like a man;

I’ll ask you some questions, and you answer me.

8Will you really try to discredit me to justify yourself?

9Do you have an arm like mine?

Can you thunder like me?  	Job 40:6-9

10“Go ahead and put on eminence and dignity;

dress yourself with honor and majesty.

11Pour out your overflowing anger;

look at everybody that’s proud and humble them.

12Look down on everybody that’s arrogant;

walk on sinners where they stand.

13Bury them in the dust together;

imprison them in the hidden place.

14Then I’ll acknowledge to you

that your own right hand can save you.	Job 40:10-14

15“Look at Behemoth, which I made as well as I did you;

it eats grass like an ox.

16It has strong loins

and powerful muscles in its stomach.

17It swings its tail like a cedar beam;

the sinews in its thighs intertwine.

18Its bones are like bronze tubes;

its limbs, like iron bars.	Job 40:15-18

19It’s a prime example of my what I’ve created;

only the One that made it need bring his sword!

20The mountains produce its food,

where wild animals play.

21It lies down under the lotus plants

and hides among the reeds in the marsh.

22The lotus plants give it shade;

the willows by the stream surround it.

23It doesn’t care if the river rages

or worry if the Jordan rushes at its mouth.

24Can anyone capture it when it’s awake?

Can anybody trap it and put a ring in its nose?	Job 40:19-24

41:1“Can you pull Leviathan in on a fishhook

or muzzle it with a noose?

2Can you tie it up with a rope in its nose

or pierce its jaw with a hook?

3Will it beg you for mercy

or speak to you softly?

4Will it agree to work for you

like a slave for life?

5Will you make a pet out of it like a bird

or put it on a leash for your little girls?

6Will traders bid on it

or divide it up among the merchants’ shops?

7Can you hurt its hide with harpoons

or its head with fishing spears?	Job 41:1-7

8Put your hands on it, and you’ll remember the fight!

You won’t do that again!

9Anything you try to do with it is useless;

the very sight of it is overpowering.

10Nobody is fierce enough to dare to disturb it;

who then can stand against me?

11Who has given to me that I should repay?

Whatever’s under the sky is already mine. 	Job 41:8-11

12“I won’t fail to mention its limbs,

its great strength or graceful frame.

13Who can strip off its outer armor

or penetrate its double coat of mail?

14Who can pry its jaws open?

Its teeth are terrifying!

15It’s proud of its hard scales

that fit together like a seal,

16one so close to the other

that air can’t get between them.

17They interlock with one another

and can’t be separated.

18When it sneezes, it flashes out light;

its eyes are red like the rays of dawn.	Job 41:12-18

19Burning torches blaze out of its mouth;

sparks fly from it.

20Smoke pours out of its nostrils

as from a boiling pot or burning reeds.

21Flames burst out of its mouth;

its breath lights coals.

22It has a strong neck

that strikes panic wherever goes.

23The folds of its flesh fit tightly together,

firm and unmovable.

24Its heart is as hard as rock,

like a lower millstone.

25When it stands up, mighty men scramble

and retreat at its thrashing.

26No sword can hurt it;

neither can a spear, dart, or javelin.	Job 41:19-26

27They glance off like straws;

it deflects bronze weapons like rotten sticks.

28Arrows can’t chase it away;

sling stones amount to wads of sod.

29Clubs do no more harm to it than stubble;

it laughs at rattling javelins.

30Sharp scales like potsherds cover its underbelly;

it leaves grooves in the dirt like a threshing sledge.

31It makes deep water roil like a boiling pot;

it stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.

32The water in its wake foams behind it;

you’d think the deep had gray hair.

33There’s nothing like it on earth;

it’s not afraid of anything.

34It stares down at everything tall;

it’s king over everything arrogant.”	Job 41:27-34

42:1Job answered the LORD:

2“I know you can do anything

and nobody can thwart what you do.

3You asked, ‘Who is this that darkens my counsel with ignorance?’

So I admit I don’t understand;

these things are too awesome for me to look into.

4You said, ‘Listen; I’ll talk;

I’ll ask; you instruct me.’

5I’d only heard about you before,

but now I see you.

6So I take back what I’ve said

and repent in dust and ashes.”	Job 42:1-6

7After the LORD addressed Job, he told Eliphaz the Temanite,

“I’m aggravated with you and your two friends because you haven’t said about me what’s right like Job has. 8So take 7 bulls and 7 rams to him and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. He’ll pray for you, and I’ll accept him so I won’t do to you what you deserve, because you haven’t said about me what’s right like he has.”

9Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what the LORD said, and he accepted Job.    	Job 42:7-9

10When Job prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and doubled what he had before. 11Then his brothers, sisters, and acquaintances that knew him before, came to eat with him in his house. They consoled him for the misfortunes the LORD had let come on him. Each one gave him one piece of money and a gold ring. 12The LORD blessed Job’s later life more than its beginning. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. 13He had 7 sons and 3 daughters. 14He named the firstf Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 15In the whole land there weren’t any women as beautiful as his daughters. Their father gave them an inheritance alongside their brothers. 16After that, Job lived 140 years and saw his grandsons and great-grandsons, four generations. 17He died an old man that had lived a full life. 	  Job 42:10-17

THE PSALMS

BOOK 1

Psalm 1

1People are blessed that don’t

take advice from the wicked

or stand among sinners

or sit with scoffers,

2but delight in the Law of the LORD

and meditate on it day and night.

3They’re like trees planted beside a river

that bear fruit in season,

whose leaves don’t wither.

They’re successful at what they do.

4Sinners aren’t like that:

they’re like chaff that wind blows away;

5they won’t withstand judgment

or stand among the godly.

6The LORD watches over the godly,

but the wicked perish.		Ps 1:1-6

Psalm 2

1Why do the nations get together

to plot pointless schemes?

2Kings take their stand

and rulers hold counsel

against the LORD and his Anointed One [Messiah]:

3“Let’s break their bonds

and throw them away.”

4The One that’s in heaven laughs;

the LORD scoffs at them.

5He’ll speak to them in his anger

and terrify them with his fury:

6“I’ve installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain.”	Ps 2:1-6

7“I’ll tell the LORD’s decree:

‘You’re my Son;

I’ve inaugurated you today.

8Just ask me, and I’ll give you the nations to inherit,

the most distant lands to possess.

9You’ll rule them with an iron scepter

and shatter them like clay pots.’”

10So, kings, be wise;

rulers, be warned.

11Serve the LORD with reverence;

celebrate with trembling.

12Kiss the Son so he won’t be angry

and you perish along the way;

his anger is easily sparked.

They’re so fortunate who take refuge in him!		Ps 2:7-12

Psalm 3

A Psalm of David When He Fled from His Son Absalom

1LORD, I have so many enemies;

so many are working against me;

2so many are saying,

“God’s not going to help him.”		Ps 3:1-2

3But you’re my shield, LORD, my glory,

the One that holds my head up.

4When I call out to you,

you answer from your holy mountain.

5I lie down to sleep and wake up again

because you sustain me.

6I won’t be afraid if 10,000 oppose me.

7Arise, LORD; rescue me.

Slap my enemies;

knock out their teeth.

8Victory comes from you;

bless your people!		Ps 3:3-8

Psalm 4

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Stringed Instruments

1Righteous God, answer when I call!

Take time for me in my distress;

listen graciously to my prayer.

2People, how long will you try to ruin my reputation?

How long will you love unfounded accusations and outright lies?

3Just remember that the LORD sets good people apart for himself;

he’ll listen when I call out to him.		Ps 4:1-3

4If you’re angry, don’t sin;

just think it to yourself in bed; don’t act it out.

5Offer sacrifices with the right attitude

and trust in the LORD.

6Many say, “Who will show us something good?”

Smile on us, LORD.

7You make me happier

than those who have big crops and new wine.

8I lie down to sleep in peace

because you make me able to live safely. 		Ps 4:4-8

Psalm 5

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Flute Accompaniment

1Listen to me, LORD;

Pay attention to my groaning.

2Hear my call for help, my God and King,

because I pray only to you.

3You hear me in the mornings,

when I offer my prayers and wait.

4You’re not amused by sinfulness

because there’s nothing bad about you.

5Braggards can’t stand in your presence

because you send away everyone that sins.

6You destroy liars

and abhor bloodthirsty people.

7But I’ll go into your house under your enduring love

and bow in reverence in your holy Temple.	Ps 5:1-7

8Because I have enemies, LORD,

lead me in your goodness;

make your way clear to me.

9You can’t believe a word they say;

they set their heart on destruction;

their throat’s an open grave;

they flatter with their tongues.

10Hold them guilty, God;

make their own schemes trip them up!

Cast them out because of their many sins

because they’re rebelling against you.

11Let everybody be happy that takes refuge in you;

let them always sing for joy.

Defend them

so those who love you can be happy in you.

12You bless good people

and cover them with your favor like a shield.	Ps 5:8-12

Psalm 6

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

with Stringed Instruments;

Set to The Sheminith [To the Eight-String Lyre]

1Don’t lash out at me, LORD,

or take me to task in your anger.

2Be gracious to me because I’m weak;

heal me because I’m troubled deep inside.

3I’m really scared;

how long, LORD, before you save me?

4Come back and rescue me;

because of your enduring love, save me;

5because nobody talks about you when they’re dead;

who gives you gratitude in Sheol?	Ps 6:1-5

6I’m worn out from moaning;

I flood my bed with tears every night

and drench my couch with weeping.

7My eyes melt from grief,

worn out over my adversaries.

8Go away, all you sinners,

because the LORD has heard me call.

9He’s heard my plea

and accepts my prayer.

10He’ll disgrace my enemies and greatly distress them;

they’ll suddenly retreat, humiliated.	Ps 6:6-10

Psalm 7

A Shiggaion of David that He Sang

to the LORD About Cush, a Benjamite

1 LORD my God, I’ve taken refuge in you;

protect me from persecutors

2so they won’t tear me apart like a lion does

and drag me away with no one to rescue me.

3 LORD my God, if I’ve done wrong,

if there’s any injustice in me,

4if I’ve betrayed a friend

or plundered an adversary for no reason,

5chase me down and slay me;

trample me on the ground;

lay my honor in the dust.			Ps 7:1-5

6Rise up in anger, LORD,

against my angry enemies;

wake up and decree justice on my behalf.

7Gather the nations around you

and rule them from on high.

8You that judge all people,

judge me by my goodness and integrity.

9Put an end to people’s sinfulness;

establish goodness

because our good God tests hearts and minds.

10You’re my shield who saves the godly in heart,

11a just judge that’s angry with sinners every day.	Ps 7:6-11

12For someone that doesn’t repent,

God sharpens his sword,

bends his bow, and strings it;

13he has his deadly weapons ready

and makes arrows with flaming shafts.

14Wicked people conceive evil,

get pregnant with sin,

and give birth to lies.

15They dig a pit and hollow it out,

and fall into the hole they’ve dug to trap others.

16Their scheming comes back on them;

their violence crashes down on their own heads.

17I’ll give the LORD the thanks his goodness calls for

and sing praise to the LORD Most High.	Ps 7:12-17

Psalm 8

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Gittith

1LORD, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!

You display your splendor higher than the sky!

2Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies

you’ve established a defensive wall

against your adversaries,

to silence enemies that want revenge.		Ps 8:1-2

3When I look at the sky, the work of your fingers,

the moon and stars you’ve set in place,

4what are we that you give us any thought

or care about us?

5You’ve made us a little lower than the angels

and crowned us with glory and honor!

6You’ve given us responsibility over what you’ve made

and put it under our control:

7sheep and oxen, wild animals in the countryside,

8birds in the sky, fish in the sea,

whatever swims through the ocean.

9LORD, our Lord, you’re so majestic all over the world!

Ps 8:3-9

Psalm 9

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to the tune of “Death of the Son”

1I’ll thank you, LORD, with all my heart

and call attention to the amazing things you’ve done.

2I’ll gladly celebrate over you

and sing your praise, Most High.

3When my enemies retreated,

they staggered and died in front of you

4because you judged in my favor;

you sat on your throne and judged justly.

5You’ve rebuked the nations,

destroyed the wicked,

and blotted out their names forever.

6Your enemies have ended up in permanent ruins;

you’ve uprooted their towns;

the very memory of them is gone.	Ps 9:1-6

7But the LORD reigns as king forever,

rendering judgment from his throne.

8He judges the world justly,

delivers verdicts evenhandedly,

9a stronghold for oppressed people,

a fortress in troubled times,

10trusted by those who know him

because he doesn’t abandon the ones who depend on him.

Ps 9:7-10

11Sing praises to the LORD that lives in Zion;

tell what all he’s done.

12He that avenges murder remembers the helpless;

he doesn’t forget the cries of those who suffer.

13Be gracious to me, LORD;

look at how those who hate me treat me.

Lift me up from death

14so I can publicly praise you

and celebrate in Zion’s gates over your deliverance.

15The nations fall into the pit they dig

and catch their feet in the net they hide.

16The LORD makes himself known

for carrying out judgment.

Sinners snare themselves in their own traps. 	Ps 9:11-16

[Higgaion]

17The sinful go down to Sheol;

so does every nation that forgets God.

18Needy people won’t be overlooked forever;

the hopes of the depressed won’t perish.

19Don’t let people prevail, LORD;

judge the nations.

20Put them in fear;

remind them that they’re mere mortals.			Ps 9:17-20

Psalm 10

1Why stand so far away, LORD?

Why hide when trouble comes?

2Sinners hunt down the poor in arrogance

and get themselves caught in their own schemes.

3They brag about their sinful desires;

they bless the greedy and curse the LORD.

4In their arrogance, they don’t trust in him;

they just keep acting like there’s no God.	Ps 10:1-4

5Yet they always seem to prosper;

they don’t see your coming judgments from on high;

they sneer at adversaries

6and keep telling themselves, “We’re all set;

nothing bad is ever going to happen to us.”

7They curse, deceive, and oppress;

scheming and sin are on the tip of their tongue.

8They lie in ambush in villages,

kill innocent people in private,

and search for the unfortunate in stealth.

9They lurk in hiding places like lions in a den

and sneak around to pounce on helpless people

when they snare them in their nets.

10They crouch and slink down;

the unfortunate fall under their power.

11They tell themselves, “God won’t remember;

he doesn’t pay attention to what’s going on;

he won’t even see it.”	Ps 10:5-11

12Raise up your hand, LORD;

remember the helpless.

13Why do sinners renounce you?

Why tell themselves you won’t call them to account?

14You do see trouble and distress;

so you will take care of it.

Poor people commit themselves to you,

and you defend orphans.

15Break the arms of bad people;

search out sinners till there’s none left to find.

16LORD, you’re King forever;

nations perish at your hand.

17You listen to what the humble need

and increase your mercy toward them.

18You vindicate the orphan and the oppressed

so worldly people can’t abuse them anymore.	Ps 10:12-18

Psalm 11

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I rely on the LORD’s protection;

so why tell me,

“Flee like a bird to the mountains

2because the ungodly are bending the bow;

they’re putting their arrow to the string

to shoot from the shadows at the godly in heart.

3If the foundations of society collapse,

what can good people do?”

4The LORD is in his holy Temple;

he rules from heaven,

watching everyone,

examining each one.

5He tests the good and the bad

and hates the ones that love violence.

6He’ll rain burning coals on sinners;

he’ll punish them with fire, sulfur, and scorching wind

7because he’s good and loves goodness.

Good people get to meet him face to face.		Ps 11:1-7

Psalm 12

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Eight-String Lyre

1Help, LORD; there aren’t any decent people left;

the faithful are disappearing.

2Neighbors lie to one another

and speak with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.

3May the LORD cut off their flattering lips

and bragging tongues 4that say

“We can talk our way out of anything;

they’re our lips; who’s going to stop us?”

5The LORD says, “Since the oppressed are suffering violence

and the needy groan,

I’ll come to give them the protection they long for.” 	Ps 12:1-5

6Your promises are pure, LORD,

like silver refined in a furnace seven times.

7Keep us; protect us from this generation

8that struts around, displaying its contempt. 	Ps 12:6-8

Psalm 13

1LORD, are you going to forget about me forever?

How long will you ignore me?

2How long must I counsel myself in constant sorrow?

How long will my enemies lord it over me?

3Think about me and respond to me, LORD my God;

brighten my eyes so they don’t grow dull as in death,

4so my enemies won’t brag about defeating me

and celebrate over my downfall.

5I rely on your enduring love;

I’m happy because you’ve delivered me.

6I’ll sing to you, LORD,

because you’ve blessed me wonderfully.		Ps 13:1-6

Psalm 14

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Fools keep telling themselves there’s no God,

corrupt people that do corrupt things;

none of them does what’s right.

2The LORD looks down from heaven

to see if there’s anybody that lives wisely,

if anybody seeks him.

3But they’ve all veered off course and become corrupted;

not a one of them does what’s right, not a one.

4Don’t sinners realize what they’re doing

when they eat up my people like bread

and refuse to call on me?

5Terror will overwhelm them later

because I’m taking the good people’s side.

6Oppressors try to frustrate the endeavors of the oppressed,

but I’m their refuge.

7Oh that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion!

When the LORD restores his captive people,

Jacob will celebrate; Israel will be happy.		Ps 14:1-7

Psalm 15

A Psalm of David

1LORD, who can live in your Tabernacle?

Who can reside on your holy hill?

2Those who act with integrity,

who do what’s right and tell the truth;

3who don’t mistreat their neighbors

or join in gossiping about their friends;

4who despise reprobates,

but honor people that respect the LORD,

who even swear to their own disadvantage

and carry it through,

5that don’t charge interest

or accept bribes against innocent people.

People like that will always be secure.	Ps 15:1-5

Psalm 16

A Mikhtam of David

1Protect me, LORD; you’re my refuge.

2I say, “You’re my Lord;

apart from you, I don’t have anything good.”

3The godly people on earth are the noble ones I delight in.

4Trouble multiplies

for those who rush off to some other god;

I won’t pour out blood offerings with them

or even say their names.

5The LORD is my permanent possession, my cup;

he holds in safekeeping what’s allotted to me.

6The boundary lines of my inheritance fall in good places;

it’s a beautiful land.	Ps 16:1-6

7I’ll bless the LORD that guides me;

even at night my heart teaches me.

8I keep himY continually beside me,

at my right hand so I don’t get unsettled.

9So I’m happy and celebrate;

my body will also rest secure

10because you won’t abandon me in Sheol,

or let your Holy One decay.

11You’ll show me how to live;

there’s total joy when you’re around,

with eternal delights with you.	Ps 16:7-11

Psalm 17

A Prayer of David

1LORD; listen to my call for justice;

pay attention to my sincere prayer.

2Declare me innocent

because you see that I’m righteous.

3You’ve visited me at night and tested my heart;

you’ve put me on trial and found nothing wrong;

I’m determined not to say anything sinful.

4Your word has kept me from following

the example of cruel people.

5My steps have stayed on your path;

my feet haven’t slipped.	Ps 17:1-5

6I’m calling on you, God,

because you answer me.

7Demonstrate your amazing, enduring love

for the ones that take refuge in you

from people that rebel against you.

8Keep me as the pupil of your eye;

hide me under your wings

9from sinners who plunder,

from deadly enemies that surround me,

10that have no mercy in their hearts,

and brag arrogantly.

11They’ve tracked me down and surrounded me,

and threaten to knock me to the ground.

12They’re like lions eager to maul me,

like young lions lurking in ambush.	Ps 17:6-12

13Confront them, LORD; knock them down;

deliver me from sinners with the sword

14that’s in your hand,

from people who’ve cast their lot in this life,

whose stomach you fill with your treasure.

They’re satisfied with having children

and leaving their wealth to their babies.

15But because I’m righteous,

I’ll be satisfied by seeing you when I wake up.	 Ps 17:13-15

Psalm 18 (2 Samuel 22)

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,

the LORD’s servant, who sang this song to him

when he delivered him from his enemies and from Saul

He said,

1“I love you, LORD, my strength,

2my fortress, my deliverer,

my God, my Rock, my Refuge;

my shield, the place that saves me, my stronghold.”

3I called on him who deserves praise,

and he saved me from my enemies.

4The waves of death entangled me;

the torrents of destruction flooded over me;

5the cords of Sheol tied me down;

the snares of death had entrapped me.

6In my desperation, I cried out to the LORD,

and he heard me in his Temple.		Ps 18:1-6

7Then the earth quaked and the mountains shook

because he was angry.

8Smoke poured out of his nostrils;

consuming fire flared from his mouth;

glowing coals erupted from him.

9He lowered the sky too

and came down with dense darkness under his feet.

10He rode on a cherub

and came flying swiftly on the wings of the wind.

11He covered himself with darkness like a pavilion,

with dark rain clouds veiling his advance

12and hiding the brightness around him,

while hailstones and lightning bolts broke through his clouds.

13The LORD thundered from the sky;

the Most High raised his voice;

hailstones and lightning bolts resounded.

14He shot his arrows and scattered my enemies;

lightning flashes routed them.

15Then the water in the ocean receded;

the seabed was exposed

at his rebuke,

at the blast from his nostrils.	Ps 18:7-15

16He reached down from on high and grabbed me

and pulled me out of the path of the raging tsunami.

17He delivered me from enemies

that hated me,

that were too strong for me.

18They attacked me at a time of distress,

but the LORD was my buttress.

19He brought me out to a safe place

and rescued me because he delighted in me.

20The LORD rewarded me for my goodness,

for my innocence;

21I’d kept his ways

and hadn’t sinned by leaving him;

22his ordinances all stayed with me;

I hadn’t shoved any of his statutes away.

23I stood blameless in his presence

because I’d kept myself from sinning.

24So the LORD rewarded me for my goodness,

for my innocence.	Ps 18:16-24

25To the kind you’re kind;

with the blameless you’re blameless;

26with the pure you’re pure;

with the treacherous you’re shrewd.

27You rescue the humble

but bring down the haughty.

28You’re my lamp, LORD my God,

and shine light into my darkness.

29With your help, I can crush a whole battalion

I can scale any wall.	Ps 18:25-29

30God’s way is perfect;

the LORD’s promise proves true;

he’s a shield for everyone that depends on his protection.

31Who is God except the LORD?

Who is a rock but our God,

32who wraps me in strength

and makes my way safe?

33He makes my feet as surefooted a red deer’s hooves

and stands me securely on high ground.

34He trains my hands for battle

and strengthens my arms to draw a bronze bow.

35He’s given me his deliverance as a shield;

his help has made me great.

36He’s widened the path where I step

so my feet don’t slip.	Ps 18:30-36

37I chased my enemies and overtook them;

I didn’t turn back till I’d eliminated them.

38I thrust them through so they couldn’t get up again;

they fell under my feet

39because you wrapped me in strength for battle

and subdued my assailants.

40You’ve made my enemies retreat;

I destroyed the ones that hated me.

41They looked around for help, but there wasn’t any;

they even cried out to the LORD, but he didn’t answer.

42I pulverized them like dust in the wind,

emptied them out like dirt on the street.

43You delivered me from conflict with the people

and placed me at the head of nations;

people I didn’t know now serve me.

44Foreigners submit as soon as they hear me;

45they lose heart and come cringing out of their fortresses.

Ps 18:37-45

46The LORD lives; praise be to my Rock;

exalted be God that delivers me,

47that avenges me,

that subdues nations under me.

48that rescues me from my enemies,

lifts me above my attackers,

and delivers me from violent people.

49So I’ll thank you among the nations, LORD,

and sing your praises.

50You give victory for your king

and show enduring love to your anointed one,

to me [David] and my descendants forever.		Ps 18:46-50

Psalm 19

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David.

1The heavens show God’s glory;

the sky displays his workmanship.

2Day in and day out they speak;

night after night they display intelligence.

3There’s no speech or words;

there’s nothing to hear.

4Their testimony goes out to the whole world,

their message to the ends of the earth;

in them he’s pitched a tent for the sun.

5It’s like a groom coming out of his room,

excited like a man in shape to run a race.

6It rises at one side of the sky

and makes its circuit to the other;

nothing escapes its warmth.		Ps 19:1-6

7The Law of the LORD is perfect for reviving the soul;

his Testimony is reliable for making simple people wise.

8The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing happiness;

his commandments are clear, enlightening the mind.

9Respect for the LORD is pure, lasting forever;

his judgments are true and altogether just.

10They’re worth more than lots of fine gold;

they’re sweeter than honey that drips from the honeycomb.

11They warn me

and reward me when I keep them.

12Who can see their own mistakes?

So declare me innocent of my unseen faults.

13Restrain me from presumptuous sins;

don’t let them gain control of me.

Then I’ll be blameless and relieved for not sinning.

14May what I think and say

be acceptable to you, LORD, my Rock, my Redeemer.	Ps 19:7-14

Psalm 20

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1When trouble comes, may the LORD answer you!

May Jacob’s God set you safely on high!

2May he send help from the sanctuary

and support you from Zion!

3May he remember your many meal offerings

and find your burnt offerings acceptable.

4May he grant you your heart’s desire

and make your plans successful.

5You’ll sing for joy over his deliverance

and hoist your banners in his name.

May the LORD give you your petitions.		Ps 20:1-5

6We know the LORD saves his anointed ones;

he answers them from his holy heaven

with the saving strength of his right hand.

7Some nations boast about chariots and horses,

but we’ll boast about the LORD our God.

8Those nations will collapse and fall,

but we’ll rise up and stand tall.

9Give us victory, LORD, when we call.	Ps 20:6-9

Psalm 21

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1LORD, the king delights in your strength;

he’s happy because you’ve helped him.

2You’ve given him his heart’s desire;

you didn’t withhold his request.

3You met him with blessings

and crowned him with fine gold.

4He asked you for life,

and you gave him life everlasting.

5He has great honor because you delivered him

and endowed him with splendor and majesty.

6You make him blessed forever

and happy because you’re with him.		Ps 21:1-6

7The king trusts in the LORD;

because of the enduring love of the Most High,

he won’t be deposed.

8You’ll discover all your enemies;

you’ll find out who hates you.

9You’ll throw them into a blazing furnace in your anger;

you’ll burn them up in your wrath

10and destroy their offspring.

11Though they’ve devised a coup to harm you,

they won’t succeed.

12You’ll put them to flight

when you snap your bowstring at their faces.

13Be honored in your strength, LORD;

we’ll sing praises about your power.		Ps 21:7-13

Psalm 22

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to The Hind of the Dawn

1My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

Why are you so far from helping me,

so far from my groaning?

2I call out in the daytime, but you don’t answer;

I don’t get any relief at night.

3Yet you’re holy,

enthroned on Israel’s praises.

4Our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.

5They called out to you, and you saved them;

they relied on you, and you didn’t disappoint them. 	Ps 22:1-5

6But I’m a worm, not a man;

people scorn me and despise me.

7Everybody that sees me makes fun of me;

they make faces at me and shake their heads at me and say,

8“Entrust yourself to the LORD; let him deliver you;

let him rescue you because he delights in you!”

9Yet you’re the One that delivered me from the womb

and made me trust when I was on my mother’s breasts.

10I’ve depended on you from birth;

you’ve been my God from my mother’s womb.	 	Ps 22:6-10

11Don’t be distant because trouble’s near;

there’s nobody else to help me.

12Many bulls have surrounded me;

fierce bulls from Bashan have gathered around me.

13They bellow at me

like ravening, roaring lions.

14I’m being poured out like water;

all my bones are out of joint;

my heart’s melting like wax.

15My strength has dried up like a potsherd,

my tongue is sticking to my jaws,

and you’ve laid me down dead in the dust.

16Dogs have surrounded me;

an crowd has ganged up on me;

they’ve pierced my hands and feet.

17I can count all my bones;

people are staring at me;

18they’re dividing up my clothes

and gambling for my garments.		Ps 22:11-18

19Don’t be distant, LORD;

you’re my only help; hurry and help me.

20Deliver me from the sword;

rescue me from the dog’s paws;

21save me from the lion’s mouth

and the wild ox’s horns.	Ps 22:19-21

22I’ll tell my brothers about you

and praise you when your people gather.

23You that respect the LORD, praise him;

stand in awe of him, descendants of Israel,

24because he hasn’t looked down on the oppressed

or ignored them;

when they’ve appealed to him for help, he’s listened. 	Ps 22:22-24

25The theme of my praise in the great assembly comes from you;

I’ll fulfill my vows in front of people that respect you.

26The poverty-stricken will eat and be satisfied;

those who rely on the LORD will praise him.

May their hearts live forever!	Ps 22:25-26

27The most distant places will remember and turn to the LORD;

all the families in the nations will worship him

28because the kingdom belongs to him;

he rules the nations.

29Prosperous people will eat and worship;

everyone that goes down to dust will bow to him,

all those who can’t keep themselves alive.

30Posterity will serve him;

one generation will tell the next one about him.

31To people not yet born,

they’ll come to declare his goodness,

that he’s the One that’s done all of this.	Ps 22:27-31

Psalm 23

A Psalm of David

1The LORD is my shepherd;

I’ll have everything I need.

2He beds me down in green pasture

and leads me beside still water.

3He refreshes me

and guides me along good paths for his honor.

4Even though I walk through the darkest valley,

I won’t be afraid, because he’s with me;

his rod and staff reassure me.

5You set a table for me in front of my enemies;

you anoint my head with oil;

my cup runs over.

6Goodness and mercy will follow me all my life,

and I’ll live in the LORD’s house forever.	Ps 23:1-6

Psalm 24

A Psalm of David

1The earth and everything in it belongs to the LORD,

the world and those who live here.

2He positioned land higher than seas,

more elevated than ocean currents.

3Who can climb his mountain

and stand in his holy place?

4People with clean hands and pure hearts,

who don’t offer themselves up to idols

or lie under oath.

5They’ll receive a blessing from the LORD,

goodness from the God who keeps them safe.

6That’s the way it is for those who seek him out

and worship him—even the House of Jacob.	Ps 24:1-6

7Open up, gates;

open up, everlasting doors,

so the glorious King can enter!

8Who is the glorious King?

The LORD strong and powerful,

the LORD mighty in battle.

9Open up, gates;

open up, everlasting doors,

so the glorious King can enter!

10Who is the glorious King?

The LORD of Hosts,

he is the glorious King.	Ps 24:7-10

Psalm 25

A Psalm of David

1I hold my life up to you, LORD;

2I trust you;

don’t let me down

or let my enemies celebrate over my defeat.

3Nobody that waits for you will be discredited;

people who deal treacherously

are the ones that will be discredited.	Ps 25:1-3

4 LORD, let me know your ways;

teach me your paths;

5lead me in your truth

because you keep me safe;

I’ll always depend on you.

6Remember your mercy and enduring love

that have existed from ages past.

7Don’t keep in mind the sins I committed when I was young;

remember me in the light of your enduring love.	Ps 25:4-7

8The LORD is good and just,

so he instructs sinners in his way

9and leads the humble in what’s right.

10Everything he does comes from truth and enduring love

for those who keep his covenant and testimonies.

11For your own honor,

pardon my sin because it’s great. 	Ps 25:8-11

12Who of you respect the LORD?

He’ll instruct you in what to choose

13so you’ll keep succeeding

and your offspring will inherit the land.

14People that respect the LORD are his friends;

he’ll make his covenant known to them.

15I keep looking to him

because he untangles my feet from my enemies’ net.	Ps 25:12-15

16Turn to me and be gracious

because I’m lonely and downcast.

17Relieve me of my pain and anguish,

and lift me out of my doldrums.

18Look at my troubles

and forgive my sin.	Ps 25:16-18

19Look at all the enemies I have

that hate me so much!

20Guard my life and rescue me;

don’t let me regret taking refuge in you.

21Oh that integrity and godliness would protect me

because I depend on you.

22Redeem Israel, God, from all its troubles.	Ps 25:19-22

Psalm 26

A Psalm of David

1Declare me innocent, LORD,

because I’ve conducted myself with integrity

and trusted in you without wavering.

2Examine me, put me on trial,

test my motives and attitude.

3I keep my eye on your unfailing love

and follow you faithfully.

4I don’t sit with deceitful people

or run around with pretenders.

5I detest the company of unreliable people

and refuse to join in with sinners.

6I’ll wash my hands to express my innocence

and frequent your altar, LORD,

7singing my gratitude

and telling about the wonderful things you’ve done.	Ps 26:1-7

8 LORD, I love the Temple where you live,

the place where your glory lies.

9Don’t carry off my soul with sinners,

or my life with bloodthirsty people

10that devise sinful schemes

and hand out bribes left and right.

11But I maintain my integrity;

redeem me with your grace.

12My foot stands on solid ground;

I’ll bless you publicly. 	Ps 26:8-12

Psalm 27

A Psalm of David

1The LORD is my light and salvation;

who am I going to be afraid of?

He defends me;

who am I going to dread?

2When bad people come to devour me,

they stumble and fall.

3Though an army attacks me, it won’t frighten me;

though war breaks out against me, I’ll stay confident.	Ps 27:1-3

4I ask the LORD for one thing—what I look for most:

to live in his house my whole life,

to see his beauty and meditate in his Temple.

5When trouble comes, he’ll shelter conceal me;

he’ll hide me in a secret place

and station me on a high rock.

6I’ll hold up my head above my enemies;

in his Tabernacle I’ll offer sacrifices with shouts of joy

and sing praises to the LORD.	Ps 27:4-6

7Listen when I call out, LORD;

be gracious and answer me.

8You said, “Seek me,”

my heart and soul responded, “I’ll seek you.”

9Don’t ignore me

or turn away angry.

You’ve been my help;

don’t abandon me, God my Savior.

10Even if my parents exposed me I as an infant to die,

you would pick me up.	Ps 27:7-10

11Teach me your way, LORD;

lead me on a level path away from my enemies.

12Don’t turn me over to them,

because lying witnesses have taken the stand against me,

the kind that threatens violence with every breath.

13I’d have despaired if I hadn’t believed

I’d see the LORD’s goodness while I was alive.

14So wait for him;

be strong and courageous.

Yes, wait for him.	Ps 27:11-14

Psalm 28

A Psalm of David

1I’m calling out to you, LORD;

don’t turn a deaf ear, my Rock;

otherwise, I’ll be like someone going down to the Pit.

2Help me when I plead for help,

when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary.

3Don’t drag me away with the wicked,

with those who sin,

who offer their neighbors peace

while selfish motives lurk in their hearts.

4Pay them back according to their deeds,

in proportion to the sin they practice.

5Since they don’t appreciate

what you’ve made and done,

tear them down and don’t rebuild them.	Ps 28:1-5

6Bless the LORD for listening to my petition.

7He’s my strength and shield;

I trust him and he helps me;

so I celebrate and thank him with songs.

8He’s his people’s strength,

the saving defense for his anointed ones.

9Save your people and bless your inheritance;

be their shepherd and carry them forever.	Ps 28:6-9

Psalm 29

A Psalm of David

1Children of the mighty,

attribute to the LORD honor and strength.

2Honor him like he deserves;

worship him in his holy splendor.	Ps 29:1-2

3The sound from the LORD carries out over the water;

our glorious God thunders across the ocean expanse.

4His voice is loud and majestic

5and blows down cedars in Lebanon.

6He makes Lebanon skip like a calf

and Sirion [Mt. Hermon] jump around like a young wild ox.

7The sound from the LORD flashes out lightning bolts

8and shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh;

9it makes deer go into labor

and strips the trees bare.

In his Temple everyone shouts, “Glory!”

10The LORD sits like a king above the flood,

enthroned forever.

11He gives his people courage

and blesses them with peace.	Ps 29:3-11

Psalm 30

A Psalm of David

A Song at the Dedication of the Temple

1I’ll praise you, LORD, because you’ve rescued me;

you haven’t let my enemies celebrate victory over me.

2I appealed to you for help, my God,

and you restored my health;

3you brought me up from Sheol;

you kept me from going down to the Pit.

4Sing praise to the LORD, his holy people;

thank him, 5because his anger is only for a little while,

but his blessing lasts a lifetime.

Weeping may go on all night,

but rejoicing comes in the morning.	Ps 30:1-5

6In my good fortune, I said, “I’ll never be shaken.”

7Your blessing, LORD, made me feel as stable as a mountain;

but then you hid from me, and I was shattered.

8I called out to you in a petition:

9“What does my death accomplish if you let me go down to the Pit?

Will dust praise you and tell about your faithfulness?

10“Hear me, LORD; be gracious and help me.”

11You turned my mourning into dancing;

you removed my burlap of mourning

and dressed me in happiness.

12Now I can sing praise to you unrestrained;

I can be eternally grateful to you.	Ps 30:6-12

Psalm 31

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I take refuge in you, LORD;

never let me be disgraced;

in your goodness protect me.

2Listen to me, rescue me quickly;

be a rock for me,

a strong fortress to save me.

3You’re my rock and fortress;

for your honor, lead me and guide me.

4Free me out of the trap people secretly laid for me

because you’re my protection.

5I’m entrusting my spirit to you;

rescue me, LORD, true God. 	Ps 31:1-5

6I detest those who respect worthless idols;

I trust in you, LORD.

7I’ll be happy in your enduring love,

because you see my difficulties

and know the trouble I’m in,

8because you haven’t handed me over to my enemies;

you’ve set me on a spacious place.	Ps 31:6-8

9Be gracious to me in my distress, LORD;

my eyes are melting away with grief,

my soul and body are getting weak as well

10because I live in constant sorrow;

I spend my years in sighing.

My strength is failing because of sin;

my body is wasting away.

11Because I have so many enemies,

my neighbors despise me,

my acquaintances abhor me,

and people shun me in the streets.

12I’m forgotten like someone long dead,

out of mind like a broken pot.

13I hear people’s slander;

there’s terror on every side;

my enemies conspire against me

and lay plots to kill me.	Ps 31:9-13

14But I trust you, LORD;

I swear, “You’re my God.”

15My future’s in your hands;

rescue me from my enemies,

from those who persecute me.

16Smile at me;

save me with your enduring love.

17Don’t let my enemies disgrace me, LORD,

because I’m calling on you.

Put sinners to disgrace;

let them be silent in Sheol.

18Make lying lips be mute

that insult the good with pride and contempt.	Ps 31:14-18

19How great your goodness is

that you’ve stored up for those who respect you,

that you’ve shown to people that take refuge in you

so others can see.

20You secretly hide them with you away from people’s plots,

and shelter them from the conflict that tongues can cause.

21Bless the LORD

because he showed me his enduring love

when I was surrounded like a city under siege.

22I despaired in my alarm, “I can’t see you!”

but you heard my appeal.	Ps 31:19-22

23Love the LORD, all you holy people!

He preserves the faithful

and repays those who act arrogantly.

24Be strong and courageous,

you that rest your hopes in him!	Ps 31:23-24

Psalm 32

A Maskil. A Psalm of David

1How blessed they are whose sin God forgives,

whose transgression he covers;

2whose disobedience the LORD doesn’t hold against them,

whose spirit doesn’t harbor deceit!

3When I didn’t acknowledge my sin,

my body wasted away,

I moaned all day,

4your hand weighed on me day and night,

my strength drained away in the summer heat.

5When I acknowledged it and said, “I’ll confess my sin to the LORD,”

you forgave me.

6So everyone that’s godly needs to pray to you

while there’s time;

so when distress floods in,

it won’t overwhelm them.

7You’re our hiding place

for protecting us from trouble

and surrounding us with songs about deliverance.	Ps 32:1-7

8I’ll teach you the way to go;

I’ll focus my attention on you and advise you.

9Don’t be like a senseless horse or mule

that needs a bit and bridle to make it obey.

10Sinful people incur lots of sorrow,

but enduring love surrounds those who trust the LORD.

11Be happy and celebrate in him;

shout for joy, all of you with godly hearts.	Ps 32:8-11

Psalm 33

1Sing for joy to the LORD, good people;

praise is fitting for the godly.

2Give him thanks with a lyre;

sing praises to him with a ten-string harp.

3Sing a new song to him;

play skillfully and shout for joy.

4You can believe what he says

and rely on what he does.

5He loves goodness and justice,

and fills the world with his enduring love.	Ps 33:1-5

6The LORD made the sky with a word,

all its host with the breath from his mouth.

7He gathered the water in the ocean

and stored up the depths in reservoirs.

8The whole world must respect him

and stand in awe of him.

9He spoke and it happened;

he commanded and it occurred.

10The LORD overrides the counsel of nations

and frustrates the peoples’ plans.

11His counsel stands forever;

his plans endure across the generations.	Ps 33:6-11

12The nation is blessed whose God is the LORD,

the people he’s chosen for his inheritance.

13The LORD looks down from heaven at everyone;

14from where he sits, he sees the whole human race.

15He made their hearts;

so he understands what they do.

16A king doesn’t prevail by his large army;

a soldier doesn’t save himself by his great strength.

17A warhorse gives false hope for victory;

it doesn’t deliver anyone by its power.	Ps 33:12-17

18The LORD watches over those who respect him,

who place their hope in his enduring love

19to deliver them from death

and keep them alive at famine time.

20We wait for him, our help and shield,

21and celebrate in him because we trust in him.

22Send down your enduring love to us, LORD,

because we’ve put our hope in you.	Ps 33:18-22

Psalm 34

A Psalm of David When He Faked Insanity

in Front of Abimelech, Who Drove Him Away

1I’ll bless the LORD at all times

and praise him constantly.

2I’ll make my boast about him;

the helpless will hear it and take heart.

3Let’s tell how great the LORD is;

let’s honor him together.

4I looked to the LORD; he answered me

and freed me from my fears.

5People that look to him are radiant;

they never look subdued.

6I cried out in my suffering, and he listened

and saved me from my troubles.

7An angel of the LORD camps around people that respect him,

and he rescues them.	Ps 34:1-7

8Taste and find out how good the LORD is,

how blessed everyone is that takes refuge in him!

9Respect him, his holy people;

those who do, have everything they need.

10Young lions get hungry,

but anyone that looks to the LORD has everything good.

11Come, children, listen to me;

I’ll teach you to respect the LORD.

12Who wants to live

a long time and prosper?

13Keep your tongue from sinning

and your lips from lying.

14Quit doing bad and do good;

look for peace and pursue it.	Ps 34:8-14

15The LORD watches over good people

and hears them cry out to him.

16He turns against those who practice sin,

and erases the memory of them.

17When good people call for help; he listens

and rescues them from their troubles.

18He’s close to the brokenhearted

and saves those whose spirit is crushed.

19Good people face lots of trouble,

but the LORD delivers them.

20They keep all their bones;

not a one of them will be broken.

21Sin slays the sinful;

God punishes those who hate the righteous.

22He redeems his servants;

he doesn’t condemn anyone that takes refuge in him.	Ps 34:15-22

Psalm 35

A Psalm of David

1LORD, oppose the ones that oppose me;

fight those who fight me.

2Put on buckler and shield,

and come to my aid.

3Draw spear and javelin against my pursuers;

tell me you’ll save me.

4Dishonor the ones that want to kill me;

drive back and humiliate those who scheme against me.

5Make them like chaff in the wind,

with the angel of the LORD blowing them.

6Make their path dark and slippery,

with the angel of the LORD chasing them;

7for no reason they hid a net to catch me

and dug a pit to trap me.

8Bring destruction on them unawares;

have the net they hide catch them;

have them fall into that very destruction.	Ps 35:1-8

9I’ll be happy in the LORD

and celebrate over his salvation.

10My very bones say, “LORD, who is like you

that delivers the oppressed from people too strong for them

and saves the needy from the one that robs them?”

11Malicious witnesses testify against me

and accuse me of things I didn’t do

12They repay me bad for good; I’m heartbroken.

13But when they were sick, I wore burlap;

I humbled myself with fasting

and prayed with my chin on my chest.

14I went about as if it was my friend or brother;

I bent over mourning as if it was my mother.

15But when I stumbled, they celebrated and ganged up on me;

strikers that I didn’t even know gathered against me

and slandered me for no reason.

16Like godless jesters at a feast,

they gnashed their teeth at me.	Ps 35:9-16

17Lord, how long will you just watch?

Rescue me from their ravages;

save me from those lions.

18I’ll thank you in the great community

and praise you in the mighty throng.

19Don’t let my enemies celebrate over me

or wink maliciously who hate me.

20They don’t talk about peace;

they scheme against those who are peaceful in the land.

21They open their mouth wide against me,

“Aha, aha, we saw him do it!”	Ps 35:17-21

22You can see what they’re doing, LORD;

don’t stand back and not say anything.

23Stir yourself up, awake for my justice,

for my cause, my Lord and my God.

24Judge me, LORD, according to your goodness;

don’t let my enemies celebrate over me.

25Don’t let them say to themselves, “Just what we’d hoped!”

Don’t let them say, “Let’s eat him alive!”

26Humiliate them who celebrate over my distress;

dress them in shame and dishonor

who vaunt themselves up over me.	Ps 35:22-26

27Shout for joy you that are in favor of my vindication;

say again and again, “The LORD is great;

he delights in his servant’s prosperity.”

28I’ll declare your goodness and praise all day long.	Ps 35:27-28

Psalm 36

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of David, the LORD’s Servant

1Sin speaks to sinful people’s hearts;

they don’t respect God at all.

2They flatter themselves

that he can’t discover their sin.

3Their words deceive;

they’ve stopped being wise and doing good.

4They devise schemes in bed

and carry them out in the morning with no qualms	Ps 36:1-4

5LORD, your enduring love reaches the stars;

your faithfulness is as high as the sky;

6your goodness as mighty as the mountains;

your justice as deep as the ocean;

your provision sufficient for everything that breathes.

7How precious that enduring love is!

All humanity finds protection under your wings.

8They drink their fill from the abundance in your house,

from your river of delights.

9You’re their fountain of life;

in your light they see light.

10Maintain your enduring love to all who know you,

your goodness to the godly in heart. 	Ps 36:5-10

11Don’t let the proud tramp on me

or the sinful shove me away.

12Let sinners fall where they sin,

thrown down so they can’t get up.	Ps 36:10-12

Psalm 37

A Psalm of David

1Don’t worry about bad people

or envy those who do wrong;

2they’ll wither like grass

and fade like flowers.

3Trust in the LORD and do good

so you can live in the land and enjoy security.

4Delight in the LORD,

and he’ll give you what your heart desires.

5Commit your way to him and trust him,

and he’ll act on your behalf.

6He’ll bring forth your goodness like the dawn

and your vindication like the midday sun.	Ps 37:1-6

7Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for him;

don’t worry about people that prosper

by carrying out dishonest schemes.

8Stop being mad at them; set anger aside;

don’t concern yourself with them;

that only leads to your own sinning.

9They’ll be destroyed,

but those who depend on the LORD will inherit the land.

10Sinners will soon be gone;

you can look all over for them,

but they won’t be there.

11It’s the humble that inherit the land

and delight in abundant prosperity.	Ps 37:7-11

12Bad people plot against the good

and gnash their teeth at them.

13But the LORD laughs at them

because he sees what’s going to happen to them.

14Sinners draw the sword and bend the bow

to bring down the poor and needy

and slay the godly;

15but their sword will pierce their own heart,

and their bow will break.	Ps 37:12-15

16The little that good people have is better

than the abundance sinners possess,

17because the LORD will break the arms of sinners

and sustain the good.

18He knows the time of the blameless;

their inheritance lasts forever.

19They aren’t discouraged in hard times

and have plenty during famine.

20But the sinful perish;

the LORD’s enemies are like flowers in a pasture;

they dissipate like smoke.

21The wicked borrow and don’t repay,

but the good are generous and give.

22Those he blesses will inherit the land;

the ones he curses will die.	Ps 37:16-22

23The LORD guides the steps of the godly

and delights in their lives.

24If they fall, they won’t fall headlong

because the LORD will hold their hand.

25I was young once; now I’m old;

yet I’ve not seen good people abandoned

or their children beg for bread.

26They’re gracious and generous;

their descendants are a blessing.

27Quit doing bad things and do good

so you’ll live forever.	Ps 37:23-27

28The LORD loves justice

and doesn’t abandon his holy people;

he keeps them forever,

but cuts off the descendants of the wicked.

29The godly will inherit the land

and live there permanently.

30The godly utter wisdom and speak justice.

31The Law of their God is in their heart;

their feet don’t slip.

32Sinners spy on them

and try to kill them.

33The LORD won’t abandon the godly to their power

or let them be condemned when they’re judged.

34Wait for the LORD and keep his way,

and he’ll raise you up to inherit the land;

you’ll see the wicked destroyed.		Ps 37:28-34

35I’ve seen a violent, wicked people spread themselves out

like tall trees in their native soil.

36Then they passed away and were gone;

I looked for them, but they were nowhere to be found.

37Take note of blameless, watch the godly

because peaceful people prosper;

38but sinners will be destroyed

along with their future.

39The salvation of the godly comes from the LORD,

their refuge when trouble comes.

40The LORD helps them and delivers them,

protects them from sinners and saves them

because they take refuge in him. 		Ps 37:35-40

Psalm 38

A Psalm of David

for a Memorial

1LORD, don’t rebuke me in your wrath

or discipline me in your furious anger.

2Your arrows have pierced deep into me;

your hand has come down hard on me.

3Because of your indignation, my body’s not sound;

by my sin I’ve ruined my health.

4My iniquities have piled up higher than my head

and weighed me down.

5My wounds have festered and grown foul.

My foolish choices 6have doubled me over;

I grieve all the time;

7I’m burning up with fever;

my health is broken.

8I’m numb and crushed,

and groan from inner conflict.	Ps 38:1-8

9Lord, you know what I long for;

you hear my sighs.

10My heart’s pounding, my strength’s failing;

the sparkle in my eyes is gone.

11My friends and loved ones stand back from my sickness;

my relatives stay well away from me.

12Those who want to kill me lay snares for me;

the ones that want to injure me threaten destruction,

constantly plotting treachery.	Ps 38:9-12

13But like someone deaf, I don’t hear;

like a mute I don’t speak.

14Yes, I’m like somebody that can’t hear,

someone with no arguments to offer.

15I’m depending on you, LORD;

you’ll have to answer for me.

16Don’t let them celebrate over me

or gloat when my foot slips.

17I’m ready to fall;

my sorrow continually looms in front of me.

18I’m confessing my iniquity;

I’m anxious about my sin.

19But my enemies are vigorous and strong;

they hate me for no reason

20and repay bad for good

because I follow after what’s good.

21Don’t leave me, LORD;

stay close by!

22Hurry and help me, Lord my savior!	Ps 38:13-22

Psalm 39

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Jeduthun

1I said, “I’ll watch what I do

so I won’t sin with my tongue;

I’ll put a muzzle on my mouth

when sinful people come around.”

2But when I kept silent even about what was good,

it was of no avail;

my agitation grew worse.

3The more I thought about it

the more the fire burned within me;

so I spoke up:

4“LORD, show me my end,

how long I’ll live;

let me realize how fleeting my life is.

5You’ve made my days like handbreadths;

my lifetime is only a moment to you.

We all stand like a mere breath.

6We walk around like shadows in turmoil for nothing;

we accumulate wealth without knowing who will inherit it.

Ps 39:1-6

7“Now Lord, what is it I’m waiting for?

You’re my only hope.

8Save me from my sins;

don’t let fools humiliate me.

9I can’t open my mouth; I’m not able to speak

because you’re the one that disabled me.

10Stop striking me;

I’m exhausted from your blows.

11You discipline us for our sins

and consume like a moth what’s precious to us.

Clearly, we’re all nothing more than a breath.	Ps 39:7-11

12“Hear my prayer, LORD;

don’t ignore my tears

because I’m a passing guest,

a nomad like my ancestors.

13Leave me alone so I can be happy again

before I’m gone and don’t exist anymore.”	Ps 39:12-13

Psalm 40

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1I waited patiently for the LORD;

he listened to my call for help.

2He brought me up out of the pit of despair,

out of the muddy clay,

set my feet on solid rock,

and made my footsteps secure.

3He put a new song in me, a song about praising God;

other people will hear it, see what he’s done, and trust in him.

4How blessed people are that trust in the LORD

instead of turning to proud or deceitful people.

5LORD my God, you’ve done so many amazing things;

your good intentions for us are too many to tell.

Nobody compares with you;

if I tried to tell about your wonderful acts,

I couldn’t recount them all. 	Ps 40:1-5

6Your don’t delight in sacrifices and meal offerings;

you haven’t required burnt offerings and sin offerings;

you’ve pierced my ears. [you gave me a bodyLXX.]

7Then I said, “I’m coming;

it’s written about me in the scroll;

8I delight in doing your will, my God;

I have your Law at heart.”

9In the great assembly

I’ve proclaimed the good news about goodness

I didn’t hold back

10or keep to myself the truth about your goodness;

I spoke openly about your saving power,

about your enduring love and truth.	Ps 40:6-10

11 LORD, don’t withhold your mercy from me;

let your enduring love and truth keep protecting me.

12Troubles beyond number surround me,

and my own sins overtake me

till I can’t see any way to escape them.

13LORD, please hurry and help me.

14Embarrass and humiliate those who keep trying to destroy me;

disgrace the ones that delight in hurting me.

15Make them appalled at their disgrace

who say to me, “Aha, aha!”

16Make them happy who look to you,

who love your salvation and chant,

“The LORD is great.”

17Keep me in your thoughts

because I’m in misery and need you,

my helper, my deliverer.

Don’t delay.			Ps 40:11-17

Psalm 41

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1How blessed people are that have regard for the poor;

the LORD will deliver them when they have need.

2He’ll protect them, keep them alive, and call them blessed;

3sustain them when they’re sick and restore them to health.

Ps 41:1-3

4I said, “Be gracious to me, LORD;

heal my soul because I’ve sinned against you.”

5My enemies say rude things about me:

“When’s he going to die

so we can forget about him?”

6When they come to visit me,

they say things they don’t mean;

they just come to gather threads

they can weave into gossip when they leave.

7Everybody that hates me whispers behind my back

and makes up hurtful things to say about me:

8“He has some deadly disease;

he’ll never get out of bed again.”

9Even the close friend that I trusted, that I ate with,

has turned against me.	Ps 41:4-9

10But you, LORD, be gracious and restore me

so I can pay them back.

11I know you’re pleased with me;

you haven’t let my enemies triumph over me.

12You’ve upheld me in my integrity

and brought me into your eternal presence.

13Bless the LORD God of Israel

from everlasting to everlasting.

Amen and Amen.	Ps 41:10-13

BOOK 2

Psalm 42

For the Choir Director

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah

1My soul pants for God

like a deer pants for water.

2My soul is thirsty for the living God;

when will I ever see him?

3My tears have been my food day and night

as people ask me all the time, “Where’s your God?”

4I think about these things as I pour out my soul.

I used to go with the throng,

leading the procession to the house of God,

singing for joy and giving thanks

in the great celebration.

5Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him

for the help his presence brings.

6I’m in despair, God;

so I remember you from the land of the Jordan,

from the peaks of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.

7The sounds of your crashing waves echo back and forth;

your waves and breakers are sweeping over me.	Ps 42:1-7

8The LORD directs his enduring love to me in the daytime;

I sing his songs at night, prayers to my living God.

9I say to God, my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me?

Why do I go around in mourning

because my enemies oppress me?”

10Like breaking my bones, they taunt me;

people keep asking me, “Where’s your God?”

11Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I’ll still praise him

for the help his presence brings.	Ps 42:8-11

Psalm 43

1Declare me innocent, God;

defend me against this ungodly nation;

deliver me from liars!

2You’re the God that I rely on for courage;

why reject me?

Why do I go around in mourning

because my enemies oppress me?

3Send your light and truth to lead me,

to bring me to the holy hill where you live.

4Then I can go to your altar, my greatest source of joy,

and praise you with a harp.

5Why despair, my soul?

Why be disturbed?

Put your hope in God because I still praise him,

my helper and my God.	Ps 43:1-5

Psalm 44

For the Choir Director

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah

1God, our ancestors have told us

what you did in their time long ago.

2You drove out nations and planted this one;

you struck them and scattered them abroad.

3Our ancestors didn’t conquer the land with their sword;

their own arm didn’t save them.

Your right hand, your arm,

the light of your presence did it

when you showed them favor.	Ps 44:1-3

4You’re my King, God;

ordain victories for Jacob in our day too.

5By your power we’ll push back our adversaries

and tramp down our attackers.

6We don’t trust in our bow;

our sword won’t save us.

7You are the one that must save us from our enemies

and disgrace those who hate us.

8We take pride in you always

and give you thanks forever.	Ps 44:4-8

9Yet now you’ve set us aside to dishonor;

you don’t go out with our armies.

10You’ve made us retreat from our enemies;

those who hate us have plundered our land.

11You’ve butchered us like sheep

and scattered us among the nations.

12You sell us cheap

and make no profit from doing it.

13You make us a disgrace to our neighbors,

something to scoff at,

14a byword the world over,

a laughingstock among the nations.	Ps 44:9-14

15All day long we’re disgraced and humiliated

16because people insult us;

we have enemies and avengers everywhere.

17That’s all come on us though we haven’t forgotten you

or been unfaithful to your covenant.

18Our heart hasn’t deserted you;

we haven’t strayed from your way;

19yet you’ve crushed us in a place filled with jackals

and covered us with the shadow of death.	Ps 44:15-19

20If we’d forgotten you

or raised our hands to a foreign god,

21wouldn’t you have found it out?

You know all our inner secrets.

22But for the sake of your honor, our lives are always in danger;

we’re like sheep headed for slaughter.

23Wake up, LORD; why are you sleeping?

don’t reject us forever.

24Why ignore us

and forget our suffering and oppression?

25We’re struck down to the dirt;

our bodies stick to the ground.

26Get up and help us;

redeem us like your enduring love suggests. 	Ps 44:20-26

Psalm 45

For the Choir Director. Set to Lilies

A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. A Song About Love

1My heart is overflowing with a noble theme

as I recite my verses to the king;

my tongue is like the pen of a gifted poet.

2You’re more handsome than the sons of men;

gracious words stream from on your lips;

God has blessed you forever.

3Strap your sword to your thigh, Mighty Warrior,

in your splendor and majesty!

4 In your majesty, ride on to victory,

defending truth, humility, and goodness;

have your right hand display awesome deeds.

5Your sharp arrows pierce your enemies’ hearts;

nations fall under you.	Ps 45:1-5

6Your throne is eternal, God;

your kingdom’s scepter is a godly one.

7You love goodness and hate sinfulness;

so God, your God, has anointed you

with more happiness than your companions.

8Your robes have the fragrance of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;

stringed instruments entertain you in ivory palaces.

9 Yourmas maids of honor include kings’ daughters;

at yourmas right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. Ps 45:6-9

10Listen, daughter; pay attention;

forget your people and your father’s family

11The king delights in your beauty;

since he’s your lord, bow to him.

12The people from Tyre will shower youfem with gifts;

wealthy citizens will sue yourfem favor.

13The princess looks beautiful

in her gown interwoven with gold.

14She’ll be led to the king in embroidered robes

with bridesmaids in her train.

15With happiness and celebration,

they’ll enter the palace of the king.	Ps 45:10-15

16Yourmas sons will take the place of yourmas fathers;

you’llmas make them rulers over many lands.

17I’ll perpetuate yourmas memory in every generation;

the nations will be eternally grateful to youmas.	Ps 45:16-17

Psalm 46

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

Set to Alamoth. A Song

1God is our refuge and strength,

an ever-present help when trouble comes.

2So we won’t be afraid

though the ground tremors,

though the mountains cascade into the sea,

3though its water roars and foams,

though the ground quakes at its tsunamis.

4There’s a river of joy that flows into the city of God,

the sacred place where the Most High lives.

5God is there; it’s unmovable;

from the break of day, he protects it.

6When nations rage and kingdoms totter,

his voice thunders and earth melts away.

7The LORD of Hosts is with us;

the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:1-7

8Come and look at what the LORD does:

he brings destruction on the earth;

9he stops wars all over the world;

he breaks bows and snaps spears in two;

he burns chariots.

10“So be still and know that I’m God;

exalted in every nation,

honored all over the world.”

11The LORD of Hosts is with us;

the God of Jacob is our refuge.	Ps 46:8-11

Psalm 47

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Clap your hands, everybody;

shout to God with joy;

2because you are to revere the LORD Most High,

the great King over the whole world.

3He subdued people groups under us,

put nations beneath our feet,

4and chose our inheritance for us,

the pride of Jacob that he loves.	Ps 47:1-4

5God has ascended with a shout,

with a trumpet fanfare.

6Sing praises to God, sing praises;

sing praises to our King, sing praises;

7because God is King over the whole world;

sing praises with a beautiful psalm.

8He reigns over the nations on his holy throne.

9The rulers of the people have gathered together

with the people of Abraham’s God;

because the shields of the earth belong to him;

he’s highly honored.	Ps 47:5-9

Psalm 48

A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1The LORD is great and deserves great praise

in the city of our God on his holy mountain.

2Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon, is high and beautiful—

the joy of the whole earth, the city of the great King.

3In its towers God reveals himself as a strong defense.

4Kings joined forces

and advanced against that strong defense.

5But as soon as it came into view,

they panicked and fled.

6Panic seized them

like the anguish of a woman in childbirth.

7The LORD destroyed them

like ships of Tarshish capsized by an east wind.

8As we’ve heard, so we’ve seen

in the city of the LORD of Hosts, our God;

he’ll make it safe forever.	Ps 48:1-8

9In your Temple we think about your enduring love.

10Like your name, God, your praise is everywhere;

your right hand is filled with goodness.

11Let Mount Zion be happy,

and the residents of Judah celebrate your goodness.

12Walk around Zion and count its towers;

13inspect its ramparts and tour its fortresses

so you can tell the next generation;

14because God is God forever;

he’ll guide us till we die.	Ps 48:9-14

Psalm 49

For the Choir Director

A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1Hear this, every nation;

listen, everyone on earth,

2low and high, rich and poor alike.

3My words are wise;

my thoughts are full of insight.

4I listen to proverbs

and expound my riddles on a harp.

5Why should I be afraid when there’s adversity,

when my enemies’ sins are all around me,

6people who trust in their wealth

and brag about how rich they are?

7Nobody can use wealth to redeem a brother from death

or pay God a ransom for him—

8redeeming a life is too expensive;

you may as well forget about

9living on forever and not seeing the Pit.	Ps 49:1-9

10Even the wise die—

just like the ignorant and senseless—

and leave their wealth to others.

11They act like their houses will last forever,

like where they live will be there for all generations;

so they name their lands after themselves.

12But in all their pomp, they won’t endure;

they’ll perish like animals.

13This is the fate of the foolish

and those who agree with them:

14like sheep they’re appointed to Sheol;

death will be their shepherd.

The godly will rule them in the morning;

Sheol will consume their form

far from their stately homes.

15But God will redeem me from its power

and take me to himself.	Ps 49:10-15

16Don’t be afraid when people get rich,

when their houses appreciate in value;

17because when they die, they won’t take anything with them;

what they gloried in won’t go down with them to the grave.

18Though they congratulate themselves while they’re alive,

though other people praise them for being successful,

19they’ll go to their ancestors

and never see the light of day.

20People in all their pomp who don’t have intelligence

amount to being like animals when they die.	Ps 49:16-20

Psalm 50

A Psalm of Asaph

1God, the Mighty One, the LORD, has spoken

and calls to earth from sunrise to sunset.

2He shines forth out of Zion in perfect beauty.

3Our God comes; he doesn’t stay quiet;

a fire consumes in front of him;

a storm rages around him.

4He calls on the sky above and the earth beneath

to witness the judgment of his people.

5“Gather my people to me

that I’ve made a covenant with by sacrifice.”

6The heavens declare his justice

because God himself is judge.	Ps 50:1-6

7“Listen, my people, and I’ll speak;

Israel, I’ll bring my charges against you.

I’m God, your God.

8I don’t have any complaint about your sacrifices

or burnt offerings that are always in front of me.

9But I don’t need any bulls from your barns

or male goats from your pens;

10every animal in the forest already belongs to me,

the livestock on a thousand hills.

11I know every bird in the mountains;

everything that moves in the field is mine.

12If I was hungry, I wouldn’t say anything to you about it,

because the whole world belongs to me and everything in it.

13Will I eat the meat of bulls

or drink the blood of male goats?

14Offer to me a sacrifice of thanksgiving;

keep your vows to the Most High.

15Call on me when there’s trouble;

then I’ll rescue you, and you’ll honor me.”	Ps 50:7-15

16But God says to the sinful,

“What reason do you have to recite my statutes

or discuss my covenant?

17You hate discipline

and disregard what I tell you.

18Thieves are your friends;

you associate with adulterers.

19You give your mouth free reign;

your tongue tells lies.

20You sit around and gossip about your brother;

you slander your mother’s son.

21I didn’t speak up when you did those things,

so you thought it didn’t matter to me;

but now I’ll charge you

and lay out my case against you. 	Ps 50:16-21

22“Consider this, you that forget about me,

or I’ll tear you to pieces,

and there won’t be anyone to save you.

23Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me;

I’ll show you my deliverance if you keep to my path.” 	Ps 50:22-23

Psalm 51

Psalm for the Choir Director. A Psalm of David,

When Nathan the Prophet Came to Him,

After He’d Slept with Bathsheba

1Be gracious to me, God, in proportion to your enduring love;

according to your great mercy, blot out my transgressions.

2Wash me thoroughly from my sin;

cleanse me from my iniquity.

3I know my failings;

my sin always weighs on my mind.

4I’ve sinned against you and you only;

I did what you consider evil;

so you’re justified in what you say to me,

blameless when you condemn me.	Ps 51:1-4

5I was born in sin;

in iniquity my mother conceived me.

6You want truth in the inward self;

you’ll make me know wisdom in myself.

7Purify me with hyssop, and I’ll be clean;

wash me, and I’ll be whiter than snow.

8Fill me with joy and happiness again,

and let the bones you broke mend up.

9Don’t look at my sins;

blot out my iniquities.	Ps 51:5-9

10Create a clean heart in me, God;

renew a steadfast spirit within me.

11Don’t banish me from your presence

or take your Holy Spirit away from me.

12Restore to me the joy your salvation brings;

grant me a willing attitude to obey.

13Then I’ll teach transgressors your ways;

sinners will be converted to you.

14Deliver me from being guilty of murder

so I can joyfully sing about your goodness.

15LORD, open my lips

so I can express your praises.

16You don’t delight in sacrifice; otherwise, I’d give it;

you’re not pleased with burnt offerings.

17The sacrifice you want is a broken spirit;

you appreciate a repentant heart.

18In your good favor, do good to Zion;

build up the walls around Jerusalem.

19Then you’ll delight in godly sacrifices,

in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;

then young bulls will again be offered on your altar.	Ps 51:10-19

Psalm 52

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,

When Doeg the Edomite Came and Told Saul,

“David has gone to Ahimelech’s house.”

1God’s enduring love lasts all day;

so why brag about sinning, great soldier?

2Your tongue cuts like a razor.

3You like evil more than good,

falsehood more than truth.

4You like words that devour

and a lying tongue that deceives.

5But God will strike you down once and for all;

he’ll pull you out of your tent

and uproot you from the land of the living. 	Ps 52:1-5

6Good people will see it and be amazed;

they’ll laugh at you and say,

7“Look at the men that wouldn’t take refuge in God,

but trusted in their great wealth

and used their strength to destroy.”

8But I’m like a green olive tree in God’s house;

I’ll always trust in his enduring love.

9I’ll be eternally grateful for what he’s done,

and depend on him in front of his holy people

because that’s good.	Ps 52:6-9

Psalm 53

For the Choir Director. Set to Mahalath

A Maskil of David

1Fools tell themselves there’s no God.

They’re corrupt and commit disgusting sins;

none of them does what’s good.

2God looks down from heaven

to see if anybody understands,

if anybody looks to him.

3Every one of them has turned aside and become corrupt;

not a one does what’s good, not a one.	Ps 53:1-3

4Won’t sinners ever learn?

They eat up my people like bread

and don’t pray to me.

5They’ll be in a panic like never before,

because I’ll scatter the bones of your attackers;

you’ll put them to shame because I’ve rejected them.

6Oh that deliverance would come out of Zion!

When I restore the fortunes of my people,

Jacob will celebrate, Israel will be happy.	Ps 53:4-6

Psalm 54

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David,

When the Ziphites Came and Told Saul,

“Isn’t David hiding among us?”

On Stringed Instruments

1Deliver me, God, by your name;

vindicate me by your power.

2Listen to my prayer; hear what I have to say.

3Foreigners have attacked me;

violent people have tried to kill me;

they don’t care about you.

4But God helps me; the LORD sustains my life.

5He pays back my adversaries

and destroys them in his faithfulness.

6I’ll sacrifice to him willingly

and thank him because he’s good.

7He’s delivered me from all my trouble

so I could triumph over my enemies.	Ps 54:1-7

Psalm 55

For the Choir Director. A Maskil of David

On Stringed Instruments

1Hear my prayer, God;

don’t ignore my plea.

2Listen and answer;

trouble has overwhelmed me; I’m distracted

3by the threats of my enemies,

by bringing suffering on me

and bearing angry grudges against me.	Ps 55:1-3

4My heart’s pounding;

terror of death has fallen on me.

5Fear and trembling have come over me;

horror has overwhelmed me.

6I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove!

I’d fly off and find peace.

7I’d flee far away

and lodge out in the countryside.

8I’d hurry to my shelter

from the howling wind and raging storm.”	Ps 55:4-8

9Lord, destroy their plans; confuse their languages,

because all I see is violence and conflict in the city.

10Day and night they patrol the walls,

but sin and scheming threaten inside it.

11Ruin is rampant within it;

oppression and cheating never leave the streets.	Ps 55:9-11

12It’s not an enemy that’s disparaging me;

I could handle that;

it’s not foes that hate me and rise up against me,

I could hide from them.

13But it’s you, my equal,

my companion, my familiar friend.

14We used to be close friends

that walked in God’s Temple together.

15Let death overtake my enemies;

let them go down alive to Sheol,

because there’s evil where they live.	Ps 55:12-15

16I’ll call on the LORD my God to deliver me.

17Morning, noon, and night, he’ll hear my groaning

18and deliver my life in peace from my attackers,

because lots of people are opposing me.

19The One who sits enthroned from of old

will punish the ones that don’t change or respect him.

20As for that companion of mine,

he betrays his friends and breaks his promises

against those who are at peace with him.	 Ps 55:16-20

21His speech is smoother than butter,

but there’s war in his heart;

his words are more soothing than oil,

but secretly they’re drawn daggers.

22Put your burdens on the LORD, and he’ll take care of you;

he won’t let the godly fall.

23You, God, will bring the wicked down to the deepest pit;

bloodthirsty, devious people won’t live half their time,

but I’ll trust in you.	Ps 55:21-23

Psalm 56

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When the Philistines Seized Him in Gath

Set to The Pigeon in Far-Off Terebinths

1Be gracious, God; people are walking all over me,

oppressing me all the time, 2attacking me.

3When I’m afraid, I put my trust in you.

4In you, whose word I praise, I’ve put my trust;

what can mortals do to me?

5All day long they try to frustrate my purposes;

they think up ways to harm me.

6They stir up conflict, they lurk, they watch my every step,

looking for a chance to kill me.

7Because they’re sinful, throw them out;

in anger put them down, God!	Ps 56:1-7

8You’ve kept track of my wanderings

and collected my tears in your bottle;

aren’t they recorded in your scroll?

9My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help;

I know this one thing: you’re with me.

10In God, whose word I praise,

in the LORD, whose word I praise,

11I’ve put my trust so I won’t be afraid;

what can mortals do to me?

12I have to perform my vows to you;

I’ll give thank offerings for your help,

13because you’ve delivered me from death

and my feet from stumbling

so I can walk with you in the light of life.	Ps 56:8-13

Psalm 57

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When He Fled from Saul in the Cave

Set to Do Not Destroy

1Be gracious to me, God,

because I depend on you to protect me;

in the shadow of your wings I take refuge

till danger passes.

2I call out to God Most High,

who accomplishes everything for me;

3he sends help from heaven to rescue me

and discredits whoever tries to run over me. 	Ps 57:1-3

4I live among lions;

I have to lie among those who breathe fire,

people whose teeth are spears and arrows,

whose tongues are sharp swords.

5Be raised up higher than the sky, God;

shine your glory on the whole world.

6They’ve set a trap for me to step in;

they’ve dug a pit for me—I’m weary from stress—

but they’ve fallen into it themselves!	Ps 57:4-6

7My heart is steadfast, God; it’s steadfast;

I’ll sing; yes, I’ll sing praises!

8Wake up, my glory;

wake up, harp and lyre;

I’ll wake up the dawn with my songs.

9I’ll give you thanks, God, among the peoples

and sing praises to you among the nations.

10Your enduring love is as high as the sky;

your truth reaches up to the clouds.

11Be raised up higher than the sky, God;

shine your glory on the whole world.	Ps 57:7-11

Psalm 58

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David

Set to Do Not Destroy

1Leaders, do you decree what’s right?

Do you judge justly?

2No, you plot injustice in your hearts

and spread violence in the land.

3The sinful go astray from the womb;

they lie from the time they’re born.

4They have venom like vipers,

and stop up their ears like deaf cobras

5so they don’t hear their charmers’ voices

or those skilled at casting spells.	Ps 58:1-5

6Pull out their fangs, God;

break the teeth out of the young lions.

7Make them disappear like water that drains away;

make their arrows shafts without points.

8Make sinners be like snails that dissolve as they go along,

like a miscarriage that never sees the sun.

9Before your pots can feel the heat of burning briers;

he’ll sweep them away with a whirlwind,

whether green or on fire.	Ps 58:6-9

10Good people will celebrate when they see God pay them back;

he’ll wash their feet in the sinners’ blood.

11People will say, “There’s surely a reward for good people;

there’s certainly a God that judges on earth!”	Ps 58:10-11

Psalm 59

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

When Saul Sent Men to Watch the House and Kill Him

Set to Do Not Destroy

1Deliver me from my enemies, God;

set me on high away from my attackers.

2Save me from sinners;

rescue me from bloodthirsty people.

3They lie in ambush to kill me;

fierce enemies stir up conflict against me, LORD,

but not for my transgression.

4For no fault of mine, they run to attack me;

get up to see and help me!		Ps 59:1-4

5LORD God of Hosts, God of Israel,

wake up and punish the nations;

don’t extend grace to any that are treacherous.

6They come back in the evening

and roam the city, howling like dogs.

7They growl with their mouth;

they have swords in their lips;

they say, “Who’s going to hear us?”

8But you laugh at them, LORD;

you scoff at the nations.	Ps 59:5-8

9I’ll watch for you, my Strength, my fortress.

10You’ll meet me in your enduring love;

and let me look down in triumph at my enemies.

11Don’t kill them; otherwise, my people will forget;

scatter them with your power

and bring them to their knees, LORD our shield.

12For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips,

catch them in their pride, their curses, and the lies they tell.

13In your anger, destroy them so they’ll be out of the way,

so people will know that you rule in Jacob

and everywhere.

14They come back in the evening

and roam the city, howling like dogs.

15They wander around looking for food

and growl if they’re not satisfied.	Ps 59:9-15

16But I’ll sing about your strength,

every morning about your enduring love.

You’ve been my fortress,

my refuge in trouble.

17I’ll sing praise to you, my Strength,

the God who shows me enduring love.	Ps 59:16-17

Psalm 60

For the Choir Director. A Mikhtam of David,

to teach when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah,

and Joab came back and struck 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt

1You’ve rejected us, God, and broken us;

you’ve been angry, but restore us now.

2You’ve made the land quake; you’ve split it open;

now repair the faults and stop the tremors.

3You’ve made your people endure hardship

and given us wine that makes us stagger.

4You’ve raised a banner for those who respect you

as a rallying point for truth.

5Save us now with your right hand and answer us,

deliver your beloved.	Ps 60:1-5

6In his kindness God has answered;

“I’ll celebrate by dividing up Shechem

and measuring out the Valley of Succoth.

7Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;

Ephraim is my helmet; Jacob is my scepter.

8Moab will be my washbasin;

I’ll scrape off my shoes on Edom

and shout in triumph over Philistia!”	Ps 60:6-8

9Who will take me to a fortified city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

10Have you rejected us, God?

You’re not going out with our armies.

11Help us against our enemies;

we have no hope of human deliverance!

12Through you we can do valiantly;

you’ll tread down our adversaries.	Ps 60:9-12

Psalm 61

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

On Stringed Instruments

1Listen to my prayer, God; hear my prayer.

2With a faint heart I call to you from the end of the earth;

lead me to the rock that’s higher than me.

3You’re my refuge, my strong tower against the enemy.

4Let me live in your tent forever

and take shelter under your wings.

5You’ve heard my vows, God,

and given me the inheritance that comes to those who respect you.

6Lengthen the king’s life;

make his lifetime like many generations.

7Have him sit enthroned in your presence forever;

appoint enduring love and truth to preserve him.

8I’ll sing praise to you forever

as I pay my vows each day.	Ps 61:1-8

Psalm 62

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Jeduthun

1I wait for God alone

because my victory comes from him.

2He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;

I won’t be shaken.

3How long will youpl assail me

so you can murder me,

like a leaning wall or crumbling fence?

4Your only intention is to knock me down;

you enjoy lying about me;

you bless out loud but curse inside.	Ps 62:1-4

5My soul, wait in silence for God

because my hope lies only in him.

6He alone is my rock, my salvation, my fortress;

I won’t be shaken.

7My deliverance and glory rest with him,

my strong rock and refuge.

8Always trust him, people;

pour out your heart to him, our refuge.	Ps 62:5-8

9Common people have no value;

the powerful aren’t what they seem.

Either one rises higher in the balances;

they’re both lighter than air.

10Don’t put confidence in extortion;

don’t place empty hopes in stealing.

If wealth does increase, don’t set your heart on it.

11God has spoken once;

I’ve heard it twice

that power belongs to God

12and the LORD has enduring love;

he pays people according to their work.	Ps 62:9-12

Psalm 63

A Psalm of David,

When He Was in the Wilderness of Judah

1God, you’re my God; I look to you in earnest;

my soul thirsts for you;

my flesh yearns for you in this dry, weary land.

2So I’ve looked at you in the sanctuary

and seen your power and glory.

3 I’ll praise you

because your enduring love is better than life;

4I’ll bless you as long as I live

and lift up my hands in your name.

5You satisfy my soul like the finest food;

I offer praises gladly.	Ps 63:1-5

6I remember you when I’m in bed;

I think about you during the night.

7You’ve been my help;

I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.

8My soul clings to you;

your right hand upholds me.

9But those who are trying to destroy me

will end up in the ground.

10The sword will overwhelm them;

they’ll become prey for foxes.

11But the king will celebrate in God;

everybody that swears by him will glory

while liars’ mouths will be stopped.	Ps 63:6-11

Psalm 64

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1Listen to my complaint, God;

keep me from living in dread of my enemies.

2Hide me from the secret plots of bad people,

from the schemes of sinners

3that sharpen their tongue like a sword,

that aim bitter words like arrows,

4that shoot at innocent people from hiding places,

and do it suddenly without qualms.

5They latch onto sinful purposes

and talk secretly about setting traps;

they say, “Who will notice?”

6They look for ways to be unjust,

“We’re ready with a well-conceived plot,”

because the human mind and heart are cunning.	Ps 64:1-6

7But God will wound them with an arrow

8and make them trip over their tongues!

Everybody that sees them will shake their heads.

9Then everybody will be respectful

and talk about what God’s done

and ponder what he’s made.

10Good people will be happy in the LORD

and take refuge in him;

the godly in heart will honor him.	Ps 64:7-10

Psalm 65

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

A Song

5You answer us with awesome deeds, God who keeps us safe,

who is trusted in every land and the farthest sea.

6You established the mountains by your power

and dressed yourself with strength,

7you that still the roaring seas

and the disturbances among the nations.

8They who live at the ends of the earth

stand in awe at your wonders;

you make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.	Ps 65:5-8

9You take care of the earth and water it;

you greatly enrich the ground and provide the water

to grow the grain;

that’s how you’ve ordained things to work.

10You water the plowed ground abundantly and level its ridges;

you soften its clods with showers and bless its growth.

11You crown the year with abundant harvests;

paths get overgrown with lush vegetation.

12The pastures in the countryside drip with dew;

the hills blossom with rejoicing.

13The meadows are clothed with flocks;

the valleys are covered with grain;

they shout and sing for joy.	Ps 65:9-13

Psalm 66

For the Choir Director. A Psalm. A Song

1Make a joyful sound to God, all the earth.

2Sing about his honor;

make his praise glorious.

3Say to him, “What you do is so awesome!

Your enemies feign obedience to you

out of fear for your power.

4All the earth worships you and praises you;

they sing praises to you.”	Ps 66:1-4

5Come and see what God has done;

it’s awesome what he’s done for people.

6He turned the Red Sea into dry ground;

the people crossed through the Jordan on foot;

they celebrated over him there.

7He rules by his power forever;

he keeps watch over the nations;

the rebellious don’t make an uprising.	Ps 66:5-7

8Bless our God, you nations;

sound his praise abroad.

9He keeps us alive

and doesn’t let our feet slip.

10You’ve tried us, God,

and refined us like silver.

11You caught us in your net

and laid a heavy load in our lap.

12You put a ruler over us

and passed us through fire and water;

yet you brought us out into a large place.

13I’ll come to your Temple with burnt offerings

and keep the vows 14I made when I was in trouble.

15I’ll offer you burnt offerings of healthy animals

with the smoke of rams;

I’ll offer bulls and male goats.	Ps 66:8-15

16Come and listen, you that respect God,

and I’ll tell you what he’s done for me.

17I appealed to him with my mouth

and extolled him with my tongue.

18If I cherish sinfulness in my heart,

the LORD won’t hear me.

19But he’s certainly heard me;

he’s listened to my prayer.

20Bless God,

who hasn’t ignored my prayer

or withdrawn his enduring love.	Ps 66:16-20

Psalm 67

For the Choir Director. A Psalm. A Song

With Stringed Instruments

1God, be gracious and bless us;

smile at us

2so every nation can know your way

and your saving power.

3May the nations praise you;

may they all praise you.

4May they be happy and sing

because you judge them justly

and guide them.

5May the nations praise you, God;

may they all praise you.

6The earth has yielded its produce;

God, our God, has blessed us

7so everyone everywhere will respect him.	Ps 67:1-7

Psalm 68

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

A Song

1Arise, God, scatter your enemies;

chase off those who hate you!

2Blow them away like smoke;

melt them like wax near fire;

make sinners perish in your presence.

3But may good people be happy,

delight in your presence,

celebrate and be glad.

4So sing to God, sing praises to him;

lay out a highway for the One that rides through deserts,

whose name is Yah,

and celebrate with him. 	Ps 68:1-4

5God in his holy Temple

is a father for the fatherless and a judge for widows;

6he makes a home for the lonely

and leads prisoners out to prosperity;

only the rebellious live in a parched land.

7God of Israel, when you went out ahead of your people

and marched through the desert,

8the ground shook,

the sky poured down rain,

Sinai itself quaked in front of you.

9You sent widespread, abundant rain, God,

and refreshed your inheritance when it was parched.

10The animals settled in it;

in your goodness you provided for the poor.	Ps 68:5-10

11The Lord gives the command,

and a host of women sing the good news:

12“Kings and their armies flee

the women that stayed home divide the spoil!”

13Even those who stayed among the flocks found treasure

like the wings of a dove covered with silver

and pinions covered with glistening gold.

14The Almighty scattered the enemy kings there

like blowing snow in Zalmon.

15The mountain in Bashan is majestic,

a mountain range with many peaks.

16Mountain with many peaks, why do you look with envy

at the mountain God wanted for his home?

He’ll certainly live there forever.

17God had twice ten thousand chariots, thousands upon thousands;

Yahveh came with them from Sinai to the holy place.

18When you ascended on high and led captivityLXX captive,

and received gifts among people, even rebellious people—

so Yahveh God might live there.

Ps 68:11-18

19Bless Yahveh, who carries our burdens every day,

who keeps us safe 20and rescues us;

deliverance from death comes from Yahveh the Lord.

21He’ll bash in the heads of his enemies,

the hairy crowns of those who keep doing their guilty deeds.

22The Lord said, “I’ll bring them down from Bashan

and bring them up from the ocean depths

23so you can wash your feet in their blood

and your dogs can have their share of your enemies.”	Ps 68:19-23

24They’ve seen your solemn procession, God,

the procession of God, my King, into the sanctuary—

25singers first, then musicians,

with young women playing tambourines.

26Bless God as a community,

Yahveh, the fountain of Israel.

27There’s Benjamin, the youngest, leading them,

the officials of Judah in the throng,

the officials of Zebulun and Naphtali.

28Summon your strength, God;

show us your power like you have before.

29Kings will bring you gifts

because of your Temple in Jerusalem.

30Scare off the beast that lives in the reeds,

the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.

Trample underfoot its bars of silver;

scatter the nations that delight in war.

31Let envoys bring gifts out of Egypt;

let Nubia quickly submit to God.	Ps 68:24-31

32Sing to God, kingdoms on earth;

sing praises to Yahveh,

33that rides high in the ancient sky,

that thunders out his loud voice.

34Attribute power to God,

whose majesty shines on Israel,

whose strength is displayed in the sky.

35He’s awesome in his sanctuary;

the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.

Bless God!	Ps 68:32-35

Psalm 69

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

Set to Lilies

1Save me, God;

I’m in water up to my neck!

2I’ve sunk in deep mud, where there’s no foothold;

a flood is sweeping over me.

3I’m worn out from crying; my throat’s dry;

my eyes are red from crying, waiting for my God.

4The people that hate me for no reason

outnumber the hairs on my head;

those who want to destroy me are powerful;

they’re trying to make me repay what I didn’t steal.	Ps 69:1-4

5God, you know about my foolish choices;

I can’t hide the things I’ve done wrong.

6May those who put their hope in you

not be disgraced because of me;

may the ones who look to you

not be dishonored by what I’ve done;

7because I’ve endured humiliation for your sake;

I have shame written all over my face.

8I’m alienated from my brothers;

my mother’s sons treat me like a foreigner.

9I’m consumed with zeal for your Temple;

the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.

10When I humble myself with fasting, they mock me;

11when I wear burlap, they make my name a byword.

12Those who sit in the city gate talk about me;

drunks make up songs about me.	Ps 69:5-12

13But, I pray to you, LORD;

at an acceptable time, in your great enduring love,

answer me with your sure salvation.

14Save me from sinking in the mud;

deliver me from my enemies and from deep water.

15May the flood not overwhelm me

or the deep drown me

or the Pit close over me.	Ps 69:13-15

16Answer me, LORD, because your enduring love is good;

turn to me according to your great mercy.

17Don’t abandon me,

because I’m in distress; answer me quickly.

18Come close to my soul and redeem it;

ransom me from my enemies.

19You know my disgrace, shame, and dishonor;

all my adversaries stand in your presence.	Ps 69:16-19

20Insults have broken my heart; I’m heartsick.

I looked for sympathy, but there wasn’t any,

and for comforters, but I couldn’t find any.

21Instead, they gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink.

22May their table become a snare

and their peace a trap.

23May their eyes go blind

and their loins tremble feebly.

24Pour out indignation on them;

overwhelm them with furious anger.

25Make their camp desolate

and their tents deserted.

26They persecute the one you yourself have struck;

they strike even more the ones you’ve already wounded.

27Pile their sins high;

don’t let them experience your goodness.

28Erase them from the Book of Life;

don’t enroll them with the godly.	Ps 69:20-28

29I’m miserable with pain;

save me, God; set me safely up high.

30I’ll praise God with song

and magnify him with thanksgiving.

31That will please the LORD more

than a young bull with horns and hoofs.

32The humble will see it and be happy;

you that look to God for help will revive your hearts.

33The LORD listens to the needy;

he doesn’t look down on his imprisoned people.	Ps 69:29-33

34Let earth and sky praise him,

the seas and everything that’s in them.

35God will save Zion and rebuild the towns in Judah

so the people can settle there and own it.

36The descendants of his servants will inherit it;

those who love him will live there.	Ps 69:34-36

Psalm 70

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

for a Memorial

1Hurry and deliver me, LORD;

come quick to help me.

2Discredit those who want to kill me;

turn them back and

dishonor the people that delight in harming me.

3Because of their disgrace,

turn them back those who say, “Aha, Aha.”

4May the ones that depend on you be happy in you;

may those who love your deliverance repeatedly say,

“God is great.”

5But I’m poor and needy, LORD!

you’re my deliverer; don’t delay.	Ps 70:1-5

Psalm 71

1I’ve taken refuge in you, LORD;

don’t let me be discredited.

2In your goodness, rescue me;

listen to me and save me.

3Be my rock of refuge that I can always go to;

give orders to save me

because you’re my rock and fortress.

4Rescue me from sinners,

from the grasp of cruel men.

5You’re my hope, Lord GOD,

my confidence since I was young.

6the One that took me from my mother’s womb

and sustained me since I was born.	Ps 71:1-6

7Many have marveled over me

because you’ve been my strong refuge.

8I’m full of your praise

and glory all the time.

9Don’t set me aside in my old age

or leave me as my strength begins to fail.

10My enemies speak against me;

they who want to kill me consult with each other,

11“God has left him.

Let’s go get him;

he doesn’t have anybody to defend him.”	Ps 71:7-11

12God, stay close by to help me.

13Consume my adversaries with shame;

cover their faces with dishonor that try to harm me.

14But I’ll keep hoping

and praising you on and on.

15I’ll tell about your goodness

and how many times you’ve saved me,

though I can’t count how often that’s happened.

16I’ll praise the great deeds of the Lord GOD

and tell about the goodness you alone have.	Ps 71:12-16

17You’ve been teaching me since I was young;

I still talk about your wonderful deeds.

18Even when I’m old and grey, don’t leave me, LORD,

till I tell this generation about your strength

and future people about your power.

19Your goodness is as high as the sky,

you that have done great things.

Who is like you?

20You let me face troubles and distresses,

but you revive me afterwards

and lift me out of deep despair.

21You increase your greatness toward me

and comfort me once again.

22I’ll praise you with a harp for your faithfulness, my God;

and sing praises with a lyre, you Holy One of Israel.

23I’ll shout for joy when I sing to you;

my soul that you’ve redeemed will praise you.

24I’ll talk about your goodness,

because the ones that were trying to harm me

have been discredited.	Ps 71:17-24

Psalm 72

A Psalm of Solomon

1Give the king your judgments, God;

give your goodness to his son.

2May he judge your people fairly,

your oppressed ones with justice.

3Let the mountains bring prosperity to the people;

may the hills bring goodness.

4May he defend the downtrodden,

save the children of the needy,

and crush their oppressors.	Ps 72:1-4

5Let them respect you as long as the sun lasts,

as long as the moon endures—throughout all generations.

6May the king rule like rain on mown grass,

like showers that water the ground.

7May good people flourish in his time

and have abundant peace till the moon disappears.	Ps 72:5-7

8May he rule from sea to sea,

from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

9Let desert nomads bow to him,

and his enemies lick dust.

10Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring presents,

and the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.

11Let all kings bow to him

and every nation serve him.

12He’ll deliver the needy when they call for help,

the oppressed with no one to help them.

13He’ll have mercy on the poor and needy

and save their lives.

14He’ll rescue them from oppression and violence;

their blood is precious to him;

15so may they live long and receive the gold of Sheba;

let them pray to him continually

and bless him all day long.	Ps 72:6-15

16May grain be abundant in the land;

may it wave on tops of the hills.

May it produce like Lebanon;

may its people blossom in the city like grass in the pasture.

17May the king’s name last forever

and grow as long as the sun shines.

Let people bless themselves by him

and all nations call him blessed.

18Bless the LORD, the God of Israel,

who alone does wonderful things.

19Bless his glorious name forever;

may the whole world be full of his glory.

Amen and Amen.

BOOK 3

Psalm 73

A Psalm of Asaph

1God is good to Israel,

to those whose hearts are pure.

2I’d almost stumbled; my steps almost slipped;

3because I envied the prosperity of the arrogant.

4They don’t seem to suffer when they die;

their bodies are healthy and well.

5They don’t have trouble like other people;

they aren’t stricken like everyone else.

6So pride is the gold chain around their neck;

violence is their clothes.

7Their eyes are puffy with fatness;

they have everything they could want.

8They mock, and talk about oppressing,

and talk down to the oppressed.

9They brag against the sky itself;

their words strut across the world.	Ps 73:1-9

10So his people turn to them

and drink in all their claims.

11They say, “How does God know any of this?

Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”

12They’re the sinful,

always at ease as their wealth grows.

13It seems like I’ve kept my heart pure for nothing

and washed my hands in innocence for no reason,

14because I’m stricken all day

and endure grief every morning.	Ps 73:10-14

15If I’d talked the way I felt,

I’d have betrayed your people.

16When I tried to understand why sinners prosper,

I was troubled by it

17till I went to God’s sanctuary;

then I understood their destiny.

18You put them on slippery places

and make them slide into ruin.

19They’re quickly destroyed,

completely swept away by sudden desolation!

20They’re like dreamers when they wake up, LORD;

their phantoms disappear.	Ps 73:15-20

21When I was bitter and in turmoil inside,

22I was senseless and ignorant

like an animal in your presence.

23Nevertheless, I’m continually with you;

you’ve taken me by the hand.

24You’ll guide me with your advice

and afterward receive me into glory.

25Who do I have in heaven but you?

I want you more than anything on earth.

26My own flesh and heart may grow weak,

but you’re my strength and portion forever.

27Those who are far from you perish;

you destroy those who are not faithful to you.

28Your nearness to me is good for me;

I’ve made you my refuge

so I can tell everybody how you operate.	Ps 73:21-28

Psalm 74

A Maskil of Asaph

1Why have you thrown us away forever, God?

Why does your anger smoke at the sheep in your pasture?

2Remember your community that you bought so long ago,

that you redeemed as a tribe for your heritage,

Mount Zion, where you’ve lived.

3Direct your attention to its continuing ruins;

the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary.

4Your adversaries have roared in your sanctuary

and set up their own standards for signs.

5It’s like someone that used an axe in a forest;

6they broke down its carved work with hatchets and hammers.

7They burned the sanctuary to the ground

and defiled your home.

8They said to themselves, “We’ll completely subdue them”;

they set fire to your meeting places in the land.

9We don’t see miraculous signs anymore;

there aren’t any prophets;

nobody knows how long this will last.

10How long will your adversaries scoff, God,

and mock you? Forever?

11Why hold back from doing something?

Why keep your right hand against your chest?	Ps 74:1-11

12Yet you’re my king from ancient times,

who provided deliverance on the earth.

13You divided the sea by your power

and bashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.

14You crushed Leviathan’s heads

and made it into food for animals in the open country.

15You opened springs and torrents,

and dried up flowing rivers.

16Day and night belong to you;

you put the sun and stars in place.

17You established boundaries for the land

and marked out summer and winter.	Ps 74:12-17

18Remember, LORD, that your enemies are scorning you;

foolish people are ridiculing you.

19Don’t deliver your turtledove to a wild animal;

don’t forget forever the life of your hurting people.

20Have regard for your covenant

because the land is filled with violent places.

21Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed;

let the poor and needy praise you.

22Stand up for youirself, God;

remember how foolish people scoff at you all day long.

23Don’t forget the clamor of your adversaries,

the constant uproar of those who rebel against you.	Ps 74:18-23

Psalm 75

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

A Song; Set to Do Not Destroy

1Thank you, God, for being close by;

people declare your wonderful deeds.

2“When I set a time for judgment;

I’ll judge even-handedly.

3The earth and everybody in it melt;

I’m the One that firmly set its pillars.

4I said to people that brag, ‘Stop it,’

and to sinners, ‘Don’t lift up your horns;

5don’t raise them up high

or talk with such arrogance.’”	Ps 75:1-5

6Exaltation doesn’t come from the east or west,

7but from God, the judge;

he puts one person down and raises another up.

8There’s a cup of foaming wine in his hand;

he has mixed it well and pours it out;

sinners have to drain it and drink its dregs.

9I’ll sing praise to Jacob’s God;

I’ll declare it forever.

10He’ll cut off the horns of the wicked,

but lift up the righteous. 	Ps 75:6-10

Psalm 76

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

A Song. On Stringed Instruments

1God is known in Judah;

his name is great in Israel.

2His home is in Salem;

he lives on Zion.

3He has broken flaming arrows there,

shields, swords, and weapons of war.

4You’re glorious, more majestic

than mountains full of beasts of prey.

5Our stouthearted enemies have been stripped of their spoil;

they’ve sunk into deep sleep;

none of the soldiers could raise a hand against us.

6At your rebuke, God of Jacob,

horse and rider were thrown down into dead sleep.

7You’re to be respected;

who can withstand you when you’re angry?	Ps 76:1-7

8You rendered judgment from heaven;

the earth lay silent in fear

9when you arose to measure out judgment,

to save the oppressed on earth.

10People’s wrath only heightens your honor;

you dress yourself with the ashes of their anger.

11Make your vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them;

let everyone bring gifts to the One they need to respect.

12He breaks the pride of princes;

kings on earth respect him.	Ps 76:8-12

Psalm 77

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to Jeduthun

1I raise my voice up to God; I call out loud;

it rises to him so he’ll hear me.

2When trouble comes, I turn to the LORD for help.

All night I reach out to him,

but I get no reassurance.

3When I think about him, I’m shaken;

I sigh and feel faint.

4He won’t let me sleep;

I’m in such distress I can’t pray.

5I think about days gone by, years ago.

6I remember singing during the night,

meditating and pondering in my mind.	Ps 77:1-6

7Will the LORD reject me forever now?

Won’t he ever be kind to me again?

8Has his enduring love stopped permanently?

Have his promises come to an end?

9Has he forgotten to be gracious?

In his anger has he withdrawn his mercy?

10I said, “It’s my destiny

that the LORD has turned against me.”

11Then I reconsider what all you’ve done, LORD,

and recall your wonders from of old.

12I think about everything you do.

13Your way is holy;

What god is as great as you?

14You work wonders

and demonstrate your power among the nations.

15You’ve rescued your people by your strength,

descendants of Jacob and Joseph.	Ps 77:7-15

16When the water faced you, God,

it tremored to its depths.

17Clouds poured down water;

the sky thundered;

your arrows flashed.

18You thundered in the whirlwind;

lightning flashes lit up the landscape;

the ground shook.

19You went through the sea;

your path led into deep water,

but your footprints didn’t show.

20You led your people like a flock

by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	Ps 77:16-20

Psalm 78

Maskil of Asaph

1Listen to my instruction, my people;

pay attention to what I’m saying.

2I’ll tell a parable and offer hidden truths from our history,

3things we’ve heard and known from our ancestors.

4We won’t keep them from our children;

we’ll tell the next generation what we praise the LORD for:

his strength, the amazing things he’s done.	Ps 78:1-4

5He established a Testimony in Jacob

and appointed a Law in Israel,

one that he commanded our ancestors

to teach their children;

6so the coming generation would know—

children not yet born—

so they’d grow up and tell their children

7to put their confidence in God,

not forget what he’s done,

and keep his commands.

8They weren’t to be like their ancestors,

stubborn and rebellious,

who didn’t prepare their heart,

whose spirit wasn’t faithful to God.

9The Ephraimites were archers equipped with bows;

yet they retreated in battle.

10They didn’t keep God’s covenant

or follow his Law.	Ps 78:5-10

11They forgot what he’d done,

the miracles he’d shown them.

12He performed wonders for their ancestors to see

in Egypt and in the plain of Zoan.

13He divided the sea so they could pass through it

and made the water stand in a pile.

14He led them with a cloud in the daytime

and the light of fire at night.

15He split rocks open in the desert

to give them drinking water in abundance.

16He brought streams out of rock

and made water run like a river.

17Yet they continued to sin against him,

to rebel against the Most High in the desert.

18In their heart they put him to trial

by asking for food they’d like better.

19They spoke against him

“Can God prepare a table in the desert?

20He struck the rock, and water gushed out

and streams overflowed.

Can he give us bread too?

Can he feed us meat?”	Ps 78:11-20

21When the LORD heard it, he was furious;

his wrath burned like fire against Jacob;

his anger flared at Israel

22because they didn’t believe in him

or trust in him to deliver them.

23Yet he commanded the clouds above

and opened the doors in the sky,

24and rained down manna on them

and gave them bread from the sky to eat.

25People ate the bread of angels;

God sent them food in abundance.

26He made the east wind blow

and directed the south wind by his power.

27When he rained meat on them as plentiful as dust—

winged fowl as abundant as sand by the sea—

28he let them fall in the camp around the tents.	Ps 78:21-28

29So they ate their fill of what they craved.

30Before they’d satisfied their desire,

while their food was in their mouths,

31God’s anger swelled up against them;

he killed their strongest

and cut down Israel’s picked men.

32In spite of that, they still sinned

and didn’t believe in his wonderful deeds.

33So he brought their days to an end in futility,

their years in terror.	Ps 78:29-33

34When he started taking their lives,

they finally repented and turned to  him diligently.

35They remembered that he was their rock,

that the Most High God was their redeemer.

36But they tried to flatter him and lie to him

37because they weren’t being honest with him

or faithful to his covenant.

38But in his mercy, he forgave their sin

and didn’t destroy them;

he often restrained his anger

and didn’t express all his wrath.

39He remembered that they were mortal,

wind that blows and doesn’t return.

40How often they rebelled against him in the desert

and grieved him there!

41Again and again they tested him

and pained the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 78:34-41

42They didn’t keep in mind his power

or his rescuing them from their foe

43as when he performed his signs in Egypt

and his miracles in the plain of Zoan:

44he turned their streams to blood

so they couldn’t drink from them;

45he sent swarms of flies that devoured them

and frogs to devour them;

46he gave their crops to caterpillars

and the product from their labor to locusts;

47he destroyed their grapevines with hail

and their sycamore-figs with sleet;

48he exposed their cattle to hailstones

and their flocks to lightning bolts;

49he let loose his hot anger on them:

fury, indignation, and distress—

a band of destroying messengers;

50he directed his anger against them,

not sparing them from plague and death;

51he struck Egypt’s firstborn,

the oldest sons in the tents of Ham.

52Then he led his own people out like sheep

and guided them in the desert like a flock.

53He led them safely so they weren’t afraid,

but the sea drowned their enemies.	Ps 78:42-53

54He brought them to his holy land,

to this hill country that he’d won.

55He drove out the nations in front of them,

divided up the land for an inheritance,

and enabled the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.

56Yet they tested him and rebelled against the Most High God,

and didn’t observe his testimonies.

57They were as unreliable as a crooked bow.

58They provoked him with their high places

and aroused his jealousy with their carved images.	Ps 78:54-58

59When God heard it, he was angry

and came to abhor Israel.

60So he abandoned his house in Shiloh,

the Tabernacle he’d pitched among them.

61He let his powerful Ark be captured

and surrendered his honor to the adversary.

62He allowed the sword to destroy his people

and vented his anger on his inheritance.

63Fire consumed his young men;

virgins had no wedding songs.

64His priests fell by the sword,

and widows couldn’t weep.	Ps 78:59-64

65Then the LORD woke up as from sleeping,

like a soldier aroused from drunkenness.

66He routed his adversaries

and put them to eternal shame.

67He rejected Joseph’s descendants

and chose not to keep the tribe of Ephraim,

68but chose Judah, Mount Zion that he loved.

69He built his sanctuary as high as the sky,

as enduring as the earth.

70He chose David his servant,

took him from the sheepfolds,

71from tending ewes that had young

to shepherding Jacob his people,

Israel his inheritance.

72He shepherded them with a godly heart

and led them with skillful hands.	Ps 78:65-72

Psalm 79

A Psalm of Asaph

1Other nations have invaded your inheritance, God;

they’ve defiled your holy Temple

and laid Jerusalem in ruins.

2They’ve given the buzzards your servants’ corpses,

and the wild animals the flesh of your holy people.

3They’ve poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem;

there wasn’t anybody to bury them.

4We’ve become a disgrace to our neighbors,

mocked and derided by the people around us.

5LORD, will you be angry forever?

Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?	Ps 79:1-5

6Pour out your wrath on nations that don’t know you,

that don’t call on you;

7they’ve devastated Jacob and laid waste his realm.

8Don’t hold our ancestors’ sins against us;

bring us mercy quickly because we’re in despair.

9For your honor, help us, God who delivers;

forgive our sins for your name’s sake.

10Why should the nations say, “Where’s their God?”

Show those nations your vengeance

for your servants’ blood that they shed.

11Listen to the moaning prisoner;

with your great power save those doomed to die.

12Repay our neighbors seven times over

for the taunts they’ve leveled at you, LORD,

13so we, your people, the sheep in your pasture,

can be eternally grateful to you

and recount your praise to all generations.	Ps 79:6-13

Psalm 80

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to Lilies; A Testimony

1Listen, Shepherd of Israel,

you that lead Joseph like a flock;

show your glory,

you that are enthroned above the cherubs.

2Stir up your power against Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh;

and come to rescue us.

3Restore us, God;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:1-3

4LORD God of Hosts,

how long will you be angry with our prayers?

5You’ve fed us tears

and made us drink them in full measure.

6You made us a taunt to our neighbors;

they laugh at us among themselves.

7God of Hosts, restore us;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:4-7

8You took a grapevine out of Egypt,

drove out the Canaanite nations,

and planted it in their land.

9You cleared the ground for it;

it took deep root and spread across the whole land.

10It covered the mountains with its shadow

and God’s cedars with its branches.

11It grew its branches all the way out to the Mediterranean Sea,

its shoots as far as the Euphrates River.

12Why did you tear down its walls

so everybody that goes by can pick its fruit?

13A boar from the woods roots it up;

whatever moves in the countryside feeds on it.	Ps 80:8-13

14God of Hosts, please come back now;

look down from heaven and take care of this grapevine,

15the root you planted,

the son you’ve raised for your use.

16Our enemies have cut it down and burned it;

may they perish at the rebuke from your angry look.

17Encourage the man at your right hand,

the son you made strong for yourself.

18Then we won’t turn away from you anymore;

revive us so we can call on you again.

19LORD God of Hosts, restore us;

look at us with favor so we’ll be saved.	Ps 80:14-19

Psalm 81

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of Asaph

Set to The Gittith

1Sing to God your Strength;

make a joyful sound to Jacob’s God.

2Sing, beat the tambourine,

pluck the lyre and harp.

3At the new moons blow your ram’s horn,

at the full moon and on your festival days.

4It’s a statute for Israel,

an ordinance from Jacob’s God.

5He established it as a Testimony in Joseph

when he displayed his power all over Egypt.

I heard a language I didn’t know, saying.	Ps 81:1-5

6“I’ll take the burden off your shoulders

and free you from heavy labor.

7You cried out in trouble, and I rescued you;

I answered you while I concealed myself in a thundercloud;

I tested you when you had no water at Meribah.

8Listen, my people, when I admonish you;

Israel, if only you’ll listen!

9There’s to be no foreign god among you;

don’t worship any alien deity.

10I’m the LORD your God

who brought you out of Egypt.

Open your mouth, and I’ll fill it.”	Ps 81:6-10

11“But my people ignored me;

Israel wouldn’t obey.

12So I let them follow their stubborn heart

and go after their own devices.

13If only they’d listen!

If Israel would just follow my ways,

14I’d quickly subdue their enemies;

I’d turn my hand against their foes,

15I’d doom forever

those who hate me while pretending to obey me.

16I want to feed you with the finest wheat

and satisfy you with wild honey from the rocky cliffs.”	Ps 81:11-16

Psalm 82

A Psalm of Asaph

1God presides over the divine council

and judges you judges.

2So how long will youpl judge unjustly

by showingpl partiality to lawbreakers?

3Renderpl justice to the weak and fatherless;

standpl up for the oppressed and destitute.

4Rescuepl the weak and needy;

deliverpl them from bad people. 	Ps 82:1-4

5You don’t know or understand;

You’re walking around in the dark;

the very foundations of your world are unstable.

6I say, “You’re gods,

children of the Most High,

7but you’ll die like other mortals

and fall like anyone else.”

8You judge the world, God!

You’re the One that owns the nations.	Ps 82:5-8

Psalm 83

A Song. A Psalm of Asaph

1God, don’t keep quiet; don’t be silent.

2Your enemies are making an uproar;

those who hate you are exalting themselves.

3They’re plotting against your people,

conspiring against them 4and saying,

“Let’s wipe out their nation

so no one will remember them anymore.”

5Together they’re signing a treaty against you:

6Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;

7Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;

Philistia and the people in Tyre;

8Assyria has joined them too;

they’re allied with Lot’s descendants.	Ps 83:1-8

9Deal with them like you dealt with Midian,

with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River,

10that you destroyed at En-dor,

that became like manure on the ground.

11Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb

and their officials like Zebah and Zalmunna,

12who said, “Let’s take over God’s pastures.”	Ps 83:9-12

13Make them like whirling dust,

like chaff in the wind.

14Like a wildfire that burns a whole forest,

like a flame that sets mountains on fire;

15chase them with your storm;

terrify them with your tempest.

16Write shame all over their faces

till they submit to you, LORD.

17Frighten them forever;

let them die in disgrace

18so they’ll know that you

are supreme over the whole world.	Ps 83:13-18

Psalm 84

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

Set to The Gittith

1Your Temple is so beautiful, LORD of Hosts!

2I long, yes, even faint with longing for your courts;

my body and soul sing for joy to the living God.

3Even a sparrow finds a home for herself,

a swallow builds a nest to raise her young

near your altars, LORD of Hosts, my God and King.

4How blessed they are who live in your Temple

and continually sing your praises.

5How blessed people are whose strength comes from you,

who’ve resolved to make pilgrimages to Zion!

6As they pass through the Valley of Weeping,

they turn it into a spring;

autumn rains cover it with blessings.

7They grow from strength to more strength

till each one appears before God in Zion.	Ps 84:1-7

8LORD God of Hosts, listen to my prayer;

listen to me, God of Jacob!

9Extend your favor to the shield

you anointed over us,

10because one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.

I’d rather stand at the threshold of your Temple

than live at ease in the tents of sinners,

11because the LORD is sun and shield,

who gives grace and honor

and doesn’t withhold anything good from those who do what’s right.

12LORD of Hosts, how blessed they are who trust in you! 	Ps 84:8-12

Psalm 85

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1LORD, you blessed your land;

you restored the fortunes of Jacob;

2you forgave your people’s iniquity

and pardoned their sins;

3you withdrew your fury

and turned away from your hot anger.

4Restore us, our Deliverer;

end your displeasure with us.

5Will you be angry with us forever?

Will you extend your wrath to every generation?

6Won’t you revive us

so we can celebrate over you?

7Show us your enduring love, LORD;

grant us your salvation.	Ps 85:1-7

8I’ll listen to what our God the LORD says,

because he offers peace to his holy people,

those who avoid foolish behavior.

9His salvation is nearby for those who respect him,

so there can be honor in our land.

10Truth and enduring love combine;

goodness and peace kiss each other.

11Faithfulness grows up from the ground,

and goodness looks down from the sky.

12The LORD gives what’s good

so our land can yield its produce.

13Goodness goes ahead of him

and makes his footprints into a path.	Ps 85:8-13

Psalm 86

A Prayer of David

1Listen, LORD, and answer me

because I’m troubled and in need.

2Preserve my life because I’m a godly man;

save me because I trust in you.

3Be gracious to me

because I call out to you all the time.

4Make me happy

because I hold up my life to you.

5You’re good, ready to forgive,

and abundant in enduring love

to everyone that calls on you.

6Hear my prayer, LORD;

listen to my petition.

7When I’m in trouble, I call on you

because you answer me.

8There’s no one like you among the gods,

no other deeds like yours.

9All the nations you’ve made will come

to worship you and honor you,

10because you’re great and do great things;

only you are God.	Ps 86:1-10

11Teach me your way;

I’ll follow your truth;

make me consistently respect you.

12I’ll thank you, LORD my God, with all my heart

and honor you forever

13because you show me such enduring love;

you’ve rescued me from the depths of Sheol.	Ps 86:11-13

14Arrogant people are attacking me, God;

a gang of violent men wants to kill me;

they don’t care about you.

15But you’re a merciful, gracious God,

slow to get angry

and abundant in enduring love and faithfulness.

16Turn to me and be gracious;

give me your strength;

save your servant’s son.

17Show me a sign of your favor

so the ones that hate me can see it and be put to shame,

because you’ve helped me and reassured me.	Ps 86:14-17

Psalm 87

A Song. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah

1The city that the LORD founded stands on his holy mountain;

2he loves Zion more than the other places in Jacob.

3Glorious things are said about you, city of God.

4“I’ll count Rahab [Egypt] and Babylon among those who know me,

Philistia, Tyre, and Nubia too:

‘They’ve become citizens there,’” people will say.

5But they will say about Zion,

“This one and that one were born here”;

the Most High himself has made it so.

6When the LORD registers the nations,

he’ll say, “They’ve all become citizens here.”

7Then those who sing and those who play flutes will say,

“The springs of all our joy are in you.”	Ps 87:1-7

A Maskil of Herman the Ezrahite

1LORD God who keeps me safe,

I call out to you day and night.

2Let my prayer come to you;

listen to my call!

3I’ve had so much trouble;

I’m close to Sheol.

4I’m as good as dead,

like someone with no strength left.

5Abandoned among the dead

like someone slain in the grave,

I’m forgotten and cut off from you.

6You’ve put me in the Pit,

in regions dark and deep.

7Your anger overwhelms me;

wave after wave weighs heavily on me.

8You’ve made my friends avoid me

by making me someone they detest;

I’m trapped and can’t escape.

9My sight is blurry from tears;

I call on you every day, LORD,

and reach out to you for help.	Ps 88:1-9

10Do you perform wonders for the dead?

Do departed spirits rise and praise you?

11Do they declare your enduring love in the grave

or your faithfulness in the place of destruction?

12Are your wonders known in the dark

or your goodness in the land of forgetfulness?	Ps 88:10-12

13LORD, I call out to you for help;

in the mornings my prayers go up to you.

14Why are you rejecting me?

Why are you hiding from me?

15I’ve been attacked and close to death from my youth up;

I suffer from the terrors you bring; I’m overwhelmed.

16Your furious anger has swept over me;

your dreaded assaults have destroyed me.

17They surround me like water all the time

and engulf me completely.

18You’ve removed lover and friend far from me;

my companions lie in darkness.	Ps 88:13-18

Psalm 89

A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite

1I’ll sing forever about the LORD’s enduring love

and make known his faithfulness to every generation,

2because I’ve said, “You build up enduring love;

in the heavens you establish your faithfulness.”

3The LORD said, “I’ve made a covenant with my chosen one;

I’ve sworn to David my servant,

4‘I’ll make your descendants secure forever

and build up your throne to all generations.’”	Ps 89:1-4

5The sky praises your wonders

and extols your faithfulness in the assembly of your holy angels.

6Who in the sky can compare with you?

Who among the heavenly beings is like you,

7a God greatly respected in the council of holy angels

and awesome above everyone around him?

8Lord GOD of Hosts, who is like you?

You’re completely faithful.

9You rule the raging sea;

when its waves rise up, you quiet them.

10You’ve crushed Rahab like one that’s slain

and scattered your enemies with your strong arm.	Ps 89:5-10

11The sky is yours; the earth belongs to you;

you’ve founded the world and everything in it.

12You’ve created north and south;

Tabor and Hermon shout for joy over you.

13You have a powerful arm and a strong hand;

you lift your right hand high.

14Goodness and justice make the foundation for your throne;

enduring love and truth proceed ahead of you.

15How blessed people are who know the sound of joy,

who walk in the light of your presence, LORD.

16In your name they celebrate all day;

your goodness lifts their spirits.

17They glory in your strength;

your blessing honors them.

18Their shield belongs to the LORD;

their king belongs to the Holy One of Israel.	Ps 89:11-18

19Long ago you said in a vision to your holy people,

“I’ve crowned a great man,

chosen from the common people.

20I found my servant David

and anointed him with my holy oil.

21My hand will make him secure;

my arm will give him strength.

22His enemies won’t outsmart him;

sinful people won’t oppress him.

23I’ll crush his adversaries

and strike down those who hate him.

24My faithfulness and enduring love will be with him,

and I’ll make him honored.	Ps 89:19-24

25I’ll establish his rule as far as the sea

and set his control over the rivers.

26He’ll call out to me, ‘My Father,

my God, the Rock that keeps me safe.’

27I’ll make him my firstborn,

the highest among the kings on earth.

28I’ll keep my enduring love for him forever

and confirm my covenant with him.

29I’ll make his descendants permanently secure,

his throne as eternal as the sky.	Ps 89:25-29

30“If his descendants leave my Law

and don’t follow my judgments,

31if they violate my statutes

and don’t keep my commandments,

32then I’ll bring a rod to bear on their sin

and stripes on their iniquity.

33But I won’t break off my enduring love from him

or deal falsely in my faithfulness.

34I won’t violate my covenant

or alter what I’ve said.

35Once I’ve sworn by my holiness,

I won’t lie to David.

36His descendants will continue permanently,

his throne will last like the sun with me.

37It’ll be secure as permanently as the moon,

as faithful as its witness in the sky.”	Ps 89:30-37

38But, you’ve thrown him away and rejected him;

you’re angry with your anointed.

39You’ve spurned the covenant with him

and profaned his crown in the dust.

40You’ve broken down his walls

and brought his fortresses to ruin.

41Everyone that passes by plunders him;

he’s become a disgrace to his neighbors.

42You’ve raised up his adversaries

and made them celebrate.

43You’ve turned back the edge of his sword

and haven’t made him stand in battle.

44You made his splendor cease

and threw his throne on the ground.

45You’ve shortened his youth

and covered him with shame.	Ps 89:38-45

46How long, LORD,

will you conceal yourself,

will your anger burn like fire?

47Remember how long life is.

What emptiness have you created people for?

48Who can live without dying?

Can anyone avoid Sheol?	Ps 89:46-48

49Where’s your former enduring love

that you faithfully swore to David?

50Remember the scorn your servants endure,

how I carry many people’s insults inside me

51that your enemies have used for taunts,

that they’ve mocked your anointed one with.

52Bless the LORD forever!

Amen and Amen.	Ps 89:49-52

BOOK 4

Psalm 90

A Prayer of Moses, the Man of God

1LORD, through all generations

you’ve been our dwelling place.

2Before the mountains were born

or you gave birth to the world,

from one end of time to the other, you’ve been God.	Ps 90:1-2

3You turn people back to dust and say,

“Return to dust, mortals.”

4A thousand years to you

are like yesterday,

like a watch in the night.

5You sweep us away like the dreams in our sleep.

In the morning we sprout like grass 6and flourish;

then toward evening we fade like blossoms

and wither away.

7Your anger consumes us;

your wrath scares us.

8You place our iniquities in front of you;

our secret sins are open to you.

9All our days pass away in your fury;

we finish our years with a sigh.

10We live for 70 years or by good health for 80 years;

yet whatever their length, they’re full of labor and pain

because they’re gone so soon, and we fly away.

11Who understands the power of your anger and fury

in comparison to the respect you deserve?

12So teach us to count our days

so we can grow in wisdom toward you.	Ps 90:3-12

13Come back to us, LORD; how long will it be?

Have pity on your servants.

14Satisfy us in the morning with your enduring love

so we can sing and be happy our whole life.

15Make us happy for as long as you’ve punished us,

for the years we’ve had misfortune.

16Let us see your work

and our children witness your majesty.

17Bless us, LORD our God;

make our efforts successful;

yes, make them succeed!	Ps 90:13-17

Psalm 91

1Those who live in the shelter of the Most High

will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

2They’ll say about the LORD,

“Our refuge and fortress, the God we trust!”	Ps 91:1-2

3He delivers you from the trapper’s snare

and deadly pestilence.

4He covers you with his pinions;

you can find refuge under his wings;

his faithfulness shields and protects you.

5You won’t be afraid of terrors at night,

of arrows that fly by day,

6of pestilence that lurks in the dark,

or destruction that lays waste at noon.

7A thousand may fall at your side,

ten thousand by your right hand;

but disaster won’t touch you.

8You’ll stand by and watch his recompense to the wicked,

9because you’ve made the LORD your refuge,

the Most High your hiding place.

10Misfortune won’t fall on you;

no plague will get near you.	Ps 91:3-10

11He’ll make his angels responsible

for guarding you whatever you do.

12They’ll carry you

so you won’t trip over a rock.

13You’ll step on lions and cobras

and crush them.

14“I’ll rescue them that love me

and set up high those who know me.

15They’ll call on me, and I’ll answer them;

I’ll be with them in trouble,

rescue and honor them.

16I’ll satisfy them with long life

and give them salvation.”	Ps 91:11-16

Psalm 92

A Psalm

A Song for the Sabbath

1It’s good to thank you, LORD,

to sing praises to you, Most High;

2to declare your enduring love in the morning

and your faithfulness at night

3with a lute and a ten-stringed harp,

with melody on a lyre.

4Because you’ve made me happy by what you’ve done,

I’ll sing for joy over what you do.	Ps 92:1-4

5Your deeds are so great, LORD,

your thoughts so deep!

6Senseless people don’t realize,

ignorant mortals don’t understand

7that when sinners sprout up like grass

and the wicked flourish,

it’s only that they’ll be destroyed forever.

8But you’re on high forever.

9Your enemies will perish;

everybody that sins will scatter.	Ps 92:5-9

10You’ve made me as strong as a wild ox

and anointed me with fresh oil.

11I’ve looked in triumph at my enemies

and heard about the defeat of my attackers.

12Good people flourish like palm trees;

they grow like cedars in Lebanon.

13Planted in the LORD’s Temple,

they flourish in the courts of our God.

14They bear fruit even when they’re old;

they’re still green and full of energy.

15They declare that the LORD is good,

that he’s our rock; there’s nothing bad about him.	Ps 92:10-15

Psalm 93

1The LORD reigns, robed in majesty,

dressed in strength.

The world stands firm; it won’t move.

2Your throne has been secure from of old;

you’re from eternity past.

3The floods have swelled;

the roar of their pounding waves has increased.

4But more than the thunder of overwhelming water,

more than the mighty ocean breakers against the shore,

LORD on high, you are powerful.

5Your decrees stand firm;

holiness adorns your Temple forever.	Ps 93:1-5

Psalm 94

1LORD God of vengeance, shine!

2Rise up, Judge of the whole world;

repay the proud.

3How long will you let sinners celebrate?

4How long will they pour out their arrogant words,

vaunt themselves up

5crush your people,

attack your heritage

6murder widows and foreigners and orphans,

7and say, “The LORD’s not watching;

Jacob’s God is not paying attention.”	Ps 94:1-7

8You silly people, you pay attention;

when will you ever understand?

9Can’t he hear, who created the ear?

Can’t he see, who formed the eye?

10Won’t he that rebukes nations, discipline you;

doesn’t the Source of knowledge know what you’re doing?

11The LORD knows that your thoughts

are nothing but hot air.

12The ones you discipline are blessed, LORD,

the ones you teach out of the Law;

13so you can grant them relief in adversity,

till you dig a pit for the wicked.

14The LORD won’t abandon his people

or forsake his inheritance.

15The administration of justice will be good again,

and the godly will follow it.

16Who else will stand up for me against evil people?

Who else will take a stand for me against sinners? 	Ps 94:8-16

17If the LORD hadn’t helped me,

I would soon have occupied the silent place.

18When I cried out, “I’m slipping,”

his enduring love kept me from falling.

19When my anxious thoughts multiplied,

he cheered me up.

20Can corrupt rulers be his allies

and plot schemes with their wicked laws?

21Can they gang up on good people

and condemn the innocent to death?

22No, because the LORD is my fortress;

my God the Rock is my refuge.

23He’ll bring their sinfulness back on them

and destroy them with their own evil;

the LORD our God will wipe them out.	Ps 94:17-23

Psalm 95

1Come, let’s sing to the LORD;

let’s make a joyful sound to the Rock that saves us.

2Let’s go to him with thanksgiving

and sing to him with psalms.

3The LORD is a great God,

a great King above all gods.

4He controls the deep sea;

he owns the mountain peaks

5and the ocean because he created them;

he made the dry land.	Ps 95:1-5

6Come, let’s bow in worship;

let’s kneel to the LORD our Maker.

7He’s our God, and we’re sheep in his pasture,

the flock under his care.

If you hear him today,

8don’t harden your hearts like they did at Meribah

that day at Massah in the desert.

9Your ancestors kept testing me

though they’d been seeing my work for 40 years.

10I detested that generation and said,

“They err in their hearts;

they don’t know my ways.”

11So I swore in my anger,

“They certainly won’t enter my rest.”	Ps 95:6-11

Psalm 96

1Sing a new song to the LORD;

sing to him, all the earth.

2Bless him in song;

proclaim every day the good news that he saves.

3Tell about his glory the world over,

his marvelous deeds among the nations.

4The LORD is great and deserves great praise;

he’s to be respected more than all gods

5because the nations’ gods are idols,

but the LORD created the sky.

6Honor and majesty lie in him;

strength and beauty fill his sanctuary.	Ps 96:1-6

7Families of the nations,

attribute to the LORD honor and strength.

8Attribute to the LORD the glory he deserves;

take an offering to his courts.

9Worship him in holy attire;

tremble at him, all the earth.

10Say among the nations, “The LORD reigns;

yes, the world is firmly set; it won’t move;

he’ll judge the nations fairly.”

11Let the heavens be happy and the earth rejoice;

let the ocean roar and everything that’s in it;

12let the fields celebrate and all that grows there;

then the trees in the forest will sing 13to the LORD

because he’ll judge the world with justice

and its people with truth.	Ps 96:7-13

Psalm 97

1The LORD reigns; let the world rejoice;

let the distant shores be glad.

2Clouds and dense darkness surround him;

goodness and justice are the foundation for his throne.

3Fire goes forth ahead of him

and burns up his adversaries.

4His lightning lights up the world;

the world sees it and trembles.

5The mountains melt like wax

at his presence everywhere.

6The sky declares his goodness;

every nation can see his glory.	Ps 97:1-6

7Let those who worship carved images be discredited,

those who take pride in idols;

bow to him, all you gods.

8Zion hears that and is happy;

the towns in Judah celebrate

because of your justice, LORD,

9You’re greater than all gods.

10Hate evil, you that love the LORD,

who preserves his holy people

and delivers them from sinners.

11Light is sown like seed for the godly,

like happiness for the godly in heart.

12Be happy in him, good people;

praise him for his holiness.	Ps 97:7-12

Psalm 98

A Psalm

1Sing a new song to the LORD

because he’s done outstanding things;

his right hand and holy arm have given him victory.

2He has made his salvation known

and revealed his goodness to the nations.

3He has remembered his enduring love

and faithfulness to Israel;

people the earth over have seen

the deliverance our God gives. 	Ps 98:1-3

4Make a joyful sound to the LORD, all the earth;

break out in joyful song.

5Sing praises to him with lyre and melody;

6make a joyful sound with trumpets and rams’ horns

to the King, the LORD.

7Let the ocean roar and everything in it,

the world and those who live here.

8Let the rivers clap their hands;

let the mountains sing 9to the LORD

because he’s coming to judge the world righteously

and its people fairly.	Ps 98:4-9

Psalm 99

1The LORD reigns;

let the people tremble;

he sits on his throne above the cherubs;

let the earth quake!

2The LORD is great in Zion;

he’s exalted above all nations.

3Let them praise his great, awesome name;

he is holy.

4The great King who loves justice

has established what’s fair for all.

5Exalt the LORD our God

and worship at his feet;	he is holy.	Ps 99:1-5

6Moses and Aaron were among his priests;

Samuel too was one who called on him;

they called on the LORD and he answered them.

7He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;

they kept the testimonies and statutes he gave them.

8He was a forgiving God;

yet he disciplined them for their sins.

9Exalt the LORD our God

and worship on his holy mountain; because

he is holy.	Ps 99:6-9

Psalm 100

A Psalm for Thanksgiving

1Make a joyful sound to the LORD, all the earth.

2Serve him gladly;

come to him with singing.

3Acknowledge that the LORD is God;

he made us; we didn’t make ourselves.

We’re his people, sheep in his pasture.

4Enter his gates with thanksgiving

and his courts with praise.

Thank him and bless him 5because he’s good;

his enduring love never ends;

his faithfulness extends to every generation.	Ps 100:1-5

Psalm 101

A Psalm of David

1I’ll sing about your enduring love and justice,

and sing praises to you, LORD.

2I’ll pay attention to the way that’s blameless;

when will you come to help me?

In my home I’ll walk in integrity.

3I won’t set anything base beside me;

I’ll hate what they do who fall away;

I’ll stay away from them.

4I’ll cast perverse things out of my heart

and have nothing to do with evil.

5I’ll withdraw from anyone that slanders another;

I won’t put up with people

that have haughty looks or arrogant hearts. 	Ps 101:1-5

6I’ll focus my attention on the faithful

to be my friends.

Those who follow the blameless way

are the ones that will be my servants.

7I won’t let deceivers serve in my Temple;

liars won’t maintain their relationship with me.

8Each morning I’ll destroy the wicked in the land

and rid the city of the LORD of everyone that sins. 	Ps 101:6-8

Psalm 102

A Prayer by the Oppressed When They’re Faint

and Pour Out Their Complaint to the LORD

1Listen to my prayer, LORD!

Let my cry come to you.

2Don’t turn away from me in my distress;

when I call, answer quickly.

3My days dissipate like smoke;

my bones lie scorched on a hearth.

4My heart is weak and withers away like grass;

I have no appetite 5in my loud groaning;

I’m skin and bones.

6I’m like a pelican in the desert,

like an owl in desolate places;

7I lie awake

like a lonely bird on a housetop.	Ps 102:1-7

8My enemies taunt me all day;

they ridicule me and use my name as a curse.

9I eat ashes for food

and mix my drink with tears

10because of your indignation,

because you’ve thrown me away.

11My days are like a shadow;

I wither like the grass.

12But you live forever, LORD;

you endure for all generations.

13Have mercy on Zion;

it’s time to be gracious to it;

the appointed time has come.

14Your servants delight in its very rocks

and have regard even for its dust.

15So the nations will respect the LORD;

kings will respect your honor.

16The LORD will build up Zion;

he’ll appear in his glory.

17He’ll have regard for the destitute;

he won’t disregard their prayer.	Ps 102:8-17

18Write this for the next generation,

so people not yet born will praise the LORD:

19He looked down from his holy height;

from heaven he gazed at earth

20to hear the groaning prisoners,

to free those doomed to die;

21so people will celebrate the LORD in Zion

and praise him in Jerusalem

22when the nations gather

and the kingdoms assemble to serve him.	Ps 102:18-22

23He weakened my strength

in the course of my life and shortened it.

24 I say to him,

My God, don’t take me away in the middle of life;

you live throughout all generations.

25You founded the earth long ago;

the sky is your handiwork.

26Even they will perish, but you’ll remain;

they’ll wear out like a robe,

and you’ll change them like clothes.

27But you’ll be the same; your years won’t end.

28Your people’s children will continue in security;

their descendants will thrive in your presence.”	Ps 102:23-28

Psalm 103

A Psalm of David

1Bless the LORD, all that I am!

Everything that’s in me, bless him.

2Bless the LORD, all that I am;

May I never forget how he helps me:

3he pardons my sins

and heals my diseases;

4he rescues me from the Pit

and crowns me with enduring love and mercy;

5he satisfies my years with good things,

and renews my youth like an eagle’s.	Ps 103:1-5

6The LORD performs good deeds

and renders justice for people mistreated.

7He made his ways known to Moses

and demonstrated his acts to Israel.

8The LORD is merciful and gracious,

slow to anger and abounding in enduring love.

9He won’t constantly confront us

or always be angry with us.

10He hasn’t dealt with us according to our sins

or rewarded us in proportion to our iniquities.

11As high as the sky is above the earth,

so great is his enduring love toward those who respect him.

12As far as the east is from the west,

that’s how far he’s removed our sins from us.

13Like a father that has mercy on his children,

the LORD has mercy on those who respect him.

14He knows how we’re made;

he’s aware that we’re only dust.	Ps 103:6-14

15People are like grass,

they flourish like flowers in a field.

16When the wind blows on them, they’re gone

like they’d never been there.

17The LORD’s enduring love is

from eternity past to future for them who respect him;

his goodness is to children’s children

18to those who keep his covenant,

that obey his commandments.	Ps 103:15-18

19The LORD has secured his throne in the sky;

he’s sovereign everywhere.

20Bless the LORD, angels, great in power,

who do what he says and obey him.

21Bless the LORD, all his hosts

who serve him and do his will.

22Bless the LORD, everything he’s created

everywhere he reigns.

Bless the LORD, everything that I am!	Ps 103:19-22

Psalm 104

1Bless the LORD, everything that I am!

LORD my God, you’re so great;

you’re dressed in splendor and majesty.

2You cover yourself with light as with a robe;

you’ve stretched out the sky like a tent.

3You laid the beams for your rooms on the water;

you make the clouds your chariot

and walk on the wind.

4You make the winds your messengers

and blazing fire your ministers.	Ps 104:1-4

5You built the earth on foundations

so it would never shift.

6You covered it with the ocean like a robe

deeper than the mountains.

7At your rebuke it receded;

at the sound of your thunder, it withdrew.

8The mountains rose up; the valleys sank down

to the level you determined for them to have.

9You set a boundary the water couldn’t cross

so it wouldn’t flow back over the earth again.	Ps 104:5-9

10You make springs in the valleys

so creeks flow between the mountains.

11They water the animals in the countryside

and quench the thirst of wild donkeys.

12Birds live beside them

and chirp in the trees.

13You water the mountains from your home above;

your work provides for the earth.	Ps 104:10-13

14You make grass grow for the livestock

and crops from people’s labor

so they could produce food from the ground

15and wine to cheer them up,

so they could make their faces shine with oil

and grow food to sustain them.

16The LORD’s trees drink their fill,

Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,

17where birds build their nests

and storks make roosts in fir trees.	Ps 104:14-17

18High mountains are for wild goats,

and rocks provide cover for badgers.

19You made the moon to mark the seasons;

the sun knows where to set.

20You send darkness, and it becomes night;

wild animals prowl around in it.

21Young lions roar after their prey

and seek their food from God.

22When the sun comes up,

they go back and lie down in their dens,

23and people go out to work till evening.	Ps 104:18-23

24LORD, how many things you’ve done!

you’ve done them all with wisdom

and filled the earth with your creations.

25Yonder is the ocean, big and wide;

it teems with schools of fish without number,

marine life large and small.

26Ships move along on it,

Leviathan too, which you formed to play in it.	Ps 104:24-26

27They all depend on you

to feed them when it’s time.

28You give them food, and they gather it;

you open your hand and satisfy them with good.

29If you hide, they’re scared;

you take away their breath, and they die.

30You send out your breath, and they’re created;

you renew the surface of the ground.	Ps 104:27-30

31Let the LORD’s honor endure forever;

let him delight in things he’s made.

32The world trembles at his look;

the mountains smoke at his touch.

33I’ll sing to the LORD as long as I live;

I’ll sing praise to my God as long as I’m here.

34May my meditations please him;

I’ll be happy in him.

35Let sinners vanish from the earth;

let the wicked cease to exist.

Bless the LORD, everything that I am!

Hallelujah!	Ps 104:31-35

Psalm 105

1Be grateful to the LORD; call on him;

tell the nations what all he’s done.

2Sing praises to him;

talk about the amazing acts.

3Take pride in his holy name;

let the people be happy that rely on him.

4Rely on the LORD and his strength;

depend on him always.

5Remember his amazing miracles,

the judgments he’s rendered,

6descendants of Abraham his servant,

children of Jacob, his chosen ones!

7He’s the LORD our God,

who renders judgment all over the world.	Ps 105:1-7

8He remembers his eternal covenant,

the message he commanded to a thousand generations,

9his covenant with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.

10his statute confirmed to Jacob

as an ongoing covenant.

11He swore, “I’ll give you Canaan to inherit.”

12When they were just a few,

temporary residents,

13they wandered from nation to nation,

from kingdom to kingdom.

14He didn’t let anybody oppress them;

he reprimanded kings on their behalf:

15“Don’t touch my anointed ones;

don’t harm my prophets.”	Ps 105:8-15

16He called for a famine in the land

and cut off their food supply.

17He sent a man ahead of them,

Joseph, sold as a slave.

18They hurt his feet with restraints

and put an iron collar around his neck

19till God’s message came to him

and revealed what kind of man he was.

20The king released him;

the people’s ruler let him go.

21He made him master of his household,

steward over everything he owned,

22even to imprison his officials if he saw fit

so he could teach his elders wisdom.	Ps 105:16-22

23Then Israel/Jacob went down to Egypt

and lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.

24God multiplied his people

and made them stronger than their enemies,

25whose hearts he turned against his people

to mistreat them.

26Then he sent Moses his servant

and Aaron his chosen one

27to perform his amazing acts among them,

miracles in the land of Ham:

28he engulfed their land in darkness

when they defied him and his message;

29he turned their water to blood

and killed their fish;	Ps 105:23-29

30frogs overran the land

even into the king’s bedrooms;

31swarms of flies came,

and gnats infested the whole region;

32he gave them hail for rain,

and lightning flashed in the land;

33he struck down their grapevines and fig trees

and stripped their trees;

34he summoned countless young locusts to come

35and eat the vegetation in the country

and devour the produce from the ground;

36he struck the Egyptians’ firstborn,

the first issue of their strength.	Ps 105:30-36

37Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold;

nobody among the tribes faltered.

38The Egyptians were glad when they left

because they’d come to dread them.

39He spread a cloud over them

and sent fire to light up the night.

40They asked, and he brought quail

and satisfied them with manna from the sky.

41He opened a rock and water came out

and ran into the desert like a stream.

42He remembered his sacred promise

to Abraham his servant.

43He brought his people out with joy and celebration.

44He gave them the lands of nations,

and they harvested what those nations had grown;

45he did it so they would keep his statutes

and observe his laws.

Hallelujah!	Ps 105:37-45

Psalm 106

1Hallelujah!

Be grateful to the LORD because he’s good;

his enduring love lasts forever.

2Who can recount all his mighty deeds?

Who can ever praise him enough?

3How blessed they are who maintain justice,

who practice goodness all the time!

4Remember me, LORD, when you’re gracious to your people;

come and rescue me

5so I can share in your holy people’s prosperity,

celebrate in your nation’s happiness,

and glory in your heritage.	Ps 106:1-5

6We and our ancestors have sinned,

committed iniquity, and behaved badly.

7Our ancestors in Egypt didn’t get the point of the LORD’s amazing acts

or remember his abundant kindness;

instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.

8Nevertheless, he saved them to defend his honor

and demonstrate his power.

9He commanded the Red Sea to dry up,

and led them through its depths as through a desert.

10He saved them from those who hated them;

he rescued them from their enemy.

11The water drowned their adversaries;

not a one survived.

12Then they believed in him and praised him in song.	Ps 106:6-12

13But they soon forgot what he’d done

and didn’t wait for his direction,

14but made loud demands

and put him on trial in the desert.

15So he gave them what they asked for,

but sent a wasting disease among them.	Ps 106:13-15

16When men in the camp got jealous of Moses

and of Aaron, the LORD’s holy priest,

17the ground opened up

and swallowed Dathan and Abiram’s rebels.

18Fire broke out among their companions

and consumed the sinful. 	Ps 106:16-18

19They made a calf at Horeb/Sinai

and worshiped a molten image;

20they exchanged their Glorious One

for an image of a bull that eats grass.

21They forgot God, who’d saved them

and done such great things in Egypt,

22amazing things in Ham,

awesome things at the Red Sea.

23So he said he’d destroy them.

If Moses, his chosen one, hadn’t stood in the gap

to turn away his wrath, he would’ve done it.

24They refused to enter the pleasant land

and didn’t believe what he promised;

25they grumbled in their tents

and didn’t listen to the LORD.

26So he swore he’d let them die in the desert,

27disperse their descendants among the nations,

and scatter them in other lands.	Ps 106:19-27

28They joined in the worship of Baal-peor

and ate sacrifices to the dead.

29What they did provoked him

to send a plague out among them.

30Then Phinehas got up and intervened;

so the plague stopped.

31He’s been considered a good man ever since.	Ps 106:28-31

32They’d already provoked God at Meribah

and got Moses in serious trouble 33for speaking rashly.

34Later, they failed to eradicate the nations like the LORD told them to,

35 but mixed in with them, learned their practices,

36and served their idols, which led to their downfall.

37They even sacrificed sons and daughters to the demons

38and thereby shed innocent blood,

the blood of their sons and daughters

that they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;

they polluted the land with blood.

39So they defiled themselves with their practices

and played the prostitute in their deeds.	Ps 106:32-39

40The LORD’s anger so sparked against his people

that he abhorred his special possession.

41So he gave them over to the surrounding nations;

people that hated them ruled them;

42their enemies subdued them

and oppressed them.

43Many times he delivered them,

but they kept rebelling with their own intentions

and sank into sin.	Ps 106:40-43

44Nevertheless, he felt compassion for them

when he heard them cry out in distress.

45He remembered his covenant

and relented because of his enduring love.

46He even made their captors be kind to them.

47Save us, LORD our God;

retrieve us from the nations

so we can thank you and glory in praising you.

48Bless the LORD God of Israel

from everlasting to everlasting.

Everybody say, “Amen.”

Hallelujah!	Ps 106:44-48

BOOK 5

Psalm 107

1Be grateful to the LORD because he’s good;

his love endures forever.

2Let his redeemed say it,

the ones he rescued from their adversaries

3and gathered from other countries

east and west, north and south.	Ps 107:1-3

4Some wandered in trackless desert

and couldn’t find their way to any inhabited city.

5Hungry and thirsty,

their souls fainted inside them.

6Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,

and he delivered them from it;

7he led them straight to a city they could live in.

8They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his awesome acts for his people!

9He satisfies the thirsty

and fills the hungry with good things.	Ps 107:4-9

10Some sat in darkness and death’s shadow,

prisoners suffering in iron shackles,

11because they’d rebelled against what God said

and spurned the advice of the Most High.

12So he humbled them with labor;

they stumbled and nobody was there to help.

13Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,

and he delivered them from it.

14He brought them out of darkness and death’s shadow

and broke their chains.

15They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his awesome acts for his people!

16because he shattered bronze gates

and cut iron bars in two.	Ps 107:10-16

17Some were fools

and suffered because they rebelled and sinned.

18The very sight of food was repulsive to them;

they came close to dying.

19Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,

and he delivered them from distress.

20He sent his message to heal them

and delivered them from destruction.

21They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his wonderful acts for his people!

22Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving

and tell about his deeds with joyful singing.	Ps 107:17-22

23Some went down to ships by the sea

and did business on the ocean;

24they, too, have seen what the LORD can do,

his powerful acts on the great deep.

25He spoke and a storm arose

that whipped up the waves,

26waves that swelled up toward the sky

and crashed down to the depths;

sailors’ courage melted away in their terror.

27They reeled and staggered like drunks;

they were at their wits’ end.

28Then they appealed to the LORD in their trouble,

and he delivered them from distress.

29He stilled the storm and calmed the waves.

30Then they were happy because they had quiet;

so he guided them to the port they desired.

31They need to thank him for his enduring love

and his wonderful acts for his people!

32Let them extol him in front of the community

and praise him at the elders’ seats.	Ps 107:23-32

33He transforms rivers into desert,

springs into thirsty ground,

34productive land into a salt waste

because sinful people live there.

35But he transforms a desert into a sea,

dry land into springs.

36He enables hungry people to live there

and build a city,

37sow fields, plant vineyards,

and gather a big harvest. 	Ps 107:33-37

38He blesses them and they multiply;

he keeps the number of their livestock from decreasing.

39When they’re decreased and brought low

through oppression, misery, and sorrow,

40he pours contempt on their rulers

and makes them wander in trackless wasteland.

41But he sets the needy safely on high away from adversity

and makes their families like a flock.

42The godly see it and are happy,

but bad people don’t have anything they can say.

43Who is wise? Pay attention to these things

and think about the LORD’s enduring love.	Ps 107:38-43

Psalm 108

A Song. A Psalm of David

1I’m steadfast, God;

I’ll sing praises in my heart.

2Wake up, harp and lyre;

I’ll wake up at dawn!

3I’ll thank you, LORD, among the nations

and sing praises to you everywhere,

4because your enduring love is bigger than the sky;

your truth is as high as the heavens.

5Be lifted up, God, above the sky;

display your glory the world over.

6Save with your power and answer me

so your beloved can be delivered.	Ps 108:1-6

7God has spoken in his holiness:

“I’ll gladly divide up Shechem.

8Gilead and Manasseh belong to me;

Ephraim, my helmet;

Judah, my scepter;

9Moab, my washbasin;

I’ll wipe my feet on Edom

and shout in triumph over Philistia.”	Ps 108:7-9

10Who will take me to the besieged city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

11Are you rejecting us, God?

Aren’t you going out with our armies?

12Help us against our adversary

because human help can’t save us.

13Through you, we’ll do mightily;

you can tramp down our enemies.	Ps 108:10-13

Psalm 109

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1God that I praise, speak up for me!

2Deceitful people speak against me;

they slander me with lies.

3They surround me with hateful words

and fight me for no reason.

4In return for my love, they accuse me

even when I’m praying for them.

5They repay me evil for good,

hatred for love.	Ps 109:1-5

6Appoint someone corrupt over them,

an accuser to stand beside them.

7When they’re judged, pronounce them guilty;

count even their prayers as acts of sin.

8Shorten their lives

and give someone else their position of oversight.

9Make their children fatherless

and their wives widows.

10Have their children go begging,

looking for food far from their ruined homes.

11Have their creditors seize everything they own

and foreigners plunder what they’d labored to produce.

12May no one extend enduring love to them

or be gracious to their fatherless children.

13Cut off their posterity;

erase their names from the next generation.	Ps 109:6-13

14LORD, remember their fathers’ sins

and not blot out their mothers’ transgressions;

15always keep them in mind;

Have people forget they ever lived,

16because they didn’t show enduring love;

they persecuted poor, needy people,

and murdered the despondent.

17They loved to curse; put curses on them!

they didn’t like to bless; don’t bless them!

18They cover themselves with cursing like clothes;

it soaks into their bodies like water,

down to the bone like oil!

19Put it on them like a robe they have to wear all the time,

like a belt they always have on.

20Make such things the LORD’s reward to accusers

that claim bad things about me.	Ps 109:14-20

21But LORD God, deal graciously with me

because your enduring love is good;

deliver me 22because I’m poor and needy

and wounded in my heart.

23I’m passing on like a lengthening shadow;

I’m brushed off like a locust.

24My knees are weak from fasting;

I’m skin and bones.

25I’m someone people scorn;

they just shake their heads at the sight of me.	Ps 109:21-25

26Help me, LORD my God;

in your enduring love, save me.

27Show them this is your doing.

28Let them curse, but you bless;

when they attack me, humiliate them,

and I’ll be happy.

29Dress those accusers in dishonor;

cover them with their humiliation like a cloak.	Ps 109:26-29

30I’ll praise the LORD repeatedly;

I’ll praise him in front of everyone,

31because he stands by the needy

to save them from those who condemn them to death.

Ps 109:30-31

Psalm 110

A Psalm of David

1The LORD said to my Lord,

“Sit at my right hand

till I make your enemies your footstool.”

2The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from on Zion,

and say, “Rule your enemies.”

3Your soldiers will volunteer readily

when you muster your army in holy array;

your strength will be renewed

every morning like the dew.

4The LORD has sworn and won’t change his mind,

“You’re a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”

5The LORD is at your right hand

to shatter kings when it’s time to display his anger.

6He’ll render judgment against the nations by filling them with corpses;

he’ll shatter leaders worldwide.

7He’ll refresh himself from streams along the way

and raise up his head in triumph.	Ps 110-:1-7

Psalm 111

1Hallelujah!

I thank the LORD with all my heart

in the presence of his godly people.

2His works are so outstanding

no one that delights in them

can quit thinking about them;

3their splendor and majesty

reflect his eternal goodness;

4he makes his amazing acts memorable

because they show his grace and mercy.

5He feeds those who respect him

and remembers his covenant with them;

6he demonstrated his power to his people

by giving them other nations’ land.	Ps 111:1-6

7His works are just and true;

so his people can trust his commandments

8to bring eternal security

when they practice them sincerely.

9He has provided redemption for his people

and ordained his covenant with them forever;

he’s holy and awesome.

10Respecting the LORD is the most important thing about being wise;

doing what he commands brings understanding.

Praise him forever.	Ps 111:7-10

Psalm 112

1Hallelujah!

How blessed people are that respect the LORD

and delight in what he calls on them to do.

2Their descendants will be successful

and a blessing to their own generation.

3They’ll have wealth and riches in their homes,

and their goodness will last forever.

4Godly people have light in the dark;

they’re gracious, merciful, and good.

5Goodness comes to those who graciously lend

and conduct their affairs with justice.

6Misfortune won’t overcome them,

and people will remember the good they’ve done. 	Ps 112:1-6

7Bad news doesn’t scare people like that

because they’ve committed themselves to the LORD they trust;

8they’re confident and courageous

and face their adversaries with assurance.

9They give freely to the poor,

so their goodness lasts forever

in ongoing influence and honor.

10Sinners will see that and get mad;

they’ll grit their teeth—and leave;

what they wanted won’t happen.	Ps 112:7-10

Psalm 113

1Hallelujah!

Servants of the LORD, praise him;

2bless him from now on forever;

3from sunrise to sunset, praise him.

4On high above the nations,

he displays his glory in the sky.

5Who is like the LORD our God

that sits on high, 6but humbles himself to watch

what’s happening in the sky and on earth?

7Then he raises up the poor from the dust

and lifts the needy from the ash pile

8to seat them beside the princes of his people.

9He gives the barren woman a home

like a happy mother of children.

Hallelujah! 	Ps 113:1-9

Psalm 114

1When Israel left Egypt—

when the House of Jacob came out

from a nation with a different language—

2the land of Judah became his sanctuary;

Israel became his kingdom.

3The Red Sea saw them coming and backed away;

the Jordan quit flowing.

4The mountains jumped like rams;

the hills skipped around like lambs.

5What’s the matter with you, Sea, that you’re backing away,

or Jordan, that you’ve quit flowing,

6or mountains, that you jump like rams,

or hills, that you skip around like lambs?

7Earth, tremble at the Lord, Jacob’s God,

8who turned rock into water

and flint into a fountain.	Ps 114:1-8

Psalm 115

1Not to us, LORD, not to us,

but to you be honor

because of your enduring love and faithfulness.

2Why should the nations say,

“Where’s their God?”

3Our God is in heaven,

where he accomplishes what he intends.

4Their man-made idols are just silver and gold

5with mouths that can’t talk,

eyes that can’t see,

6ears that can’t hear,

noses that can’t smell,

7hands that can’t feel,

feet that can’t walk,

throats that can’t make a sound!

8The ones that make them will become like them,

likewise everybody that relies on them.	Ps 115:1-8

9Israel, trust in the LORD;

he’s your helper and shield.

10House of Aaron, trust in the LORD;

he’s your helper and shield.

11All of you that respect the LORD, trust in him;

he’s your helper and shield.

12He cares about you; he’ll bless you;

Israel and Aaron;

13he’ll bless everyone that respects him,

least and greatest.

14May he increase you and your children;

15may the Maker of earth and sky bless you.	Ps 115:9-15

16The sky belongs to him,

but he’s given us the earth.

17The dead don’t praise the LORD;

nobody does that descends into silence;

18but we’ll bless him

from now on forever.

Hallelujah!	Ps 115:16-18

Psalm 116

1I love the LORD because he listens to my petitions;

2so I’ll call on him as long as I live.

3The snares of death were all around me;

the pains of Sheol came on me;

I suffered distress and sorrow.

4Then I called on the LORD,

“Please save me.”	Ps 116:1-4

5You’re gracious and good, merciful God.

6You preserve the simple;

when I was brought low, you saved me.

7I can rest again

because you’ve been good to me;

8you’ve saved me from death,

my eyes from tears,

my feet from stumbling.

9I’ll walk with you in the land of the living.

10I kept believing even when I said,

“I’m greatly oppressed.”

11I said in my anxiety,

“Everybody’s lying to me!”	Ps 116:5-11

12How can I repay you, LORD,

for all your benefits?

13I’ll lift up the cup of salvation

and call on you.

14I’ll fulfill my vows to you

in the presence of your people.

15You care about your holy people when they die.

16LORD, I’m your servant,

the son of your maidservant;

you’ve removed my shackles.

17I’ll offer you a thanksgiving sacrifice

and call on you.	Ps 116:12-17

18I’ll fulfill my vows to you

in the presence of your people,

19in the courts of your Temple in Jerusalem.

Hallelujah!	Ps 116:18-19

Psalm 117

1Praise the LORD, every nation;

praise him, every people group,

2because he has great enduring love toward us;

hisY faithfulness lasts forever.

Hallelujah!	Ps 117:1-2

Psalm 118

1Be grateful to the LORD because he’s good;

his love lasts forever.

2Let Israel say,

“His love lasts forever.”

3Let the house of Aaron say,

“His love lasts forever.”

4Let those who respect the LORD say,

“His love lasts forever.”	Ps 118:1-4

5I called on the LORD in my distress,

and he answered me and set me free.

6He’s on my side; so I won’t be afraid;

what can mortals do to me?

7He’s beside me to help me;

so I look in triumph at those who hate me.

8It’s better to take refuge in the LORD than trust in people,

9to take refuge in him than put trust in rulers.	Ps 118:5-9

10All the nations surrounded me;

in the LORD’s name I destroyed them.

11They surrounded me on every side;

in the LORD’s name I destroyed them.

12They swarmed around me like bees;

they stung like burning briers;

in the LORD’s name I destroyed them.

13They shoved me back so hard I started to fall,

but the LORD came to my aid.

14He’s my strength and song;

he’s my salvation.	Ps 118:10-14

15Joyful shouting over deliverance

goes on in the tents of good people;

the LORD’s right hand has done valiantly.

16He has lifted high his right hand;

His right hand has done mighty things.

17I’ll live to tell what he’s done.

18He disciplined me severely,

but he didn’t let me die.	Ps 118:15-18

19Open the gate to goodness for me

so I can go in and thank the LORD.

20This is his gate;

good people enter through it.

21Thank you for answering me;

you’ve become my salvation.	Ps 118:19-21

22The stone the builders rejected

has become the cornerstone.

23That’s the LORD’s doing;

it’s amazing.

24Today is a day the LORD has made;

let’s celebrate and be happy in it.

25LORD, save us

and send us prosperity.

26Blessed is the one that comes in the LORD’s name;

we bless you from his Temple.

27The LORD is God; he gives us light;

tie the festival sacrifice to the horns of the altar.

28You’re my God; I thank you;

you’re my God; I praise you.

29Give thanks to the LORD because he’s good;

his love lasts forever. 	Ps 118:22-29

Psalm 119

Aleph א

1How blessed they are who follow his way blamelessly,

who follow the Law of the LORD,

2who observe his testimonies

and look to him with all their heart.

3They do no evil who follow his ways.

4You’ve charged us

to keep your commandments diligently.

5Oh that my ways may become secure

by reflecting on your statutes!

6I won’t be disgraced

if I keep my eye on everything you’ve commanded.

7I’ll thank you by living with a godly heart

as I learn your good ordinances.

8I’ll keep your statutes;

don’t give up on me!	Ps 119:1-8

Bet ב

9How can the young keep their conduct pure?

By guarding it with what you say.

10I’ve looked to you wholeheartedly;

don’t let me stray from your commandments.

11I’ve treasured up your word in my heart

so I won’t sin against you.

12You’re blessed, LORD;

teach me your statutes.

13I’ve recited all the ordinances you’ve given

14and delighted in your testimonies as much as in wealth.

15I’ll study your precepts

and fix my attention on your ways.

16I’ll delight in your decrees

and commit your word to memory.	Ps 119:9-16

Gimel ג

17Deal well with me

so I can live and keep your word.

18Open my eyes so I can see

the wonderful things in your Law.

19I’m a foreigner in the world;

so make your commandments clear to me.

20I feel a burden

to always keep your ordinances.

21You rebuke the insolent, the accursed

that wander off from your commandments.

22Take their insults and contempt away from me

because I observe your decrees.

23Even though officials sit around plotting against me,

I still think about your statutes

24and delight in your decrees;

they’re my counselors.	Ps 119:17-24

Dalet ד

25I’m lying in the dust;

revive me with your message.

26I’ve told you my intentions and you responded;

now teach me your statutes!

27Make me understand what your commandments mean

so I can think about your wonderful deeds.

28I melt away with sorrow;

encourage me with your message.

29Put false ways far away from me

and graciously teach me your Law.

30I’ve chosen to be faithful

and keep your ordinances at hand.

31I hold onto your testimonies, LORD;

don’t let me feel humiliated!

32I’ll follow your commands

because by them you increase my understanding.	Ps 119:25-32

He ה

33Teach me, LORD, the way your statutes direct,

and I’ll keep them to the end.

34Help me understand

so I can observe your Law properly.

35Lead me the way your commandments dictate

because I delight in them.

36Incline my heart to your testimonies

rather than to dishonest profit.

37Turn my attention away from pointless things

and give me life in your ways.

38Confirm to me your promise

to those who respect you.

39Turn away the disgrace I dread,

because your ordinances are good.

40I want to obey your commandments;

so in your goodness give me life.	Ps 119:33-40

Vav ו

41Direct your enduring love toward me, LORD,

the salvation you offer in your word,

42so I can answer whoever tries to discredit me,

because I trust what you say.

43Don’t take your message out of my mouth,

because I’ve put my hope in your ordinances

44so I can keep your Law ever and always.

45I’m free because I look to your precepts.

46I’ll talk to kings about your testimonies

without feeling self-conscious.

47I delight in your commandments;

48I lift up my hands to them

and study your statutes.	Ps 119:41-48

Zayin ז

49Remember your promise

that you made for me to trust in.

50That’s my reassurance in adversity;

your promise revives me.

51Godless people utterly deride me;

yet I won’t turn aside from your Law.

52When I remember your ordinances from of old,

I find comfort.

53Burning indignation has seized me

because of sinners that abandon your Law.

54Your statutes are my songs

wherever life leads me.

55I think about you at night,

about keeping your instructions.

56This has been my way of life:

observing your commandments.	Ps 119:49-56

Het ח

57LORD, you’re my portion;

I promise to obey what you say.

58I ask for your blessing with all my heart;

be gracious to me like you promised.

59When I think about your ways,

I turn to your testimonies.

60I hurry to obey your commandments.

61Although sinful people’s cords ensnare me,

I won’t let them pull me away from your Law.

62At midnight I get up to thank you

for your good ordinances.

63I’m a friend to everyone that respects you

and keeps your precepts.

64The earth is full of your enduring love, LORD;

teach me your regulations.	Ps 119:57-64

Tet ט

65You’ve dealt well with me,

LORD, like you promised.

66Give me discernment and insight

because I believe in your commandments.

67Before I suffered I went astray,

but now I keep your word.

68You’re good and do good;

teach me your regulations.

69The godless have smeared me with slander;

but I’ll still observe your precepts with all my heart.

70Their hearts are dull,

but I delight in your Law.

71Suffering was good for me

because from it I learned to obey your statutes.

72Your Law is more valuable to me

than thousands of pieces of silver and gold. 	Ps 119:65-72

Yod י

73You made me and fashioned me;

help me understand so I can appreciate your commandments.

74May the ones that respect you see me and be happy

because I wait for your promise.

75LORD, I know your judgments are right

and that it was in your faithfulness that you oppressed me.

76Let your enduring love comfort me

like you promised.

77Send me your mercy so I can live,

because I delight in your Law.

78Discredit godless people

because they’re undermining my welfare with deceit;

meanwhile, I’ll stay focused on your precepts.

79May those who respect you return to me,

the ones that know your testimonies.

80May my heart be blameless in regard to your statutes

so I won’t have any regrets.	Ps 119:73-80

Kaph  כ

81I’m weary waiting for your rescue,

but I’ve put my hope in your message.

82My eyes strain to see your promises come true,

while I say, “When will you comfort me?”

83Though I’ve shriveled up like a wineskin in smoke,

I don’t lose touch with your regulations.

84How long will I live?

When will you punish my persecutors?

85Godless men have dug pits to capture me,

men that don’t conform to your Law.

86Your commandments are reliable;

protect me from people that harass me with lies!

87They almost ruined me,

but I didn’t give up on your precepts;

88in your enduring love, spare my life

so I can keep obeying them.	Ps 119:81-88

Lamed ל

89LORD, your word is settled forever in heaven.

90Your faithfulness continues through every generation;

you built the earth to stand.

91Your ordinances stand today

because everything serves your purposes.

92If the Law hadn’t delighted me,

I would’ve died in my misery.

93But I’ll never forget your instructions

because you’ve given me life by them.

94I belong to you; save me

because I’ve relied on your precepts.

95Bad people lie in ambush to destroy me,

so I’ll diligently keep thinking about your testimonies.

96I’ve seen a limit to perfection in everything else,

but your commandments don’t have any.	Ps 119:89-96

Mem מ

97How I love your law!

I think about it all the time.

98Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies

because they’re my constant guide.

99I have more insight than my teachers

because your testimonies inform my thinking.

100I understand more than my elders

because I’ve observed your precepts.

101I’ve stayed off of every errant path

so I could keep your word.

102I haven’t turned aside from your ordinances

because you yourself have taught me.

103Your words taste so sweet!

they’re sweeter than honey!

104I gain insight from your precepts;

I’ve put my hope in what you say.

115Go away, bad people,

so I can observe God’s commands.

116Sustain me like you promised;

don’t let me lose hope.

117Uphold me so I’m safe,

so I can always regard your testimonies.

that you’ve laid down your testimonies to last forever.	Ps 119:145-52

Psalm 120

A Song of Ascents

1In my troubles I appealed to the LORD,

and he answered me.

2LORD, rescue me from lying lips

and treacherous tongues.

3What will God do to you, treacherous tongues?

How will he intensify your punishment?

4He’ll pierce you with a soldier’s sharp arrows

and burn you with coals from a broom tree.

5Misfortune awaits me because I’m a foreigner in Meshech,

because I live among the tents of Kedar!

6For too long I’ve lived where people hate peace.

7I’m for peace; but when I speak up, they’re for war.	Ps 120:1-7

Psalm 121

A Song of Ascents

1I look up toward the mountains—

will my help come from there?

2It’ll come from the LORD,

who made earth and sky.

3He won’t let your foot slip.

The One that guards you won’t slumber;

4he who watches over Israel never sleeps.

5The LORD is your keeper;

he’s your protection nearby.

6The sun won’t harm you during the day

or the moon at night.

7The LORD will protect you from harm

and keep you alive.

8He’ll guard you in everything you do

from now on forever.	Ps 121:1-8

Psalm 122

A Song of Ascents. by David

1It made me happy when they said,

“Let’s go to the LORD’s Temple.”

2We’re standing inside your gates, Jerusalem,

3that’s built solid and seamless,

4where the tribes of the LORD go up as required by the Law

to give him thanks;

5the thrones for judgment stand here,

the thrones of David’s dynasty.

6Pray for peace in Jerusalem:

“May they prosper who love you;

7may there be peace inside your walls

and prosperity in your palaces.”

8For the sake of my brothers and friends,

I say, “Peace be in you.”

9For the sake of the Temple of the LORD our God,

I’ll seek the best for you.	Ps 122:1-9

Psalm 123

A Song of Ascents

1I look to you enthroned in heaven!

2Like a servant looks to his master

and a maid looks to her mistress,

we look to the LORD our God

to show us mercy.

3Be gracious to us, LORD,

because we’ve had our fill of contempt.

4For too long our lives have been full of

the scorn of people at ease

and the contempt of arrogant others.	Ps 123:1-4

Psalm 124

A Song of Ascents. by David

1Let Israel acknowledge,

“If the LORD hadn’t taken our side

2when people attacked us,

3they would have swallowed us alive in their fury,

4the water would have overwhelmed us,

the river would have rushed over us,

5the raging water would’ve drowned us.”

6Bless the LORD,

who didn’t let us be torn to pieces in their teeth.

7We escaped like a bird from a trapper’s snare;

the snare broke and we got away.

8Our help comes from the LORD,

maker of earth and sky.	Ps 124:1-8

Psalm 125

A Song of Ascents

1Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion,

that can’t be moved, that lasts forever.

2Like mountains surround Jerusalem,

the LORD surrounds his people

from now on forever.

3Sinners won’t rule

in the land allotted to good people

because they’d tempt the good to do wrong.

4The LORD does good to those who do good,

who are godly in heart.

5But those who turn aside to their crooked ways,

he’ll lead away with sinners.

Peace to Israel!	Ps 125:1-5

Psalm 126

A Song of Ascents

1When the LORD brought us exiles back to Zion,

we were like people dreaming.

2Our mouths were laughing,

our tongues were shouting with joy;

the other nations were saying of us,

“The LORD has done great things for them.”

3Yes, the LORD has done great things for us;

we’re happy.

4Restore our fortunes, LORD,

like streams in the Negev.

5Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.

6Those who go back and forth weeping with their bags of seed,

will come again with shouts of joy, bringing bundles of grain.

Ps 126:1-6

Psalm 127

A Song of Ascents, by Solomon

1Unless the LORD builds the house,

they work for nothing who build it;

unless the LORD guards the city,

its watchmen stay awake for no reason.

2In vain you rise early and work late

to eat the food you gain by painful labor;

he gives rest to the ones he loves.

3Children are a gift from the LORD;

what the womb produces is a reward.

4Children born to a young man are

like arrows in a soldier’s hand.

5How blessed he is that has a quiver full of them;

he won’t be disgraced

when he confronts his accusers at the city gate.	Ps 127:1-5

Psalm 128

A Song of Ascents

1How blessed you are that respect the LORD

and follow his ways.

2When you eat what you earn,

you’ll be happy, and life will be good.

3Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your house;

your children will be like olive plants around your table.

4That’s how you’re blessed who respect the LORD.

5The LORD bless you from Zion;

may you see Jerusalem prosper your whole life.

6May you live to see your grandchildren.

Peace to Israel!	Ps 128:1-6

Psalm 129

A Song of Ascents

1Let Israel say,

2“They’ve persecuted me often since I was young,

but they haven’t defeated me.

3My back looks like a farmer plowed it

and made long furrows.”

4The LORD is good;

he has cut loose from me the cords of the wicked.

5May everyone that hates Zion

be driven away and discredited.

6Let them be like grass on a rooftop

that withers before it’s grown.

7The reaper doesn’t fill his hand with it,

or the bundler fill his arms.

8People that go past don’t say,

“The LORD bless you;

we bless you in his name.”	Ps 129:1-8

Psalm 130

A Song of Ascents

1LORD, I’ve cried out to you from the depths;

2be attentive to my petitions.

3If you kept track of sins, who could stand?

4But you forgive so people can continue to respect you.

5I wait for the LORD

and put my hope in what he says.

6I wait for the Lord

more than watchmen hope for morning.

7Israel, put your hope in the LORD

because there’s enduring love

and abundant redemption in him.

8He’ll redeem Israel from its sins.	Ps 130:1-8

Psalm 131

A Song of Ascents, by David

1LORD, my heart’s not proud or my eyes arrogant;

I don’t insert myself into things I can’t handle.

2I’ve calmed and quieted myself;

like a weaned child resting against its mother,

my soul is quiet within me.

3Israel, put your hope in the LORD

from now on forever.	Ps 131:1-3

Psalm 132

A Song of Ascents

1LORD, remember David and what he suffered;

2how he swore to the LORD

and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

3“I won’t go to my own house

or get on my bed 4and sleep

5till I find a place for the LORD to live,

a place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”	Ps 132:1-5

6We heard it in Ephrathah

and found it in the fields of Jaar,

7“Let’s go to his Temple

and worship at his footstool.”

8Come to your resting place, LORD,

you and the ark that represents your strength.

9May your priests be arrayed in goodness,

and your holy people sing for joy.

10For the sake of David your servant,

don’t turn away from your anointed one.

11You’ve sworn to him

a truth you won’t take back:

“I’ll set a son from your body on your throne.

12If your descendants keep my covenant

and the Testimony I teach them,

their descendants will also sit

on your throne permanently.” 	Ps 132:6-12

13You’ve chosen Zion;

you wanted to live there:

14“This is my permanent resting place;

I’ll live here because I’ve wanted it.

15I’ll abundantly bless what it can provide

and satisfy its needy ones with food.

16I’ll dress its priests in deliverance;

its holy people will sing for joy.

17I’ll make a horn from David spring up there

and light a lamp for my anointed one.

18I’ll dress his enemies in humiliation

but make his crown shine.”	Ps 132:13-18

Psalm 133

A Song of Ascents. by David

1It’s so good and pleasant

for brothers to live together in peace.

2It’s like precious anointing oil

running down like it did on Aaron’s beard

and dripped on his robe.

3It’s like the dew from Mount Hermon

that falls on the hills around Mount Zion;

the LORD commanded the blessing there—eternal life.	Ps 133:1-3

Psalm 134

A Song of Ascents

1Bless the LORD, you servants of the LORD

that serve him at night in his Temple!

2Raise your hands toward the sanctuary

and bless him.

3May the One that made earth and sky

bless you from Zion.	Ps 134:1-3

Psalm 135

1Hallelujah!

Praise the LORD;

praise him, his servant,

2you that stand in his Temple,

in the courts of our God!

3Praise him because he’s good;

sing his praises because he’s gracious,

4because he’s chosen Jacob for himself,

Israel for his own possession.	Ps 135:1-4

5I know the LORD is great,

that he’s above all gods.

6He does what he wants

in the sky, on earth, in the seas and all their depths.

7He makes clouds come up from the horizon;

he sends lightning with the rain

and brings the wind out of his storehouses.	Ps 135:5-7

8He struck Egypt’s firstborn,

people and animals.

9He performed signs and wonders

on Pharaoh and his people.

10He struck many nations

and slew powerful kings:

11Sihon, king of the Amorites;

Og, king of Bashan;

as well as the kingdoms in Canaan.

12He gave their land as an inheritance

to his people Israel.

13His name lasts forever;

his renown endures throughout all generations.

14The LORD will vindicate his people

and have mercy on his servants. 	Ps 135:8-14

15The hand-crafted idols the nations have are just silver and gold

16with mouths that can’t talk,

with eyes that can’t see,

17with ears that can’t hear;

and they can’t breathe.

18The ones that make them are just like them,

everybody that trusts in them too.	Ps 135:15-18

19House of Israel, bless the LORD;

House of Aaron, bless the LORD;

20House of Levi, bless the LORD;

you that respect the LORD, bless him.

21From Zion bless the LORD,

who lives in Jerusalem.

Hallelujah!	Ps 135:19-21

Psalm 136

His love is everlasting.

6to him that spread out the dry land higher than the water,

His love is everlasting.

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:1-9

His love is everlasting;

11and brought Israel out of there

His love is everlasting,

12with a strong hand and outstretched arm;

His love is everlasting,

His love is everlasting.

14and passed Israel through it,

His love is everlasting;

15but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in it;

His love is everlasting;	Ps 136:10-15

16to him that led his people through the desert,

His love is everlasting;

His love is everlasting;

18and slew them:

His love is everlasting.

His love is everlasting,

20and Og, king of Bashan;

His love is everlasting;

21and gave their land as an inheritance,

His love is everlasting,

22an inheritance for Israel his servant,

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:16-22

23who remembered us in our low estate

His love is everlasting;

24and rescued us from our enemies,

His love is everlasting,

25who gives good to every person.

His love is everlasting.

26Thank God in heaven.

His love is everlasting.	Ps 136:23-26

Psalm 137

1We sat by the rivers in Babylon

and cried when we remembered Zion.

2We hung our harps on its willows.

3Our captors required us to sing there;

our tormentors demanded happy songs,

“Sing us a song from Zion.”	Ps 137:1-3

4How can we sing about the LORD in a foreign land?

5If I forget you, Jerusalem,

may my right hand wither.

6May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth

if I don’t remember you,

if I don’t regard Jerusalem

above my greatest joy.

7Remember, LORD, against the Edomites

the day of Jerusalem, when they said to the Babylonians,

“Tear it down, tear it down to its foundation.”

8Young woman of Babylon, you devastated one,

how happy will be the one that repays you

with what you did to us.

9How happy will the one be that grabs your infants

and dashes them against the rocks!	Ps 137:4-9

Psalm 138

A Psalm of David

1I thank you with all my heart

and sing your praises in front of the mighty.

2I bow toward your holy Temple

and thank you for your enduring love and faithfulness,

because you’ve guaranteed your promises

with the honor your name has.

3You answered me when I called out to you

and made me bold with strength.	Ps 138:1-3

4Kings will thank you, LORD,

when they hear what you say.

5They’ll sing about your ways

because your honor is so great.

6Though you’re high above us,

you care about the lowly;

but you recognize the proud from a long way off.

7Though I’m in trouble, you’ll protect me

and reach out against my enemies to save me.

8You’ll accomplish the purposes you have for me;

your love endures forever, LORD.

Don’t abandon the ones you’ve created.	Ps 138:4-8

Psalm 139

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1LORD, you’ve known me and examined me.

2You know when I sit down and when I get up;

from a long way off you know what I’m thinking.

3You search out my traveling and my resting;

you’re well acquainted with my ways.

4Before I speak,

you know what I’m going to say.

5You’ve protected me front and back

and laid your hand over me.

6Knowledge like that is too amazing for me;

it’s beyond me; I can’t imagine it.	Ps 139:1-6

7Where can I go from your Spirit?

Where can I go to get away from you?

8If I go up to the sky, you’re there;

if I make my bed in Sheol, you’re there.

9If I take the wings of morning

and live by the most distant part of the ocean,

10even there you’ll lead me and support me.

11If I say, “Let darkness cover me,

and the light around me become night,”

12the dark’s not dark to you;

the night’s as bright as day.	Ps 139:7-12

13You formed my inner parts

and knit me together in my mother’s womb.

14Thank you; the way you’ve made me

is awesome and wonderful.

What you do is marvelous;

I know that for sure.

15My frame wasn’t hidden from you

when I was being made in secret,

intricately put together deep in the earth.

16You saw my unshaped substance;

you wrote in your scroll

the length of life you appointed for me

before there was any of it.	Ps 139:13-16

17How precious your thoughts are to me!

How vast their number is!

18If I could count them, they’d outnumber the grains of sand.

When I wake up, I’m still with you.

19Oh that you’d slay the sinful, God.

(Go away from me, you murderers!)

20Your enemies say awful things about you;

they use your name as a byword.

21Don’t I hate those who hate you?

Don’t I despise the ones that oppose you?

22I have total disdain for them;

they’re my enemies.

23Examine me, God, and know my heart;

test me and see how anxious my thoughts are.

24See if there’s anything offensive in me

and lead me in the everlasting way.	Ps 139:17-24

Psalm 140

For the Choir Director. A Psalm of David

1LORD, rescue me from sinful people

protect me from violent men,

2that plot evil things in their minds,

and constantly stir up conflict.

3They have pointed tongues like a snake;

viper’s venom lies behind their lips.

4LORD, protect me from sinful people;

Protect me from violent men,

that try to trip me.

5The arrogant hide traps for me;

with cords they spread a net beside the road

and set snares for me.	Ps 140:1-5

6I said to the LORD, “You’re my God;

listen to my petitions.

7GOD the Lord, my strong deliverer,

you’ve protected my head in battle.

8Don’t let sinful people do whatever they please;

don’t further their evil intentions.

9“Make the schemes they talk about

come down on their own heads.

10Let burning coals fall on them;

throw them into the fire,

into deep pits they can’t climb out of.

11Don’t let slanderers get a foothold in the earth;

have misfortune hunt down violent people quickly.”

12I know you’ll champion the cause of the suffering

and render justice for the poor.

13The godly will thank you

and live in your presence.	Ps 140:6-13

Psalm 141

A Psalm of David

1LORD, I’m calling on you; come quick;

hear me out.

2Consider my prayer as incense

and the raising of my hands as an evening offering.

3Guard my mouth;

watch over my lips.

4Incline my heart away from anything evil,

from practicing sinful things with sinners.	Ps 141:1-4

5Let a godly person strike me or rebuke me graciously;

that would be ointment for my head;

Don’t let me refuse it.

I still pray constantly against the deeds of sinners.

6When their leaders are thrown over the cliffs;

they’ll learn that the LORD’s word is true.

7“Like someone plowing up rocks,

our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”

8I look to you, Lord GOD,

and take refuge in you; don’t leave me with no defense.

9Keep me from the jaws of the trap they’ve set for me,

from sinners’ snares;

10may they stumble into their own nets

while I go on by safely.	Ps 141:5-10

Psalm 142

A Maskil of David when he was in the cave

A Prayer

1I cry out to the LORD

and petition him;

2I pour out my complaint to him

and tell him my troubles.

3When I feel overwhelmed,

he knows the route I should take;

they’ve hidden traps for me

on every path I walk.

4I look in every direction,

but nobody notices me.

There’s no escape for me;

nobody cares if I live.	Ps 142:1-4

5I’m calling out to you, LORD;

“You’re my refuge,

my portion among the living.

6Listen to my outcry

because I’m in desperate need;

deliver me from my persecutors;

they’re just too strong.

7Bring me out of prison

so I can thank you;

the godly gather around me

because you’ve been so good to me.”	Ps 142:5-7

Psalm 143

A Psalm of David

1Hear my prayer, LORD;

listen to my petition;

in your faithfulness and goodness, come to my relief.

2Don’t put me on trial

because, compared to you, nobody’s good.

3My enemy has chased me,

crushed me on the ground,

and made me sit in the dark like people long dead.

4So I feel overwhelmed,

and my heart is empty.

5I remember the old days;

I ponder everything you’ve done

and think about what you’ve made.

6I reach out for you,

thirsty for you like parched ground.	Ps 143:1-6

7Answer me right away, LORD;

my spirit is failing; don’t hide from me,

or I’ll get like those destined for the Pit.

8Let me hear about your enduring love every morning

because I put my trust in you;

show me where to walk

because I’m lifting myself up to you.

9Deliver me from my enemies;

you’re my refuge.

10Teach me how to do your will

because you’re my God;

let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.

11In defense of your honor, LORD, protect me;

in your goodness, take me away from trouble;

12in your enduring love, slay my enemies;

destroy the ones that abuse me,

because I’m your servant.	Ps 143:7-12

Psalm 144

A Psalm of David

1Bless the LORD, my Rock,

who trains my hands for war,

my fingers for battle.

2He’s my enduring love and fortress,

my stronghold and deliverer,

my shield and refuge,

who subdues nations.

3LORD, what are we that you give us any thought

or care about us?

4We’re like a breath;

our lifetime is like a passing shadow.	Ps 144:1-4

5Lower the sky, LORD, and come down;

touch the mountains and make them smoke.

6Throw your lightning bolts and scatter my enemies;

shoot your arrows and rout them.

7Reach down from on high

and rescue me from deep water,

from aliens 8that lie,

whose right hand deceives.

9I’ll sing you a new song, God;

I’ll sing praise to you on a ten-string harp.

10You deliver kings

and rescued David from the cruel sword.

11Deliver me from aliens that lie,

whose right hand deceives.	Ps 144:5-11

12Make our sons in their youth like grown-up plants

and our daughters like corner pillars in a palace.

13Fill our granaries with every kind of crop;

have our flocks bear thousands—tens of thousands—in our pastures.

14Have our cattle deliver without miscarriage or failure to bear;

make it so there’s no danger in our streets.

15How happy people are that have such blessings;

how blessed they are that have the LORD as their God! Ps 144:12-15

Psalm 145

A Psalm of Praise. by David

1I’ll praise you highly, my God and king,

and bless you forever.

2I’ll bless you every day

and praise you from now on.

3You’re great and deserve great praise;

you have a greatness we have no way to measure.

4One generation will praise your works to the next

and tell about the powerful things you’ve done.

5They’ll think about your majestic glory and splendor

and about your amazing acts.

6People will talk about the power evident in your awesome deeds

and tell how great you are.

7They’ll overflow with the fame of your abundant goodness

and loudly sing about your godliness.	Ps 145:1-7

8The LORD is gracious and merciful,

slow to get angry and great in enduring love.

9He’s good to everyone;

his mercy spreads out across his whole creation.

10Everything he’s made will thank him;

his holy people will bless him.

11They’ll speak of the honor his kingdom has

and talk about his power

12to make known his powerful deeds

and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.

13His kingdom lasts forever;

his dominion continues across all generations.	Ps 145:8-13

14The LORD catches the ones that fall down

and straightens up those who are bent over.

15Everyone looks to him for help,

and he gives them their food as needed.

16He meets the needs of every living thing.

17The LORD shows his goodness in everything he does,

his kindness in every deed.

18He’s near to those who call on him,

that call on him sincerely.

19He provides for the people who respect him;

he hears their call and saves them.

20He protects those who love him,

but destroys the sinful.

21I’ll speak praise to the LORD;

everyone will bless him forever. 	Ps 145:14-21

Psalm 146

1Praise the LORD, my soul!

2I’ll praise my God as long as I live

and sing praises to him as long as I’m here.

3Don’t rely on rulers,

mortals, who can’t help.

4They quit breathing and go back into the ground;

their plans come to an end at the same time.

5How blessed they are that have Jacob’s God to help them,

whose hope lies in the LORD

6that made earth and sky,

the ocean and everything in them,

that’s dependable forever,

7who renders justice to the oppressed,

who feeds the hungry

and sets the prisoners free.	Ps 146:1-7

8He gives sight to the blind,

lifts up the burdened,

and loves the godly.

9He protects foreigners

and supports widows and the fatherless,

but thwarts the sinful.

10The LORD will reign forever,

your God, Zion, to all generations.

Hallelujah!	Ps 146:8-10

Psalm 147

1Hallelujah!

It’s good to sing praises to our God;

praising him is fitting because he’s gracious.

2The LORD builds up Jerusalem

and gathers the outcasts in Israel.

3He heals the brokenhearted

and bandages up their wounds.

4He counts the stars

and calls them each by name.

5Our Lord is great and has great power,

and understanding without limit.

6He supports the abused

and takes sinners down to the ground.	Ps 147:1-6

7Sing thanksgiving to the LORD;

sing praise to our God with a lyre.

8He covers the sky with clouds,

provides rain for the ground,

and makes grass grow on the hills.

9He gives animals their food

and feeds the young ravens when they caw.

10He doesn’t delight in the strength of horses

or take pleasure in human might.

11The LORD favors those who respect him,

who place their hopes in his enduring love.	Ps 147:7-11

12Praise the LORD, Jerusalem;

praise your God, Zion.

13He’s reinforced the bars on your gates

and blessed those who reside in you.

14He brings peace to your borders

and satisfies you with the finest wheat.

15He issues his command to the world,

and his message travels swiftly.

16He sends snow like wool

and scatters frost like ashes.

17He makes it hail;

who can stand his freezing cold?

18He speaks and it melts;

he makes wind blow and water flow.

19He declares his message to Jacob,

his statutes and ordinances to Israel.

20He hasn’t dealt this way with any other nation;

they haven’t known his ordinances.

Hallelujah!	Ps 147:12-20

Psalm 148

1Hallelujah!

and shining stars.

4Praise him, highest heaven,

and water vapor in the sky.

5Let them praise the LORD

because he commanded and they came to be.

6He established them forever

by a decree that won’t expire.	Ps 148:1-6

7Praise the LORD from earth,

you sea monsters and all the great deep,

8fire and hail, snow and clouds,

stormy wind fulfilling his command,

9mountains and hills,

fruit trees and cedars,

10wild animals and livestock,

crawling things and flying birds,

11kings of the earth and all the nations,

officials and judges

12young men and virgins,

old men and children.

13Praise the LORD

because he alone is to be esteemed;

his honor towers higher than earth and sky.

14He makes his people strong

and establishes praise for his holy nation,

for Israel that’s near him.

Hallelujah!	Ps 148:7-14

Sing the LORD a new song;

praise him in the assembly of his holy people.

2Be happy in your Maker, Israel;

celebrate your King, people of Zion.

sing praises with tambourines and lyres,

4because the LORD delights in you

and graces harassed people with deliverance.	Ps 149:1-4

and two-edged swords in your hands

7to carry out vengeance on nations

and punishment on peoples,

and nobles with iron restraints,

9to carry out prescribed judgment on them.

with loud crashing cymbals.

Hallelujah!  	Ps 150:1-6

PROVERBS

1:1Proverbs of Solomon Son of David, King of Israel

2for knowing wisdom and instruction,

for understanding words that give insight,

3for receiving instruction in smart living,

goodness, justice, and equity;

4for giving prudence to the simple,

and knowledge and discretion to the young;

5for increasing learning in the wise

and gaining skill at understanding;

6for understanding proverbs and wise sayings,

riddles and profound speech.	Prov 1:1-6

7Respect for the LORD is the first thing about being wise;

foolish people despise wisdom and instruction.

8Listen, son, to your father’s instruction;

don’t leave your mother’s teaching;

9they’ll be a crown for your head

and a garland for your neck.	Prov 1:7-9

10Son, if sinners tempt you, don’t give in to them.

11If they say, “Come on,

let’s lie in wait to shed blood

and ambush innocent people for fun.

12Let’s swallow them alive and whole like Sheol,

like people that go down to the Pit.

13We’ll get precious wealth

and fill our houses with plunder.

14Throw in your lot with us,

and we’ll share the take”—

15don’t go with them;

stay off that road.

16They hurry to do harm;

they run to shed blood.	Prov 1:10-16

17There’s no point in spreading a net

while the bird’s watching.

18Sinners lie in wait for their own blood;

they ambush their own lives.

19That’s how it is with people that profit from violence;

it steals their own lives.	Prov 1:17-19

20Wisdom shouts in the street;

it raises its voice in the marketplace.

21It cries out from the top of the wall

and says at the city gate:

22“How long, simpletons, will you like being simpletons,

and you scoffers delight in scoffing,

and you foolish people hate knowledge?

23Pay attention when I correct you;

I’ll pour out my spirit on you

and tell you what you need to know.

24I called and you wouldn’t listen;

I held out my hand, and you paid no attention.

25You ignored my advice;

you didn’t want me to correct you.

26So I’ll laugh at your misfortune

and mock you when panic strikes,

27when what you dread comes like a tornado,

when distress come crashing down on you. 	Prov 1:20-27

28Then you’ll call out to me, and I won’t answer;

you’ll look for me, but not find me

29because you disregarded knowledge

and chose not to respect the LORD.

30You wouldn’t accept my advice;

you despised being corrected;

31so you’ll eat the fruit of how you lived

founder on your own schemes.

32The waywardness of simpleminded people gets them killed;

the complacency of fools destroys them.

33But the ones that listen to me, live securely;

they’re at ease without dreading misfortune.”	Prov 1:28-33

2:1Son, if you accept what I say

and value my commandments,

2if you’re attentive to wisdom

and inclined to understanding,

3if you cry out for insight

and call out for comprehension,

4if you look for it like silver

and search for it like treasure—

5then you’ll understand the importance of reverence for the LORD

and find out what it means to know God.	Prov 2:1-5

6The LORD gives wisdom;

knowledge and insight come from him.

7He stores up wisdom for godly people

and shields those who maintain integrity

8and guard justice.

He preserves his saints.

9Then you’ll understand goodness and justice,

equity and every proper course of action.

10Wisdom will come into your heart,

and knowledge will be pleasant to you.	Prov 2:6-10

11Discretion will come to you;

knowledge will watch over you

12to deliver you from the evil way,

from people that say perverse things,

13who leave the paths of godliness

to walk in the dark,

14who enjoy sinning

and revel in its perversity,

15whose paths are crooked,

whose ways are treacherous;

16to deliver you from immoral women,

from the seductive woman

17that leaves the husband of her youth

and forgets her covenant with God,

18whose house lies on the road to death,

whose footprints lead to the dead.

19No man that enters her house ever comes back;

they don’t reach the paths that lead to life.	Prov 2:11-19

20Follow the road good people take;

keep to the paths they follow,

21because the godly will live in the land;

the blameless will stay here.

22But sinners will be removed from the land;

the treacherous will be uprooted from their country.	Prov 2:20-22

3:1Son, don’t forget what I’ve taught you;

take my commandments to heart;

2they’ll add peace and length to your life.

3Don’t let kindness and truth slip away from you;

tie them around your neck;

write them on your heart.

4That way you’ll find blessing

and have a good reputation with God and people.

5Trust in the LORD with all your heart;

don’t rely on your own perception.

6Acknowledge him in everything you do,

and he’ll make straight paths for you to follow.

7Don’t get the idea that you’re smart;

respect the LORD and turn your back on sin.

8It will heal your body and refresh your very bones.	Prov 3:1-8

9Honor the LORD with your substance,

the firstfruits of your crops.

10Your barns will be full;

your vats will overflow with new wine.	Prov 3:9-10

11Son, don’t reject the LORD’s discipline

or give up when he corrects you;

12he corrects the ones he cares about,

like a father that disciplines a son he delights in.

13They are blessed who find wisdom,

that gain insight.

14It’s more profitable than silver;

it brings greater gains than fine gold.

15It’s more precious than jewels;

nothing you desire can compare with it.

16Its left hand holds wealth and honor;

long life is in its right hand.

17Its ways are pleasant;

its paths are peaceful.

18It’s a life-giving tree for people that pick its fruit;

everybody that holds onto it is happy.	Prov 3:11-18

19The LORD founded the earth with wisdom

and established the heavens with understanding;

20he broke up the depths with his knowledge

and caused dew to settle from the sky.	Prov 3:19-20

21Son, keep sound wisdom and discretion nearby;

don’t let them out of your sight.

22They’ll refresh your soul

and adorn your neck.

23You’ll walk along your road

surefooted without stumbling.

24When you lie down, you won’t feel afraid;

when you go to bed, your sleep will be sweet.

25Don’t be afraid of sudden panic

or the ruin that sinful people may bring,

26because you’ll have confidence with the LORD;

he’ll keep your foot out of the snare.	Prov 3:21-26

27Don’t withhold good from people that need it

when you can give it.

28Don’t tell them,

“Come back tomorrow, and you can have it.”

29Don’t devise misfortune against the one

that’s living safely beside you.

30Don’t be difficult with people

if they’ve done you no wrong.

31Don’t envy the violent

or choose to do what they do.

32The LORD detests crooked people,

but he’s close to godly ones.

33He puts a curse on the house of the sinful,

but blesses the homes of the righteous.

34He scoffs at scoffers,

but is gracious to the humble.

35The wise receive honor;

the foolish get disgrace.	Prov 3:27-35

4:1Listen to my instruction, children;

pay attention and learn.

2I’ll give you helpful guidance;

don’t abandon it.

3When I was my father’s son,

my mother’s tender, only boy,

4he taught me,

“Hold fast to what I say;

keep my commandments and live.

5Gain wisdom! Get insight!

Don’t forget it or leave it.

6Keep it with you, and it’ll protect you;

love it, and it’ll watch over you.

7This is the main thing about wisdom: get it;

whatever else you get, get that.

8Value it highly, and it’ll elevate you;

it will bring you honor if you embrace it.

9It will put a beautiful wreath on your head

and present you with a splendid crown.”	Prov 4:1-9

10Accept what I’m telling you, son,

and you’ll live a long time.

11I’ve directed you in the way of wisdom

and led you in godly paths.

12When you walk, you won’t be hampered;

when you run, you won’t stumble.

13Latch hold of instruction and don’t let go;

guard it, and it will determine your destiny.	Prov 4:10-13

14Don’t follow the road that sinners travel

or walk the path of perverse people.

15Avoid it; don’t pass by it;

turn and go the other way.

16They can’t sleep unless they mistreat someone;

they lose sleep unless they can trip somebody up.

17They eat the bread of wickedness,

and drink the wine of violence.

18But the path of goodness is like dawn’s early light;

it shines brighter and brighter till it’s fully day.

19The way of sinners is like darkness;

they don’t know what they’re stumbling over.	Prov 4:14-19

20Pay attention to me, son;

listen to what I’m telling you;

21don’t let it out of your sight;

keep it inside you.

22It gives life to those who find it

and health to their whole body.

23Watch over your heart diligently,

because the springs of life flow out of it.

24Put away a deceitful mouth;

put devious lips far from you.

25Look straight ahead;

fix your gaze in front of you.

26Keep your eye on the path you’re walking,

and all your ways will be safe.

27Don’t stray from them;

go the other way from sin.	Prov 4:20-27

5:1Pay attention to my wisdom, son;

listen to what I understand

2so you can use discretion

and express knowledge.

3An immoral woman’s lips drip honey;

her speech is more soothing than oil;

4but in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood,

as sharp as a two-edged sword.

5Her feet go down to death;

her steps lead to Sheol.

6She doesn’t ponder the path of life;

she wanders without realizing it.	Prov 5:1-6

7Listen to me, sons;

don’t turn aside from what I’m telling you.

8Stay away from her;

don’t go near her house,

9so you won’t be giving your vigor to others

and your years to someone cruel;

10so a stranger won’t be filled with your strength

and the fruit of your act go to an alien;

11and you groan at the end of life

because you misused your body;

12and you say, “I hated instruction!

my heart despised being corrected!

13I didn’t listen to my teachers

or pay attention to my instructors!

14I’ve come to the point of total ruin

and have to face public disgrace.”	Prov 5:7-14

15Drink water from your own cistern,

fresh water from your own well.

16Should your spring be spilled

like water running down the street?

17Let it be for yours alone,

not for a stranger too.	Prov 5:15-17

18Let your fountain be blessed;

be happy with the wife of your youth.

19Like a lovely deer, a graceful doe,

be satisfied with her breasts;

be stimulated by her love.

20Son, why be stimulated by an immoral woman?

why embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21The LORD watches everyone

to see which direction they’re going.

22Their own iniquities capture the wicked;

they get caught in the web of their own sins.

23They die from ignorance

and get lost over foolishness. 	Prov 5:18-23

6:1Son, if you sign for your neighbor

or give a pledge for a stranger,

2if you get snared by a promise you’ve made

or caught by what you’ve said,

3do this to deliver yourself:

since you’re at his disposal,

humble yourself and plead with him

to take away your obligation.

4Don’t sleep or slumber;

5deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hunter,

like a bird from a fowler.	Prov 6:1-5

6Go observe ants, lazy guy;

watch what they do and wise up.

7Though they don’t have a chief, an officer, or ruler,

8they prepare their food in the summer;

at harvest time they gather provisions for winter.

9How long will you lie around?

When will you get up from napping?

10“A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to rest”—

11your poverty will come on you like a bandit;

your need will attack you like an armed man. 	Prov 6:6-11

12A worthless, wicked man is one

that goes around lying,

13that winks with his eye,

signals with his feet,

gestures with his fingers,

14that plots in his mind

and constantly stirs up conflict.

15Tragedy will come crashing down on him;

all at once he’ll be crushed beyond recovery.	Prov 6:11-15

16Six things the LORD despises;

no, make that seven that disgust him:

17arrogant eyes,

lying tongues,

blood-shedding hands,

18plotting hearts,

feet in a hurry to do harm,

19witnesses who perjure themselves

and people that stir up conflict between friends.	Prov 6:16-19

20Son, keep your father’s commands;

don’t leave your mother’s teachings.

21Bind them next to your heart;

hang them around your neck.

22They’ll guide you when you walk,

watch over you while you sleep,

and advise you when you wake up.

23A commandment is a lamp;

teaching is a light;

corrections that discipline lead to life.	Prov 6:20-23

24They keep your eyes off an immoral woman,

a loose woman with smooth talk.

25Don’t desire her beauty

or let her catch your attention with her eyes.

26A prostitute leaves a man with little to eat;

an immoral woman stalks his very life.

27Can a man carry fire in his arms

and not singe his clothes?

28Can he walk on hot coals

and not burn his feet?

29Can a man go to his neighbor’s wife

and not suffer for it?	Prov 6:24-29

30People don’t despise a thief

that steals because he’s hungry;

31but when he’s caught, he still needs to repay it seven times over

even if he has to sell everything in his house to make it right.

32A man that commits adultery lacks good judgment;

he’s looking to destroy himself.

33He’ll find wounds and disgrace

and shame he can’t erase.

34Jealousy makes a husband furious;

he won’t restrain his revenge.

35He won’t accept ransom

or be content with your gifts.	Prov 6:30-35

7:1Take my advice, son;

treasure up my commandments inside you.

2Keep my commands so you can have a life;

guard my teachings like the pupil in your eye.

3Tie them on your fingers;

write them on your heart.

4Call wisdom your sister and insight your friend,

5so they can keep you away from the adulteress

that flatters with her words.	Prov 7:1-5

6At the window of my house

I looked out through the lattice

7and saw among the naïve

a young man with no sense.

8He was going down the street near her corner

on the way to her house,

9in the evening at dusk.

During the night after dark,

10a woman comes to meet him,

dressed like a prostitute, coy at heart.

11She’s loud and rebellious, not content to stay home—

12now in the streets, now in the squares,

lurking at every corner.	Prov 7:6-12

13She grabs him and kisses him,

and says to him with a brazen face,

14“It was time for me to offer peace offerings;

I paid my vows today.

15So I’ve come out to meet you,

to look for you eagerly, and I found you.

16I’ve decorated my couch with covers,

with colored linens from Egypt.

17I’ve sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18Come on, let’s drink our fill of love till morning;

let’s delight ourselves with love.

19My husband’s gone on a long trip;

20he’s taken a moneybag with him

and won’t be back till full moon.”	Prov 7:13-20

21She entices him with persuasion,

And seduces him with flattery.

22Finally he follows her like a bull to slaughter,

like a stag heading for a trap.

23An arrow pierces his liver;

like a bird swooping to a snare,

he doesn’t realize it will cost him his life.	Prov 7:21-23

24So pay attention to what I’m saying, sons.

25Don’t let your heart turn to its own ways

or stray into its own paths;

26doing that has thrown down so many victims

and slain them.

27Her house lies on the road to Sheol,

that descends to the den of death.	Prov 7:24-27

8:1Wisdom calls out,

and intelligence raises its voice.

2It takes its stand on high places

where footpaths meet.

3It shouts at the city gates:

4“I’m calling out to you;

my voice is aimed at everyone.

5Learn prudence, simple ones;

gain wisdom, foolish people.

6Listen, so I can tell you nobler things,

important things come from me.	Prov 8:1-6

7I tell the truth

because I detest sinfulness.

8Everything I say is good;

there’s nothing devious in it.

9What I say makes sense to anyone that has insight;

it’s right to those who learn.

10Take instruction rather than silver;

accept knowledge instead of gold

11because wisdom is worth more than jewels;

nothing you want compares with it.	Prov 8:7-11

12“I, wisdom, and good judgment live together;

I discover knowledge and discretion.

13Respecting the LORD means hating sin,

pride and arrogance,

corrupt behavior and perverse speech.

14I offer advice about wise living

and provide insight and strength.

15Kings reign by me,

and rulers decree justice.

16Officials and nobles govern by me

as does everyone that judges justly.

17I love the ones that love me,

that diligently search me out.

18I have wealth and honor to offer,

lasting riches and goodness.

19My fruit has more value than pure gold;

my yield outperforms the finest silver.

20I walk in the way of goodness,

on the paths of justice,

21to endow with wealth the ones that love me.		Prov 8:12-21

22“The LORD created me at the very beginning,

before anything else he did in ancient times.

23I was in place from everlasting,

from the beginning of time on earth.

24I came before there were any oceans

or any springs abounded with water,

25before the mountains were born

or any hills existed,

26before he made soil and fields

and dust on the ground.	Prov 8:22-26

27I was there when he put the heavens in place

and drew the horizons around the ocean;

28when he set the sky above

and established the fountains in the deep;

29when he laid shorelines for the seas

so water couldn’t cross their boundaries;

when he marked out the foundations for the earth.

30I stood beside him like a general contractor,

serving as his daily delight,

celebrating with him,

31rejoicing in the world he was making,

delighting in humankind.	Prov 8:27-31

32“So now, my children, listen to me

because I bless those who keep my ways.

33Obey instruction in order to be wise;

don’t neglect it.

34Blessed are those who pay attention to what I say,

who watch at my gates each day

and wait at my doorpost.

35The ones that find me find life

and gain the LORD’s blessing.

36But those who miss out on me hurt themselves;

the ones that hate me love death.”	Prov 8:32-36

9:1Wisdom has built her house;

she’s carved its seven columns.

2She’s done her butchering, mixed her wine,

and set her table.

3She’s sent her maids

to call out from the heights of the city:

4“Whoever is naïve, turn in here!”

She says to those who lack good judgment,

5“Come in and eat my food

drink the wine I’ve mixed.

6Abandon your foolish ways and start having a life;

conduct yourself with good judgment.”	Prov 9:1-6

7If you correct a scoffer, you’ll be abused;

if you reprove sinners, you’ll get insulted.

8So don’t bother reproving scoffers; they’ll hate you;

reprove the wise, and they’ll love you.

9Instruct the wise, and they’ll be wiser still;

teach the good, and they’ll be better yet.

10Respect for the LORD is basic to wisdom;

knowing the Holy One clarifies your thinking.

11It’ll multiply your days

and add years to your life.

12If you’re wise, you’re wise for yourself;

if you scoff at wisdom, it’ll be to your detriment.	Prov 9:7-12

13A foolish woman is loud;

she’s naïve and ignorant.

14She sits in the doorway of her house

or takes a seat on the high places in town.

15She calls out to those who are going by,

who are following straight paths:

16“Whoever is naïve, turn in here,”

she claims to those who don’t know any better.

17“Stolen water is refreshing;

bread eaten in secret tastes good.”

18But they don’t know that the dead are there,

that her guests lie in Sheol.	Prov 9:13-18

10:1Proverbs of Solomon

A wise son makes a happy father,

but a foolish one grieves his mother.

2Ill-gotten gain doesn’t gain you anything,

but goodness delivers you from death.

3The LORD won’t let good people go hungry;

he thwarts what the wicked want.

4A lazy hand makes for poverty;

a diligent one produces wealth.

5They who gather crops in the summer are smart;

those who sleep at harvest time are shameful.

6Blessings come to the good,

but the sinful harbor violent intentions.	Prov 10:1-6

7Good people leave blessed memories behind,

but sinful people’s names rot away.

8The wise in heart accept commands,

but babbling fools come to ruin.

9If you live with integrity, you’ll live with confidence;

but people soon find out if you’re crooked.

10The one that winks causes trouble;

babbling fools come to ruin.

11Good people’s words are life-giving fountains;

what sinners harbor discord.

12Hatred stirs up conflict,

but love atones for all sins.

13Wisdom comes from people that have insight;

but a rod is for the back of fools.

14The wise store up knowledge,

but ruin is at hand for foolish people.		Prov 10:7-14

15For the rich, wealth is a fortress;

for the poor, poverty is their ruin.

16Life is good people’s pay;

punishment is bad people’s payback.

17Listening to instruction puts you on the route to life;

abandoning correction gets you lost.

18Hiding hatred makes you a liar;

spreading slander makes you a fool.

19Talking too much makes you likely to sin;

so be wise and limit what you say.

20The words of good people are like fine silver;

what sinners say isn’t worth repeating.	Prov 10:15-20

21What good people say feeds many;

foolish people starve to death from ignorance.

22The LORD’s blessing makes you rich,

and he doesn’t add sorrow to it.

23Sin is fun for fools;

so is wisdom for the wise.

24What sinners fear tends to happen;

what good people want they tend to receive.

25After a windstorm passes, sinners have been blown away;

but the godly have a firm foundation.

26To those who hire them,

lazy people irritate like vinegar on teeth

and smoke in the eyes.				Prov 10:21-26

27Respecting the LORD lengthens your life;

sinfulness cuts it short.

28Good people’s hopes result in happiness,

but the expectations of the sinful fade away.

29The LORD’s way is your fortress if you’re godly,

but it destroys sinners.

30Good people won’t be displaced,

but the sinful will be expelled from their land.

31The mouth of good people overflows with wisdom,

but the perverse tongue of the wicked will be cut off.

32Good people say what’s acceptable,

but the sinful say perverse things.	Prov 10:27-32

11:1The LORD detests a false balance;

he delights in accurate weights.

2Dishonor follows pride,

but wisdom lies with the humble.

3The integrity of the wise gives them direction;

the dishonesty of treacherous people destroys them.

4Wealth won’t help you when judgment comes,

but goodness delivers you from death.

5Goodness smooths the way for the blameless,

but the sinful collapse under the weight of their own sin.

6Their goodness delivers the godly;

their greed snares deceivers.	Prov 11:1-6

7When sinners die, their aspirations die as well;

hope perishes with the godless.

8Good people leave trouble behind,

but sinners head right for it.

9The godless destroy their neighbors with their mouths,

but knowledge lets the righteous escape.

10A city celebrates when things go well for the godly;

there’s also happy shouting over the demise of the sinful.

11The godly are a blessing that builds up a city;

the mouths of sinners tear it down.

12Belittling your neighbor doesn’t help anybody;

be silent and just let it rest.

13Gossips go around telling secrets;

reliable people keep private matters private.

14Without wise leaders a nation falls;

victory comes from having many advisors.	Prov 11:7-14

15Standing good for a stranger’s debt

means you’re likely to pay it;

avoid guaranteeing it and stay safe.

16A gracious woman earns respect;

a violent man just gets rich.

17Kindness repays you;

cruelty destroys you.

18Sinners get rich by deception;

people that sow goodness make a legitimate living.

19Steadfast goodness promotes life;

chasing after evil gets you killed.

20The LORD detests the perverse in heart;

he delights in those blameless in their living.

21Sinful people will certainly suffer for it,

but the children of the just will be rescued.

22A beautiful woman with no discretion

is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.	Prov 11:15-22

23The godly look forward to good things;

the sinful are simply waiting for wrath.

24Give liberally and grow richer;

withhold what you should give

and be in need.

25The generous prosper;

those who refresh other people will be refreshed.

26People curse the one that hoards grain

but bless the one that sells it to people that need it.

27Whoever seeks the good finds favor,

and trouble comes to the one that’s looking for it.

28People that rely on their wealth will fall;

but the godly will flourish like green leaves.	Prov 11:23-28

29Bring trouble on your family,

and you’ll inherit the wind;

the foolish serve the wise.

how much more godless sinners!	Prov 11:29-31

whoever hates to be corrected stays ignorant.

but condemns those who concoct evil.

but one that embarrasses him is like cancer in his bones.

but the advice of sinners is treacherous.

but the words of the godly rescue people.	Prov 12:1-6

7The sinful are overthrown and disappear,

but the godly stand firm.

8People are commended for using good sense;

people with perverted minds are despised.

9The humble who work as servants are better off

than those who honor themselves and go hungry.

10Good people care about their animals’ life;

sinful people are cruel to everything.

11Plow your ground and you’ll have plenty to eat;

chasing after fantasies shows poor judgment.

12Sinners are jealous of each other’s plunder,

but the goodly produce their own things.	Prov 12:7-12

13Their own words trap sinful people;

good people avoid trouble like that.

14Good people gain satisfaction

from the effects of their words;

their actions also return to reward them.

15Fools think their way is the right way;

but the wise are willing to listen.

16Fools fly off the handle when insulted,

but the prudent stay calm.

17Honest witnesses tell the truth;

false ones just make up something.

18Cutting remarks spoken rashly thrust like daggers,

but wise words heal wounds.	Prov 12:13-18

19A truthful tongue lasts a lifetime,

but lying lips don’t endure.

but advisors of peace have joy.

21Harm tends not to fall on good people;

sinners are always in trouble.

but delights in reliable people.

foolish people talk too much.

24The diligent rule;

the lazy end up enslaved.	Prov 12:19-24

sinful ones get them lost.

diligent ones gain precious possessions.

28Life lies along the road good people follow;

there’s no death there.	Prov 12:25-28

13:1Wise children accept their father’s discipline,

but scoffers don’t pay attention to correction.

2From the influence of your words,

people respond willingly;

but treacherous people want to force things through.

3Be careful what you say, and you’ll save yourself;

talk too much, and you’ll do yourself in.

4Lazy people want but don’t get;

the diligent have a rich supply.

5Good people hate lies,

but sinners act disgracefully.

6Goodness protects the blameless;

sinfulness undermines the sinful.	Prov 13:1-6

7One person acts rich but is poor;

another pretends to be poor but is wealthy.

8The rich can pay a ransom to save their lives,

but the poor don’t get kidnapped for ransom.

9The light of the godly shines bright,

but the lamp of the sinful flickers out.

10Insolence causes division;

accepting advice brings wisdom.

11Easy wealth soon dwindles away;

what we work for increases.

12Hope delayed makes a heart sick,

but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.	Prov 13:7-12

13Instruction destroys people that hate it;

a commandment rewards those who respect it.

14Wise teaching is your fountain of life

for avoiding the snares of death.

15Good sense leads to blessing,

but a treacherous mind creates hardship.

16Prudent people act with insight;

fools flaunt their foolishness.

17An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble,

but a faithful envoy can bring detente.

18We risk poverty and shame by neglecting self-discipline;

honor comes to us if we value correction.	Prov 13:13-18

19Seeing dreams come true is pleasant to the soul,

but fools hate to quit sinning.

20When you live with the wise you become wise;

companions of fools will suffer with them.

21Misfortune follows sinners,

but prosperity rewards the righteous.

22Good people leave an inheritance for their grandchildren;

sinners lay up wealth for the godly.

23Even fallow ground yields enough to feed the poor,

but injustice sweeps it all away.

24Those who spare the rod don’t love their children;

if you care about them, you’ll discipline them.

25Good people have enough to satisfy their appetite,

but a sinner’s stomach never feels full.	Prov 13:19-25

14:1A wise woman builds up her home;

a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

2We show respect for the LORD by pursuing godliness;

being crooked in our ways means we don’t respect him.

3The tongues of fools become a rod for their back;

the lips of the wise save them.

4A manger stays clean where there are no oxen,

but abundant crops come in by their strength.

5A truthful witness tells no lies;

a false one lies with every breath.

knowledge comes easy for insightful people. 	Prov 14:1-6

7Stay away from foolish people;

you won’t learn anything from them.

8Prudent people know where they’re going,

but fools mislead themselves.

10The heart knows its bitterness;

no one else can share its joy.

but the tent of the godly stands steady.

12There is a way that seems right,

but it leads to death.	Prov 14:7-12

13Laughter can hide a heavy heart;

joy can give way to grief.

14Perverse people get a fill of their own ways;

good people get satisfaction from theirs.

15Simpleminded people believe anything,

the prudent watch where they step.

16The wise take caution and get away from sin,

but fools are arrogant and reckless.

17Short-tempered people do foolish things;

people despise people that scheme.

18The naïve inherit foolishness,

but the prudent wear knowledge like a crown.	Prov 14:13-18

19Evil bows to good;

sinners will bow at the gates of the godly.

20Even neighbors dislike the poor,

but lots of people like the rich.

21Whoever despises another commits sin,

but those gracious to the poor find happiness.

22Won’t they take a loss that devise evil?

Those who devise good receive kindness and truth.

23There’s profit in work;

mere talk produces poverty.

24The wise wear their wealth like a crown;

the foolish dress in their own foolishness.	Prov 14:19-24

25A truthful witness saves lives,

but a false witness is a traitor.

26Those who respect the LORD feel confident;

their children have a reliable refuge.

27Respecting the LORD provides a fountain of life

so people can avoid the snares of death.

28A growing population speaks well for a king;

what’s the point of a prince without subjects?

29Wise people control their temper;

short-tempered people show their lack of good sense.

30A peaceful heart makes a healthy body,

but jealousy is like cancer of the bone.	Prov 14:25-30

31People that oppress the poor insult their Maker;

those who are gracious to them honor him.

32Sinful people get crushed by the disasters

they bring on themselves,

but the righteous have a refuge when they die.

33Wisdom rests in intelligent people,

but it’s not evident among fools.

34Goodness raises the quality of a nation;

sin’s a disgrace to any people.

35A king favors a servant that acts wisely,

but he lashes out at one that disgraces him.	Prov 14:31-35

15:1A gentle answer deflects anger;

harsh words make tempers flare.

2The wise dispense knowledge;

fools expound foolishness.

3The LORD sees everything;

he watches the evil and the good.

4Gentle words are a tree of life,

but perverse talk breaks people’s spirit.

5Fools reject their father’s discipline,

but those attentive to correction become prudent.

6There’s wealth in the house of the godly,

but the earnings of the sinful bring trouble.	Prov 15:1-6

7The lips of the wise give good advice;

the hearts of fools have nothing to offer.

8The LORD detests the sacrifices of sinners,

but delights in the prayers of the righteous.

9He detests the way of the wicked,

but loves people who pursue goodness.

10Those who abandon the way incur harsh discipline;

those who reject discipline die.

11Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD;

how much more our hearts!

12Scoffers don’t like people that rebuke them;

so they stay away from the wise.	Prov 15:7-12

13A cheerful heart makes a happy face,

but a sad heart breaks the spirit.

14The mind of the wise is hungry for insight,

but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.

15Negative people have nothing but bad days,

but with a happy heart they enjoy a continual feast.

16It’s better to have a little with reverence for the LORD

than to have a lot with turmoil attached.

17A plate of vegetables with someone you love tastes better

than a roast from a grain-fed cow with someone you don’t like.

18Hot-tempered people stir up quarrels,

but controlling anger calms contentions. 	Prov 15:13-18

19Briers overgrow lazy people’s paths,

but the upright travel on an open road.

20Wise children make a happy father;

foolish ones despise their mother.

21Foolishness is fun for the foolish,

but the wise walk on a straight path.

22Without advice plans go awry,

but with many advisors they succeed.

23Everyone enjoys giving a good answer,

and a timely word delights those who hear it!

24The path of the wise leads upward

away from Sheol below.	Prov 15:19-24

25The LORD tears down the house of the proud

but protects the widow’s home.

26The LORD detests evil plans

but delights in pure words.

27Those greedy for gain bring trouble home;

those who refuse bribes live in peace.

28The godly think before they speak;

sinners blurt out evil without thinking.

29The LORD stands far away from the sinful,

but he listens to the prayers decent people offer.

30A cheerful look makes the heart happy;

good news refreshes us deep inside.	Prov 15:25-30

31If you listen to constructive correction,

you’ll live among the wise.

32If you ignore instruction, you only hurt yourself;

by heeding correction, you gain insight.

33Respecting the LORD teaches wisdom;

humility comes before honor.	Prov 15:31-33

16:1We have intentions,

but the LORD provides the proper course of action.

2Our ways may seem pure to us,

but the LORD weighs our motives.

3Commit your work to the LORD,

and you’ll succeed.

4The LORD has a purpose for everything,

even for sinners in troubled times.

and makes sure they’re punished.

6Loyalty and faithfulness atone for sin;

respecting the LORD avoids evil.	Prov 16:1-6

7When we please the LORD,

he even makes our enemies live in peace with us.

8A little with goodness is better

than a lot with dishonesty.

9You can make your plans,

but the LORD directs the steps you’ll take.

10A king needs to make inspired decisions;

he can’t afford to err in his judgments.

11The LORD requires accurate scales and balances;

he sets the standard for every weight in the bag.

12An evil king is especially detestable;

a throne needs to be based on goodness.	Prov 16:7-12

13Godly words delight a king;

he loves people that tell the truth.

14A king’s anger is a death sentence;

the wise will appease it.

15There’s life in a king’s countenance;

his blessing is like clouds that bring spring rain.

16Getting wisdom is better than getting gold!

Choose insight over silver.

17The road of the upright leads away from evil;

those who watch where they’re going preserve their life.

18Pride goes before destruction,

and an arrogant spirit before a fall.	Prov 16:13-18

19Better to nurture a humble spirit

than share plunder with the proud.

20By attending to the LORD’S word, we find what’s good;

he blesses us who trust in him.

21The wise in heart we consider insightful;

their pleasant words seem more persuasive.

22Wisdom is a fountain of life to the wise,

but foolishness disciplines fools.

23The wise think carefully about what they say,

which adds power to their comments.

24Pleasant words are like honeycomb,

sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.	Prov 16:19-24

25There’s a way that seems right,

but it leads to death.

26The workers’ appetite works for them

because their hunger drives them on.

27Worthless people plot evil;

what they say is like a scorching fire.

28Perverse persons spread conflict;

slanderers alienate friends.

29Violent people tempt their friends

and lead them off in the wrong direction.

30Those who wink devise perverse things;

they who purse their lips bring about evil.	Prov 16:25-30

31A gray head is a crown of honor

gained by a good life.

32Those who are slow to lose their temper

are stronger than the powerful;

the ones that rule their spirit

are better than troops that capture a city.

33We cast lots in the lap,

but the LORD determines how they fall.	Prov 16:31-33

17:1A dry morsel eaten in peace tastes better

than a feast in a house full of conflict.

2A wise servant will rule a shameful son

and share in the inheritance among brothers.

3Fire refines silver and a furnace purifies gold,

but the LORD assays the heart.

4Wrongdoers pay attention to gossip;

liars latch onto slander.

5People that mock the poor insult their Maker;

those who rejoice over their misfortune will get their just due.

6Grandchildren are the crown of old age;

parents are the pride of their children.	Prov 17:1-6

7Fine speech doesn’t fit with being a fool;

much less is lying appropriate for leaders.

8A bribe is a lucky charm in its owner’s sight;

whoever uses it prospers!

9Forgiving fosters love,

but dwelling on faults alienates friends.

10A rebuke penetrates deeper into thoughtful people

than 100 blows affect a fool.

11Rebellious people are looking for trouble;

so a cruel messenger will confront them.

12Facing a bear robbed of her cubs

is safer than confronting a fool for his folly.	Prov 17:7-12

13Misfortune never leaves the house of anyone

that repays a good deed with a bad one.

14Starting an argument is like opening a floodgate;

so stop a quarrel before it starts.

15Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent

are equally detestable to the LORD.

16Why spend money on educating fools

when they don’t care about learning?

17A friend loves despite the circumstance;

adversity forges friendship.

18It’s not good judgment

to guarantee another person’s debt.	Prov 17:13-18

19Loving sin amounts to loving conflict;

trusting in tall walls invites invasion.

20A crooked heart doesn’t prosper;

a lying tongue calls for retaliation.

21The parents of a fool feel discouraged;

there’s no joy in life for the father of a fool.

22A happy heart is good medicine;

a broken spirit weakens health.

23Sinners accept secret bribes

to pervert the course of justice.

24Sensible people find wisdom nearby;

fools think they’ll find it far away.	Prov 17:19-24

25Foolish children are a grief to their father

and bring bitterness to the one that gave them birth.

26It’s wrong to punish the godly for their godliness

or flog noble people for being noble.

27Wise people speak with restraint;

cool heads display better insight.

28Even fools, people consider wise

as long as they keep their mouth shut;

people suppose fools are smart when they close their lips.

Prov 17:25-28

18:1Unfriendly people pursue selfish ends;

and don’t use common sense.

2Fools don’t delight in learning,

only in telling what they think.

3When sinners come, contempt comes with them;

and with dishonor comes disgrace.

4Wise thoughts are deep water;

wisdom is the spring for a babbling brook.

5Don’t cater to bad people

or deprive the good of justice.

6Fools’ lips instigate conflict;

their mouths are asking for a slap.	Prov 18:1-6

7The mouths of fools bring about their ruin;

their lips serve as snares to them.

8Rumors are like delicious morsels;

they just work their way down inside you!

9People that aren’t productive

are relatives of those who destroy.

10The LORD’s name is a strong tower;

escape to it for safety.

11The wealth of the rich is their fortified city;

in their imagination it’s like a high wall.

12Pride goes before destruction;

humility precedes honor.	Prov 18:7-12

13Popping off an answer before listening to the question

is foolish and shameful.

14The human spirit can survive a sick body,

but who can endure a broken spirit?

15The wise search for knowledge;

the prudent acquire it.

16Generosity opens doors

and connects you with important people.

17The first to argue a case in court

sounds convincing till someone cross-examines.

18Casting lots ends contentions;

it settles disputes between powerful contenders.	Prov 18:13-18

19Winning back an offended brother

is harder than conquering a fortified city;

arguments become like the barred gates of a fortress.

20What the mouth says satisfies the inner self;

what the lips express brings satisfaction.

21The tongue wields the power of life and death;

those who love it will reap its consequences.

22A man that finds a wife finds something good

and obtains the LORD’s blessing.

23The poor ask for help;

the rich answer roughly.

24Someone with lots of “friends” may come to ruin,

but there’s a friend that sticks closer than a brother.	Prov 18:19-24

19:1The honest poor are better off

than dishonest fools.

2It’s not good to not know;

enthusiasm doesn’t compensate for ignorance.

3When people’s foolishness brings them to ruin,

they blame the LORD.

4Wealth draws lots of friends

that desert you if poverty comes.

5False witnesses will get their just due;

perjurers won’t get off free.

6Many ask for generous people’s blessing;

everybody makes friends with bighearted people.	Prov 19:1-6

7Relatives of the poor despise them,

and their friends leave!

Appealing to them won’t bring them back.

8People that gain wisdom care about themselves;

they prosper who cherish understanding.

9False witnesses won’t go unpunished;

liars perish.

10Living in luxury isn’t fitting for a fool,

much less for a slave to rule over princes.

11Discretion gives you control over anger;

you learn to delight in overlooking sin.

12A king’s anger is like a lion’s roar;

his blessing falls like dew on grass.	Prov 19:7-12

13A foolish child destroys a father;

a nagging wife is like constant dripping.

14Houses and wealth people inherit from parents,

but a prudent wife comes from the LORD.

15Laziness lulls people to sleep;

shiftless people go hungry.

16Those who keep the commandments keep their life;

people that are careless about their way will lose it.

17Those gracious to the poor lend to the LORD;

he’ll reward them for the good they do.

18Discipline your children while there’s hope

so you won’t ruin their lives.	Prov 19:13-18

19Let angry people suffer the consequences;

bail them out, and you’ll have it to do again.

20Listen to advice and respond to discipline

so you can gain wisdom for later on.

21People make their plans,

but the LORD’s counsel is what prevails.

22Loyalty makes everyone better;

poor people are better at it than liars.

23Respecting the LORD leads to life;

you can sleep in peace without worrying about misfortune.

24Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate,

but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.	 Prov 19:19-24

25Punish scoffers so the simpleminded can learn prudence;

reprove the wise and they’ll be wiser still.

26Children that mistreat their parents

are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.

27If you stop paying attention to discipline, child,

you’ll never learn what you need to know.

28A worthless witness makes mockery of justice;

a sinful mouth eats sin.

29Penalties are designed for scoffers,

and scourging for the backs of fools.	Prov 19:25-29

20:1Wine is a mocker, beer is a brawler;

whoever errs in them is not wise.

2A king’s anger is like a lion’s growl;

stirring it up forfeits your life.

3Staying away from conflict honors you;

any fool can fight.

4Anyone too lazy to plow

will beg for food at harvest time.

5A purpose in your heart is like deep water,

but you can draw it out with thoughtful effort.

6Many claim to be loyal,

but who can find someone that’s actually loyal?	Prov 20:1-6

7How blessed the children are

whose parents carry themselves with integrity.

8A king on a just throne

winnows evil with his eyes.

9Who can say, “I’ve cleansed my heart;

I’m pure from sin”?

10The LORD detests false weights and measures.

11Even kids mark themselves by what they do

if their actions are pure and good.

12The hearing ear and seeing eye—

the LORD made them both.	Prov 20:7-12

13Don’t love sleep too much; you’ll end up poor;

keep your eyes open, and you’ll have enough to eat.

14“It’s no good,” buyers say;

but when the seller’s gone, they brag about the bargain.

15Gold and precious stones abound,

but knowledge has more value.

16Take his cloak who signs for a stranger;

hold him in pledge for foreigners.

17Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet,

but afterward it feels like gravel in your mouth.

18Make plans in consultation with the other players;

wage war with guidance.	Prov 20:13-18

19Gossips tell secrets;

so don’t associate with people that talk too much.

20Curse father and mother,

and your lamp will go out when it gets dark.

21Inheritance gained too early in life

won’t be a blessing in the end.

22Don’t say, “I’ll get even with him”;

wait and let the LORD do it.

23The LORD detests false weights;

dishonest scales don’t please him.

24The LORD orders our steps;

so how can we fully understand our way?	Prov 20:19-24

25You set a trap for yourself by making a rash vow to God

and only thinking about it after you’ve vowed.

26A wise king winnows sinners

and drives the threshing wheel over them.

27The human spirit is the LORD’s lamp;

it searches out the inner self.

28Loyalty and truth keep a king in office;

he holds onto his throne by goodness.

29A young man’s strength is his glory;

an old man’s glory is his gray hair.

30Punishment cleanses evil away;

discipline purifies the heart.	Prov 20:25-30

21:1A king’s heart in the LORD’s hand

is like a stream he can direct where he wants.

2Your own way seems right to you,

but the LORD weighs your heart.

3The LORD wants goodness and justice

more than sacrifice.

4Arrogant eyes and a proud heart

are wicked people’s lamp—and sin.

5Diligent planning gives you an advantage;

getting in a hurry gets you poverty.

6Getting rich by lying is a dissipating vapor

that ends in death.	Prov 21:1-6

7Sinful people’s violence sweeps them away

because they refuse to do what’s right.

8A guilty person’s road is full of curves,

but the conduct of the pure makes a straight path.

9It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop

than inside the house with a contentious woman.

10Evil people desire evil

and don’t show compassion to anyone.

11Punishing scoffers makes them wise;

instructing the wise makes them wiser still.

12Good people watch out for the sinful

and turn them to ruin.	Prov 21:7-12

13If you shut out the cry from the poor,

you’ll cry out yourself and not be heard.

14A secret gift calms anger;

a present turns it away.

15Good people enjoy carrying out justice;

justice distresses sinners.

16If you stray from understanding,

you’ll end up among the dead.

17People that love pleasure become poor;

they who love wine and comfort never get rich.

18Sinners are ransoms for the righteous;

the unfaithful replace the good.	Prov 21:13-18

19It’s better to live in the desert

than with a contentious, “complainy” woman.

20Precious treasure and oil are in the houses of the wise,

but foolish people waste them.

21Pursue goodness and loyalty,

and you’ll arrive at life, goodness, and honor.

22The wise scale the walls of the powerful

and bring down the fortress they trust in.

23Watch your mouth and guard your tongue,

and you’ll stay out of trouble.

24“Scoffers” is the name for proud, haughty people

that conduct themselves with arrogance.	Prov 21:19-24

25Lazy people’s desires end up killing them

because they refuse to work.

26The greedy never get enough

while the godly give liberally.

27God despises sinners’ sacrifices,

especially when they bring them with selfish motives.

28False witnesses perish,

but good listeners testify forever.

29Sinners bluff,

but the godly think before they act.

30No wisdom, insight, or counsel

can prevail against the LORD.

31A horse is trained for battle,

but victory comes from the LORD.	Prov 21:25-31

22:1A good name means more than great wealth;

being blessed is better than having silver and gold.

2The rich and the poor have this in common:

the LORD made them both.

3Prudent people see evil and avoid it;

but the simpleminded rush on ahead and suffer for it.

4Wealth, honor, and life are rewards

for humility and reverence for the LORD.

5Briers and snares lie along the path of perverse people;

those who watch what they’re doing avoid such things.

6Train up children in the way they should go;

and when they’re older, they won’t stray from it.	Prov 22:1-6

7The rich rule the poor;

borrowers become servants to lenders.

8Those who sow sin reap disaster,

and their fury won’t subdue the opposition.

9Generous people will be blessed

because they give some of their food to the poor.

10Get rid of scoffers, and contention leaves too;

conflict and dishonor stop.

11The one that loves a pure heart

and has gracious speech becomes a king’s friend.

12The LORD preserves knowledge

and overthrows what unreliable people say.	Prov 22:7-12

13Lazy people claim, “There’s a lion outside;

I’ll surely get killed in the streets!”

14An immoral woman’s mouth is a deep pit;

the one the LORD curses falls into it.

15Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a kid,

but discipline drives it out.

16Those who oppress the poor to get ahead—

or regale the rich—come to poverty themselves.

Prov 22:13-16

17Listen to the wise

and apply your mind to my instruction;

18it will be pleasant if you retain it

so you’re ready to pass it on.

19I’m teaching you today

so you’ll trust in the LORD.

20Haven’t I written helpful things

about advice and knowledge,

21to make you sure of the truth

so you can report correctly to the one that sent you?

22Don’t rob the poor, who can’t resist,

or try to crush them in court;

23the LORD will argue their case

and sentence to death those who’ve robbed them.	Prov 22:17-23

24Don’t associate with people prone to anger

or go around with hotheaded types;

25you’ll pick up their habits

and entangle yourself in a net.

26Don’t give pledges or sign for debts.

27If you can’t pay,

why let someone take your bed from under you?

28Don’t remove the ancient boundary markers

that your ancestors have set.

29Do you see people skilled at their work?

They’ll serve kings, not just ordinary people.	Prov 22:24-29

23:1When you’re dining with a ruler,

be careful with what he sets in front of you.

2Put a knife to your throat

if you have a big appetite.

3Don’t crave very many of his delicacies;

they may be there to test you.

4Don’t wear yourself out trying to get wealthy;

quit concerning yourself with riches.

5When you stare at wealth, it disappears;

it grows wings like an eagle and flies to the sky.	Prov 23:1-5

6Don’t eat with stingy people

or crave their delicacies;

7what they think to themselves is what they really are:

they may tell you to eat up and drink,

but they don’t mean it!

8You’ll vomit the morsel you’ve eaten

and waste your compliments.

9Don’t speak where fools can hear you;

they’ll despise the wisdom of what you say.

10Don’t move an ancient boundary marker

or trespass in the fields of the fatherless,

11because their Rescuer is powerful;

he’ll sue you in court.

12Apply your heart to instruction

and your ears to knowledge.	Prov 23:6-12

13Don’t withhold discipline from your children;

punishment won’t kill them.

14Use a switch on them

and deliver their souls from Sheol.

15Son, if your heart’s wise, mine will be glad;

16I’ll be happy when you become an honest man.

17Don’t envy sinners;

always live in reverence for the LORD.

18There most certainly is a future;

your hopes won’t be disappointed.

19Listen and be wise;

direct your heart on the right course.	Prov 23:13-19

20Don’t pal around with heavy drinkers or big eaters;

21drunks and gluttons end up poor,

and laziness will dress them in rags.

22Listen to your father;

don’t look down on your mother when she’s old.

23Buy truth and don’t sell it;

get wisdom, instruction, and insight.

24Parents delight in well-behaved children;

mature offspring make them happy.

25Make father happy;

let her enjoy life who gave you birth.	Prov 23:20-25

26Give me your heart, son;

observe my ways.

27A prostitute is a deep pit;

an immoral woman is a narrow well.

28She lurks around like a robber

and makes men unfaithful.	 Prov 23:26-28

29Who has misfortune? Who is sad?

Who has to cope with conflict?

Who complains?

Who is wounded for no reason?

Whose eyes are bloodshot?

30Those who linger long over wine,

who look around for mixed wine.

31Don’t gaze at wine when it’s red,

when it sparkles in the cup,

when it goes down smoothly.

32Afterward it strikes like a serpent;

it bites like a viper.

33You’ll have hallucinations

and say crazy stuff.

34You’re like somebody asleep, bobbing on the ocean

or swaying on the rigging of a ship.

35“They strike me, but it doesn’t hurt;

they beat me, but I don’t feel it.

When I wake up,

I’ll want another drink.”	Prov 23:29-35

24:1Don’t envy bad people

or want to be around them;

2their minds devise violence;

their lips stir up trouble.

3Wisdom builds a house;

intelligence establishes a home;

4knowledge fills its rooms with precious, pleasant wealth.

5The wise are strong;

knowledge increases their strength;

6they wage war with effective strategy;

they win the victory because of their many advisors.

7Wisdom is out of the reach of fools;

they have nothing to say in the city gate.

8People call them schemers who plot misfortune;

9devising foolishness is sin;

scoffing is detestable.	Prov 24:1-9

10If adversity makes you weak,

you’re not very strong to start with.

11Rescue those unjustly sentenced to death;

save those who are staggering to their execution.

12If you try to excuse yourself by claiming ignorance,

won’t he know better than that who weighs your heart?

Doesn’t he know you that keeps your soul?

Won’t he render to you what you deserve?

13Son, eat honey; it’s good;

honeycomb tastes sweet.

14Understand that wisdom is like that to your soul;

if you find it, you’ll have a bright future,

and your hope won’t fade away.	Prov 24:10-14

15Don’t lie in wait at godly people’s house, you wicked;

don’t raid their resting place.

16Good people fall seven times and get up again;

but for sinners, one disaster is more than enough.

17Don’t be glad when your enemies stumble

or celebrate when they fall.

18The LORD won’t be pleased;

he’ll turn his anger away from them.

19Don’t worry about sinners or envy them;

20they have no future; their lamp will flicker out.	Prov 24:15-20

21Son, revere the LORD, respect the king,

and don’t associate with unstable people;

22their disaster will rise up unexpectedly,

and ruin you with them.

23These are sayings of the wise:

Showing partiality in judgment is unjust.

24Anyone that tells sinners they’re good,

people will curse and nations abhor.

25But those who rebuke sinners will receive delight;

blessing will come to them.

26Giving an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.	Prov 24:21-26

27Finish your work in the field first;

then come and build your house.

28Don’t testify against someone for no reason

or deceive by what you say.

29Don’t say, “I’ll do to him what he’s done to me;

I’ll render to him his deeds in return.”

30I went past a lazy person’s field,

past the vineyard of someone without common sense.

31Thistles had taken it over;

nettles covered the ground;

its walls were broken down.

32I thought about what I saw;

I looked and learned:

33“A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to rest.”

34Your poverty will descend on you like a raider;

your need will attack you like an armed robber.	Prov 24:27-34

25:1

More of Solomon’s Proverbs That the Men of Hezekiah,

it’s a king’s responsibility to figure them out.

or put yourself in a place designated for nobles.

7It’s better to be told to come up higher

What you’ve seen

8don’t rush to court over;

what will you do at the end of the trial

if the one you accuse puts you to shame?

don’t betray another person’s confidence;

10people may find out and accuse you of gossiping,

are like golden apples in a silver setting.

12A wise correction to an attentive ear

15Patience can persuade a prince;

a soft tongue can break a bone.

16Have you found honey?

Don’t eat too much of it and make yourself sick.

17Don’t visit your friends too often;

they’ll get tired of you.

18Someone that slanders

is like a club, a sword, a sharp arrow.	Prov 25:11-18

19Depending on undependable people in hard times

is like chewing with a broken tooth

or walking on a sprained ankle.

20Singing to a heavy heart

is like removing your coat on a cold day

or pouring vinegar on lye.

21If your enemies are hungry, feed them;

if they’re thirsty, give them a drink;

22you’ll be dumping hot coals on their head,

and the LORD will reward you.	Prov 25:19-22

23A north wind brings rain;

a back-biting tongue brings angry looks.

24It’s better to live in the corner of a housetop

than inside a house with a contentious woman.

25Good news from a distant land

is like cool water to a weary soul.

26Good people that cave in to sinful people

are like trampled springs and polluted wells.

27Don’t eat too much honey;

don’t seek your own honor.

28Someone that’s out of control

is like an unwalled city; it’s open to attack.	Prov 25:23-28

26:1Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,

honor is out of place on a fool.

2Like a flitting sparrow, like a fluttering swallow,

an undeserved curse doesn’t land on its intended victim.

3A whip is for a horse,

a bridle is for a donkey,

a rod is for the back of a fool.

4Don’t answer fools’ arguments;

you’ll dignify them with a response.

5Answer fools’ arguments;

otherwise, they’ll think they’ve won.

6Trusting a fool to deliver a message

is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison. 	Prov 26:1-6

7A proverb in the mouth of a fool

is like legs hanging from the lame.

8Honoring a fool

is as dangerous as putting a stone in a sling.

9A proverb in the mouth of a fool

is like a thorn in the hand of a drunk.

10Whoever hires a fool or passerby

is like an archer that shoots at random.

11A fool that repeats his folly

is like a dog that returns to its vomit.

12There’s more hope for fools

than for people that think they’re smart.	Prov 26:7-12

13Lazy people claim there’s a lion in the road!

There’s surely a lion in the public square!

14Like a door swinging on its hinges,

lazy people turn on their beds.

15Lazy people stick their fingers in the plate

but they don’t even bring the food to their mouth.

16Lazy people think they’re smarter

than seven wise advisors.

17A passerby that meddles in other people’s conflict

is like someone taking a dog by the ears.	Prov 26:13-17

18-19Someone that lies

and says, “Just kidding,”

is as dangerous as a maniac

that’s shooting flaming arrows.

20For lack of wood a fire goes out;

where there’s no gossip, quarreling dies down.

21Contentious people spark conflict

like charcoal on hot embers or wood on fire.

22Rumors are like delicious morsels;

they work their way down deep inside you!

23Warm lips and a base heart

are like silver glaze on a clay pot.	Prov 26:18-23

24People disguise disdain with words

while storing up deceit in their heart;

25don’t trust them when they pretend to be kind to you,

because they have seven evils in their minds;

26though they coat their disdain with lies,

it’ll eventually come out for all to see.

27You dig a pit for others, only to fall in it yourself;

you roll a boulder uphill only to have it roll back and crush you.

28A lying tongue despises its victims;

a flattering mouth brings ruin.	Prov 26:24-28

27:1Don’t brag about tomorrow;

you don’t know what’s going to happen.

2Let somebody else praise you, not your own mouth;

a stranger, not your own lips.

3A rock is heavy and sand weighs a lot,

but a fool’s resentment outweighs either one.

4Anger and wrath are bad enough,

but jealousy is even worse.

5Open rebuke is better than secret love.

6A friend’s wounds may be sincere,

but an enemy’s kisses deceive.	Prov 27:1-6

7A person that’s full hates honey;

one that’s famished thinks bitter tastes sweet.

8If you wander away from home,

you’re like a bird that wanders off from its nest.

9Oil and perfume make you feel good,

and a friend’s advice is sweet.

10Don’t abandon a friend, yours or your father’s;

that way, if misfortune comes,

you won’t have to impose on your brother’s house;

a near neighbor is better than a distant brother.

11Be wise and make me happy, child,

so I can answer critics that try to disgrace me.

12The prudent foresee danger and take precautions;

the simpleminded plunge ahead and pay the price.	Prov 27:7-12

13Get security from someone that guarantees a foreigner’s debt;

get a deposit for a promiscuous woman.

14Loudly blessing a friend in the morning

will be taken as an enemy’s curse.

15A contentious wife is like a steady rain;

16whoever tries to restrain her

may as well try to restrain the wind

or hold onto something with an oily hand.	Prov 27:13-16

17Like iron sharpens iron,

one person sharpens another.

18If you tend a fig tree, you'll eat its fruit;

if you aid your master’s interests, you’ll be rewarded.

19As water reflects a face,

the heart reflects the real person.

20Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;

neither are people’s wants.

21A crucible is for silver, and a furnace is for gold;

a person is put to the test by flattery.

22Though you grind fools in a mortar

with a pestle like crushed grain,

you won’t separate them from their foolishness.	Prov 27:17-22

23Keep tabs on the condition of your flocks;

pay close attention to your herds,

24because wealth doesn’t last forever,

and a crown isn’t permanent.

25When the hay’s all in

and new growth starts to appear

and the grass on the hillsides is in the barn,

26lambs will provide wool for your clothes,

and your goats will be worth enough to buy a field;

27you’ll have enough goats’ milk for yourself,

your family, and your servant girls.	Prov 27:23-27

28:1Sinners run when no one’s chasing,

but the good are as bold as lions.

2When a country sins, lots of leaders vie for control;

but wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability.

3The poor that oppress the poor

are like a driving rain that destroys crops.

4Those who leave the Law commend the sinful,

but those who keep it contend with them.

5Bad people don’t understand justice,

those who look to the LORD understand it.

6Being poor and honest

is better than being rich and dishonest.	Prov 28:1-6

7Young people that keep the Law are wise offspring,

but companions of gluttons humiliate their parents.

8Whoever increases wealth by charging high interest,

gathers it for the one that’s kind to the poor.

9When people quit listening to the Law,

even their prayers become offensive.

10They who mislead the godly

fall into their own pit,

but the honest inherit good things.

11The rich may think they’re smart,

but poor people with insight can see through them.

12When the godly triumph, everybody’s glad;

but when the sinful take over, people leave. 		Prov 28:7-12

13Concealing your sins won’t make you prosper,

but confessing and abandoning them will foster mercy.

14How blessed they are who fear doing wrong,

but those who harden their hearts are headed for trouble.

15An evil ruler is as dangerous to poor people

as a roaring lion or a charging bear.

16A leader that oppresses isn’t using good judgment;

anyone that hates unjust gain prolongs life.

17Corrupt leaders, loaded down with the guilt of human blood,

will be fugitives till death; nobody will take their side.

18People that live with integrity will be rescued,

but those who are perverse will suddenly fall.	Prov 28:13-18

19The man that plows his ground will have plenty to eat,

but one that follows fantasies will be poor in the midst of plenty.

20Reliable people receive many blessings,

but those who want to get rich quick get into trouble.

21Showing partiality is never good;

yet some would sin to get a piece of bread.

22A miser hurries to get rich

and doesn’t realize that want will overtake him.

23Someone that rebukes finds more approval

than someone that flatters.

24People that steal from their parents,

and claim it’s not sin,

are no better than murderers.	Prov 28:19-24

25Arrogant people stir up conflict,

but those who trust in the LORD prosper.

26People are foolish to trust in themselves;

it’s the ones that live wisely that stay safe.

27If you give to the poor, you’ll never be poor;

but if you close your eyes to poverty, you’ll be cursed.

28When corrupt leaders rise to power, people go into hiding;

when they meet disaster, the godly flourish. 	Prov 28:25-28

29:1If you stiffen your neck after repeated correction,

you’ll suddenly be broken beyond recovery.

2When good people rule, people are happy;

when corrupt leaders take over, the citizens groan.

3A son that loves wisdom makes his father happy,

but one that visits prostitutes squanders his wealth.

4A good king creates a stable country,

but one that accepts bribes ruins it.

5Flattering your friends

spreads a net for them to step in.

6Bad people’s sins become their downfall,

but the righteous can sing and celebrate.	Prov 29:1-6

7The godly care about the rights of the poor;

sinful people don’t care about such things.

8Scoffers can set a city in an uproar,

but the wise defuse anger.

9When the wise argue with the foolish,

the foolish get mad or mock; there’s no quiet response.

10Bloodthirsty people hate anybody that’s blameless,

but the godly are concerned about other people’s lives.

11Fools lose their temper;

the wise keep it in check.

12If a ruler is willing to listen to lies,

his advisors become corrupt.	Prov 29:7-12

13The poor and the oppressor have this in common:

the LORD makes both of them able to see.

14If a king judges the poor fairly,

his throne will be permanently secure.

15Discipline gives children wisdom,

but kids that get their way are an embarrassment to their mother.

16When corrupt leaders get control, sin multiplies;

but the godly will see them fall.

17Correct your children,

and they’ll bring you comfort and delight.

18Where there’s no revelation, people cast off restraint;

but those who keep the Law stay happy.	Prov 29:13-18

19Words alone won’t correct a slave;

though he understands, he won’t respond.

20There’s more hope for a fool

than for someone that’s rash with words

21A slave pampered from childhood

will turn out to be a rebel.

22Angry people stir up conflict;

hotheads commit a lot of sins.

23Pride brings humiliation;

humility lifts up to places of honor.

24Helping a thief puts you in jeopardy:

you’ve taken an oath against perjury,

but you can’t tell the truth in court.	Prov 29:19-24

25Fearing other people entraps you;

trusting the LORD makes you secure.

26People look to rulers for approval,

but justice comes from the LORD.

27The wicked despise the righteous,

and the righteous despise them back.	Prov 29:25-27

30:1The Words of Agur Son of Jakeh, an Oracle

Agur says to Ithiel and Ucal:

2Surely I’m too stupid to be human;

I don’t have common sense.

3I haven’t mastered wisdom;

I don’t know the Holy One.

4Who but God goes up to the sky and back down

or grasps the wind in his fist?

Who wraps up the ocean in his cloak

or sets the boundaries of land?

What’s his name? What’s his son’s name?

Tell me if you know!	Prov 30:1-4

5Every message from God proves true;

he’s a shield for those who take refuge in him.

6Don’t add to what he says;

otherwise, he’ll reprove you

and expose you as a liar.

7I ask you for two things before I die:

8first, keep me from being deceived*;

second, don’t give me poverty or wealth;

just give me what I need;

9so, on the one hand, I won’t be full and deny you, saying,

“Who needs the LORD?”

or, on the other hand, lack what I need and steal to get it,

and so profane the name of my God.

10Don’t slander a slave to his master,

or he’ll curse you and you’ll pay for it.	Prov 30:5-10

11Some curse their father

and don’t bless their mother.

12Some consider themselves pure,

but they’re unwashed and filthy.

13Some—how lofty their eyes!

how high their brows!—

14some have teeth like swords

and fangs like knives;

they devour the poor and needy. 				Prov 30:11-14

15A leech has two daughters

that cry, “More, give me more.”

Three things are never satisfied,

no, make that four that never say, “That’s enough”:

16Sheol,

a barren womb,

desert ground,

and a blazing fire	Prov 30:15-16

17The eye that mocks father or scorns mother

the ravens in the valley will pluck out,

the vultures will eat.

18Three things are too amazing for me,

no, make that four I don’t understand:

19how an eagle flies in the sky,

how a snake slithers on a ledge,

how a ship moves on the ocean,

and how a man is drawn to a maiden.

20An adulterous woman “consumes” a man,

“wipes her mouth,” and says,

“I haven’t done anything wrong.”			Prov 30:17-20

21Under three things the ground trembles,

no, make that four, it can’t endure:

22a slave that becomes king,

a well-fed fool,

23an unloved woman that gets a husband,

and a maid that replaces her mistress.

24Four things are small but especially wise:

25ants aren’t strong,

but they store up their food in the summer;

26rock badgers aren’t powerful,

but they make their homes in the rocks;

27locusts don’t have a king,

but they march out in ranks;

28lizards are easy to catch with your hands,

yet they’re in kings’ palaces.	Prov 30:21-28

29Three things are stately in their stride,

no, four that walk with majestic bearing:

30a lion, powerful and unafraid among the animals;

31a strutting rooster,

a billy goat,

and a king leading his army.

32If you’ve been foolish by acting proud

or putting other people down,

cover your mouth in shame.

33As churning cream makes butter

and punching a nose makes it bleed,

so stirring up anger causes quarrels.	Prov 30:29-33

31;1The Words of King Lemuel

The Oracle His Mother Taught Him

2Please listen, son,

son of my womb, son of my vows;

3don’t waste your strength

on the kind of women that destroy kings.

4Lemuel, it’s not for kings to guzzle wine

or for rulers to get addicted to alcohol;

5the fear is that they’ll forget the Law

and not give justice to the oppressed.

6Give alcohol to the dying

and wine to those in pain;

7let them drink and forget their condition,

and not remember their suffering anymore.

8Speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves;

9judge justly and defend the poor and needy.		Prov 31:1-9

Tribute to a Worthy Woman

10Who can find a capable wife of noble character?

She’s worth more than jewels.

11Her husband can rely on her,

and he’ll not lack anything of value.

12She’ll do him good her whole life.

13She looks for wool and linen,

and enjoys working with her hands.

14Like a merchant ship,

she brings her food from a distance.

15She gets up before daylight to feed her family

and assign the day’s jobs to her maids.

16She inspects a field and buys it,

and plants a vineyard from her earnings.	Prov 31:10-16

17She wraps her waist with strength

and makes her arms strong.

18She makes sure her efforts are profitable,

and her lamp doesn’t go out at night.

19She reaches for the distaff,

and her hands hold the spindle.

20She reaches out to the poor and needy.

21She’s not worried when it snows

because she has dressed her family in scarlet.

22She wears purple and fine linen

and makes her own bedclothes.				Prov 31:17-22

23The community knows her husband in the city gates,

where he sits among the leaders of the land.

24She makes sashes and linen garments

to sell to the merchants.

25She dresses in strength and dignity

and smiles at the future.

26She speaks wisely and teaches kindly.

27She takes care of her household

and doesn’t idle away her time.

28Her children grow up and bless her;

her husband, too, and praises her:

29“Lots of women do nobly,

but you excel them all.”

30Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,

but praise a woman that respects the LORD.

31Reward her for what she does,

and let her work speak for her in the community.	Prov 31:23-31

ECCLESIASTES

1:1The Words of the Preacher, Son of David, King in Jerusalem

2“Completely pointless,” the Preacher says;

“Completely pointless! It’s all pointless.”

3What do people get out of their work under the sun?

4One generation passes away and another comes along,

but the earth just goes on and on.

5The sun comes up, the sun goes down,

and hurries back to where it comes up again.

6The wind blows south, the wind blows north;

it just keeps circulating around and around.	Eccl 1:1-6

7The rivers flow to the ocean; yet the ocean doesn’t run over;

they flow again to where they flowed before.

8Everything is too tiresome to talk about;

eyes aren’t satisfied by seeing;

ears aren’t fulfilled by hearing.

9What has been is what will be;

what’s been done is what’ll be done;

there’s nothing new under the sun.

10Is there anything you can say,

“Look, that’s new”?

11People don’t remember the past;

later, they won’t remember the future either.

The ones that come after you won’t remember you.	Eccl 1:7-11

12I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13I decided to examine with wisdom everything people do under the sky. It’s a grievous job God has stricken them with. 14I’ve looked at everything they do under the sun. It’s all pointless, like chasing the wind.

15What’s crooked you can’t straighten;

what’s missing you can’t get back.

16I said to myself,

“I’m wiser than anybody that’s ruled Jerusalem before;

I’ve gained a wealth of knowledge.”

17I determined to experience everything from wisdom to madness and pointless behavior. I came to realize that it’s all like chasing the wind.

18There’s much grief in much wisdom;

increasing knowledge increases pain.	     Eccl 1:12-18

2:1I said to myself, “Try pleasure; enjoy yourself.” That turned out to have no purpose either. 2Laughing’s silly and pleasure’s pointless. 3I cast about in my mind how to cheer myself up with wine and embrace foolishness while thinking wisely.

I tried to find out what’s worth doing under the sky during the few years we’re alive. 4I undertook big projects:

I built houses for myself;

I planted vineyards for myself;

5I made gardens and parks for myself,

planted all kinds of fruit trees in them,

6and built ponds to irrigate the trees;

7I bought male and female slaves and had home-born slaves;

I owned bigger flocks and herds than anyone before me in Jerusalem;

8I collected silver and gold and the treasure from kings and provinces;

I provided for myself male and female singers and lots of concubines—men’s pleasure.

9So I became great and surpassed everybody before me in Jerusalem, as my wisdom stayed with me. 10I took whatever I saw that I wanted. I didn’t deprive myself of any pleasure because I was pleased with my work and pleasure was my reward for it. 11Then I looked at what I’d done and the effort I’d put into doing it. It was pointless, like chasing the wind. I hadn’t gained anything under the sun.			     Eccl 2:1-11

12So I compared wisdom to madness and fun; who can have more of that than a king? 13I saw that wisdom excels fun as much as light excels darkness. 14The wise can see where they’re going, but the foolish walk around in the dark; yet both share the same fate. 15I said, “The fate of a fool will come to me too; so what’s the point of being wise?” 16There’s no more lasting memory of the wise than of the foolish. Later on, everybody will fade from memory. The wise and the foolish both die! 17So I despised life because my work under the sun brought me grief. Everything’s pointless, like chasing the wind.           	    Eccl 2:12-17

18So I despised everything I’d worked for under the sun because I’ll have to leave it to other people. 19Who knows if they’ll be wise or foolish? Yet they’ll control everything I worked for in wisdom under the sun. It’s pointless. 20So I let myself despair over everything I worked for under the sun. 21After people labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, they have to leave it to somebody that didn’t work for it. It’s pointless, a great misfortune. 22What do people get out of their hard work and striving under the sun? 23Their whole life is painful and grievous. Even at night their mind doesn’t rest. It’s all so pointless.

24There’s nothing better than to eat and drink and get satisfaction out of your work. I’ve seen even that comes from God; 25apart from him, who can eat and enjoy anything? 26He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to the ones he considers good. He gives sinners the job of accumulating wealth to give to the ones he considers good. That’s pointless too, like chasing the wind.				    Eccl 2:18-26

3:1There’s a time for everything under the sky:

2a time to be born and a time to die;

a time to plant and a time to uproot what’s planted;

3a time to kill and a time to heal;

a time to build and a time to tear down;

4a time to laugh and a time to cry;

a time to dance and a time to mourn;

5a time to gather stones and a time to throw them away;

a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;

6a time to search and a time to quit searching;

a time to keep and a time to throw away;

7a time to rip apart and a time to sew together;

a time to speak and a time to be quiet;

8a time to love and a time not to love;

a time for peace and a time for war.

9What do workers get out of work? 10I’ve seen the job God has given people to occupy themselves. 11He’s set an appropriate time for everything and planted eternity in their hearts, but in a way that they can’t see his work beginning to end.	   Eccl 3:1-11

12I realize there’s nothing better for people than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. 13There’s nothing better than eating and drinking and taking pleasure in their work—that’s God’s gift. 14Everything God does is final. There’s nothing to add or take away, because he has worked in such a way that people should respect him. 15What will be has already been, because God does again what he’s done before.

16Besides, I’ve seen that in place of justice and goodness there’s wickedness under the sun. 17I said to myself,

“God will judge the good and the bad because he’s appointed a time for everything. 18He tests them so they can see they’re no better than animals.”

19People and animals have the same fate: one dies like the other; they both have to breathe. People don’t have any advantage. 20They both came from dust, and they’ll go back to it. 21Who knows if a person’s spirit goes up and an animal’s spirit goes down into the ground? 22I’ve seen that there’s nothing better for people than to be happy in what they do; that’s their lot. Who can make them see what’ll happen when they’re gone?  	   Eccl 3:12-22

4:1Then I looked at the oppression that’s under the sun and saw the tears of the oppressed that have no comforters because their oppressors have the power. 2So I decided the dead are better off than the living, 3and the ones that never existed are better off yet.

4I saw that competition between people drives work and achievement. That's pointless too, like chasing the wind. 5Fools fold their hands, so their bodies atrophy. 6One handful with quietness is better than two with toil—and chasing the wind.

7I saw something else that’s pointless under the sun: 8people with nobody that needs them—offspring or sibling, yet they work as hard as they can to get wealth, but to no end because wealth doesn’t satisfy them: “Who am I working for? Who am I depriving myself of enjoyment for?” It’s all meaningless and depressing.	             Eccl 4:1-8

9Two are better than one because they can get more done. 10If either falls, the other can help; misfortune awaits whoever doesn’t have anybody that can help. 11Besides, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; how can one keep warm alone? 12A bully can overpower someone that’s alone, but two can resist. A cord with three strands doesn’t break easily.

13A poor, wise youth is better off than a foolish old king who doesn’t know how to accept instruction anymore. 14A youth can come out of prison to become king, though he was born in poverty. 15But I’ve seen people throng to the next young man to replace him, 16and there’s no end to his successors. But people won’t be happy with those successors either. That whole scenario is pointless, too, like chasing the wind.            	            Eccl 4:9-16

5:1When you go to God’s Temple, go there to listen rather than offer mindless sacrifice and not realize you’re sinning. 2Don’t think impulsively or speak rashly in God’s presence. He’s in heaven, you’re on earth; so don’t say too much. 3Working too much fosters false dreams, and talking too much makes you a fool. 4When you make a vow to God, don’t delay paying it. He doesn’t delight in fools; pay what you vow. 5It’d be better not to vow than not to pay it. 6Don’t sin in what you say; don’t say in God’s presence that you misspoke. Why have him angry with what you say and destroy your work? 7When daydreams grow and words multiply, emptiness comes. Respect God, instead.     		   Eccl 5:1-7

8Don’t be shocked if you see the poor oppressed and justice denied in the realm. One official oversees another official, higher officials oversee them, 9and the king that cultivates the land to his own advantage.

10People that love money aren’t satisfied with money; those who love wealth aren’t satisfied with wealth. That’s pointless too. 11The more you make, the more people there are that want to get you to spend it. So what’s the advantage of being an owner except to have something to look at? 12Working people’s sleep is pleasant, whether they eat a little or a lot. But the full stomach of the rich doesn’t let them sleep.	 Eccl 5:8-12

13There’s a grievous problem I’ve seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the hoarder’s hurt. 14When he lost that wealth in a bad venture and had fathered a son, he couldn’t support him. 15He came naked from his mother’s womb; he’ll go like he came. He won’t take anything with him from his labor. 16That’s a grievous thing: people die like they’re born; so what do they get out of working for the wind? 17Their whole life they eat in the dark, oppressed, sick, and angry.

18I’ve seen something that’s fitting and good: to eat, drink, and enjoy your work under the sun for the few years God gives you; that’s your reward. 19It’s also God’s gift to all he’s given wealth. He’s enabled them to eat from it, receive their reward, and enjoy what they do. 20They won’t dwell on how long they’re going to live, because God keeps them occupied with happiness.		  		  Eccl 5:13-20

6:1There’s a common tragedy I’ve seen under the sun: 2people that God has given wealth and honor so they have everything they could want, but he hasn’t given them a chance to enjoy them; a foreigner is enjoying them. That’s a pointless tragedy. 3If a man fathers 100 children and lives for however many years, but isn’t satisfied with good things and doesn’t even get a proper burial, then I say,

“A miscarriage is better off 4because it would have come in pointless and gone out in the dark. 5A miscarriage never sees the sun or knows anything. 6Even if someone lives 1,000 years twice and isn’t content, what’s the point? Everybody ends up in the same place.”

7All our labor is for our mouth; yet our appetite isn’t satisfied. 8What advantage do the wise have over the foolish? What advantage do the poor have that know how to conduct themselves with other people? 9What the eyes see is better than what the soul wants. That’s pointless too, like chasing the wind.	Eccl 6:1-9

10God has already decided what’s going to happen, including what each of us will be. We can’t argue with him about it; he’s stronger than we are. 11The more we say the less it means; so what’s the point of talking? 12Who knows what’s good for us anyway during the few years of our pointless life? They’ll go by like a shadow, and who can tell us what will happen under the sun when they’re done?  	 Eccl 6:10-12

7:1A good reputation is better than expensive ointment;

the day you die is better than the day you’re born.

2It’s better to go to a house of mourning

than to a house of feasting;

because that’s the end of everyone,

and the living should take it to heart.

3Sorrow is better than laughter in this respect:

when the face is sad, the heart can be happy.

4The heart of the wise remembers there’s mourning,

but the heart of a fool just thinks about having fun.

5It’s better to listen to a rebuke from the wise

than be regaled by the songs of a fool.

6A fool’s laughter doesn’t last long;

it’s like thorns crackling under a heating pot:

it’s pointless.	Eccl 7:1-6

7Oppression can turn the wise into fools;

bribes corrupt their heart.

8Finishing is better than starting;

patience is better than pride.

9Don’t get mad quick,

because anger thrives in the chest of fools.

10Don’t say, “Why were the old days better than now?”

You don’t ask that because you’re wise.

11Wisdom plus inheritance is good;

it’s an advantage to those who see the sun.

12Protecting knowledge is like protecting money,

but only knowledge can save your life.			Eccl 7:7-12

13Think about what God does;

who can straighten out what he bends?

14Be happy in prosperous times,

but in hard times think about this:

God has made the one as well as the other;

so you can’t be sure what will happen when you’re gone.

15I’ve seen all kinds of things in my pointless life,

including good people that die young and bad people that die old.

16Don’t overestimate your “goodness” or “wisdom.”

Why ruin what you really are?

17Don’t be excessively bad or foolish.

Why die early? 18Avoid extremes.

A humble person that respects God

ends up with both wise goodness and long life.

19One wise person is stronger than ten rulers in a city.

20Nobody’s always good; 21so don’t take too seriously everything you hear; you may hear your servant cursing you, 22and you know how often you’ve cursed people.  	   Eccl 7:13-22

23I determined I’d be wise about everything, but I couldn’t do it. 24No one can figure out what’s distant and deep. 25I set my mind to knowing, investigating, looking for wisdom and explanation, to identifying sinfulness, foolishness, and folly. 26I discovered more bitter than death is a woman whose heart is a snare, whose hands are chains.

27“Here’s something I’ve discovered,” the Preacher says, “combining one thing with another to reach a conclusion, 28something I’m still looking for and haven’t found. I’ve found a man among a thousand, but I haven’t found a woman among them. 29I’ve found only this: God made people godly, but they’ve sought out their own ways.” 	    Eccl 7:23-29

8:1Who is wise enough to figure out what things mean? Wisdom puts a glow on the face and changes a harsh countenance to a radiant one.

2My advice to you is to keep the king’s command that you’ve sworn before God to do. 3Don’t try to avoid your duty or put it off because it’s unpleasant. The king can do what he pleases 4because his word is final and you’re in no position to question it. 5The one that obeys his command won’t come to harm because the wise know how to do it and when. 6There’s a right time and proper way to do everything even in times of trouble. 7How can anybody avoid what nobody knows is going to happen? 8None of us can keep our spirit from leaving or prevent our death from coming. There’s no getting out of a war, and sin won’t let people off that practice it. 9I’ve seen all that and thought about what all people do under the sun to lord it over one another.		        	 Eccl 8:1-9

10Then I saw the sinful buried who use to frequent the Holy Place. They were soon forgotten in the city where they did it. It’s pointless. 11The sentence against a sin doesn’t always come right away. That’s why people think they can get away with it. 12Though a sinner sins 100 times and keeps living, I still know it’ll be well with those who respect God openly. 13but it won’t be well for those sinners; they won’t lengthen their days like a shadow because they don’t respect God.

14Something else happens that’s pointless too: good people treated like they’re bad, and bad people treated like they’re good. 15So I recommend enjoying life, because there’s nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy life.

16When I applied my mind to knowing wisdom and seeing what happens in the world (even if a person never slept), 17I looked at everything God does and concluded that no one can figure out what’s going on under the sun no matter how hard they try. Though the wisest may claim to understand it, they haven’t figured it out. 	  Eccl 8:10-17

9:1I’ve concluded that good, wise people and what they do are in God’s hands, but they don’t know if love or hate lies around the corner. 2It’s the same for everyone. The good and the bad share the same fate whether they’re ceremonially clean or not, whether they offer sacrifices or not. Good people are treated like sinners; people that take oaths are treated like ones that are afraid to. 3It doesn’t seem right that there’s one destiny for everybody. Their hearts are perverse; their minds harbor insanity their whole life; afterward they go to the dead. 4Where there’s life there’s hope; it's better to be a live dog than a dead lion. 5The living do know they’ll die; the dead don’t know anything. They don’t have any future because they’re forgotten. 6Their love, their hate, their zeal perish with them; they won’t play a part in anything under the sun.  Eccl 9:1-6

7So enjoy your bread and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, because God approves of it. 8Wear good clothes and use plenty of oil on your head. 9Enjoy life with the wife you love all the fleeting days God gives you. That’s the reward in life for your toil under the sun. 10Whatever your hand finds to do, do it diligently; there’s no activity or planning or wisdom in Sheol where you’re going.

11Again, I saw that under the sun the swift don’t necessarily win the race, soldiers don’t win the battle, the wise don’t get the bread, the discerning aren’t wealthy, the capable don’t gain approval; time and chance interfere with everything. 12Besides, people don’t know what’s going to happen to them; they’re like fish in a seine or birds in a snare: they unexpectedly get caught by misfortune.

13I’ve also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me. 14There was a small city where few people lived. A powerful king came, surrounded it, and built big siege works against it. 15But a poor man in the city delivered it by his wisdom; yet nobody remembered that poor wise man. 	Eccl 9:7-15

16So I said, “Wisdom is better than power.”

People often look down on poor people’s wisdom

and ignore what they say.

17The words of the wise heard in quietness

are better than the shouts of a ruler among fools.

18Wisdom is better than weapons,

but one sinner can destroy lots of good. 	Eccl 9:16-18

10:1Dead flies even make perfume stink;

likewise, a little foolishness can spoil wisdom and honor.

2A foolish heart pulls to the left;

a wise one pulls to the right.

3You can recognize fools

just by the way they walk.

4If a ruler’s anger flares at you, don’t react,

because composure smooths over big offenses.	Eccl 10:1-4

5There’s a problem I’ve seen under the sun, an error that originates in rulers 6who appoint foolish people to high positions while putting successful people in lower ones. 7I’ve seen slaves ride horses beside princes that walk on the ground like slaves.

8If you dig a pit, you may fall in it;

if you break through a wall, you may get bit by a snake.

9If you quarry stones, you may be injured by them;

if you split logs, you may hurt yourself doing it.

10If you don’t sharpen your axe,

you have to work harder;

wisdom aids success.	Eccl 10:5-10

11If a snake bites before it’s charmed,

the charmer hasn’t accomplished anything.

12Words from the wise are gracious;

the thoughts of fools destroy them.

13They begin with foolish talk,

and foolish talk leads to foolish deeds;

14but fools just keep talking.

Nobody knows what’s going to happen;

who can tell people what will come after them?

15Fools’ toil wears them out so much

they can’t find their way home.

16Misfortune awaits the land whose king is a kid,

whose princes feast in the morning.

17You’re a fortunate land if its king is noble

and its princes eat at normal times—

for energy, not for gluttony. 				Eccl 10:11-17

18Through laziness, rafters sag;

through idleness, the roof leaks.

19People fix a meal for enjoyment;

wine makes life happy;

money solves everything;

20Don’t curse the king in your bedroom

or the rich where you sleep.

A bird in the sky may hear what you say

and spread it around.	Eccl 10:18-20

11:1Toss your bread on the water;

it’ll come back around a long time later.

2Diversify your investments seven or eight ways;

you don’t know what risks lie ahead.

3Heavy clouds drop rain;

a tree stays where it falls.

4If you keep worrying about the weather, you won’t sow;

if you keep watching the clouds, you won’t reap.

5Just like you don’t know where the wind will blow

or how bones form in a womb,

you don’t understand what God’s doing

who makes everything happen.

6Plant your seed in the morning;

don’t be idle in the afternoon;

you don’t know if planting in the morning

or afternoon is best,

or if one’s as good as the other.	Eccl 11:1-6

7Light is pleasing;

sunrise is pleasant to behold.

8If you live a long time, enjoy all your years;

just remember, there’ll be lots of dark days,

and nothing will seem important in the end.

9Young people, enjoy life while you’re young;

stay pleasant.

Go ahead and follow your impulses and desires;

just remember, God will judge you for all of them.

10So don’t worry; take care of your health,

because childhood and the prime of life soon pass. 	Eccl 11:7-10

12:1Remember your Creator when you’re young,

before the difficult days come,

before the years close in and you say,

“I don’t enjoy them anymore”;

2before the sun, moon, and stars grow faint

and clouds remain after rain;

3when the watchmen [arms and hands?] of the house [body] are palsied

and strong men [shoulders?] hunch over;

when grinders [teeth?] stand idle because they’re few

and those looking out of windows [eyes?] can’t see much;

4when the doors to the street [lips?] are shut

and the sound of grinding [chewing?] is muffled,

when you arise at the time of a bird’s chirping

and young women sing faintly; 			Eccl 12:1-4

5when you’re afraid of falling*

and scared to walk around;

when your hair turns white like almond-tree blossoms

and the grasshopper drags itself along;

when your appetite’s gone*

and you go to your eternal home

while wailers walk the streets;

6before the silver cord snaps,

the golden bowl breaks,

the pitcher by the well shatters,

the pulley at the cistern doesn’t work anymore;

7when the dust returns to the earth where it was

and the spirit returns to the God who gave it.

8“Completely pointless,” the Preacher says; “it’s all pointless.”

Eccl 12:5-8

9Besides being a wise man, the Preacher taught the people. He weighed, studied, and classified lots of proverbs. 10He endeavored to write true things and searched for expressive words.

11The words of the wise are like goads. Collections of them are like nails tightly driven; they come from one Shepherd. 12My child, beware of anything more: there’s no end to writing books, and too much study wears you out.

13You’ve heard every view. Here’s the conclusion: respect God and do his will; that’s your role. 14God will judge every act, everything secret, good or bad.   	  Eccl 12:9-13

5“I’m black, but beautiful, young women of Jerusalem,

like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

6Don’t stare at me because I’m dark,

because the sun has darkened my skin.

My mother’s sons were mad at me;

they made me take care of vineyards,

I’ve neglected my own vineyard.

7You that I love, tell me

where you pasture your flock,

where you have them lie down at noon.”

Groom

8“If you don’t know, most beautiful woman,

follow the flock’s tracks,

and pasture your young goats by the shepherds’ tents.

S of S 1:5-8

9“My darling, to me you’re like my mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.

10Your cheeks are lovely with earrings,

and your neck pretty with strings of beads.”

Friends

11“We’ll make you gold earrings with silver beads.”

Bride

12“While the king was on his couch,

my perfume floated out its scent.

13My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh

that lies all night between my breasts.

14My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms

in the vineyards of En-gedi.”	S of S 1:9-14

Groom

15“My darling, you’re so beautiful!

You’re so lovely!

Your eyes are like doves.”

Bride

16“How handsome you are, my beloved, and so pleasant!

Our couch is luxurious!

17The beams in our houses are cedar;

our rafters are fir.”	S of S 1:15-17

2:1“I’m a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley.”

Groom

2“My darling among young women is

like a lily among thorns.”

Bride

3“My beloved among young men is

like an apricot tree in the forest.

I took great delight in its shade and sat down,

and its fruit tasted sweet.

4He has taken me to his banquet hall,

and love is his banner above me.

5Sustain me with raisin cakes,

refresh me with apples, because I’m lovesick.

6Let his left hand be under my head,

and his right hand embrace me.”	S of S 2:1-6

Groom

7“I want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem,

by the gazelles or hinds in the field,

that you won’t wake up my love till she’s ready.”

Bride

8“Listen! My beloved! Look, he’s coming,

jumping across the mountains, leaping over the hills!

9My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.

It’s standing behind our wall;

looking in the windows;

staring through the lattice.	S of S 2:7-9

10“My beloved answered me,

‘Get up, my darling, my beautiful one,

and come along.

11Winter’s over; the rains have come and gone.

12Flowers are coming out;

it’s time to sing;

we can hear the turtledove.

13Fig trees have ripened their figs;

vines in blossom are giving off their scent.

Get up, my darling, my beautiful one,

and come along with me!

14My dove, in the cleft of the rock,

in the secret place by the steep path,

let me see you; let me hear you;

because your singing is sweet,

your looks are lovely.’	S of S 2:10-14

15“Catch the foxes for us,

the little foxes that are ruining the vineyards

that are in bloom.

16My beloved’s mine, and I’m his;

he pastures his flock among the lilies.

17Till the evening breeze comes and shadows recede,

turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle

or a young stag on the mountains.”	S of S 2:15-17

Bride

3:1“In bed night after night I sought the one I love;

I looked for him but didn’t find him.

2‘I need to get up and look around the city;

in the streets and squares

I have to find the one I love.’

I looked for him, but I didn’t find him.

3The watchmen that make their rounds in the city met me; I said,

‘Have you seen the one I love?’

4I had just left them when I found him.

I held onto him and wouldn’t let him go,

till I’d brought him to my mother’s house,

to the room where she conceived me.”	S of S 3:1-4

Groom

5“I want you to swear, young women of Jerusalem,

by the gazelles or hinds in the field,

that you won’t wake up my love till she’s ready.”

Friends

6“What’s this coming up from the countryside

like columns of smoke,

perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,

with all the merchant’s scented powders?

7It’s Solomon’s portable couch,

with 60 of Israel’s strong men around it.

8All of them are swordsmen, expert in war;

each with his sword at his side,

guarding against the dangers at night.

9King Solomon has made an enclosed portable chair

from wood in Lebanon.

10He made its posts out of silver,

its back out of gold,

its seat out of purple fabric,

and its interior lovingly fitted out

by the young women of Jerusalem.

11Go out, young women of Zion,

and look at King Solomon,

wearing the crown his mother gave him

on his wedding day, his happy day.”	S of S 3:5-11

Groom

4:1“You are so beautiful, my darling;

you’re so beautiful!

Your eyes are like doves behind your veil;

your hair is like a flock of goats

coming down Mount Gilead.

2Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes

that have come up from their washing,

that have all had twins

and none have miscarried.

3Your lips are like a scarlet thread;

your mouth is lovely;

your cheeks are like the halves of a pomegranate

behind your veil.

4Your neck is like the tower of David,

built with rows of stones

that have 1,000 shields hanging on them,

the round shields of strong men.	S of S 4:1-4

5Your two breasts are like two fawns,

twins of a gazelle,

that feed among the lilies.

6Till the evening breeze comes and shadows recede,

I’ll go my way to the mountain of myrrh

and the hill of frankincense.

7“You’re so beautiful, my darling;

there’s not a blemish on you.

8Come with me from Lebanon, my bride;

leave the summit of Amana,

the top of Senir and Hermon,

away from the lions’ dens,

the mountains and their leopards.	S of S 4:5-8

9You’ve made my heart beat faster, my sister, my bride;

you’ve made it beat faster

with a single glance with your eyes,

with one jewel of your necklace.

10Your love is so sweet, my sister, my bride!

so much better than wine;

the fragrance of your oils

is more pleasing than any spice!

11Your lips, my bride, distil nectar;

honey and milk are under your tongue;

the fragrance of your clothes is like the fragrance of Lebanon.

12A garden locked is my sister, my bride,

a garden locked, a fountain sealed.	S of S 4:9-12

13Your sprouts are an orchard of pomegranates

with choice fruits, henna with nard,

14nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,

with all the trees of frankincense,

myrrh and aloes, along with the finest spices.

15You’re a garden spring,

a well of fresh water,

a stream flowing from Lebanon.”	S of S 4:13-15

Bride

16“Wake up, north wind;

come, wind from the south;

make my garden breathe out fragrance;

let its spices carry abroad;

let my beloved go to his garden,

and eat its best produce!”	S of S 4:16

Groom

5:1“I’ve come to my garden, my sister, my bride;

I’ve gathered my myrrh and spice.

I’ve eaten my honey and honeycomb,

and drunk my wine and milk.

Eat, friends, and drink;

drink deeply, lovers.”	S of S 5:1

Bride

2“I was asleep, but my heart was awake.

A voice! my beloved is knocking.

‘Open for me, my sister, my darling,

my dove, my perfect one!

My head is drenched with dew;

my hair is damp from the night.’

3I’ve taken off my dress;

how can I put it on again?

I’ve washed my feet;

how can I get them dirty again?

4My beloved extended his hand through the opening,

my feelings were aroused.	S of S 5:2-4

5I got up to open the door for him;

my hands dripped with myrrh,

my fingers with liquid myrrh,

on the handles of the bolt.

6I opened for my beloved,

but he’d turned away and gone!

I looked for him but didn’t find him;

I called for him, but he didn’t answer.

7The watchmen that make their rounds in the city met me;

they struck me and hurt me;

the guardsmen took my shawl.

8I adjure you, young women of Jerusalem,

if you find my beloved, tell him I’m lovesick.”	S of S 5:5-8

Friends

9“But what kind of beloved is he,

most beautiful among women?

What kind of beloved is your beloved,

that you adjure us that way?”	S of S 5:9

Bride

10“My beloved is radiant and healthy,

outstanding among 10,000.

11His head is like gold—pure gold;

his hair is like clusters of dates,

and black as a raven.

12His eyes are like doves beside streams of water,

bathed in milk and neatly set.

13His cheeks are like a bed of spices,

banks of sweet-scented herbs;

his lips are lilies,

dripping with liquid myrrh.

14His hands are rods of gold,

set with beryl;

his abdomen is carved ivory

inlaid with lapis lazuli.

15His legs are alabaster pillars

set on pedestals of pure gold;

his appearance is like Lebanon,

as choice as the cedars.

16His mouth is full of sweetness;

he’s so desirable.

That’s my beloved, my friend,

young women of Jerusalem.”	S of S 5:10-16

Friends

6:1“Where has your beloved gone,

most beautiful among women?

Where has he turned

so we can help you find him?”

Bride

2“He’s gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,

to pasture his flock in the gardens and gather lilies.

3I’m my beloved’s, and my beloved’s mine,

the one that pastures his flock among the lilies.” S of S 6:1-3

Groom

4“You’re as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,

as lovely as Jerusalem,

as awesome as an army with standards.

5Turn your eyes away from me;

they overpower me;

your hair is like a flock of goats

coming down from Gilead.

6Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,

that have come up from their washing,

that have all had twins

and none have miscarried.

7Your cheeks are like the halves of a pomegranate

behind your veil.

8There are 60 queens and 80 concubines,

and young women without number.

9But my dove, my perfect one, is unique;

her mother’s only daughter,

the pure child of the one that bore her.	S of S 6:4-9

10“Who is this that grows like the dawn,

as beautiful as the full moon,

as pure as the sun,

as awesome as an army with standards?

11I went down to the orchard of nut trees

to see the blossoms in the valley,

to see if the grapevines had budded,

or the pomegranates had bloomed.

12Before I knew it, my fancy put me

in a chariot over my noble people.”

Friends

13“Come back, Shulammite;

Come back so we can get a good look at you!

as at the jostling between two armies?”	S of S 6:10-14

Groom

7:1“Your feet are so graceful in sandals,

prince’s daughter!

The curves of your hips are like jewels,

the work of an artist’s hand.

2Your navel is like a round goblet

that’s always full of mixed wine;

your stomach is like a pile of wheat

encircled by lilies.

3Your two breasts are like two fawns,

twins of a gazelle.

4Your neck is like an ivory tower;

your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon

by the gate of Bath-rabbim;

your nose is like the tower of Lebanon,

that overlooks Damascus.	S of S 7:1-4

5Your head crowns you like Carmel,

and the flowing locks of your hair are like purple threads;

the king is captivated by your tresses.

6How beautiful and delightful you are,

my love, with all your charms!

7You’re stately like a date palm;

your breasts are like its clusters.

8I said, ‘I’ll climb the palm tree

and take hold of its fruit.’

May your breasts be like clusters on a vine;

your breath is fragrant like apples;

9Your mouth is like the best wine!”		S of S 7:5-9a

Bride

“It goes down smoothly for my beloved,

and flows gently through the lips of people getting sleepy.

10“I’m my beloved’s,

and his desire is for me.

11Come on, my beloved, let’s go out in the country,

and spend the night in the villages.

12Let’s get up early and visit the vineyards

to see if the grapevines have budded,

if their blossoms are opening,

if the pomegranates have bloomed.

Then I’ll give you my love.

13The mandrakes have given off their fragrance;

above our doors are choice fruits, new and old,

that I’ve saved up for you, my beloved.	S of S 7:9b-13

8:1“Oh that you were my brother,

who nursed at my mother’s breasts.

If I found you outdoors, I’d kiss you;

and nobody would despise me.

2I’d take you into my mother’s house,

who used to instruct me;

I’d give you wine spiced from my pomegranates.

3Let his left hand be under my head,

and his right hand embrace me.”

leaning on her beloved?”	S of S 8:1-5a

Groom

“Under the apple tree I woke you up;

that’s where your mother was in labor with you,

and gave birth.

6Put me like a seal over your heart,

like a seal on your arm.

Love is as strong as death;

jealousy is as cruel as Sheol;

It flashes fire,

a very vehement flame.

7Flood water can’t quench love;

a river won’t drown it;

If a man would offer all the wealth in his house for love,

it would be utterly scorned.”	S of S 8:5b-7

Friends

8“We have a little sister,

and she doesn’t have breasts;

what will we do for her

when she’s spoken for?

9If she’s a wall,

we’ll build a silver battlement on her;

but if she’s a door,

we’ll barricade her in with cedar boards.”	S of S 8:8-9

Bride

10“I was a wall, and my breasts became like towers;

then I was in his eyes like a person that brings peace.

11Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;

he entrusted it to caretakers;

each one was to bring 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver for its fruit.

12My own vineyard is at my disposal;

the 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver are for you, Solomon,

and 5 lbs 200 shekels are for the ones that take care of its fruit.”

Groom

13“You that sit in the gardens,

my companions are listening for your voice—

let me hear it!”

Bride

14“Hurry, my beloved;

be like a gazelle or young stag

on the mountains of spices.”	S of S 8:10-14

ISAIAH

1:1Visions Isaiah Son of Amoz Saw

About Judah and Jerusalem

During the Reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,

and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah

Rebellious Judah

2Listen, earth and sky, the LORD says,

“I brought up sons,

but they’ve rebelled.

3An ox knows its owner,

and a donkey recognizes its owner’s manger,

but Israel doesn’t know me;

my people don’t recognize

that I’m the One who provided for them.”

4Sinful nation,

people weighed down with iniquity,

offspring of sinners who deal falsely,

you’ve rejected the LORD,

despised the Holy One of Israel,

and turned away from him.	Is 1:1-4

5Where else can he strike you

as you just keep on rebelling?

Your head is sick;

your heart is faint.

6There’s nothing healthy in you from head to toe,

just bruises, sores, and open wounds

without compress or bandage,

or ointment to soften them.

7Your country lies in ruins;

your towns have been burned.

Foreigners stole your crops while you watched;

it’s a wasteland they’ve overthrown.

8Zion is like a shed in a deserted vineyard,

like a watchman’s hut in an old cucumber patch,

like a city under siege.

9If the LORD of Hosts hadn’t left us a few survivors,

we’d be like Sodom and Gomorrah.	Is 1:5-9

10Listen to the LORD’s message, rulers in “Sodom”;

hear our God’s teaching, people in “Gomorrah”:

11“Why are you offering me all these sacrifices?

I’ve had enough of your burnt offerings of rams

and the fat of your grain-fed cattle;

I’m not happy with the blood of bulls, lambs, and goats.

12When you show up to worship me,

who’s making you tramp on my courts?

13Don’t keep bringing me your worthless offerings;

I detest their incense.

New moons, Sabbaths, scheduled assemblies—

I can’t endure any more of your solemn assemblies

mixed with your sinfulness.

14I despise your new moon celebrations and stated festivals;

they’re a drag to me; I’m tired of them.

15When you spread out your hands, I won’t look;

though you offer lots of prayers, I won’t be listening;

your spread-out hands have bloodshed on them.	Is 1:10-15

16“Take baths and get cleaned up;

get your sins out of my sight;

give up doing sinful things.

17Learn how to do good, seek out justice,

correct ruthless people, defend orphans,

fight for widows’ rights.

18“Come, now; let’s talk,” the LORD says.

“Though your sins are like scarlet,

they can be as white as snow;

if they’re red like crimson,

they can be like wool.

19If you start obeying me,

you’ll eat the best in the land.

20If you refuse and rebel,

your enemies’ sword will overwhelm you.”

The LORD has told you the truth.

Is 1:16-20

Unfaithful Jerusalem

21How the once-faithful city has become a prostitute,

she that used to be full of justice!

Goodness used to lodge there;

now murderers do.

22Your once-pure silver has turned to dross;

your drink’s been diluted with water.

23Your rulers rebel, your friends steal;

everybody likes bribes

and requires kickbacks;

they don’t defend orphans

or let widows’ cases come to trial.	Is 1:21-23

24So the Lord GOD of Hosts,

the Mighty One of Israel, says,

“I avenge myself of my enemies;

I take vengeance on my adversaries;

25I’ll turn against you;

I’ll smelt away your dross with lye

and remove your impurities.

26I’ll make your judges like they were at first

and your advisors the way they were in the beginning;

after that, you’ll be called ‘The City of Righteousness,’

‘The Faithful City.’”	Is 1:24-26

27Justice will redeem Zion;

repentance will lead to goodness.

28But the LORD will crush rebels and sinners;

those who forsake him will meet their end.

29You’ll be ashamed of the sacred terebinth groves you delighted in,

embarrassed by the gardens you chose to worship your idols in;

30because you’ll be like a terebinth tree with withered leaves

and a garden with no water.

31The strong will become kindling,

and their evil work the spark that lights it;

everything will burn up

with nobody able to put out the fire.	Is 1:27-31

The LORD’s Future Reign

2:1A Message Isaiah Son of Amoz Saw About Judah and Jerusalem

2In the last days, the mountain where the LORD’s Temple is,

will become the tallest mountain;

it will rise above the hills,

and nations everywhere will stream into it.

3Many nationalities will say,

“Let’s go up to the LORD’s mountain,

to the Temple of Jacob’s God,

so he can teach us his ways

and we can follow his paths,”

because the Law will go out from Zion,

the LORD’s message from Jerusalem.

4He’ll mediate between nations

and settle disputes between them;

they’ll hammer their swords into plowshares

and beat their spears into pruning hooks;

they won’t fight one another

or train for war anymore. 			Is 2:1-4

Warning About Coming Judgment

5Come, House of Jacob;

let’s follow the light of the LORD.

6He’s abandoned you

because practices from the east have filled you;

you use soothsayers like Philistines;

you strike bargains with foreigners.

7Your land has lots of silver and gold;

there’s no limit to your treasures;

you own lots of horses

and countless chariots.

8Your country is full of idols;

you worship your own creations,

what your fingers have made.	Is 2:5-8

9So the common people will be humbled,

important ones abased;

don’t forgive them.

10Get inside caves and hide underground

from the terror the LORD’s bringing

and the splendor of his majesty.

11He’ll abase arrogant people

and humble haughty ones;

he alone will be honored then.	Is 2:9-11

12The LORD of Hosts has set a time for reckoning,

for everybody that’s proud and arrogant,

for everybody that’s pompous and aloof

so they can be abased,

13for the tall cedars of Lebanon and oaks of Bashan,

14for high mountains and lofty hills,

15for every high tower and fortified wall,

16for the ships of Tarshish and their beautiful crafts.

17The LORD will humble the haughty

and abase the arrogant;

he alone will be honored then;

18idols will disappear.

19People will hide in caves in the rocks

and holes underground

in anticipation of the terror the LORD’s bringing

and the splendor of his majesty

when he takes action that makes the ground quake.

20At that time, they’ll toss to the moles and bats

the silver and gold idols they made to worship;

21they will hide in the caves in the rocks

and clefts in the cliffs

in anticipation of the terror the LORD’s bringing

and the splendor of his majesty

when he takes action that makes the ground quake.

22Stop trusting in people who breathe;

why depend on them? 	Is 2:12-22

Judgment Against Judah

3:1The Lord GOD of Hosts will remove

food and water from Judah and Jerusalem,

2strong men and soldiers, judges and prophets,

fortunetellers and elders,

3captains of 50 and their men,

advisors, expert magicians, and skilled astrologers.

4“I’ll make boys their officials,

babies their rulers;

5people will oppress one another,

neighbor against neighbor;

youths will insult elders;

inferiors will be rude to honorable citizens.”	 Is 3:1-5

6At that time, a man will grab his brother and say,

“You have a cloak; be our leader ;

rule this pile of ruins!”

7But he’ll protest,

“I won’t lead you;

I don’t have a cloak or extra food at home;

don’t expect me to be your leader.”

8Jerusalem will stumble, Judah will fall,

because their words and deeds oppose the LORD;

they’ve rebelled against his glorious presence.

9Even the looks on their faces give them away;

they show their sin like Sodom;

they don’t even try to hide it;

they’re doomed by the disaster they’ve brought on themselves.

10Tell good people it’ll go well with them;

they’ll eat what their efforts produce.

11But doom awaits the wicked! It’ll be bad for them

because they’ll get what they deserve.

12Children oppress my people;

women rule them.

My people’s guides get them lost;

they give them wrong directions.		 Is 3:6-12

13The LORD is getting up to contend in court,

to render verdict against the people.

14He’s going to sue the officials of his people:

“You’re the ones that have ruined my vineyard;

plunder from poor people sits in your houses;

15what do you mean crushing my people,

grinding their faces in the dirt?”

the Lord GOD of Hosts says.

Is 3:13-15

From Beauty to Ruin

16“Because the young women of Zion are proud

and walk with heads held high and flirting eyes,

because they prance along with dainty steps

and tinkle the bangles on their feet,

17I’ll strike their scalps with scabs

and shave off their eyebrows.	Is 3:16-17

18I’ll take away their pretty anklets, headbands, and crescent necklaces; 19dangling earrings, bracelets, and veils; 20headdresses and ankle bracelets; sashes, perfume boxes, and charms; 21finger rings and nose rings; 22fine robes, gowns, capes, and handbags; 23hand mirrors, linen clothes, tiaras, and shawls.

24Instead of sweet perfume, there’ll be stench;

instead of a girdle, a rope;

instead of permed hair, baldness;

instead of a fine robe, burlap;

and instead of beauty, branding.

25The young men of Israel will fall by the sword;

the strong will die in battle.

26The city gates will hang in lament and mourning;

Jerusalem will sit on the ground like a raped woman.”

Is 3:18-26

The LORD’s Branch

4:1At that time, seven widows will grab hold of one man and say, “We’ll provide our own food and clothes. Just let us take your name so we won’t be old maids!”

2But at that time, the LORD’s branch will be beautiful and glorious. What the ground produces will be the pride and joy of Israel’s survivors. 3The remnant in Zion and Jerusalem will be holy, everybody that’s in his record books for living there. 4When the LORD has washed the grime off of Zion’s inhabitants and cleaned up the bloodstains in Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and burning, 5then he’ll create over Mount Zion and its assemblies a cloud of smoke during the day, a bright blazing fire at night, and a canopy above the glory. 6It’ll be shade from daytime heat and shelter from storms and rain.  	Is 4:1-6

The Song of the Vineyard

5:1For the one I love, let me sing a song about his vineyard:

The one I love had a vineyard on a fertile hill.

2He spaded up the ground, picked up the rocks,

and planted the best grapevines in it;

he built a tower there

and hewed out a stone wine vat;

he expected it to produce good grapes,

but it produced wild ones.	Is 5:1-2

3“People in Judah and Jerusalem,

judge between me and my vineyard.

4What could I have done for it that I didn’t do?

Why did it produce bitter grapes instead of sweet ones?

5Let me tell you what I’m going to do with it:

I’ll cut down the hedge around it and burn it;

I’ll tear down the wall

and let animals trample it.

6I won’t take care of it, prune it, or hoe it;

briars and thorns will take it over;

I’ll tell the clouds not to rain on it anymore.”	Is 5:3-6

7Israel is the LORD’s vineyard;

the people in Judah are his delightful garden;

so he looked for justice but saw bloodshed;

he expected goodness but heard cries of distress.

Judah’s Guilt and Judgment

8Misfortune awaits you that buy up houses and fields

till there’s none left to buy,

and you’re living alone.

9I’ve heard the LORD of Hosts swear,

“Lots of houses will be empty, even big, nice ones;

10ten acres of vineyard will only produce 9 gallons 1 bath of wine;

11 bushels 1 homer of seed will only yield 1.1 bushels 1 ephah of grain.”

11Misfortune awaits those who get up early to drink alcohol

and stay up late to get drunk on wine.

12Their banquets feature lyres and harps,

tambourines and flutes—and wine;

but they give no thought to the LORD

or pay attention to what he’s doing.	Is 5:7-12

13So my people will go into exile for ignoring me;

their honored ones will starve;

their common people will be parched with thirst.

14Sheol will increase its appetite and eat its fill;

Jerusalem’s nobles and celebrating throngs will go down to it.

15Commoners will be humbled,

important people abased,

proud ones brought low.

16But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by his judgments;

the holy God will display his holiness by his goodness.

17Then lambs will graze in their pasture;

foreigners will eat among the ruins of the wealthy.

Is 5:13-17

18Misfortune awaits those who pull iniquity

behind them with ropes made out of lies,

who harness falsehood

and hook up their carts to sin,

19who say, “Let the Holy One of Israel hurry

so we can see what he’s doing;

let his purpose come close

so we can find out what it is!”

20Misfortune awaits those

who call bad good and good bad,

who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness,

who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.

21Misfortune’s in store for people that think they’re smart,

that consider themselves clever.

22Misfortune comes on winners at wine drinking

and champions at mixing drinks,

23who acquit the guilty for a bribe

and deprive the innocent of justice.	Is 5:18-23

24So, like a flame ignites stubble

and dry grass shrivels up in fire,

their roots will rot,

and their blossoms will go up like smoke.

They’ve rejected the LORD’s Law

and despised the message of the Holy One of Israel;

25so his anger has burned against his people,

and he’s reached out to strike them down.

The mountains quake;

corpses litter the streets like garbage.

His anger hasn’t turned away;

his fist is still raised.	Is 5:24-25

26He’ll signal to a far-off country;

he’ll whistle for it to come from a remote land

and to do it swiftly and soon.

27Nobody from there will get tired or stumble,

rest or sleep;

there won’t be one loose belt or broken sandal strap.

28Its arrows will be sharp; its bows bent;

its horses’ hoofs will spark like flint;

its chariot wheels will spin like tornadoes.

29It will roar like a lioness, like a young lion;

it’ll growl when it seizes prey and carries it off;

nobody will be able stop it.

30It will growl over its prey like the ocean roars;

on land, there’ll be darkness and distress;

clouds will block out the light.	Is 5:26-30

Isaiah’s Call and Cleansing

6:1The year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high throne, and his train filled the Temple. 2Seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings:  two covered their faces, two covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3One shouted to the other,

“Holy, Holy, Holy is the LORD of Hosts;

the whole world is full of his glory.”

4The thresholds shook when he shouted, and smoke filled the Temple. 5I said,

“I’m doomed! I’m lost,

a man with unclean lips

living among people with unclean lips,

and I’ve seen the King, the LORD of Hosts!”	Is 6:1-5

6One seraph flew to me with a burning coal he’d taken off the altar with tongs. 7He touched my mouth with it and said, “That has taken away your guilt; your sin’s forgiven.”

8Then I heard the Lord say, “Who will I send? Who’ll go for us?”

I said, “I’ll go; send me.”

9He said,

“Go tell this nation:

‘Keep listening, but don’t understand anything;

keep looking, but don’t perceive anything.

10Harden your hearts,

be hard of hearing,

and shut your eyes

so you can’t see or hear,

understand and repent,

and be healed.’”				Is 6:6-10

11I said, “How long, Lord?”

“Till the towns are deserted,

the houses are empty,

and the land’s forsaken;

12till I’ve taken the people far away

and leave the land largely abandoned.

13A tenth of it will survive

only to be invaded again and burned;

like a terebinth tree or oak

whose stump is still standing after it’s cut down,

the stump will be Israel’s holy seed.”		Is 6:11-13

A Message for Ahaz

7:1At the time of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but couldn’t take it. 2When the news reached Judah’s royal court that Syria was in league with Ephraim, their hearts sank, and they shook like trees in the wind.

3The LORD said to Isaiah,

“Take your son Shear-jashub [A remnant will return] and go meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that supplies the Upper Pool on the road to the Fuller’s Field. 4-6Tell him not to worry about Rezin and Remaliah’s son. He doesn’t need to be afraid or fainthearted over the fierce anger of those two smoldering sticks. True, they’re plotting to attack Judah and install Tabeel as king there. 7-9But that’s not going to happen. Syria’s headquarters is in Damascus, led by Rezin; Ephraim’s headquarters is in Samaria, led by Remaliah. Just trust me, and I’ll make you outlast them. In 65 years, Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a people.”  				  Is 7:1-9

10The LORD spoke to Ahaz again, 11“Ask me for a sign that’s as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.”

12But Ahaz said, “I’m not going to do that.”

13So Isaiah said,

“Listen, David’s dynasty! Is trying people’s patience not enough that you try God’s patience too? 14So the LORD will give youpl his own sign: a virgin will have a son she’ll call Immanuel [God is with us]. 15Before he’s old enough to eat curds and honey, refuse evil and choose good, 16the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. 17The Lord will bring on you, your people, and your ancestor’s dynasty such a time as has never come since Ephraim seceded from Judah: the king of Assyria. 18The LORD will whistle for a fly at the mouth of the rivers of Egypt and for a bee in Assyria. 19They’ll come and light in the steep ravines, in the cracks in the rocks, on the thorns, and in the pastures. 20The LORD will shave Israel’s head, legs, and beard with a “razor” he’ll hire from beyond the Euphrates: the king of Assyria.  	Is 7:10-20

21“At that time, a farmer may still have a cow and a couple sheep. 22Nevertheless, they’ll give enough for him and the few left in the land to eat curds and honey. 23Briars and thorns will take over a vineyard that used to have 1,000 vines, worth 25 lbs 1,000 shekels of silver. 24People will go there to hunt with bows and arrows because briars and thorns will overrun the country. 25People won’t go to the hills where they used to hoe garden plots, because they’ll want to avoid the briars and thorns. That’s where cattle will pasture, and sheep will trample.” 	       			Is 7:21-25

Assyria’s Coming Invasion

8:1Then the LORD told me, “Take a large tablet and etch on it in standard letters ‘Maher-shalal-hash-baz’ [quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil].” 2I got reputable men to witness it: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah. 3So I had relations with my wife the prophetess, and she had a son. The LORD told me,

“Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 4because before he knows how to say ‘daddy’ or ‘mommy,’ the king of Assyria will ‘carry away the wealth’ in Damascus and ‘the spoil’ in Samaria.”

5The LORD spoke to me again,

6“These people have rejected the water at Shiloah that flows gently and admire Rezin and Remaliah’s son. 7So I’ll flood them with the powerful, abundant ‘water’ of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its banks, 8surge into Judah, flood it, and wash on through. It will get neck deep over your whole land, Immanuel.	   Is 8:1-8

9“Be broken, nations, and terrified;

listen, distant lands;

gird up, but you’ll be crushed;

gird up, but you’ll be crushed.

10Devise a battle plan, it’ll be thwarted;

develop a strategy, it won’t stand,

because ‘God is with us’ [Immanuel].”	Is 8:9-10

Trust the LORD

11The LORD warned me strictly not to think the way this country thinks:

12“Don’t suppose everything’s a conspiracy that they do or fear everything they fear or dread what they dread. 13Fear the LORD of Hosts, the One you consider holy. 14He’ll be your sanctuary. To both houses of Israel, he’ll be a stone to stub your toe on, a rock to trip over, a snare and a trap for the people in Jerusalem. 15Many will trip on it, fall, and shatter. They’ll be caught in a snare.”

16Preserve the testimony; entrust the teaching to my disciples. 17I’ll wait for the LORD that’s turned away from Jacob’s descendants. I’ll diligently depend on him. 18I and the children the LORD has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who lives on Mount Zion. 	Is 8:11-18

19If they tell you to consult mediums and wizards that chirp and mutter, shouldn’t they consult their God instead? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 20Instead, go to God’s teaching, go to his testimony! If what they say doesn’t agree with that, it’s because they’re not going to see a new dawn. 21They’ll pass through the land, distressed and hungry. They’ll get mad and curse their king and their God. They’ll look up to the sky 22and down at the earth at distress and darkness, at the despair that comes from anguish. Then they’ll be thrust into deep darkness.	Is 8:19-22

A Messiah Has Been Born to Us

9:1But there won’t be any more darkness for those who have been in distress. In earlier times, God didn’t give much prominence to the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, but at a future time he’ll make it glorious along the road from the Jordan along the Sea of Galilee, Galilee of the Gentiles.

2Those who walk in deep darkness

will see a bright light;

it will shine on people

that live in a dark land.

3You’ll enlarge the nation

and increase their happiness;

they’ll be happy in your presence

like people at harvest time

or when they divide up spoil.

4You’ll take off their yoke of slavery,

remove the burden from their shoulders,

and break the oppressor’s rod

like when you destroyed Midian in battle.	Is 9:1-4

5Infantry boots from the chaos of battle

and uniforms soaked in blood will be burned.

6A child has been born to us, a son has been given;

the government will rest on him.

He’ll be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,

Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

7His peaceful rule will never end

on David’s throne and over his kingdom.

He’ll make it secure and maintain it with justice

and goodness permanently.

The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will make it happen. Is 9:5-7

God’s Anger at Israel

8The LORD is issuing a message against Jacob,

a message of condemnation that falls on Israel.

9Everyone in Ephraim will find out,

those who live in Samaria

who say with such arrogance,

10“The fallen bricks in our ruins

we’ll replace with dressed stones;

sycamores that have been cut down

we’ll replant with cedars.”

11But the LORD will bring adversaries from Rezin

and spur them on.

12Syrians from the east plus Philistines from the west

will devour Israel with wide-open jaws.

Even then, his anger won’t be spent;

his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:8-12

13Yet the people still won’t come back

to the One that disciplined them

or look to the LORD of Hosts.

14So he’ll cut off head and tail from Israel,

palm branch and reed the same day.

15The head is the elders and honored men;

the tail is the false prophets.

16The people’s guides are misguiding them;

they’re guiding them toward destruction.

17That’s why the LORD doesn’t delight in their young men

or feel compassion for their orphans and widows:

every one of them is godless;

they all speak foolishness.

Even then, his anger won’t be spent;

his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:13-17

18Sin burns here like a brush fire,

consuming briars and thorns,

setting ablaze the undergrowth in the woods,

and sending up clouds of smoke from igniting trees

19The fury of the LORD of Hosts will burn through the land;

its people will be the fuel for the fire;

nobody will spare his own brother.

20They’ll grab what’s on the right hand,

but still be hungry;

they eat what’s on the left,

but not be satisfied;

they’ll eat the flesh off their own arm!

21Ephraim and Manasseh will devour each other

and together feed on Judah.

Even then, his anger won’t be spent;

his fist will still be raised.	Is 9:18-21

10:1Misfortune awaits judges that enact unfair laws

and render illegal verdicts,

2who deprive the needy of justice

and rob the poor of their rights

so they can make widows their spoil

and orphans their plunder.

3What are you going to do when punishment arrives,

when devastation comes from far off?

Who will you run to for help?

Where will you hide your wealth?

4There’ll be nothing left for you

but to crouch among the captives

or fall among the slain.

Even then, his anger won’t be spent;

his fist will still be raised.	Is 10:1-4

Judgment Against Assyria

5“Misfortune awaits Assyria,

the club my anger is using,

the staff I’ve loaded with my indignation.

6I’m sending Assyria against my godless nation,

a people I’m angry with,

to capture spoil and seize plunder,

to tramp on like a dirt road.

7But that’s not Assyria’s intention.

It simply intends to destroy

one nation after another.

8It will say, ‘My princes will all be kings?

9Calno will fall like Carchemish,

Hamath like Arpad,

Samaria like Damascus.

10As I’ve done to other kingdoms with idols,

whose carved images were greater than Jerusalem’s and Samaria’s,

11so I’ll do to Jerusalem and its images

what I’ve done to Samaria and its idols.’”	Is 10:5-11

12So when the Lord finishes using Assyria to complete his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he’ll say, “I’ll punish the arrogant king of Assyria and his pompous pride.” 13That’s because he brags,

“I did this by my own power and wisdom,

because I’m intelligent;

I have broken through nations’ boundaries

and carried off their treasures,

knocked down their kings like a bull

14and robbed their wealth like a nest;

I gathered the whole world

like someone gathers abandoned eggs;

not a one flapped its wings

or opened its beak or clucked.”	Is 10:12-14

15But should an axe brag

about being mightier than the woodsman that chops with it?

Should a saw elevate itself

above the carpenter that saws with it?

That would be like a staff wielding a shepherd

or a cane standing up the one that leans on it.

16So the Lord GOD of Hosts will send

a plague among Assyria’s strong soldiers;

he’ll ignite their glory with a burning flame.

17Israel’s light will be that fire,

its Holy One that flame;

it will eat up Assyria’s “thorns and briars” in one day.

18He’ll destroy Assyria’s glory like a forest

and his fruitful “garden” body and soul;

it’ll waste away like sick people in a plague.

19So few trees will be left in his “woods”

a kid could count them.	Is 10:15-19

Hope for the Remnant

20At that time, the remnant in Israel and the survivors in Judah that escaped will have the sense to never again rely on allies that want to destroy them. They’ll rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, 21-22the Mighty God. 22Then, even though Israel was as numerous as sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. 23The Lord GOD will carry out the total destruction he’s decreed.

24So this is what he says,

“My people in Zion, don’t be afraid of Assyria that wants to strike you with a rod and threaten you with its staff like Egypt did. 25In a little while, my anger at you will be spent, and I’ll redirect it at Assyria. 26I’ll scourge it like I massacred Midian at the Rock of Oreb. I’ll hold my staff out over the sea and lift it up like I did in Egypt. 27Then I’ll lift the Assyrian burden off your shoulders and break its yoke from off your neck.”        	Is 10:20-27

28The Assyrians have passed through Migron,

attacked Aiath,

and set up base camp at Michmash.

29They’ve gone over the pass

and are camping at Geba;

Ramah has panicked,

and Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30Cry out in terror, people in Gallim!

Warn Laishah and poor Anathoth!

31Madmenah has fled;

the residents of Gebim are searching for refuge.

32The enemy will halt his advance at Nob for the day

and shake his fist at Mount Zion,

the hill of Jerusalem.	Is 10:28-32

33The Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off limbs with a terrible crash

and cut down Lebanon’s tall, lofty trees.

34With an iron axe he’ll chop down the undergrowth in its forest,

and Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One.	Is 10:33-34

A Branch from Jesse

11:1A sapling will grow out of Jesse’s stump;

a branch from his roots will bear fruit.

2The LORD’s spirit will rest on him,

the spirit of wisdom and insight,

counsel and strength,

knowledge and respect for the LORD.

3He’ll delight in respecting the LORD;

he won’t judge by appearances

or render verdicts based on hearsay.

4He’ll judge the poor justly

and decide for the meek fairly.

He’ll shake the ground with the force of his words

and blow the sinful away with his breath.

5Faithfulness will be his cloak;

goodness will be his belt.	Is 11:1-5

6Wolves will live with lambs;

leopards will lie down beside baby goats;

calves, lion cubs, and grain-fed animals will herd together;

and a little child will herd them.

7Cows will graze beside bears;

their young will bed down together;

lions will eat straw like oxen.

8A nursing baby will play by a cobra pit;

a weaned child will put his hand in a viper’s hole.

9Nothing will do harm anywhere on my holy mountain,

because the land will be full of knowledge of the LORD

like the ocean is full of water.	Is 11:6-9

10At that time, Jesse’s heir will serve as a banner for the Gentiles. They’ll rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. 11For a second time he’ll recover the remnant of his people that are left in Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands in the sea. 12He’ll hoist a flag for the nations and repatriate the exiles of Israel and Judah from every direction. 13Ephraim and Judah won’t resent each other or harass one another. 14They’ll swoop down on the Philistines in the west and together plunder the nations to the east. They’ll control Edom and Moab, and subjugate the Ammonites. 15The LORD will dry up the Red Sea by Egypt and blow his scorching wind on the Euphrates River. He’ll separate it into seven channels so people can wade across in sandals. 16There’ll be a highway from Assyria for the remnant to return on, like there was for Israel when he brought them out of Egypt.	Is 11:10-16

A Song of Praise for Salvation

12:1At that time, you’ll say,

“Thank you, LORD;

though you were angry with me,

you turned your anger away

and reassured me.

2You’re my salvation;

I’ll trust you and not be afraid,

because you’re my strength and song.”

3So I’ll draw water with joy

from the wells of salvation

4and say,

“Thank the LORD, call on him;

tell everyone what he’s done;

tell them his name is Honored.

5Sing praises to him

because he’s done excellent things;

tell it all over the world.

6Sing and shout for joy, you that live in Zion,

because the Holy One that lives with you is great.”	Is 12:1-6

13:1Oracle About Babylon That Isaiah Son of Amoz Saw

2“Hoist a signal flag on a bare hilltop; call out an army

and signal them to attack the mansions of the nobles.

3I’ve commanded my consecrated ones

and strong men to carry out my anger.”	Is 13:1-3

4There’s noise in the mountains like a large army,

the uproar of gathered kingdoms!

The LORD of Hosts is mustering an army for war.

5He and his instruments of indignation

are coming from distant countries, from far-off horizons,

to destroy the whole region.

6Cry out, because the day of the LORD has come,

destruction from the Almighty.

7Everybody’s hands will fall limp;

everyone’s heart will melt.

8They’ll panic;

pain and anguish will seize them;

they’ll writhe like a woman in labor

and look aghast at one another;

their faces will be hot.				Is 13:4-8

9The day of the LORD is coming—

cruel, with fury and burning anger—

to desolate the land

and destroy its sinners.

10The stars and constellations won’t glimmer;

the sun will be dark at dawn,

and the moon won’t shine.

11“That’s how I’ll punish the world for its sin,

put an end to its arrogance,

and humble the pride of ruthless people.

12I’ll make people rarer than gold,

rarer than gold from Ophir.

13I’ll make the sky shake and the earth quake

at my fury when my burning anger comes.” 		Is 13:9-13

14Like hunted gazelles or sheep with no shepherd,

everyone in Babylon will try to get back to their own people,

to escape to their own country.

15Anybody that’s found will be thrust through;

anybody that’s captured will fall by the sword.

16Their little ones will be dashed to pieces while they watch;

their houses will be plundered and their wives raped.

17“I’m going to stir up the Medes against them,

who don’t care about silver or delight in gold.

18Their bows will slaughter the young men;

they won’t show mercy to babies

or pity children.”	Is 13:14-18

19Babylon—the glory of the kingdoms, the Babylonians’ pride—

will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.

20Nobody will ever live there;

no nomad will pitch his tent inside it;

no shepherd will bed down his flock in it.

21Desert animals will rest there;

howling creatures will shelter in its abandoned houses;

owls will nest in it;

shaggy goats will frolic there.

22Hyenas will howl in its fortified towers,

and jackals in its luxurious palaces;

its fate is soon to come.					Is 13:19-22

A Taunt for the King of Babylon

14:1When the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, choose Israel again, and settle them in their own land, foreigners will join Jacob’s house. 2The nations will help bring them home. Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the LORD’s land, as male and female servants. They’ll capture their captors and rule their rulers. 3When the LORD gives them relief from their pain, turmoil, and harsh slavery, 4they’ll taunt the king of Babylon:

“How the big bully has ceased bullying

and stopped his insolence!

5The LORD has broken the staff of the corrupt,

the scepter of rulers

6that struck people in fury with endless blows,

that ruled nations with unrestrained tyranny.

7The whole region is resting and quiet now;

the people are breaking out into shouts of joy.

8The cypress trees are celebrating over you;

the cedars of Lebanon say,

‘Since you were laid low,

no lumberjacks have come to cut us down.’	Is 14:1-8

9Sheol below you is excited to welcome you;

the spirits of dead leaders rouse to see you;

the nations’ kings rise from their thrones.

\	10They welcome you and say,

‘You’ve become as weak as we are;

you’re like us now.

11Your pomp and the music of your lyres

have come down to Sheol;

maggots are your bed;

worms are your covers.’	Is 14:9-11

12How you’ve fallen from the sky,

Morning Star, son of the dawn!

You that overthrew nations

have been thrown to the ground!

13You told yourself

you’d ascend to the sky

and raise your throne above God’s stars

and preside over the mount of assembly

in the distant north;

14you’d rise above the clouds

and be like the Most High.

15But, you’ll be thrust down to Sheol,

to the depths of the Pit. 		Is 14:12-15

16Those who see you will gape and wonder,

‘Is this the king that made the ground shake

and kingdoms tremble,

17that turned the world into a wasteland,

overthrew cities,

and didn’t let his prisoners go home?’	Is 14:16-17

18The kings of earth lie in honor

in their magnificent tombs;

19but you’ll be thrown out of your sepulcher

like a gross miscarriage,

dumped with the slain in a mass grave,

with those pierced by the sword,

who go down into a cistern

like trampled corpses.

20No one will give you a proper burial

because you’ve ruined your own country

and slain your own people.

21Slaughter his descendants for their father’s guilt

so they won’t grow up and conquer the world

like he did.”	Is 14:18-21

22The LORD of Hosts says,

“I’ll attack Babylon and destroy its reputation, children, and posterity. 23I’ll make a marsh out of it, a haunt for hedgehogs, and sweep it with a broom of destruction.”

24The LORD of Hosts has sworn,

“It will happen the way I planned;

it’ll stand like I intended.

25I’ll break Assyria when it comes into my land

and trample it underfoot on my mountains.

I’ll remove its yoke from my people

and its burden from their backs.

26That’s what I’ve planned for the whole region,

a judgment that reaches out across the nations.”

27The LORD of Hosts has a plan; who’s going to stop it?

Who can shove aside his raised fist?	Is 14:22-27

Oracle Against Philistia

28The year King Ahaz died, this oracle came:

29“You that live in Philistia, don’t celebrate

because the rod that struck you is broken;

from that serpent’s stock

a more poisonous snake will come.

30I’ll pasture the firstborn of my poor,

and their needy will lie down safely;

but I’ll starve your root to death

and kill off any survivors.	Is 14:28-30

31Wail, gates; cry, city;

melt away, Philistia;

because an army is drifting in like smoke from the north,

and every soldier in it rushes to the fight.”

32What should we tell any messengers the Philistines send?

“The LORD founded Zion;

the stricken among his people

will find refuge there.”				Is 14:31-32

15:1Oracle About Moab

Moab will be ruined

because Ar and Kir will be wiped out overnight.

2The people of Dibon will go up to their temple

and high places to weep.

Moab will mourn over Nebo and Medeba;

everyone’s head will be bald, and their beard shaved off.

3They’ll put on burlap

in the streets and squares and on the housetops.

Everyone will be wailing, melting in tears.

4The outcries of Heshbon and Elealeh

will echo all the way to Jahaz;

the armed men of Moab will cry out in panic;

their souls will tremble inside them.	Is 15:1-4

5My heart weeps for Moab;

its refugees are fleeing as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah;

they’re going up to Luhith sobbing.

All along the road to Horonaim,

they’re crying out in distress over their ruin.

6The water at Nimrim has dried up;

the tender grass has withered;

there’s nothing green anywhere.

7The abundance they stored up

is being carried away across Wadi Arabim.

8Their distress cry has gone all over Moab;

their wail as far as Eglaim and Beer-elim.

9The stream near Dibon is running red with blood;

I’ll bring yet more anguish on Dibon:

a lion on the refugees from Moab

and the remnant that’s still in the land.	Is 15:5-9

16:1Send tribute lambs to the ruler of the land,

from Sela through the desert to Mount Zion.

2At the Arnon fords the women of Moab will be

left fluttering like birds or homeless nestlings.	Is 16:1-2

3“Give us advice, grant us justice;

cast your shadow on us like night at noon

to hide us outcasts; don’t betray us fugitives.

4Let our refugees from Moab stay among you;

hide us from the destroyer.”

When oppression and destruction end

and raiders have left the land,

God will establish one of David’s descendants as king;

5he will set up a throne in enduring love,

and a faithful judge will sit on it in David’s tent.

He’ll rule with mercy and truth,

strive for justice,

and measure out goodness in timely fashion. 	Is 16:3-5

6We’ve heard about Moab’s excessive pride,

its arrogance and fury;

its idle boasts have proved to be false.

7So everyone in Moab will moan

for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth

like people completely stricken.

8The fields of Heshbon will wither;

the vineyards of Sibmah too.

The lords of the nations will tramp on its choice clusters

whose tendrils reach out as far as Jazer

and spread to the eastern desert,

whose shoots have grown westward even across the Dead Sea.

Is 16:6-8

9So I’ll weep bitterly for Jazer and the wine of Sibmah;

I’ll drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh,

because the happy shouts over your summer fruits

and harvest have died out.

10Happiness will be gone from the productive fields;

there’ll be no joyful shouting in the vineyards.

Nobody will be treading out wine in the wine presses;

I’ll make the shouting stop.

11So my heart moans for Moab like a dirge on a harp;

my heart aches for Kir-hareseth.

12When the people of Moab

wear themselves out in worship at their shrines

and come to their sanctuary to pray,

it won’t do them any good.	Is 16:9-12

13The LORD spoke that message earlier about Moab. 14Now he says, “In three years, like a hired hand under contract would count them, I’ll humble Moab’s pride and decimate its sizeable population. Its survivors will be few and feeble.”	Is 16:13-14

17:1Oracle About Damascus

“Damascus will stop being a city

and become a pile of ruins.

2The villages around Aroer will be deserted;

flocks will bed down in them

with no one to chase them away.

3Fortified towns will disappear from Ephraim,

sovereignty from Damascus

and the remnant from Syria;

they’ll be like Israel’s departed glory,”

the LORD of Hosts says.        Is 17:1-3

4“At that time, Jacob’s glory will fade;

its robust body will grow frail.

5It will look like a grain field after harvest,

like someone gleaning heads of grain one at a time

in the Valley of Rephaim.

6Yet some gleanings will be left—

like shaking an olive tree,

two or three olives on the highest branch,

four or five on a fruitful limb,”

the LORD God of Israel says. Is 17:4-6

7At that time, people will finally care about their Maker and look to the Holy One of Israel. 8They won’t care about the altars, the work of their hands, or rely on what their fingers have made, the Asherah poles, and incense stands. 9Their largest towns will be like places the Hivites and Amorites deserted when the Israelites came. Desolation will prevail. 	Is 17:7-9

10You’ve forgotten the God that can save you,

the Rock where you could hide.

So, though you plant nice vines

and set them as seedlings from a foreign god,

11though you make them sprout the day you plant them,

put a ledge around them,

and get them to blossom the same morning—

you won’t pick any grapes from them;

harvest time will be a time of grief and unrelieved pain.

Is 17:10-11

12Ah, the uproar of many nations

like the roar of the ocean,

like the rumbling of a flash flood!

13The nations rumble on like flooding water,

but he’ll rebuke them,

and they’ll flee like chaff in the mountain wind,

like whirling dust ahead of a storm.

14In the evening Israel will wait in terror,

but by morning its enemies will be dead!

That’s what will happen to the ones that plunder us,

a proper end for those who pillage us.	Is 17:12-14

An Oracle About Nubia

18:1Ah, land of fluttering wings,

land beyond the headwaters of the Nile in Nubia,

2that sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats—

go swiftly, ambassadors, to a nation tall and smooth,

a people feared far and wide,

a powerful, oppressive nation

crisscrossed by rivers.

3All of you that live in the world,

look when I raise the signal on the mountains,

listen when I blow the ram’s horn,

4because the LORD has told me:

“I’ll watch quietly from my Temple,

as quietly as a cloud forming in the summer sunshine,

like dew condensing at harvest time.” 	Is 18:1-4

5Before harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms

and the flowers start turning into grapes,

he’ll snip off the new shoots with pruning shears

and lop off the spreading branches.

6Your huge army will be left dead for the mountain buzzards

and wild animals on the ground.

The buzzards will spend the summer picking at the corpses;

the wild animals will spend the winter gnawing on them till harvest time.

7At that time, a nation tall and smooth

will pay homage to Yahveh of Hosts—

a people feared far and wide,

a powerful, oppressive nation

crisscrossed by rivers.

They’ll bring their gifts to Mount Zion,

the place that wears the name Yahveh of Hosts. 	Is 18:5-7

19:1Oracle About Egypt

The LORD is riding a swift cloud to Egypt;

Egypt’s idols tremble in his presence;

the Egyptians’ hearts melt.

2“I’ll pit the Egyptians against one another,

brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor;

city against city, district against district.

3They’ll be demoralized;

I’ll confuse their strategy

so they’ll resort to their idols and spirits of the dead,

to mediums and spiritists.

4I’ll deliver them to a cruel master;

a powerful king will rule them,”

the Lord GOD of Hosts says. 	Is 19:1-4

5The Nile will dry up;

its riverbed will be parched and dry.

6The canals from the Nile will get foul;

the braiding streams in the delta will trickle and dry up;

reeds and rushes will rot.

7Bulrushes by the Nile and the sown fields beside it

will dry up and disappear.

8Fishermen will chant a dirge;

the ones that cast lines in the Nile will mourn;

those who spread nets on the water will lose heart.

9The ones that manufacture linen from combed flax

or weave white cloth will despair.

10Business owners will go bankrupt;

their hired laborers will grieve.	Is 19:5-10

11The officials in Zoan are simply fools;

Pharaoh’s best advisors give stupid advice.

How can you brag to Pharaoh

that you’re wise, descendants of ancient kings?

12Where are your wise men, Pharaoh?

Let them understand, have them tell you

what the LORD of Hosts has planned for Egypt.

13The officials in Zoan are simply fools;

the nobles in Memphis are deluded;

the cornerstones of its tribes have misled the country.

14The LORD has stirred up confusion in them,

they’ve led Egypt astray in everything it’s doing,

like a drunk staggering in his vomit.

15There’s nothing helpless Egypt can do

with its head or tail, palm branch or reed.	Is 19:11-15

16The Egyptians will be like women then, cringing with fear as the fist of the LORD of Hosts shakes over them. 17Judah will terrorize Egypt. They’ll dread hearing Judah mentioned because the LORD has laid out his purpose against them.

18At that time, five cities in Egypt will start speaking Hebrew and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts—Heliopolis for one. 19There’ll be an altar to him in Egypt and a monument to him at its border, 20a sign and witness. When they call out to him against oppressors, he’ll send them a champion to rescue them. 21That’s how he’ll make himself known to them. They’ll even worship with sacrifice and offering, take vows to him and keep them. 22He’ll strike Egypt, striking then healing them, so they’ll come back to him. 23-24A highway then will run from Egypt to Assyria, and people will travel to each other and worship together. Israel will be the third member in an alliance with Egypt and Assyria, with the LORD’s blessing located between the two. 25“Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, Israel my permanent possession.”             										      Is 19:16-25

A Sign Against Egypt and Nubia

20:1Sargon, king of Assyria, sent his general to attack Ashdod. 2That year the LORD spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz, “Take the burlap off your waist and remove your sandals.” So he went around naked and barefoot. 3The LORD said,

“My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as an omen to Egypt and Nubia. 4The king of Assyria will lead captives away from there, young and old, naked and barefoot with their butts showing, to Egypt’s humiliation. 5People will be disgraced and disappointed by Nubia their hope and Egypt their pride. 6The people along the coast will say, ‘Look at what’s happened to them! How can we escape who fled there for protection from the king of Assyria?!’”		 Is 20:1-6

21:1Oracle About the Sandy Wastes Beside the Sea

Like a haboob sweeping in from the Negev,

catastrophe will sweep in through the desert from a terrible land.

2I see a harsh vision:

plunderers plundering; destroyers destroying.

Go on, Elam; lay siege, Media.

I’m going to put an end to the groaning Babylon’s caused.

3My body’s in agony;

pangs have seized me like a woman in labor.

I’m so faint I can’t hear,

so scared I can’t see.

4My mind is reeling, the horror is overwhelming;

I longed for the twilight;

now I’m afraid of the dark.

5The people are setting tables and spreading rugs to sit on;

they’re eating and drinking. But—

“Get up, captains; oil the shields for battle!”	Is 21:1-5

6Then the LORD said to me,

“Station a sentry to report what he sees.

7When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,

a donkey train, a camel caravan,

he needs to stay alert.”

8Then the sentry shouted like a lion,

“LORD, every day I’ve manned my station on the tower;

every night I’ve stood at my post.

9Now at last, here come riders, horsemen in pairs.

They’re reporting, ‘Fallen! Babylon’s fallen!

its images shattered on the ground.’”

10My threshed people, winnowed on the threshing floor!

I’m reporting what I’ve heard

from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.	Is 21:6-10

11Oracle About Edom

Someone keeps calling to me from Seir,

“Watchman, what time is it?

How long till morning?”

12The watchman answers,

“Morning is coming, but night will soon return;

if you want updates, come back later

and ask again.”	Is 21:11-12

13Oracle About Arabia

Caravans of Dedanites, you have to spend the night

hiding in the deserts of Arabia.

14People in Tema, bring water for these thirsty refugees;

meet them with food,

15because they’re running from the drawn sword,

the bent bow, the press of battle.

16This is what the LORD told me,

“A year from now, as a hired hand’s contract would read, Kedar’s splendor will end. 17Its surviving archers and strong men will be few;

I, the LORD God of Israel, have spoken.”								       	       	        		Is 21:13-17

22:1Oracle About the Valley of Vision

What’s the matter with you?

Why are you all running up to the housetops?

2You noisy, exuberant city in an uproar,

your dead weren’t slain in battle,

but by famine and disease.

3Your rulers all fled together

and were captured without resistance;

your people were discovered and taken captive too,

though they’d tried to escape.	Is 22:1-3

4So I said, “Leave me alone to weep bitterly;

don’t try to comfort me about the destruction of my people.”

5The Lord GOD of Hosts has in mind

a day of panic, trampling, and confusion

in the Valley of Vision,

a day of battering down walls

and outcries echoing off the mountains.

6Elam will take up the quiver

with chariots, infantry, and cavalry;

Kir will uncover the shield.

7Chariots will fill your beautiful valleys;

cavalry will storm the gates.

8God will take down Judah’s defenses.	Is 22:4-8a

At that time, you depend on the weapons in the House of the Forest

9when you see how many breaches were in the wall of David’s city;

you store up water from the lower pool;

10you tear down some of the houses to get materials to fortify the wall;

11you create a reservoir between the walls to hold water from the old pool;

but you don’t ask for help from the One that made all this

or consider the One that planned it long ago.

12The Lord GOD of Hosts had called for you to weep, wail, shave your head, and put on burlap. 13Instead, you’ve celebrated with revelry, butchering cattle and sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink; tomorrow we die.” 14The LORD of Hosts revealed this to me, “I won’t forgive that sin as long as you live.”  	Is 22:8b-14

An Oracle for Shebna

15The Lord GOD of Hosts says,

“Go ask Shebna, the palace administrator, 16‘Who are you that you’ve hewn out a monumental tomb for yourself here high in the rock? 17-19Arrogant man! I’m going to depose you from your office, wad you into a ball, and throw you away into a large country to die there with your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master’s house.

20-21I’ll put your robe on my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah and tie your sash around him. I’ll entrust him with your authority, and he’ll become a father to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 22I’ll hang on his shoulder the key to David’s house. When he opens, no one will shut; when he shuts, nobody will open. 23I’ll drive him like a stake in solid ground. He’ll become famous, 24and they’ll place on him the prestige of his family, from offspring and issue to the least items of bowls and jars. 25But then the peg driven in solid ground will break off, and the load hanging on it will fall to the ground. I, the LORD, have said so.’”	      			Is 22:15-25

23:1Oracle About Tyre

Wail, you merchant ships of Tarshish,

because Tyre’s destroyed without home or harbor,

just like the rumor you heard all the way over at Cyprus.

2Be quiet, you people on the coast, merchants of Sidon;

your traders crossed the sea

3and sailed on many bodies of water.

Grain from the Nile, harvest from the Shihor was your revenue;

you were the international marketplace.

4But now be disgraced, Sidon,

because the fortress by the sea says,

“I’m childless, without young men and virgins.”

5When the report reaches Egypt,

they’ll agonize over Tyre.

6Pass the news on to Tarshish;

wail, people in distant places.

7Is this your joyous city

that originated in antiquity

and colonized distant lands?		Is 23:1-7

8Who planned this against Tyre, the granter of crowns,

whose merchants were princes,

whose traders the world honored?

9The LORD of Hosts planned it to dampen the pride of all beauty,

to humble the honored in the world.

10Tyre’s land has been flooded like the Nile, Tarshish;

its defenses are gone.

11The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea

and shaken the kingdoms;

he has commanded to demolish Phoenicia’s fortresses.

12He said, “You won’t celebrate anymore,

crushed virgin of Sidon;

even if you escape to Cyprus,

you won’t find rest.”		Is 23:8-12

13Look at the land of the Babylonians; it’s gone. The Assyrians delivered it to the desert animals; they erected siege ramps, stripped its palaces, and reduced it to ruins.

14Wail, ships of Tarshish;

the harbor you sailed to has been destroyed.

15Tyre will pass from memory for 70 years, the lifetime of one king. Then it will come back to life like the woman in “The Song of the Prostitute”:

16“Take your harp and walk the streets,

forgotten prostitute;

pluck the strings skillfully and sing your songs

so they’ll remember you again.”

17After 70 years the LORD will revisit Tyre. It’ll go back to playing the prostitute with kingdoms everywhere. 18In the end, her pay won’t be saved up or hoarded; it will be set aside to feed and dress the LORD’s priests.		Is 23:13-18

Devastation of the Earth

24:1The LORD is laying the earth waste, defacing its surface, scattering its residents. 2People and priests, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors—everyone will be affected. 3The earth will be completely despoiled because the LORD said so. 4The earth withers, and its people waste away, even its high-ranking ones, 5because they’ve polluted it by sinning against God’s laws, statutes, and everlasting covenant. 6So a curse devastates the earth, and its people have to pay for their guilt. They’re burned; there aren’t many left.                        	Is 24:1-6

7There’s no new wine to drink;

the grapevines have dried up;

the light-hearted sigh.

8Celebrating with tambourines has stopped;

the noise from revelers has ceased;

happiness with harps has disappeared.

9They don’t drink wine and sing;

alcohol tastes bitter.

10The city in chaos has broken-down walls;

its houses are boarded up to keep intruders out.	Is 24:7-10

11Stragglers in the streets holler for wine;

joy has turned to gloom;

happiness has vanished.

12The city’s in ruins;

its gates are battered down.

13That’s the way it is in the rural areas too—

as when they shake the olive tree

or glean for grapes.	Is 24:11-13

14But a few raise their voices and shout for joy;

they shout from the west about the majesty of the LORD.

15So honor him in the east,

the God of Israel in lands beyond the sea.

16In the distance we hear singing,

“Honor to the Righteous One.” 			Is 24:14-16

But I say, “Misfortune awaits me! Misfortune awaits me!

The devious deal deviously, so deviously!”

17Terror, pit, and snare threaten you,

people of the earth;

18the one that runs from terror

falls in a pit;

the one that climbs out of the pit

gets caught in a snare.					Is 24:17-18a

The windows in the sky rain down destruction;

the foundations of the earth quake.

19The earth breaks into pieces;

earthquakes split it apart

and shake it violently.

20It staggers like a drunk;

it leans like a shack

because its sins press heavily against it;

it will fall over permanently.

21At that time, the LORD will punish the gods in the sky above

and the kings on the earth below.

22They’ll be rounded up

like prisoners in a dungeon and finally punished,

23The moon will fade,

and the sun will lose its brightness

compared to the LORD of hosts,

who will reign on Zion

and display his glory to his people’s leaders.	Is 24:18b-23

Praise for Judgment and Salvation

25:1LORD, you’re my God.

I’ll honor and thank you

for doing the wonderful things you planned long ago.

2You’ve reduced fortified towns to ruble;

the foreigners’ palaces will never be rebuilt.

3So strong people will honor you;

towns in ruthless nations will come to revere you,

4because you’ve defended the helpless

and needy in their despair;

you’re a shelter from the storm and a shade from heat,

because the breath of ruthless people

is like a storm beating on a wall

5or stifling heat in drought.

You weaken the threats of foreigner powers

like a cloud’s shadow lessens heat;

the raucous war songs of the ruthless fall silent. 	Is 25:1-5

6On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will hold a lavish banquet for everybody in the world, a banquet of aged wine and choice meat. 7Here he’ll remove the shadow that lies over every country, the veil that covers the nations. 8He’ll swallow up death for all time, wipe away everyone’s tears, and remove the abuse of his people everywhere. The LORD has said so.

9At that time, people will say, “This is the God we’ve waited for to save us. He’s the LORD; let’s celebrate and be glad he’s done it.” 10His hand will rest on this mountain, and Moab will be trodden down like straw in the urine of a manure pit. 11He’ll subdue Moab like a swimmer pushes down water. He’ll end its pride and slight-of-hand. 12He’ll bring down its impregnable fortifications and throw them on the ground.	Is 25:6-12

A Song of Praise to the LORD

26:1At that time, they’ll sing a song in Judah:

We have an impregnable city;

it’s set up with secure walls and ramparts.

2Open the gates so a good nation can enter,

one that stays faithful.

3You keep steadfast minds in perfect peace

because they trust in you.

4Trust in the LORD forever

because in him we have an everlasting Rock.

5He brings down low the ones that live up high

in their “safe city”;

he throws it to the ground.

6The poor and helpless trample it.				Is 26:1-6

7The road for the righteous is not rough;

Righteous One, level out our path.

8We conform our way to your judgments, LORD;

with all our heart we want to honor you.

9At night I long for you;

my spirit looks for you earnestly;

when the earth experiences your judgments,

its people learn goodness.

10Even if sinners receive grace,

they don’t learn goodness;

they keep dealing unjustly in an unjust land

and don’t sense the LORD’s majesty. 	Is 26:7-10

11LORD, you’re holding up your fist, but they don’t see it;

show them your zeal for your people;

humble your adversaries;

consume them with fire.

12You’ll establish peace for us,

since you’re the One that actually does for us

everything we try to do.

13Other lords have ruled us before,

but you’re the only one we acknowledge.

14Those dead rulers won’t live again;

their departed spirits won’t rise.

You’ve punished them with destruction,

and wiped out any memory of them.

15You’ve made this nation great

and extended its borders; we honor you.	Is 26:11-15

16We looked to you in distress,

able only to whisper a prayer,

because you were disciplining us.

17Like a pregnant woman at delivery time,

she writhes and cries out in labor pains;

that’s how we were before you, LORD.

18We’ve been pregnant, writhing in labor,

but nothing came of it;

we couldn’t save the world

or bring life into it.

19But even your dead will live again; their corpses will rise;

those who lie in the dust will wake up and sing for joy.

Your light will fall on them like dew,

and the ground will give birth to their departed spirits.

Is 26:16-19

Deliverance for Israel

20Go home, my people,

and lock the doors behind you;

hide for a while

till the LORD’s anger has run its course.

21The LORD is coming from heaven

to punish people for their sin;

the ground will show those whose blood’s been shed;

it won’t any longer be able to hide its slain.	Is 26:20-21

27:1At that time, the LORD will punish Leviathan with his fierce, big strong sword, Leviathan the swift, slithering snake. He’ll kill the dragon that’s in the sea.

2Then,

“There’ll be a delightful vineyard to sing about!

3I, the LORD, will be its keeper;

I’ll water it constantly

and guard it day and night so no one harms it.

4I won’t be angry anymore.

If anybody gives me briars and thorns in battle,

I’ll trample and burn them completely

5unless they rely on me for protection.

Let them make peace with me;

let them make peace with me.”	Is 27:1-5

6In time to come, Jacob will take root;

Israel will sprout and blossom,

and fill the world with fruit.

7Has the LORD struck Israel

the way he struck Israel’s strikers?

Has he slain Israel

the way he slew Israel’s slayers?

8No, he contended with Israel by banishing them,

expelling them with his fierce east wind.

9So that’s how he’ll purge Jacob’s iniquity;

that’s what pardoning its sin will cost,

when God makes pagan altar stones like pulverized chalk,

when he leaves no Asherah pole or incense altar standing.

10The fortified towns will be deserted,

their houses empty as in open country;

calves will graze there and bed down;

they’ll chew on brush and branches there.

11When those branches dry up, they’ll break off

and women will gather them for kindling;

this nation doesn’t use any sense;

so their Maker won’t show them any mercy;

their Creator won’t be gracious to them.	Is 27:6-11

12Yet in time, Israel, the LORD will start gleaning from the Euphrates River to the River of Egypt and gather you up one by one. 13A large trumpet will blow, and the exiles who were perishing in Assyria and Egypt will come to Jerusalem to worship the LORD on his holy mountain.					Is 27:12-13

An Oracle About Samaria

28:1Misfortune awaits the proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks,

the fading flower of its glorious beauty,

Samaria, that’s at the head of the fertile valley

of those drunk with wine.

2The LORD has a strong and powerful military agent;

he’ll throw Samaria down on the ground

like a hail storm, destructive gale, overwhelming flood.

3The proud crown of Ephraim’s drunks will get tramped on;

4the fading flower of its glorious beauty

that’s at the head of the fertile valley,

will be like the first-ripe fig of summer:

as soon as it’s seen, it’s picked and eaten.	Is 28:1-4

5At a later time, the LORD of Hosts will finally become Israel’s crown instead,

a beautiful diadem for his remnant people.

6He’ll give their judges a desire to render justice

and their soldiers the courage to repel onslaughts at the gates.

7But for now the priests and prophets

reel with wine and stagger from alcohol,

reeling while having visions,

staggering while rendering verdicts.

8Their tables are covered with vomit;

there’s filth everywhere.	Is 28:5-8

9Yet they say, “Who’s the LORD think he’s going to teach?

Who’s he going to explain the message to?

Are we little kids just weaned from milk,

just taken from the breast?

10They say that because he tells them over and over,

“Precept on precept,

line on line;

here a little, there a little.”

11So instead, he’ll have to speak to his people

in a foreigner’s language.

12He told them, “Here’s a place for the weary to rest,”

but they ignored him.

13So the LORD will keep on lining out his message to them,

“Precept on precept,

line on line;

here a little, there a little”;

till they stumble and fall backward,

broken, snared, and captured.	Is 28:9-13

14So listen to the LORD’s message,

you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem:

15“You try to tell yourselves,

‘We’ve made a deal with death,

a treaty with Sheol;

the overwhelming scourge won’t trample us

when it comes along;

we can lie our way out of danger

and hide behind deceit.’”

16But the Lord GOD says,

“I’m laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone,

a precious cornerstone for a firm foundation;

nothing that’s built on it will shift out of place.

17I’ll make justice the measuring line

and goodness the level;

hail will sweep away your refuge in lies,

and water will flood your hiding place.

18I’ll undo your deal with death

and annul your treaty with Sheol;

when the overwhelming scourge comes along,

it will trample you. 	Is 28:14-18

19It’ll seize you again and again;

morning after morning it will come through

and at any time day or night.

That will mean pure terror for you

once you get what that means.”

20The bed you’ve built is too short to stretch out on;

your blanket’s too narrow to cover up with.

21The LORD will come like he did at Mount Perazim;

he’ll show his anger like he did in the Valley of Gibeon.

He’ll do his unexpected task

and accomplish his extraordinary work.

22Don’t carry on like scoffers;

he’ll tighten your bonds even more.

I’ve heard from the Lord GOD of hosts

about his decree to destroy the whole region. Is 28:19-22

23Listen to my question.

24When it’s planting time,

does a farmer keep on plowing,

keep breaking up ground and harrowing it?

25Doesn’t he smooth it out,

sow dill and scatter cummin,

plant wheat in rows,

and broadcast barley and rye in their plots

26because his God has taught him how to do it?

27A farmer doesn’t thresh dill with a sledge

or drive a cart wheel over cummin;

he beats out dill and cummin with a stick.

28Does he crush grain for bread?

No, he doesn’t keep threshing it over and over;

the cart wheel and horses’ hooves would ruin it.

29That goes for the LORD of Hosts too,

who made his advice wonderful

and his wisdom great. 			Is 28:23-29

An Oracle About Jerusalem

29:1“Misfortune awaits you, Ariel, city where David camped!

Year after year, you observe the festivals on schedule.

2Yet I’ll bring disaster on you, Ariel;

you’ll lament and mourn;

you’ll be to me what Ariel means [blood-covered altar].

3I’ll camp against you all the way around

and set up siege works and battle towers.

4You’ll be brought low;

you’ll speak from the ground

where you lie prostrate;

you’ll speak like a spirit conjured up from the dirt,

like a whisper from the grave.	Is 29:1-4

5“But suddenly your many enemies

will be like fine dust blown away,

ruthless attackers like chaff

gone with a gust of wind.

6The LORD of Hosts will visit you

with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise,

with whirlwind, storm, and consuming fire.

7The nations that carry on war with you, Ariel,

that attack your fortresses,

will vanish like a dream at night.

8They’ll be like hungry people that dream they’re eating,

but wake up still hungry;

or thirsty people that dream they’re drinking,

but wake up fainting from thirst.

That’s how it will be with the countries

that attack Mount Zion.”		Is 29:5-8

9But you linger and wait and blind yourselves.

You’re drunk, but not with wine;

you’re staggering, but not from alcohol;

10that’s because the LORD has poured a sleeping spirit over you;

he’s shut your eyes, prophets,

and covered your heads, seers.

11-12This whole vision won’t mean much to you, either because it’s a sealed scroll to you or because you can’t read. Literate or not, you won’t get it.	         Is 29:9-12

13So the LORD says,

“These people come near with their mouth

and honor me with their lips,

but their hearts are somewhere else;

their respect for me consists of

memorizing human rules.

14So I’ll surprise these hypocrites once again

with something awesome and amazing;

the wisdom of the wise will perish;

the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear. Is 29:13-14

15“Misfortune awaits people that try to hide

their intentions from me,

who do things in the dark

and think I can’t see them.

16You’ve got things turned around!

Is a potter treated like clay

so that what’s made says to its maker,

‘You didn’t make me’;

or what’s formed says to the one that formed it,

“You don’t know what you’re doing’”?	Is 29:15-16

17Isn’t it just a little while

till Lebanon becomes a fertile field

and the fertile field becomes a forest?

18At that time, the deaf will hear the message from the scroll;

the blind will see through the gloom and darkness;

19the humble will have fresh happiness in the LORD;

the needy will celebrate in the Holy One of Israel.

20Ruthless people will come to nothing;

scoffers won’t scoff anymore;

those intent on creating disorder will be destroyed—

21people that slander,

that try to entrap the judge in court,

that defraud the innocent with sophistry. 	Is 29:17-21

22So the LORD that redeemed Abraham says of Jacob’s house,

“They won’t feel ashamed anymore

or turn pale with fear.

23When they see their descendants around them,

the work of my hands,

they’ll treat me as holy

and stand in awe of me.

24The ignorant will know the truth;

the stubborn will accept instruction.” 	Is 29:22-24

No Help from Egypt

30:1The LORD says, “Misfortune awaits rebellious children

that carry out plans, but not mine,

that make alliances, but not by my Spirit,

and thereby pile sin on top of error;

2children that go down to Egypt to get help instead of consulting me,

to take refuge in Pharaoh’s safety,

to look for shelter under Egypt’s shadow.

3The safety that comes from Pharaoh will humiliate them;

the shelter under Egypt’s shadow will disgrace them.

4Their princes may be at Zoan,

their ambassadors may arrive at Hanes,

5but they’ll all be disgraced

by a people that can’t help them,

but bring shame and dishonor.”	Is 30:1-5

6Oracle About Animals in the Negev

Through a land of distress and anguish—

where lions and lionesses,

vipers and poisonous snakes live—

a caravan transports their wealth on the backs of donkeys,

their treasure on the humps of camels.

They’re taking tribute to a nation that can’t help them,

7to Egypt, “Harmless Rahab [Dragon],” as I describe it.

Is 30:6-7

Warning to Judah

8Go write this on a scroll

so it can serve as a lasting testimony.

9This is a rebellious nation,

unfaithful children that refuse to hear the LORD’s instruction,

10that say to seers, “Don’t see visions,”

that tell prophets, “Don’t prophesy what’s true.

Say pleasant things;

prophesy illusions.

11Get off the road, turn away from the beaten path;

we don’t want to hear any more

about the Holy One of Israel.”                      Is 30:8-11

12This is what the Holy One of Israel says,

“Since you’ve rejected that message

and relied on oppression and perversion,

13your sin is like a bulge in a wall

that’s ready to collapse.

14It will fall like a smashed clay pot

so completely shattered that not a sherd of it

can take coals from a hearth

or dip water from a well.”	Is 30:12-14

Blessings for the LORD’s People

15This is what the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, says,

“Only in repenting and resting in me will you be saved;

your strength lies in quietness and trust.

But you didn’t want to do that.

16You said, ‘No, we’ll flee on horses brought from Egypt.’

You’ll flee all right!

‘We’ll ride on fast horses.’

Your pursuers will ride fast too!

17A thousand will flee at the threat of one;

you’ll all run at the threat of five,

till you’re abandoned like a flagpole on a mountaintop,

like a signal on a hill.”	Is 30:15-17

18The LORD wants to be gracious to you;

he waits on high to show you mercy

because he’s a just God.

How blessed they are who wait for him to help.	Is 30:18

19People in Zion, residents of Jerusalem, don’t cry; he’ll be gracious to you. When he hears you cry out to him for help, he’ll answer. 20Although he’s given you adversity for food and suffering for water, your Teacher won’t hide any longer; you’ll see him. 21When you swerve to left or right, you’ll hear a voice behind you, “This is the way; walk here.” 22You’ll defile your carved images overlaid with silver, your molten images plated with gold. You’ll thrown them out like filthy rags and say, “Get them out of here!”

23Then he’ll give you rain for the seed you sow and bread from the yield. It’ll be rich and abundant. Your livestock will have plenty of pasture. 24Your oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder winnowed with fork and shovel. 25After the great slaughter of your enemies when the towers fall, on every tall mountain and tall hill, there’ll be streams of water running down. 26Moonlight will be like sunlight, and sunlight will be seven times brighter—a week’s worth a day—when the LORD sets his people’s fractures and heals the bruises he’s inflicted on them.    					Is 30:19-26

27The LORD will come from a remote place

with burning anger and thick smoke.

His lips will be full of indignation,

his tongue a consuming fire,

28his breath an overflowing torrent neck deep.

He’ll sift out the nations in his sieve

and put a bridle in their mouths to ride them to ruin.

29But you’ll sing songs at night like you do at the holy festivals. You’ll celebrate like you do when you march to a flute as pilgrims and go up to the mountain of the LORD, the Rock of Israel. 30He will make his majestic voice heard and bring down his arm in lightning, cloudbursts, and downpours with hailstones. 31The Assyrians will panic when they hear him strike with his rod. 32Every punishing blow he lays on them will be to the accompaniment of tambourines and harps. He’ll fight them in battles and brandish his weapons. 33Topheth has long been ready, prepared for the Assyrian king. The LORD has made it deep and wide, a pyre with plenty of wood. His breath like a lava stream of sulfur will light it.       	Is 30:27-33

Warning to Those Who Rely on Egypt

31:1Misfortune lies ahead for those who go down to Egypt for help,

who rely on horses,

that trust in chariots because they are many

and in horsemen because they are strong,

instead of looking to the Holy One of Israel,

instead of consulting the LORD!

2He’s wise and brings disaster

and doesn’t take back what he says;

he rises up at the sinful and their helpers.

3Egyptians are people, not God;

their horses are flesh, not spirit.

So the LORD will hold out his fist,

and the one that helps them will stumble,

the one that’s helped will fall.

They’ll meet their end together.	Is 31:1-3

4The LORD says to me,

“Like a young lion growls over its prey

and shepherds’ shouts don’t scare it away,

I’ll come down

to wage war on Mount Zion.

5Like a hovering bird I’ll guard Jerusalem,

protect and deliver it,

spare and rescue it.”	Is 31:4-5

6Come back to the One you’ve rebelled against, Israel, 7and throw away the silver and gold idols you’ve made.

8“The Assyrians will fall by a sword that’s not human;

a sword that’s not human will devour them.

They won’t escape,

and their young soldiers will become slaves.

9Their ‘rock’ will pass away in panic;

their princes will desert the standard,”

the LORD says, whose fire is in Zion,

whose furnace is Jerusalem.	Is 31:6-9

Israel’s Ultimate Deliverance

32:1A righteous king is coming;

his princes will rule honestly.

2Each will provide a refuge from the wind,

a shelter from the storm,

a stream of water in the desert,

the shade of a big tree in parched land.

3Then the seeing will perceive;

the hearing will listen.

4The rash will use good judgment;

stuttering tongues will speak fluently.	Is 32:1-4

5Fools won’t be called noble anymore;

rogues won’t be considered generous;

6because fools speak nonsense;

they’re inclined to practice ungodliness,

to lie about the LORD,

to keep hungry people hungry,

and deprive the thirsty of a drink.

7Their methods are evil;

they design plots

to destroy the poor with slander

even when the plea of the needy is just.

8But the truly noble make noble plans

and stick with them.	Is 32:5-8

9Get up, women of leisure;

listen, complacent daughters.

10In a little over a year,

trouble will come, complacent daughters;

because the grapes will fail,

the fruit harvest won’t happen.

11Tremble, women of leisure;

shudder, complacent daughters.

Strip down to the skin

and wrap burlap around your waist.	Is 32:9-11

12Beat your breasts for pleasant fields and fruitful vines,

13for joyful houses and happy towns,

for my people’s land, where thorns and thistles grow;

14because the palace will be abandoned,

the populated towns will be empty,

hill and watchtower will become permanent dens,

a delight for wild donkeys,

a pasture for flocks;

15till the Spirit is poured out on us from on high,

till the desert becomes a fertile field,

and the fertile field becomes a forest.	Is 32:12-15

16Then justice will thrive in the countryside;

goodness will grow in the fertile field.

17Goodness will lead to peace

and bring extended calm and confidence.

18Then my people will live undisturbed

in safe houses and peaceful retreats.

19 Though hail flattens the forest

and the city’s leveled,

20you’ll still be blessed who sow near water,

who let livestock and donkeys range free.	Is 32:16-20

An Oracle About Assyria

33:1Misfortune awaits you, destroyers

who haven’t been destroyed yourselves;

misfortune awaits you, treacherous people

that others haven’t treated treacherously.

As soon as you’re done destroying, you’ll be destroyed;

as soon as you’ve finished your treachery,

others will deal treacherously with you.

2LORD, be gracious to us; we’ve waited for you;

be our strength each morning,

our deliverer when trouble comes.

3Let people run from the turmoil you bring;

let nations scatter when you threaten.

4Gather spoil like caterpillars gather

and locusts strip the countryside.

5Honor the LORD because he lives on high;

he’s filled Zion with justice and goodness.

6Later he’ll provide you stability,

a wealth of salvation, knowledge, and wisdom;

respect for him will be your treasure.	Is 33:1-6

7But for now, your brave men cry in public;

your ambassadors for peace weep bitterly.

8The roads are empty; travel is at a standstill

because the enemy has broken the treaty,

despised towns,

and doesn’t care about their inhabitants.

9The land mourns and pines away;

Lebanon shrivels up with shame.

Sharon has become a desert;

Bashan and Carmel are losing their leaves.

10“So now I’ll stand up and be honored,” the LORD says,

11“You’ve conceived chaff and given birth to stubble;

my breath will consume you like a flame.

12I’ll burn the nations to lime

and destroy cut thorns with fire.	Is 33:7-12

13You that are far off, pay attention to what I’ve done;

you that are near, acknowledge my power.”

14Sinners in Zion have panicked; the godless tremble,

“Who among us can live in this consuming fire

and continual burning?”

15You that conduct yourselves justly and speak truthfully,

who refuse to profit from fraud

and pull your hand back from bribes,

who stop your ears from listening to murderous plots

and shut your eyes from watching evil—

16you’ll live on high;

your refuge will be an impregnable cliff;

you’ll have food enough to eat

and water you can rely on.	Is 33:13-16

17You’ll see the King in his splendor

and look at a land that stretches far and wide.

18You’ll remember your fears from before, and ask,

“Where are the Assyrians that counted our defenses,

numbered our towers,

and added up the spoil?”

19You won’t see those fierce people anymore

whose language nobody could understand.	Is 33:17-19

20Look at Zion that hosts your appointed festivals;

you’ll see that Jerusalem offers a safe place to live,

a tent that won’t blow over,

whose stakes won’t pull up,

whose guy ropes don’t snap.

21The LORD, the Majestic One, will be there for you,

a place with streams and canals,

where no galley will come

or big ship can sail;

22because the LORD your judge, lawgiver, and king

will protect you.	Is 33:20-22

23Your enemies’ tackle is hanging loose;

it can’t hold the mast in place

or keep the sail spread.

As God’s people, you’ll divide the abundant spoil;

even the lame will gather plunder.

24You that live here won’t say, “We’re weak and sick,”

because God will forgive your sin.	Is 33:23-24

An Oracle for the Nations

34:1Come close, nations, and listen!

world and everything in it, pay attention.

2The LORD is furious with the nations and their armies;

he’ll destroy them and deliver them to slaughter.

3Their slain will be thrown out;

their corpses will reek;

their blood will soak the hillsides.

4The stars will fade out;

the sky will roll up like a scroll.

it’ll wither away

like leaves on a grapevine or fig tree.	Is 34:1-4

5“My sword has drunk its fill in the sky;

it will come down in condemnation on Edom,

a nation I’ve devoted to complete destruction.

6My sword will be bloody,

covered with the blood of lambs and goats,

with the fat on the kidneys of rams;

because I’ll hold a sacrifice in Bozrah,

a great slaughter in Edom.

7Wild oxen will fall with them,

male calves and great bulls;

Its ground will be soaked with blood;

its dust will be greasy from fat.”	Is 34:6-7

8The LORD will have a day of vengeance,

a year of payback for what Edom did to Zion.

9Edom’s wadis will run with pitch;

its dirt will become sulfur;

its ground will be covered with burning tar.

10It won’t go out day or night;

its smoke will rise endlessly.

Generation after generation it won’t be inhabited;

nobody will ever travel through it.

11Hawks and hedgehogs will take it over;

owls and ravens will roost there.

God will stretch out a measuring line over it for desolation,

hold a plumb line on it for chaos.	Is 34:8-11

12There won’t be anyone to call king;

no princes, or nobles.

13Thorns will grow in its fortresses;

nettles and thistles will come up in its forts.

It’ll be a haunt for jackals,

a home for owls.

14Desert animals will mix with hyenas;

hairy goats will bleat to one another;

the night monster [Lilith] will settle down to rest there.

15Owls will make nests and lay their eggs there;

they’ll hatch them and gather the brood under their shadow.

Buzzards will gather there in nesting pairs.			Is 34:12-15

16Read about them in the Book of the LORD;

every one is mentioned there with its mate

because he has commanded,

and his Spirit will gather them by kinds in pairs.

17He has surveyed the land

and deeded it over to them forever. 			Is 34:16-17

An Oracle for the Nations

35:1-2The desert wilderness will be happy;

the Arabah will blossom profusely with crocuses,

and sing and celebrate.

It will be as glorious as Lebanon,

as majestic as Carmel and Sharon.

They’ll see the glory of the LORD,

the majesty of our God.

3Strengthen feeble hands;

steady weak knees.

4Say to those with pounding hearts,

“Be strong and not afraid;

your God will avenge you and save you.”

5He’ll open the eyes of the blind

and unplug the ears of the deaf.	Is 35:1-5

6The lame will leap like a deer,

and the mute will shout for joy,

because water will gush out into the wilderness,

and streams will water the desert.

7Parched land will become a marsh;

springs will moisten the thirsty ground;

The jackals’ dens will become a swamp.

grass will give way to reeds and rushes.

8There’ll be a new highway there

called The Highway of Holiness.

9Lions won’t lurk along it;

vicious animals won’t hunt by it.

Such as those won’t live there,

but the redeemed will walk on it.

10The ones the LORD ransoms will return to Zion

with happy shouts and crowned with everlasting joy.

They’ll find happiness and joy;

sorrow and sighing will fade away.	Is 35:6-10

Sennacherib Invades Judah

36:1In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked the fortified towns in Judah and took them. 2He sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large army. They took position by the aqueduct to the upper pool on the road to the Fuller’s Field. 3Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna, the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went out to meet them.

4The Rabshakeh said,

“Tell Hezekiah the great king of Assyria says, ‘What’s this confidence you claim to have? 5Empty talk can’t substitute for military strategy and power. Who are you depending on when you rebel against me? 6Are you depending on Egypt as a staff? If you lean on that splintering reed, it’ll puncture your hand. That’s the way Pharaoh operates with everybody that depends on him. 7If you tell me you’re trusting in the LORD your God, isn’t he the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has closed down, and made Judah and Jerusalem worship at this altar in Jerusalem? 8Come on, make a deal with my master: I’ll give you 2,000 horses if you can put riders on them. 9Can you drive off even the least of my master’s contingents even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and cavalry? 10Anyway, haven’t I actually come up at the LORD’s behest to destroy this place? He’s told me to attack this land and destroy it.’”           	Is 36:1-10

11Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the Rabshakeh, “Speak in Aramaic; we understand it. Don’t speak in Hebrew. There are people listening on the wall.”

12But he shouted in Hebrew,

“Has my master just sent me to you and your master with this message? Hasn’t he also sent me to those people sitting on the wall that are doomed to eat their own feces and drink their own urine with you?        	Is 36:11-12

13“Listen to what the great king of Assyria says, 14‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; he can’t deliver you. 15Don’t let him make you trust in the LORD, “The LORD will deliver us. This city won’t be delivered to the king of Assyria.” 16Don’t listen to him.  Surrender and come out to me. Eat from your own grapevines and fig trees, and drink water from your own cisterns, 17till I come and take you away to a land like yours, a land with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards. 18Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you. Have any of the nations’ gods delivered their lands from the king of Assyria? 19Where are the gods of Hamath, Arpad, and Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from me? 20Will the LORD deliver Jerusalem from me?’”

21But they didn’t answer him; the king told them not to. 22They went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in despair and told him what the Rabshakeh said. 	Is 36:13-21

Hezekiah Seeks Isaiah’s Help

37:1When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, put on burlap, and went to the Temple. 2He sent Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah. 3They went to him and said,

“Hezekiah says, ‘This is a distressing, discouraging, dejecting day. Babies have come due, but there’s no strength to deliver them. 4Maybe the LORD your God has heard the Rabshakeh that the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God. Maybe he’ll reprove him for it. Pray for the remnant that’s left.’” [5]

6Isaiah said,

“Tell your master the LORD says, ‘You don’t need to be afraid of what the Assyrian king’s messengers have blasphemed. 7I’ll make him believe a rumor and go back home. He’ll fall by the sword there.’”	Is 37:1-7

8Meantime, the Rabshakeh went back and found the king of Assyria fighting Libnah, because he’d heard he’d left Lachish. 9The king had heard that Tirhakah [Taharqa], king of Nubia, had set out to fight him. When the Rabshakeh heard it, he sent ambassadors back to Hezekiah:

10“Don’t let the god you trust in deceive you into thinking Jerusalem won’t fall. 11You’ve heard that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries. Are you going to be spared? 12Did their gods deliver Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, the Edenites in Telassar? 13Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Hena, Ivvah, or the city of Sepharvaim?” 	Is 37:8-13

14Hezekiah read the letter, then went up to the Temple and unrolled it in the LORD’s presence. 15He prayed,

16“LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are God over the kingdoms. You made earth and sky. 17Incline your ear and hear, open your eyes and see. Listen to what Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God. 18Assyria’s kings have devastated all the nations and their lands. 19They’ve thrown their gods into the fire because they were just hand-made pieces of wood and stone. 20But now, LORD our God, deliver us from the one that destroyed those kingdoms so the world can know that you alone are God.” 	Is 37:14-20

Isaia Predicts Israel’s Deliverance

21Then Isaiah sent word to Hezekiah,

“The LORD God of Israel says, ‘Because you prayed to me about Sennacherib, 22 I have this to say to him:

“The virgin daughter of Zion

despises you and laughs at you;

the young woman of Jerusalem

shakes her head as you flee,	Is 37:21-22

23“Who’ve you been mocking and blaspheming?

Who’d you raise your voice at

and roll your eyes about?

The Holy One of Israel!

24You mocked the Lord through your messengers:

‘I came up

to the highest mountains with many chariots,

to the most remote parts of Lebanon;

I cut down its tall cedars, its best cypress;

I reached its highest peak, its deepest forests.

25I’ve dug wells and refreshed myself with their water

and dammed up the rivers in Egypt with my feet.’	Is 37:23-25

26“Haven’t you heard?

I decided that very thing long ago;

I planned it ages back;

now I’m letting you do it

so you’ll turn fortified towns into piles of rubble.

27That’s why the people in them are

so weak, scared, and confused;

they’re as weak as plants in a field,

as grass sprouting on housetops

that’s scorched before it’s grown.

28I know when you sit down,

when you come and go,

when you rage at me.

29Because you raged at me

and I heard your arrogance myself,

I’ll put my hook in your nose,

my bridle in your lips,

and turn you back the way you came.”	Is 37:26-29

30“Hezekiah, I’ll show you what I mean: this year you’ll only eat what volunteers, next year what volunteers from that, but the third year you’ll sow and harvest, tend vineyards and eat their fruit. 31The surviving remnant of the siege in Judah will again take root down and bear fruit up. 32A remnant will go out of Jerusalem, survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will make it happen.”

33The LORD says, “The king of Assyria and his army won’t come into this city or shoot an arrow here. He won’t approach it with a shield or throw a mound up against its walls. 34He’ll go back home the way he came. 35I’ll save this city for my sake and my servant David.”

36The angel of the LORD went out that night and struck 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When people got up early the next morning, the Assyrians were all dead. 37So Sennacherib went home to live in Nineveh. 38As he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrock, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him.		Is 37:30-38

Hezekiah’s Sickness and Recovery

38:1Around that time, Hezekiah got deathly ill, and Isaiah came to tell him, “The LORD says to set your house in order; you’re going to die.”

2Hezekiah turned to the wall and prayed, 3“LORD, please remember how I’ve followed you honestly with all my heart and done what you consider good.” He cried bitterly.

4Then a message from the LORD came to Isaiah:

5“Go back and tell Hezekiah that the LORD God of your ancestor David says, ‘I’ve heard your prayer and seen your tears. I’ll give you 15 more years to live 6and deliver you and this city from the king of Assyria. 7This is the sign that I’ll do what I’ve said: 8I’ll make the shadow on Ahaz’s stairway go back up 10 steps.’”

So it went back up 10 steps. 		Is 38:1-8

9A Writing by Hezekiah, King of Judah,

After His Illness and Recovery

10“In the prime of life,

I was headed for the gates of Sheol,

deprived of the rest of my life.

11I wouldn’t see the LORD again while I was alive

or people in this world.

12Where I live was being blown away

like a shepherd’s tent.

I’ve been rolling up my life like a weaver;

he was cutting me off the loom,

ending my life in one day.

13I called out for help all night;

like a lion he was breaking all my bones,

ending my life.

14I chattered like a swallow and a crane

and moaned like a pigeon;

my weary eyes look up wistfully,

‘Help me, LORD, I’m oppressed.’”	Is 38:9-14

15“What could I say?

You let me know what you’d do and did it;

I couldn’t sleep because of the bitterness.

16LORD, people gain life by hard experiences;

spiritual life comes from them all;

now restore my health so I can live!

17My deep anguish was for my own good;

you’ve kept me from the Pit of destruction.

18Sheol doesn’t thank you; death doesn’t praise you;

those who go down to the Pit

can’t experience hope from your faithfulness.

19Only the living can thank you, as I do today;

from parent to child, they tell about your faithfulness.

20The LORD will surely save me;

so we’ll play my songs on stringed instruments

the rest of our lives in his Temple.”

21Isaiah had said, “Apply fig salve to the boil so he can recover.” 22Hezekiah had asked, “What’s the sign that I’ll go up to the LORD’s Temple?”	Is 38:15-22

Envoys from Babylon

39:1Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah because he’d heard he’d been sick and had recovered. 2That pleased Hezekiah, and he showed the ambassadors everything in his treasure house, the silver and gold, the spices and precious oil, his whole armory, and everything in his royal treasuries. There wasn’t anything in his palace or kingdom that he didn’t show them.          	Is 39:1-2

3Then Isaiah came to ask him, “What did those men say? Where’d they come from?”

“From a distant country, Babylon.”

4“What have they seen in your palace?”

“Everything.”

5Then Isaiah said,

“Listen to a message from the LORD of Hosts: 6‘The time’s coming when everything in your palace, everything your ancestors have stored up, will be carried off to Babylon. 7Some of your sons will be taken and made officials in the palace of its king.’”

8Hezekiah told Isaiah, “That’s a good message you’ve brought from Yahveh.” (He was thinking, “At least there’ll be peace and truth in my time.”)	Is 39:3-8

Comfort for God’s People

40:1“Comfort, comfort my people,” your God says.

2“Speak graciously to Jerusalem;

tell it that its warfare’s over,

its iniquity’s removed,

it’s received from the LORD

double for its sins.”	Is 40:1-2

3A voice is calling,

“Build a road for the LORD in the desert;

make a smooth highway for our God.

4Fill every pothole,

level off every bump and high spot.

Smooth the rough ground

and make rugged terrain like a wide valley.

5Then the glory of the LORD will come;

everyone will see it together.”

The LORD has said so.           Is 40:3-5

6A voice said, “Shout.”

I answered, “Shout what?”

“People are like grass;

their beauty is like a flower in a field.

7Grass withers and flowers fade

when the LORD blows on them;

people are like that.

8Grass withers and flowers fade,

but the LORD’s word stands forever.”	Is 40:6-8

9Climb a high mountain,

Zion, messenger with good news;

shout it out;

shout it louder;

don’t hold back;

tell the towns in Judah, “Your God is coming!”

10He’ll come with power

to rule with his strong arm;

he’ll bring his reward with him.

11He’ll tend his flock like a shepherd;

he’ll pick up the lambs in his arms

and carry them against his chest,

and gently lead the nursing ewes.	Is 40:9-11

12Who else has measured the ocean in the palm of his hand

or the sky with a span,

or counted the dust?

Who else has weighed the mountains in a scales

or the hills in a balance?

13Who has directed the LORD’s Spirit

or instructed him as his advisor?

14Who did he consult for enlightenment?

Who taught him what’s good?

15The nations are just a drop in the bucket,

a piece of sand on a scales;

he picks up islands like specks of dust.

16Lebanon couldn’t provide enough wood

or its animals be sufficient for a burnt offering.

17All the nations amount to nothing in front of him;

they’re of no consequence compared to him.	Is 40:12-17

18Who can we compare God to?

What’s he like?

19An idol is something an artisan makes,

a goldsmith plates with gold,

a silversmith makes silver chains for.

20People too poor for such an offering

select wood that won’t rot

and find a skilled craftsman

to prepare an idol that won’t fall over.	Is 40:18-20

21Haven’t you heard? Don’t you know?

Didn’t anybody tell you at the beginning of the earth that

22the One who sits above the circle of the earth,

whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers to him—

he’s the One that stretches out the sky like a curtain,

spreads it out like a tent to live under.

23He’s the One that dethrones rulers

and unseats judges.

24They’ve hardly been planted,

hardly sown, hardly taken root,

when he blows on them and they wither,

and the wind carries them off like chaff.

25Who can you compare him with;

who’s his equal?

26Look up and see who created those stars,

who leads the host of them out in full number

and calls each one by name;

because of his great power and strength,

not a one of them is missing.	Is 40:21-26

27Jacob, why do you think

the LORD can’t see what you’re going through,

that he doesn’t notice the justice you deserve?

28Don’t you know? Haven’t you heard?

The eternal God, the LORD,

the creator of the earth, doesn’t get tired;

no one can measure his intelligence.

29He gives stamina to the tired

and increases strength in the weak.	Is 40:27-29

30Even youths get weary;

young men collapse exhausted;

31but those who trust in the LORD

keep finding new strength;

they walk and don’t get weary;

they run and don’t get tired;

they soar up on wings like eagles.	Is 40:30-31

God’s Help for Israel

41:1“Lands beyond the sea, come to order and listen;

prepare your case;

step forward and present it;

your case is next on the docket.

2Who has stirred up the king in the east

that he rightly called to his service,

who delivers up nations and subdues kings;

who makes them like dust with his sword,

like wind-driven chaff with his bow;

3who chases them away and passes along safely

on paths he hasn’t walked before?

4Who does such momentous deeds

generation after generation from the beginning till now?

I, the LORD, am the One, 				Is 41:1-4

5“The islands have seen it and fear;

far-off places tremble;

they’re coming; they’re getting close.

6Each one encourages the other, ‘Be strong!’

7So the carver encourages the goldsmith;

the one that shapes with the hammer

encourages the one that beats the anvil,

and says of the soldering, ‘It’s good’;

he fastens it down with nails

so it won’t rock.	Is 41:5-7

8“But you, Israel my servant,

Jacob my chosen,

descendant of Abraham my friend,

9you that I took from a far-off place

and called from the most remote parts

and said, ‘You’re my servant;

I’ve chosen you—

10don’t be afraid, I’m with you;

don’t look around discouraged; I’m your God;

I’ll encourage you and help you;

you can count on me to hold you up

with my righteous right hand.’	Is 41:8-10

11All who are incensed at you will be disgraced;

anybody that opposes you will perish.

12You’ll look around for people in conflict with you

and won’t find any;

any who attack you won’t exist anymore,

13because I’m the LORD your God

that holds you up,

that tells you,

‘Don’t be afraid, I’ll help you.’	Is 41:11-13

14So don’t be afraid, Jacob you worm, you people in Israel;

I’ll help you,” the LORD says;

“Your rescuer is the Holy One of Israel.

15I’ll make you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with teeth;

you’ll thresh the mountains and pulverize them

and grind the hills into chaff.

16You’ll winnow them, the wind will blow them away,

the storm will scatter them;

but you’ll celebrate in the LORD

and take pride in the Holy One of Israel.	Is 41:14-16

17“The poor and needy are looking for water,

but there isn’t any;

their tongues are parched with thirst;

I, the LORD, will answer them myself;

as the God of Israel, I won’t abandon them.

18I’ll make creeks run in the barren hills

and open up springs in the valleys below;

I’ll make the desert a lake of water

and turn dry land into fountains.	Is 41:17-18

19In the desert I’ll put cedars and acacia trees,

myrtles and olive trees;

I’ll plant junipers there

along with box trees and cypress trees.

20I’ll do that so people can recognize

that I’ve done it;

the Holy One of Israel has created it.	Is 41:19-20

21“Present your case for your idols,” the LORD says;

“bring forward your strong proofs,”

the King of Jacob says.

22“Predict for us what’s going to happen;

tell us what happened before

so we can connect them with their outcome

and learn what those outcomes will be.

23State what the future holds

so we can tell you are gods;

do anything—good or bad—

so we can look around and be scared together.

24You aren’t anything; you can’t do anything;

anybody that chooses you is pathetic.	Is 41:21-24

25“I’ve stirred up a leader from the north;

he answers me from the rising sun;

he’ll come on rulers like on mortar,

like a potter treading clay.”

26Who predicted this from the start,

so we could know about it?

Who said it in former times,

so we could say, ‘He was right’?

Nobody said anything;

nobody heard any god say a word.	Is 41:25-26

27“I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Help’s coming,’

and Jerusalem, ‘I’ve got good news.’

28But when I look,

there’s no advisor among them;

if I ask them, who can answer?

29They’re all fake;

they don’t do anything;

molten images are wind and hot air.	Is 41:27-29

The Servant of the LORD

42:1“My Servant that I uphold,

my Chosen One I delight in,

I’ve put my Spirit on him;

he’ll bring righteousness to the Gentiles.

2He won’t holler or be boisterous;

he won’t make a racket in the streets.

3He won’t break a bruised reed

or put out a flickering wick;

he’ll faithfully render justice.

4He won’t falter or lose heart;

he’ll establish justice on earth;

distant lands will rely on his instruction.” 	Is 42:1-4

5God, Yahveh, says—

who created the sky and stretched it out,

who made the earth and what comes from it,

who gives breath to the people on it

and spirit to those who walk in it—

6“I’m Yahveh; I’ve called you to demonstrate my goodness;

I’ll hold you by the hand and watch over you.

I’ll appoint you to be a covenant for the people,

a light for the Gentiles

7to open the eyes of the blind,

to free prisoners from dungeons

and those living in darkness from prison.

8I’m Yahveh; that’s my name.

I won’t share my honor with anyone else

or my praise with carved images.

9My former prophecies have already happened;

now I’m prophesying new ones;

I’ll tell you about them before they occur.” 	Is 42:5-9

A Song of Praise to the LORD

10Sing a new song to Yahveh;

sing his praise from the ends of the earth,

you that sail the ocean,

you distant lands and people that live there!

11Let the desert towns join the chorus,

the villages where Kedar lives;

let the people of Sela sing for joy

and shout from the mountaintops.

12Let them honor Yahveh

and declare his praise in distant lands.

13He will rush out like a soldier

and stir up his fury like a warrior;

he’ll raise his battle cry

and prevail over his enemies.	Is 42:10-13

14“I’ve kept quiet,” God says, “and restrained myself for a long time;

now like a woman in labor, I’ll groan and gasp and pant.

15I’ll make mountains and hills desolate

and wither their vegetation;

I’ll turn rivers into wadis

and dry up the ponds.

16I’ll lead the blind on a new road,

guide them in unfamiliar paths;

I’ll make darkness into light ahead of them

and make rough places smooth;

I’ll do these things;

I won’t leave them undone.

17I’ll drive back and completely disgrace

those who trust in idols

and say to molten images, ‘You’re our gods.’	Is 42:14-17

Israel Deaf and Blind

18“Listen, you deaf;

look, you blind.

19Who is as blind as my servant,

as deaf as my messenger?

Who is as blind as my chosen people,

as blind as Yahveh’s servant?

20You look at many things, but don’t see;

your ears are open, but you don’t listen.”

21Because he’s good, Yahveh was pleased

to make his Law great and glorious.

22But his people have been robbed and plundered,

trapped in caves and hidden in prisons;

they’ve become prey with no savior,

spoil with nobody to demand, “Give them back!”

Is 42:18-22

23Who among you will learn from the past?

Who will listen about the future?

24Who gave Jacob up for spoil and Israel to plunderers?

Wasn’t it Yahveh that you’ve sinned against,

whose ways you wouldn’t follow,

whose Law you didn’t obey?

25So he poured out his hot anger on you in fierce warfare

and enveloped you in flames;

you didn’t catch on, and it burned you;

you didn’t take it to heart.	Is 42:23-25

Israel’s Only Savior

43:1But this is what the LORD your creator says, Jacob,

the One that formed you, Israel,

“You don’t need to be afraid, because I’ve redeemed you

and called you by name. You’re mine!

2When you pass through the sea, I’m with you;

when you cross rivers, they won’t flood over you;

when you walk through fire, the flame won’t burn you;

3because I’m the LORD your God,

the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.

I’ve given Egypt to ransom you,

Nubia and Seba in exchange for you.	Is 43:1-3

4Since you’re precious to me,

since you’re honored and I love you,

I’ll trade other people in return for you,

others in exchange for your life.

5You don’t need to be afraid, because I’m with you;

I’ll bring your offspring from the east and west.

6I’ll say to the north, ‘Give them up!’

and to the south, ‘Quit holding onto them.’

Bring my sons and daughters from distant countries—

7everyone that wears my name,

that I’ve created for my honor.”		Is 43:4-7

8Bring out the blind, though they have eyes,

and the deaf, though they have ears.

9Gather the nations; assemble the peoples.

Which of their idols can tell about the past?

They need to present witnesses to justify themselves

that what they say is true.

10“You’re my witnesses, Israel,” the LORD says,

“the servant I’ve chosen

so you can know me and believe me,

and understand that I’m the only One;

no god ever existed before me;

none will exist after me.

11I’m the LORD;

there’s no Savior but me.

12I’m the One that predicted it, did it, and proclaimed it

before there was any foreign god among you;

so you’re my witnesses,” the LORD says;

“I’m God.

13From eternity I’m God;

No one can take anyone away from me;

no one can undo what I do.”	Is 43:8-13

The LORD’s Promised Victory

14This is what the LORD your Rescuer says,

“To help you, I’ll dispatch an army against Babylon

to drive them out as refugees

in the ships they’re proud of;

the Babylonians’ celebration will turn into mourning.

15I’m your King, Israel’s Creator,

16who made a path through the Red Sea,

a road through the flood,

17who brought out in Egypt horse and chariot,

army and soldier.

They all lay down at the same time, drowned,

snuffed out like a flickering wick. 	Is 43:14-17

18But don’t just recall those former things

or ponder the past.

19Duly note something new I’m doing now;

it’s happening; see it?

I’m making, like before, a highway in the wilderness,

streams in the desert.

20Wild animals will honor me,

jackals and owls;

because I’ve put water in the wilderness

and streams in the desert

so my people can drink.

21The people I created for myself at that time

will one day declare my praise worldwide.	Is 43:18-21

22“Yet recently you haven’t called on me for help, Jacob;

you’re tired of me, Israel.

23You haven’t brought me the sheep for your burnt offerings

or honored me with your sacrifices,

though I haven’t burdened you down with offerings

or worn you out with incense.

24You haven’t bought any calamus for me

or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.

Instead, you’ve burdened me down with your sins;

I’m tired of your iniquities.	Is 43:22-24

25“I, yes, I am the One that will erase

your transgressions for my own sake

and not hold onto your sin against me.

26Remember me; let’s debate our case together;

state your evidence for being innocent.

27But from the time of your first ancestor

through your subsequent leaders,

you’ve sinned against me.

28So I profaned the priests of the sanctuary;

I delivered Jacob to total destruction

and Israel to lasting contempt.	Is 43:25-28

44:1“But listen now, Jacob my servant,

Israel my chosen one.

2This is what the LORD says who created you

and formed you from the womb,

who will help you:

‘Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant,

Jeshurun my chosen one.

3As I’ll pour out water on thirsty ground

to make streams on desert land,

I’ll also pour out my Spirit on your offspring

and bless your descendants;

4they’ll thrive like well-watered grass,

like poplars beside streams.

5This one will say, “I belong to the LORD”;

that one will wear Jacob’s name;

others will write on their hand, “Belonging to the LORD,”

and name Israel’s God with honor.’”	Is 44:1-5

The Folly of Idols

6This is what the King of Israel says,

its Redeemer, the LORD of Hosts,

“I’m the first and last;

there’s no God but me.

7Who is like me? Speak up;

recount things to me in sequence

from the time I created this ancient nation;

then tell that nation what’s going to happen to them.

8 Don’t tremble in fear;

haven’t I announced it to you long ago?

You’re my witnesses.

Is there any God but me?

Is there any other Rock?

I don’t know of a one.”	Is 44:6-8

9Those who carve idols don’t accomplish anything because their precious objects can’t do anything. Their worshippers don’t know that; so they’ll be put to shame. 10Who but fools make their own gods and then worship them? 11The craftsmen are mere mortals. They’ll all gather with the worshipers, take their stand, and go down in terror and infamy.

12A blacksmith shapes iron into a cutting tool over coals in his forge. He beats it with hammers till he gets hungry and weak, thirsty and tired. 13Then a carver shapes a block of wood, stretches out a measuring line on it, and draws a pattern on it with red chalk. He works it with chisels and planes to look like a beautiful human figure to set in a little shrine in somebody’s house. 14He cuts down a cedar, takes a cypress or oak, and plants a fir tree in the woods, and the rain makes it grow. 15-16It becomes something he can burn. So he burns half of it to warm himself up and say “Ah, I’m warm; the heat feels good.” Or he bakes bread and eats a roast and is satisfied. 17He carves the other half into an image, his god. He falls down to it, worships it, and prays to it, “Deliver me, my god.” 	                      Is 44:9-17

18They don’t understand because God has glazed over their eyes so they can’t see, and closed their minds so they can’t think. 19The one that made it doesn’t stop to reflect,

“I burned half of it to bake bread and roast meat;

I worshiped the other half!”

20He eats ashes and trusts something that can’t help him. He doesn’t ask, “Am I holding something fake in my hand?”

Restoration for Jerusalem

21“Remember, Jacob and Israel; you’re my servant;

I made you; I won’t forget you.

22I’ve wiped out your transgressions like a dark cloud,

your sins like a heavy morning fog;

come back to me; I’ve redeemed you.”

23Shout for joy, sky, because the LORD made you!

Make a joyful sound, depths of the earth.

Break into singing, mountains, forest, and every tree in them;

the LORD has redeemed Jacob and taken pride in Israel.

Is 44:18-23

24This is what the LORD your Redeemer says

who formed you in the womb,

“I’m the One that made everything:

I stretched out the sky by myself

and spread out the earth.

Who helped me?

25I expose false prophets’ omens

and make fools out of fortunetellers;

I force the wise to eat their words

and turn their “knowledge” into nonsense.	Is 44:24-25

26I carry out my prophets’ predictions

and perform my messengers’ advice;

I’m the One that says Jerusalem will be inhabited

and the towns in Judah will be rebuilt!

27I’m the One that tells the deep ocean to dry up

and its currents to be dry.

28I say about Cyrus, ‘He’s my shepherd!

He’ll do everything I tell him’;

he’ll decree that Jerusalem will be rebuilt

and the Temple foundations will be laid again.”

Is 44:26-28

Cyrus, the LORD’s Chosen One

45:1This is what the LORD says to Cyrus his anointed

whose right hand he’ll empower

to subdue nations and dethrone kings,

to open fortress gates so they won’t be shut:

2“I’ll go ahead of you to level out the mountains,

shatter bronze gates, and cut through their iron bars.

3I’ll give you treasures stored in the dark

and wealth hidden in secret places,

so you’ll know it’s me,

the LORD God of Israel, who calls you by name.

4For the sake of Jacob my servant,

Israel my chosen one,

I’ve called you by name

and given you an honorable title

even though you didn’t know me.	Is 45:1-4

5I’m the LORD; there’s no other;

there’s no God but me.

I’ll arm you for war though you don’t know who I am,

6so people from sunrise to sunset

can know there’s no God but me.

I’m the LORD; there’s no other,

7the LORD that creates light and makes darkness,

that sends peace and brings catastrophe—

I’m the LORD that does all of that.	Is 45:5-7

8“Sky, shower from above;

clouds, rain down goodness;

ground, open up so salvation can sprout

and goodness can spring up from you.

I’m the LORD your creator.	Is 45:8

9“Misfortune awaits the ones that fuss at their Maker

like a clay pot fussing at a potter!

Will a pot say to a potter, ‘What are you doing?’

or ‘What you’re making doesn’t have any handles’?

10Misfortune awaits the baby that says to its father,

‘Why did you beget me?’

or its mother, ‘Why did you have me?’”	Is 45:9-10

11The LORD, the Holy One of Israel and your Maker, says

“Will you question me about my children

or tell me how to do my work?

12I’m the One that made the world and created people in it;

I stretched out the sky and hung the stars there.

13I’ll stir up Cyrus for my righteous purposes

and smooth his paths;

he’ll rebuild my city and free my exiles

without payment or reward.” 	Is 45:11-13

The LORD, the Only Savior

14The LORD says,

“Egyptians, Nubians, and Sabeans—men of stature—

will come in chains and fall down in front of you;

their wealth and merchandise will be yours.

They’ll say to you,

‘God is with you for sure;

there’s nobody else, no other God.’”

15Truly you’re a God that works in mysterious ways,

God of Israel, Savior!

16They’ll be disgraced who manufacture idols;

they’ll go away together in humiliation.

17The LORD will deliver Israel permanently;

Israel won’t ever be put to shame.	Is 45:14-17

18The LORD says—who created the sky,

who made the earth and shaped it,

who didn’t make it waste and void,

but shaped it to be lived in—

“I’m the LORD; there’s no other.

19I haven’t spoken secretly in some dark corner;

I didn’t tell Jacob’s descendants

to look for me in a desolate place;

I’m straightforward

and declare what makes sense.	Is 45:18-19

20“Get together and return;

come near together, refugees from the nations around.

They don’t know what they’re doing

who carry around wooden idols

and pray to gods that can’t save.

21Consult together and set forth your case.

Who predicted those things from of old?

What idol has proclaimed it for so long?

Am I not the One, the LORD?

There’s no God but me,

an upright God and Savior;

there’s none but me.

22Turn to me and be saved, people everywhere,

because I’m God, there’s no other.	Is 45:20-22

23I’ve sworn by myself;

I won’t take back the reliable message,

the message that every knee will bow to me

and every tongue will swear allegiance.

24They’ll say about me,

‘Godliness and strength are only in the LORD.’

People will come to me;

everyone that’s been mad at me will be put to shame.”

25Israel’s offspring will be justified

and honored in the LORD.	Is 45:23-25

Babylon’s False Gods

46:1Bel bows down, Nebo stoops over;

their images, loaded on beasts of burden and livestock,

are too heavy for their tired animals to bear.

2The idols themselves are stooped over;

their owners are bowed down too;

the people couldn’t keep the burden

from going into captivity with them.	Is 46:1-2

3“Listen to me, House of Jacob,

remnant of Israel, you that I’ve carried from birth,

4till your graying years I’ll do the same;

I’ve made you, and I’ll take care of you,

carry you along, and save you. 	Is 46:3-4

5“What can you compare me with?

Who’s my equal?

6Those who lavish gold from the purse

and weigh silver on the scale,

hire a goldsmith to make a god out of it;

then they bow down to worship it.

7They lift it up on their shoulder and carry it around;

they set it in its place, and it doesn’t move.

If they call out to it, it can’t answer

or deliver them from their trouble.	Is 46:5-7

8“Remember this and be confident about it, sinners.

Keep in mind the things from long ago,

because I’m God; there’s no one like me.

10I predict the end from the beginning,

from ancient times what hasn’t happened yet.

I say, ‘My purpose will come about;

I’ll accomplish what I delight in.’

11I’ll call a bird of prey from the east,

a leader from a distant country to do my bidding.

I’ve said truthfully what I’d do,

and I’ll do it.	Is 46:8-11

12“Listen to me, stubborn people

who are so far from being good;

13I’m willing to bring my goodness now;

my salvation is not something distant

that will take a long time to get here;

I’ll show Zion my salvation

and Israel my glory now.	Is 46:12-13

Prediction of the Fall of Babylon

47:1“Come sit in the dirt,

virgin daughter of Babylon.

Sit on the ground without a throne;

you won’t be treated honorably anymore.

2Grind meal with heavy millstones;

take off your veil, strip off your skirt,

uncover your legs and cross the rivers.

3Your nakedness will show;

your shame will be exposed;

in my revenge I won’t spare you or anybody else.”	Is 47:1-3

4Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;

Yahveh of Hosts is his name.

5“Sit silently in the dark,

daughter of Babylon;

you won’t be called

the queen of kingdoms anymore.

6I was angry with my people

and punished them by letting them fall to you.

But you didn’t show them any mercy;

you put a heavy yoke even on the elderly.

7Yet you said, ‘I’ll be queen forever’;

you were thoughtless about these things

and didn’t consider the consequences.	Is 47:4-7

8“Listen to this, you that love pleasure,

that live securely and tell yourselves,

‘I exist and nobody can harm me;

I’ll never be a widow or lose my children.’

9But both will happen to you suddenly the same day—

losing your children and becoming a widow;

those disasters will come on you in full measure

despite your many sorceries and powerful spells.”

Is 47:8-9

10“You felt secure in your sinfulness and said,

‘Nobody can see me.’

Your ‘wisdom and knowledge’ have misled you;

you’ve told yourself,

‘I exist and nobody can harm me.’

11But misfortune will come on you

that you can’t charm away;

disaster will fall on you

that you can’t buy off;

destruction will meet you suddenly

that you’re not prepared for. 	Is 47:10-11

12“Stick with your spells and sorceries

that you’ve labored under since you were young;

maybe you can scare somebody.

13You’re tired of all the advice you’ve received;

let the astrologers—who prophesy by the stars,

and predict by the new moon—

stand up and save you from what’s coming.

14They’re like chaff in a fire;

they can’t deliver themselves from the flames;

there won’t be any good place for you to sit and keep warm.

15That’s the way it is for the ones you’ve worked with

and done business with from your youth;

each one will go off in their own direction;

nobody can save you.	Is 47:12-15

Stubborn Israel

48:1“Listen to this, Jacob called ‘Israel,’

that came from Judah’s family,

that swear by the LORD and invoke Israel’s God,

but not sincerely and rightly,

2that call yourself The Holy City

and depend on the LORD of Hosts:	Is 48:1-2

3long ago, I told you what was going to happen;

all at once it has; my prediction has come true.

4I know how stubborn you are,

that your neck is as stiff as iron,

and your head is as hard as bronze.

5I made my prediction long ago

so you couldn’t say your idol did it,

that your carved image, your molten god commanded it.’

Is 48:3-5

6“You’ve heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled,

but you still won’t own up to them;

now I’ll tell you things you haven’t heard.

7They’re not things from long ago;

so you can’t claim you knew them all along.

8I know what traitors you are;

you’ve been rebels from birth.

9Yet for my name’s sake, I’ve delayed expressing my anger;

for my honor I’ve restrained it

to keep from wiping you out.

10I’ve refined you, but not like silver;

I’ve refined you in the furnace of suffering.

11For my own sake—yes, I’ll do it for my own sake—

I won’t let my reputation be tarnished;

I won’t share my honor with idols.	Is 48:6-11

Israel Freed from Babylon

12“Listen to me, Jacob, Israel that I’ve chosen;

I’m the only One, the first and the last.

13I’m the One that founded the earth

and spread out the sky;

when I call out the stars, they come out in force.

14Come here, all of you, and listen!

Which of your idols has told you this?

I’ve set my regard on Cyrus;

he’ll carry out my intentions on Babylon;

he’ll oppose the Babylonians.

15There I’ve said it; I’ve called him;

I’ve brought him; he’ll succeed.

16Come close and listen:

from the beginning I’ve spoken plainly

about what would happen.”

Already the Lord GOD and his Spirit have sent me with that message.

Is 48:12-16

17This is what the LORD says,

your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:

“I’m the LORD your God

that teaches you how to succeed

and leads you the way you should go.

18If only you’d paid attention to what I told you,

you’d have had peace like a river

and goodness like ocean waves washing over you.

19Your descendants would have been too numerous to count,

like grains of sand by the seashore;

I wouldn’t have needed to cut them off

or destroy them out of my presence.”	Is 48:17-19

20“Get out of Babylon! Escape from the Babylonians!

Shout the news everywhere with joy:

the LORD has rescued his servant Jacob!

21They weren’t thirsty while he led them through the desert;

he made water gush out of rock for them to drink;

22“But there’s no peace for the wicked,” the LORD says. Is 48:20-22

The Servant of the LORD

49:1Listen, far off lands;

pay attention, distant nations.

The LORD called me before I was born;

he named me inside my mother’s body.

2He made my mouth like a sharp sword

and hid me under his hand;

he made a polished arrow out of me

and put me in his quiver.

3He told me, “You’re my servant, Israel;

I’ll demonstrate my glory in you.”

4But I replied, “I haven’t really accomplished anything;

I’ve just worn myself out for nothing;

yet surely my just due is in the LORD’s hands;

I’ll have to trust him for my reward.”	Is 49:1-4

5The LORD says,

who formed me in the womb to be his servant

and bring Jacob back to him

(because the LORD values me and strengthens me):

6“It’s not a minor thing to serve me

and restore the remnant in Israel;

I’ll also make you a light to the Gentiles,

to take the news about my salvation all over the world.”

7This is what Israel’s Redeemer says

to the despised nation,

the one that other nations abhor,

the servant of rulers:

“Kings will stand at attention when they see you;

officials will bow

because of the LORD, who is faithful,

the Holy One of Israel that has chosen you.” Is 49:5-7

The Restoration of Israel Promised

8The LORD says,

“I’ll respond to you at an appropriate time

and help you when you need deliverance.

I’ll offer you as a covenant to the people

to restore Israel’s land,

to parcel out its deserted territories,

9to say to the ones in bonds, ‘Be free,’

and to those in darkness, ‘Come out into the light.’

My ‘sheep’ will graze along the roads

and pasture on the former barren hills.	Is 49:8-9

10They won’t be hungry or thirsty;

the scorching heat won’t oppress them,

because the One that shows them mercy

will lead them to springs of running water.

11I’ll make my mountains a level road

and raise my highways above the valleys.

12They’ll come from a long way off,

some from the north and west,

some from the region of Sinim.”

13Shout for joy, earth; celebrate, sky!

Break out into singing, mountains!

The LORD will comfort his people

and shown mercy to his suffering ones.	Is 49:10-13

14Yet Zion says, “The LORD has abandoned me;

he’s forgotten about me.”

15But the LORD says,

“Can a mother forget her nursing child

or withhold mercy from the son she bore?

Even if you forget, I won’t.

16I’ve written your name on my palms;

your fallen walls are always on my mind.

17Those who rebuild you will soon return to start their work;

the ones that want to destroy you will leave.

18Look up and around;

your people are gathering to you.

As I live,” the LORD says,

“you’ll put them all on

like a bride attaches jewels to her wedding gown.

Is 49:14-18

19In place of your empty spaces,

you’ll be overrun with residents;

your enemies that swallowed you will be long gone.

20The children born in exile will tell you

it’s too crowded here.

21You’ll ask yourselves.

‘Who was their father?

I was bereaved and barren,

wandering in exile;

I was alone; who had all these children?

Who raised them?’”			Is 49:19-21

22The Lord GOD says,

“I’ll signal to the nations

to bring back your boys in their arms

and to carry your little girls on their shoulders.

23Kings will be your foster fathers;

queens will be your nurses.

They’ll bow to you,

and lick the dust off your feet.

You’ll know I’m the LORD;

the ones that trust me won’t be disappointed.	Is 49:22-23

24Can anybody steal prey back from a warrior

or rescue captives from a tyrant?

25But the LORD says,

“I’ll even retrieve the captives of the strong

and rescue the tyrant’s prey.

I’ll combat anybody that combats you,

and save your children.

26I’ll make your oppressors eat their own flesh

and get drunk on their own blood.

Everyone will know I’m the LORD, your Savior,

your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”	Is 49:24-26

Israel’s Sin and the Servant’s Obedience

50:1The LORD says,

“Did I put your mother away with divorce papers?

Did I sell you as slaves to pay my debts?

No, I sold you because of your transgressions

and divorced your mother for her sins.

2When I came, why wasn’t anybody home?

When I knocked, why didn’t anyone answer the door?

Am I too poor to pay a ransom;

don’t I have the strength to rescue?

I can dry up the sea with a word,

make rivers empty and the fish in them die and stink.

3I dress the sky in darkness

and cover it with burlap.”	Is 50:1-3

4The Lord GOD has given me a disciple’s tongue

so I can comfort the weary with his message;

he wakes me up morning after morning

to help me understand his will.

5He’s cleaned out my ears,

and I haven’t pulled away.

6I’ve turned my back to the ones who scourge me

and my cheeks to those who pull out my beard;

I haven’t covered my face from being spit on.

7He helps me so I’m not disgraced;

I set my face like flint

and know I won’t feel ashamed.	Is 50:4-7

8The One that vindicates me is close at hand;

who wants to fight me?

Let’s stand up to each other.

Who wants to take me to court?

Go on, sue me!

9The Lord helps me;

who can condemn me?

Adversaries will wear out like old, moth-eaten clothes.

10Who among you respects the LORD,

obeys his servant,

and still lives in the dark?

Trust the LORD and rely on him.

11You that live by the light of the fires you set

will fall into them in torment.				Is 50:8-11

Everlasting Salvation for Israel

51:1“Listen to me, you that want to be good,

that look to the LORD,

the Rock you were hewn from,

the quarry you came from.

2Look to Abraham your ancestor,

to Sarah who bore you in pain;

he was just one man when I called him;

then I blessed him and multiplied him.”

3Indeed, the LORD will comfort Zion again

and have mercy on its desolate places;

he’ll make its wilderness like Eden,

its desert like the LORD’s orchard.

Joy and happiness will be there,

thanksgiving and songs.	Is 51:1-3

4“Listen, my people;

pay attention, my nation,

because my law will go out from me;

my justice will shine like a light for the nations,

to distant lands that wait for me.

5My goodness will come soon

to set my deliverance in motion,

my arms will bring justice to the nations;

the distant lands will look to me.

6Look up at the sky;

then look at the earth below it,

because the sky will dissipate like smoke,

the earth will wear out like a garment,

the people in it will die like gnats;

but my deliverance will be permanent,

my goodness won’t end.	Is 51:4-6

7Listen, you that know goodness

and have my Law in your heart;

don’t worry about criticism

or be intimidated by scorn;

8moths will eat away at your adversaries like a cloak;

worms will consume them like wool;

but my goodness will last forever,

my deliverance will continue to all generations.”

9Wake up, wake up, show your strength, arm of the LORD;

wake up as in the old days, generations ago;

wasn’t it you that cut Rahab in pieces,

that pierced the dragon?	Is 51:7-9

10Wasn’t it you that dried up the sea,

the water in the great deep,

that made it a path

for the rescued to pass through?

11The ones the LORD has ransomed will return

to Zion with happy shouts,

crowned with everlasting joy;

sorrow and sighing will disappear.	Is 51:10-11

12“I’m the One that gives you assurance.

Why be afraid of mortals

that wither like grass?

13Why forget the LORD your Maker

that stretched out the sky

and laid the foundations for the world?

Why constantly fear your enemies’ fury

when they threaten to destroy you?

Where’s the fury of those oppressors now?

14Exiles will soon be free;

they won’t starve to death in dungeons,

15because I’m Yahveh your God

that stirs up the sea and makes its breakers roar.

(“Yahveh of Hosts” is my title.)

16I’ve put my message in your mouth

and covered you with my hand

to establish the sky,

to found the earth,

to tell Zion, ‘You’re my people.’”	Is 51:12-16

17Wake up! Jerusalem;

get up, you that drank from the LORD’s hand

the cup of his anger,

that drank to the dregs the chalice

that made you stagger.

18Out of all the children you’ve borne and raised,

there’s no one to take you by the hand and guide you.

19Two things have happened to you:

devastation and destruction, sword and famine.

Who’s going to mourn for you?

How can I comfort you?

20Your children have fainted;

they lie helpless at the head of every street

like an antelope in a net,

full of the LORD’s anger, your God’s rebuke.	Is 51:17-20

21So listen to this, oppressed people,

drunk but not with wine;

22this is what your Lord says, the LORD your God

that contends for his people:

‘I’ve taken out of your hand

the cup filled with my anger,

the chalice that made you stagger;

you won’t have to drink it anymore.

23I’ll hand it to your tormentors to drink

who told you to lie down so they could walk on you.

You made your back like the ground,

like a street for them to tread.”	Is 51:21-23

Deliverance for Jerusalem

52:1Wake up, wake up;

dress yourself with strength, Zion;

put on your beautiful clothes, Jerusalem the holy city;

defiled, godless people won’t invade you anymore.

2Get up, shake off the dust, captive Jerusalem;

take the chains off your neck, resident in Zion,

3because the LORD says:

“You were sold for nothing;

you’ll be redeemed without money.

4In the beginning my people went down to Egypt to live;

now the Assyrians oppress them for no reason.

5Why are my people enslaved for nothing

and their rulers wail and blaspheme me all the time?

6Now my people will know my name;

they’ll know I’m the one that’s talking to them.”         Is 52:1-6

7How welcome on the mountains

is the messenger that brings good news,

that announces peace and happiness,

that declares salvation and says to Zion,

“Your God reigns!”

8Listen! Your watchmen are happy and singing;

they can see that the LORD is restoring Zion.

9Break out in joyful song together,

you laid-waste places in Jerusalem,

because the LORD has comforted his people;

he’s redeemed Jerusalem.

10He’s bared his holy arm

so the nations can witness the deliverance he’s bringing.

11Leave, leave there; don’t hang onto anything defiled;

purify yourselves, you that bring back the LORD’s sacred objects.

12You won’t go out quickly like fleeing refugees;

the LORD will lead you out;

the God of Israel will be your rear guard.	Is 52:7-12

The Suffering Servant Poem (52:13-53:12)

13My servant will succeed;

he’ll be looked up to and highly honored.

14But, even as many were astonished at you, my people,

so his astonishing appearance was marred beyond human resemblance,

his form mutilated beyond recognition.

15He’ll cleanse many nations;

kings will shut their mouths in his presence.

They’ll see what they had no one to tell them

and understand what they hadn’t heard.	Is 52:13-15

53:1Who has believed our message?

Who has the LORD shown his arm to?

He grew up before the LORD like a tender sprout,

like a shoot out of parched ground.

2He wasn’t particularly handsome or noble

to draw our attention to him

or have the looks that would attract us to him.

3People despised and abandoned him,

a pained man, acquainted with grief;

like someone people look the other way from,

we looked down on him and didn’t respect him.	Is 53:1-3

4Actually though, he was shouldering our weaknesses

and carrying our pains,

but we considered him

someone God struck and made suffer.

5But he was pierced for our sins,

crushed for our iniquities.

The discipline that was for our welfare fell on him,

and by his scourging we are healed.

6We’ve all wandered off like sheep

and turned to our own way;

but the LORD laid on him the sinfulness of us all.	Is 53:4-6

7He was oppressed and suffering,

but he didn’t say anything;

like a lamb they led to slaughter

or a sheep silent before its shearers,

he didn’t open his mouth.

8He was taken away by oppression and condemnation;

who realized at the time

that he was being cut off from the living

for the sins of my people, who deserved the stroke?

9They assigned his grave with criminals

though he hadn’t deceived or been violent;

yet he was associated with a rich man in his death.	Is 53:7-9

10But it was the LORD’s plan to crush him,

to put him to grief;

when he offers himself as a guilt offering,

he’ll see his offspring and extend his life,

and the LORD will accomplish his good pleasure in him.

11He’ll see what results from his anguish and feel fulfilled;

by his experience, my servant the upright one,

will justify many by shouldering their sins.

12So God will assign him a place among the great,

and he’ll divide the spoil with the strong

because he poured out his life

when they treated him like a transgressor.

But he was shouldering many other people’s sins

and interceding for them.	Is 53:10-12

The Future Glory for Zion

54:1“Shout for joy, childless woman;

break into joyful shouting and cry out,

you that have never had birth pangs;

because the woman that’s by herself

will have more children than a married woman,”

the LORD says.

2“Make a bigger space for your tent;

stretch out its curtains—don’t hold back;

lengthen your guy ropes and drive your pegs deeper.

3You’ll spread out left and right;

your descendants will live in the nations

and resettle ruined towns.	Is 54:1-3

4“Don’t be afraid, you won’t be disgraced;

don’t feel humiliated, you won’t feel ashamed.

You’ll forget the shame of your youth;

you won’t remember the disgrace of your widowhood;

5because your husband is your Maker;

his name is Yahveh of Hosts;

your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,

the God of the whole world.	Is 54:4-5

6Yahveh has called to you

like a wife abandoned and grieving,

like a young woman divorced.

7For a short time I separated from you,

but I’ll bring you back with mercy.

8To show you my anger,

I withdrew from you awhile;

but with enduring love,

I’ll have mercy on you now,”

Yahveh your Redeemer says.

Is 54:6-8

9“This is like Noah’s time to me,

when I swore that water like he saw

wouldn’t flood the world again;

In that same way I swear now

that I won’t be angry with you or rebuke you.

10Mountains may quake and hills may shake,

but I won’t remove my enduring love from you

or break my covenant for peace with you,”

the LORD says who has mercy for you.

Is 54:9-10

11“Suffering city, storm-tossed and uncomforted,

I’ll rebuild you with stones set in antimony

and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli.

12I’ll make your battlements out of rubies,

your gates out of carbuncles,

your entire wall out of precious stones.

13All your descendants will be the LORD’s disciples;

they’ll prosper greatly.

14You’ll be established in goodness

far from fear and oppression;

terror won’t get near you.

15If anybody assaults you, it won’t be because I sent them;

whoever attacks you will fall in defeat.

16I’ve created blacksmiths that blow the burning coals

and make weapons for their purpose;

I’ve also created destroyers that ruin them.

17No weapon designed to oppose you will achieve its aim;

you’ll refute whoever brings charges against you in court.

I’ll vindicate you,” 	the LORD says.                      Is 54:11-17

Invitation to the LORD’s Salvation

55:1“Everyone that’s thirsty, come to the water;

you that don’t have any money, come, buy, and eat;

get wine and milk for free.

2Why spend money on what’s not food,

wages on what doesn’t satisfy?

3Come and listen so you can live;

I’ll make an everlasting covenant with you

like the faithful mercies I showed David.

4I’ve appointed him as a witness to the nations,

a leader and commander for them.

5You too will call nations you don’t know;

nations that don’t know you will hurry to you

because of the LORD your God,

the Holy One of Israel,

because he has honored you.”	Is 55:1-5

6Look for the LORD while you can find him;

call on him while he’s near.

7Sinners need to change the way they act;

the unjust have to abandon selfish intentions.

They must return to the LORD

so he’ll have mercy on them,

come back to their God

because he’ll generously pardon.

8“I don’t think like you do;

I don’t do like you do,” the LORD says.

9“As high as the sky is above the earth,

my ways are above your ways

and my thoughts above your thoughts.	Is 55:6-9

10As rain and snow fall from the sky

and don’t go back there without watering the ground,

making it sprout and produce,

and providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater—

11so my message won’t come back to me

without accomplishing what I sent it to do.

12You’ll go out with joy

and be led forth in peace;

the mountains and hills

will break out in singing;

the trees in the field will clap their hands.

13Cypress trees will come up in place of thorns;

myrtles will grow instead of nettles;

they’ll be a memorial to the LORD,

an everlasting sign that won’t be destroyed.”	Is 55:10-13

Blessings for All Nations

56:1The LORD says,

“Maintain righteousness and be godly

because my salvation’s coming;

my deliverance will arrive.

2They are fortunate who do that,

who hold onto it,

who honor my Sabbath

and don’t do anything sinful.

3Foreigners that join themselves to the LORD shouldn’t say,

‘He’ll surely make a difference between me and his people’;

eunuchs shouldn’t say, ‘I’m a dead tree.’”

4The LORD says,

“For eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths holy,

choose to do what pleases me,

and keep my covenant—

5I’ll erect a memorial inside my Temple walls

and inscribe on it a name that’s better than heirs.	 Is 56:1-5

6“Foreigners that join me

to minister to me, love and serve me,

observe my Sabbaths, and keep my covenant—

7I’ll bring to my holy mountain

and make happy in my Temple for prayer;

I’ll accept their sacrifices and burnt offerings on my altar;

I’ll make my Temple a house for prayer for all nations.”

8The Lord GOD who brings back the dispersed from Israel, says,

“Still others I’ll bring to those I’ve already gathered.”

Is 56:6-8

Sinful Leaders Condemned

9All you wild animals in the field and forest,

come and devour my people.

10The watchmen are blind;

they don’t know what’s going on.

They’re dogs that can’t bark,

always lying around asleep, dreaming.

11They have huge appetites they can never satisfy;

they’re shepherds that don’t know how to shepherd.

They’ve all turned to their selfish interests,

looking for personal profit.

12“Come on,” they say, “let’s get some wine

and drink lots of alcohol;

tomorrow let’s do it again—and more so.”	Is 56:9-12

57:1Good people perish and nobody notices;

the devout disappear without anyone realizing it,

because God takes good people out of harm’s way

2They who take the godly road

go to peace and rest in their graves.

Idolatrous Worship Condemned

3“But come here, you sons of sorcerers,

you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.

4Who are you making fun of?

Who are you mouthing off to?

Who are you sticking out your tongue at?

Aren’t you rebellious brats, lying cads

5that worship your idols with lust among the terebinths

under every green tree,

that slaughter your children in the wadis

on the jagged rocks beneath the cliffs?	Is 57:1-5

6Your destiny is among those smooth-stone fertility symbols

that you worship in those wadis; they’re your fate;

you pour out liquid offerings to them

and make grain offerings;

am I supposed to be appeased by stuff like that?

7You’ve committed adultery on every high mountain

and gone up there to offer sacrifice to your idols.

8You’ve put pagan symbols on the back of your doors

and on your doorposts;

you’ve deserted me and uncovered yourself

to your Temple prostitutes;

you’ve loved their bed

and looked at their nakedness.			Is 57:6-8

9You’ve gone to Molech with olive oil

and lots of perfume;

you’ve sent your messengers far and wide,

even to Sheol.

10You’ve worn yourselves out by your long search,

but you didn’t give up;

you found renewed strength and didn’t faint.	Is 57:9-10

11“Who were you worried about and fearful of

when you lied and didn’t think about me?

12I’ll tell everybody about your so-called good deeds,

but they won’t do you any good.

13When you appealed for help,

did your collection of idols deliver you?

A gust of wind can pick them up;

a breath can blow them over.

But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land

and possess my holy mountain.”	Is 57:11-13

Comfort for the Contrite

14God says,

“Fix the road; rebuild it;

get rid of every obstacle to my people.”

15This is what the high and lofty One says

that lives forever, whose name is Holy:

“I live in a high and holy place

to revive the courage of the humble

and the heart of the repentant.

16I won’t oppose you forever or always be angry;

the spirit and breath of the ones I’ve created

would lose spirit and give up.

17I was angry and struck them

for their sinful, unjust gain;

I hid from them and was angry,

and they went on turning away in heart.	Is 57:14-17

18I’ve seen their ways, but I’ll heal them anyway;

I’ll lead them, comfort their mourners,

19and create praise from them.

Peace to the near and far;

I’ll heal them,”	the LORD says.

20“But sinful people are like a tossing sea;

it can’t relax;

it stirs up debris and mud.

21There’s no peace for them,” my God says.                      	Is 57:18-21

False and True Worship

58:1“Shout; don’t hold back;

raise your voice like a ram’s horn;

tell my people their transgressions.

2They look to me daily and seem to delight to know my ways,

as if they’re a good nation that hasn’t left my ordinances;

they ask for favorable verdicts

and act like they delight in drawing near to me.

3Then they wonder, ‘Why have we fasted, and you haven’t noticed?

Why have we humbled ourselves, and you haven’t acknowledged it?’

It’s because you fast to get what you want

(meanwhile overworking your workers)!	Is 58:1-3

4You fast only to win disputes and fist fights—

not to be heard on high.

5Is that the kind of fast I had in mind for humbling yourselves?

Isn’t that just going through the motions of bowing your head like a reed

and spreading out burlap and ashes under you?

Do you call that penance, a fast that’s acceptable to the LORD?

6Isn’t this the kind of fast I had in mind:

loosening the bonds of people you falsely imprisoned,

undoing the straps of their yoke,

freeing the oppressed,

and breaking every ties that binds people?	Is 58:4-6

7Isn’t it sharing your food with the hungry,

bringing the homeless into your house,

dressing the naked when you see them,

not hiding from relatives that need you?

8Then your light will break forth like the dawn;

your wounds will heal quickly.

Your good reputation will precede you;

the glory of the LORD will have your back.

9You’ll call and he’ll answer;

you’ll appeal to him, and he’ll say, ‘I’m here.’

If you remove oppression from among you,

the finger pointing and vicious gossip,

if you feed the hungry

and satisfy the needs of the suffering—

10then you’ll be a light shining in the dark;

the gloom around you will turn to noonday light.	Is 58:7-10

11The LORD will always guide you,

quench your thirst,

and restore your strength;

he’ll make you like an irrigated garden,

like a year-round spring.

12Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins

on foundations from long ago;

you’ll repair the breaches in the walls

and fix the streets you live on.	Is 58:11-12

13“If you turn around from the direction you’re headed,

stop doing just whatever you please on my holy day,

consider the Sabbath a delight,

honor the LORD’s day by what you do that day,

step aside from your own pursuits

and seeking your own pleasure and talking idly—

14then you’ll be delighting in the LORD.

He’ll give you honor on the earth

and satisfy you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob.”

The LORD has spoken.        	 Is 58:13-14

Warnings Against Sin

59:1It’s not that the LORD’s hand is not too weak to save

or his ear too deaf to hear you call.

2It’s your iniquities that have separated you from him;

your sins have shut him off from you,

so he ignores you.

3You’ve defiled your hands with blood,

your fingers with sin,

your lips with lying,

your tongues with gossip.

4None of you brings just suits or argues cases honestly;

you hide behind double talk and perjury;

you conceive schemes and give birth to sin.	Is 59:1-4

5You hatch viper eggs and weave spider webs;

whoever eats the eggs dies;

snakes hatch from the cracked eggs.

6Your webs can’t become clothes;

you can’t dress yourselves with what you’ve made.

Your deeds are sinful;

you use your hands for violence.

7You hurry to do harm,

run to shed blood,

and think sinful things;

destruction lies scattered along your highways.

8You don’t know any road that leads to peace;

you give the wrong directions;

whoever follows them gets lost.	Is 59:5-8

9So justice is a long way off from you;

right living doesn’t help you.

You hope for light, but it’s dark here;

you look for sunny days but live in gloom.

10You grope along the wall like the blind

and fumble around like people without eyes;

you stumble around as much at noon as you do at dusk,

like the dead among the living.

11You growl like bears and moan like pigeons;

you look for justice, but it doesn’t come;

you want salvation, but it’s a distant prospect.	Is 59:9-11

12You’ve multiplied your sins right in God’s face;

they testify against you.

You know you’re sinful;

13you transgress and deny the LORD

and turn your backs on him.

You advocate oppression and rebellion,

conceive and tell lies from the heart.

14The courts oppose justice;

it’s nowhere near;

truth stumbles in the streets;

honesty is illegal.

15aThere is no truth;

those who turn from sin become victims. 		Is 59:12-15a

15b-16The LORD was amazed;

it displeased him that there was no justice.

Nobody was intervening to help the oppressed;

so he brought about salvation himself

and sustained it with his goodness.

17He put on goodness like a breastplate,

and a helmet of salvation on his head;

he dressed himself in vengeance

and wrapped himself with zeal like a mantle.

18He’ll repay his adversaries according to their deeds,

recompense his enemies with his anger,

and carry out retribution to the ends of the earth.

19So they’ll fear the LORD in the west

and honor him from the rising of the sun,

because he’ll come like a rushing tide

that he drives with the wind.

20“A redeemer will come to Zion,

to those who turn from sin in Jacob,” the LORD says.    Is 59:15b-20

21“This is my covenant with you:

my Spirit that’s on you,

my message that’s in you

won’t leave you, your children,

or grandchildren from now on.” 			Is 59:21

Israel’s Future Glory

60:1“Arise, shine; your light has come;

the glory of the LORD has risen on you.

2Darkness will cover the earth;

thick blackness will blanket the nations;

but the LORD will shine on you;

his glory will appear on you.

3Nations will come to your light,

kings to the brightness of your rising.	Is 60:1-3

4“Look all around you;

they’re all gathering home to you.

Your little boys will come from a long way off;

your girls will be carried in arms.

5Then your eyes will be radiant;

you’ll be thrilled and happy,

because commerce from the sea will return to you,

and the nations’ wealth will be available to you.

6Caravans of camels will cover you,

young camels from Midian and Ephah.

The ones from Sheba will bring gold and frankincense,

and good news about the praises of the LORD.

7The flocks of Kedar will gather to you;

the rams of Nebaioth will serve you.

I’ll accept them on my altar

and honor my Temple.

8Who are these that fly like a cloud,

like pigeons to their windows?	Is 60:4-8

9The distant lands will learn to trust in me;

the ships from Tarshish will come first,

bringing your descendants home from afar

and their silver and gold with them

for the LORD your God,

for the Holy One of Israel,

because he’s honored you.	Is 60:9

10“Foreigners will rebuild your walls;

their kings will be your servants.

Though I struck you in my anger,

now I’ll have mercy on you in my favor.

11Your gates will stay open day and night

so nations can bring their wealth to you,

and their kings can be led as captives

in the victory procession.

12Nations that won’t serve you will perish.

13The splendor of Lebanon will come on you,

the juniper, box tree, and cypress tree together,

to beautify the place for my feet in my sanctuary.

14The descendants of your oppressors will come bowing to you;

your despisers will prostrate themselves at your feet.

They’ll call you The City of the LORD,

Zion of the Holy One of Israel.	Is 60:10-14

15“Whereas you’ve been hated, shunned, and abandoned,

I’ll make you something to be proud of forever,

a joy for endless generations.

16You’ll nurse on the milk of nations, breasts of kings;

you’ll know that I’m the LORD, your Savior,

your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

17I’ll bring gold for bronze,

bronze for wood,

silver for iron,

iron for stone.

I’ll make peace your administrators

and goodness your overseers.	Is 60:15-17

18Violence will disappear from your land,

war from inside your borders;

you’ll call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.

19You won’t need the sun for daylight

or the moon to be bright.

You’ll have the LORD for an everlasting light;

he’ll be your glory.

20Your sun won’t set anymore;

your moon won’t have phases.

You’ll have the LORD for an everlasting light;

your mourning will be over.

21Your people will be good;

they’ll own their land forever,

the branch I planted with my own hands will honor me.

22The smallest will become a clan;

the least will be a nation.

I, the LORD, will hurry it along when the time comes.”	Is 60:18-22

The Year of the LORD’s Favor

61:1The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me;

he’s anointed me to bring good news to the downtrodden.

He’s sent me to bandage up the brokenhearted,

to liberate captives,

to free prisoners,

2to announce that this is

the year the LORD shows blessing,

the day he sets things right,

to comfort anyone that’s grieving,

3to give to the sad in Zion

a crown in place of ashes,

the oil of happiness instead of mourning,

the mantle of praise rather than a fainting spirit

so they’ll be like Terebinths of Goodness

the LORD has planted to demonstrate his glory.	Is 61:1-3

4Then they’ll rebuild the ancient ruins,

set back up what was torn down,

repair destroyed towns deserted for generations.

5Foreigners will pasture your flocks,

do your farming, and tend your vineyards.

6But you’ll be the LORD’s priests;

people will speak of you as his ministers.

You’ll feed on the wealth of nations

and take pride in their prosperity.

7Instead of humiliation you’ll have a double portion;

rather than dishonor you’ll celebrate over your lot.

You’ll have everlasting joy in your land.

8“I, the LORD, love justice

and despise short-changing in burnt offering;

I’ll make an everlasting contract with you

and faithfully pay you for your work.

9Then the nations will honor your offspring worldwide;

everyone will recognize you as the offspring the LORD blessed.”

Is 61:4-9

10I’m really happy in the LORD;

I celebrate over my God

because he’s dressed me in salvation

and wrapped me in goodness like a robe,

like a groom dresses himself in a garland,

and a bride adorns herself with jewels.

11As the ground produces seeds

and a garden makes sprouts grow,

so the Lord GOD makes goodness and praise

spring up for all the world to see.	Is 61:10-11

Isaiah’s Prayer for Jerusalem

62:1For Zion’s sake I’ll speak to God;

for Jerusalem’s sake I won’t keep still,

until your goodness glows brightly,

and your salvation radiates like a burning torch;

2so the nations can witness your goodness

and kings can gaze at your glory.

The LORD himself will give you a new name.

3You’ll be a beautiful crown in his hand,

a royal diadem he holds up high.

4You won’t be called Abandoned [Azubah] anymore

or your land be named Desolate [Shemamah];

you’ll be My Delight Is in It [Hephzibah],

and your land will be Married [Beulah],

because he delights in you,

and your land will be married to him.

5Like a young man marries a virgin,

your sons will marry you, Jerusalem;

like a groom is happy over a bride,

your God will be happy over you.	Is 62:1-5

6I’ve stationed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem,

not to be silent day or night,

but to remember you to the LORD

7till he makes you something worth praising in the world.

8He has sworn by his right hand and strong arm,

“I’ll never again let your enemies eat your grain

or foreigners drink the new wine you labored for.

9But the ones that put the grain in the granary

will eat it and praise me;

the ones that pick the grapes

will drink the wine in the courts of my sanctuary.”	Is 62:6-9

10Go out through the gates;

clear the way for my people.

Build a highway so they can return;

get the loose rocks off the road.

Hoist a flag the nations can see.

11The LORD has declared all over the world,

“Tell Zion its salvation’s coming;

he’s bringing his reward with him.”

12They’ll call you The Holy People [Ha‘am Haggadosh],

The LORD’s Redeemed [Ge’ule-adonai],

The Sought For, A City No Longer Forsaken.  	 Is 62:10-12

Vengeance Against Israel’s Enemies

63:1Who is this that’s coming from Edom

in crimson clothes from Bozrah,

one majestic in attire

and marching with such power?

“The One that’s announcing vindication,

that has the strength to save.”

2Why are your clothes stained red

like those who tread out grapes?

3“Ineed, I’ve been treading in a winepress—alone;

nobody from the nations could help me;

so I tramped down my foes in my fury;

their life blood spattered my garments

and stained my clothes.

4I’ve had a day for payback on my mind;

a year for redemption to come.

5But I looked, amazed

that there was no one to intervene for the oppressed;

so my own arm did the saving;

anger sustained me.

6I tramped down nations in my fury

and made them drunk in my wrath;

I poured out their blood on the ground.”	Is 63:1-6

Praise for Deliverance

7I’ll recount the praises and tell about Yahveh’s enduring love

in proportion to everything he has granted us;

I’ll declare the great goodness he has shown

in proportion to his mercy and kindness toward Israel.

8He said, “They’re my people,

offspring that surely won’t betray me again;

so he saved them.

9In all their adversity he felt their suffering;

so he sent the angel from his presence to save them.

In his love and mercy, he redeemed them;

he picked them up and carried them

like he’d done in the past.

10But they did rebel and grieve his Holy Spirit;

so he became their enemy and opposed them.	Is 63:7-10

11Then his people remembered the past at Moses’ time.

“Where’s the One that brought them up from the sea

with the shepherds of his flock?

Where is the One that put his Holy Spirit among them,

12that showed his power when Moses raised his right hand,

that divided the water for them to make an eternal name for himself,

13that led them through the deep sea?

Like a horse in open country, they didn’t stumble;

14like livestock that goes down to a sheltered valley,

the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest;

that’s the way he led his people

to make a glorious name for himself.”	Is 63:11-14

Prayer for Pardon

15Look down from heaven,

from your holy house;

where are your zeal and powerful deeds?

I don’t sense the mercy

you used to have toward us.

16Even if Abraham would disown us

and Israel wouldn’t recognize us,

you’d still be our Father and Redeemer.

17LORD, why let us stray from your ways

and harden our hearts against you?

For our sake, bring us back as your special possession.

18Your holy people had your sanctuary for a while,

but our adversaries have tramped it down.

19We’ve become like a nation you never ruled,

like people that never wore your name.	Is 63:15-19

64:1Oh that you’d open the sky and come down

and the mountains would quake in your presence—

2like a flame that burns brush and boils water—

to show yourself to your adversaries

so they’d tremble in your presence!

3When you did awesome things we didn’t expect,

you came down and the mountains quaked in your presence.

4No one has ever heard of a God like you

that acts on behalf of people that wait for him.

5You visit those who enjoy doing good,

who remember you and your ways.

You were angry because we kept sinning for a long time;

can we ever be saved?

6We’ve all become unclean;

our best efforts are like menstrual rags.

We wither like leaves;

our sins blow us away like the wind.

7No one calls on you or reaches out to you

because you’ve hid from us

and delivered us to the consequences of our sins. Is 64:1-7

8But now, LORD, you’re our Father;

we’re the clay, you’re the potter;

you’ve made us.

9Don’t be angry beyond measure;

don’t hold our sin against us forever;

look now, we’re all your people.

10Your holy cities have become a desert;

Zion is a wasteland;

Jerusalem is desolate.

11Our holy, beautiful Temple,

where our ancestors praised you,

has been burned;

all our precious things lie in ruins.

12Will you limit yourself to this much retribution,

or will you keep disciplining us no end?	Is 64:8-12

Judgment and Final Salvation

65:1“I let people look for me who weren’t asking about me;

people that weren’t looking for me found me.

I said, ‘I’m here! Over here!’

to people that didn’t call on me.

2All day long I spread out my hands to a rebellious nation

that follows its own ideas,

3that continually angers me to my face

by offering sacrifices to idols in sacred gardens

and burning incense on pagan altars,

4that sit in tombs and spend the night in secret places,

that eat pig meat

and have broth from unclean meat in their pots,

5that say, ‘Stay away from me;

don’t touch me;

I’m holier than you are!’

They’re smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all day.	Is 65:1-5

6I’ve written it out in front of me:

I won’t stand idly by; I’ll repay.

I’ll pay back into their laps

7the sins they and their ancestors committed;

since they’ve burned incense on the mountains

and scorned me on the hills,

I’ll measure out their former deeds into their arms,”

the LORD says.

8“As new wine comes from clusters

and somebody says,

‘Don’t ruin it; it’s useful’;

that’s what I’ll do with my servants

and not destroy them all.

9I’ll preserve a remnant from Jacob and Judah

to inherit my mountains;

my chosen ones will inherit it;

my servants will live there. 	Is 65:6-9

10Sharon will be a pasture for flocks;

the Valley of Achor will be a resting place for herds—

for my people that look to me.

11-12But I’ll destine for the sword

you that leave me,

that forget my holy mountain,

that set a table for Fortune

and fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny.

You’ll bow down to slaughter,

because I called, but you didn’t answer;

I spoke, but you ignored me;

you did what I consider sinful;

you chose what I don’t delight in.”	Is 65:10-12

13So the Lord GOD says,

“My servants will eat, but you’ll be hungry;

my servants will drink, but you’ll be thirsty;

my servants will celebrate, but you’ll be humiliated;

14my servants will make a joyful sound with a happy heart,

but you’ll cry with a heavy heart

and wail with a broken spirit.

15The name you leave behind will be a curse to my chosen ones,

and the Lord GOD will slay you;

but I’ll call my servants another name

16because those who bless themselves on earth

will bless themselves by the true God;

the ones that take an oath in the land

will swear by the true God;

because I’ll forget the former troubles

and hide them from me.	Is 65:13-16

New Earth and Sky

17“I’m creating a new earth and sky;

people won’t think about previous things anymore.

18Be happy and celebrate forever in what I create,

because I’ll create Jerusalem for celebrating

and its people for happiness.

19I’ll celebrate over Jerusalem

and be happy with my people;

they won’t hear weeping and crying anymore.

20No longer will babies live just a few days,

or adults die young;

they’ll die when they’re 100;

anybody that dies young will be considered cursed.

21They’ll build houses and live in them,

plant vineyards and eat their fruit.	Is 65:17-21

22They won’t build and someone else occupy them;

they won’t plant and somebody else eat the fruit.

The lifetime of my people will be like the lifetime of a tree;

my chosen ones will enjoy what they make.

23They won’t work to no end

or have children that face catastrophes;

they’ll be the offspring of people the LORD has blessed—

their descendants as well.

24Before they call, I’ll answer;

while they’re speaking, I’ll listen.

25Wolf and lamb will graze together;

a lion will eat straw like an ox,

but snakes will eat dust.

They won’t hurt anything in all my holy mountain,”

the LORD says.                     Is 65:22-25

Judgment and Hope

66:1The LORD says,

“Heaven is my throne; earth is my footstool;

where are you going to build me a Temple to rest in?

2I made all this;

that’s why it’s here.

But the ones I especially love

are humble with a repentant spirit

and respect what I say.	Is 66:1-2

3“But for the ones who’ve chosen their own way

and delight in detestable things,

offering an ox will be like human sacrifice,

sacrificing a lamb will be like breaking a dog’s neck,

offering a grain offering will be like offering pig’s blood,

burning incense will be like blessing an idol.

4I’ll carry out their punishments

and bring on them what they dread;

because I called, but nobody answered;

I spoke, but they ignored me.

They did what I consider sinful

and chose what I don’t delight in.”	Is 66:3-4

5Listen to this message from the LORD,

you that respect what he says,

“Your brothers that hate you and exclude you

because you’re loyal to me, have scoffed,

‘Honor the LORD so we can see how happy he makes you!’

But they’re the ones that will be humiliated.

6The uproar in the city and the Temple

is the LORD paying back his enemies.	Is 66:5-6

7“Before she travailed, she brought forth;

before her pain came, she had a boy.

8Who ever heard of such a thing?

Who has seen anything like that?

Can a country be born in a day?

Can a nation be brought forth all at once?

But as soon as Zion’s travail began,

she brought forth her children.

9Would I bring to term and not deliver?

Would I that give delivery shut the womb?

10Be joyful over Jerusalem, you that love her;

be happy with her, you that mourn for her;

11so you can be satisfied by her consoling breasts,

nurse and be delighted by her bountiful bosom.”	 Is 66:7-11

12This is what the LORD says,

“I extend peace to her like a river,

the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream.

She’ll nurse you and carry you on her hip,

and play with you on her lap.

13I’ll comfort you like a mother does;

I’ll comfort you in Jerusalem.”

14When you experience it, you’ll be happy;

you’ll flourish like new grass.

The LORD’s servants will realize what he’s doing;

his enemies will experience his indignation.	Is 66:12-14

15He will come in fire;

his chariots will rush in like a windstorm

to render his anger with fury,

to rebuke with flames.

16He’ll condemn by fire and sword;

the number he slays will be countless.	Is 66:15-16

17“Those who ‘sanctify and purify’ themselves to enter sacred gardens with idols in the center, that eat pig meat and disgusting things like mice, will all come to their end at the same time. 18I know what they’re thinking; I can see what they’re doing. The time’s coming to gather all nations to see my glory. 19I’ll perform a sign among them and send survivors out from them to the nations—to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan, and distant lands that have never heard of me. 20From all the countries they’ll bring me your people as a grain offering. On horses, mules, and camels; in chariots and litter wagons they’ll bring them to my holy mountain Jerusalem,” 	the LORD says.

66:17-20

21“1’ll make some of them priests and Levites.”

22As surely as the new earth and sky will last,

your descendants and name will endure.

23-24Every new moon and Sabbath,

all humanity will come to bow to me.

When they leave, they’ll see the corpses of those

who’ve rebelled against me.

The maggots won’t die;

the fire won’t go out.

They’ll be repulsive to everybody that sees them,”								the LORD says.			Is 66:21-24

JEREMIAH

1:1The Words of Jeremiah Son of Hilkiah

from the Priests at Anathoth in Benjamin

2Messages from the LORD came to him from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah. 3They came as well during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, till the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, till Jerusalem’s exile in the fifth month.     	Jer 1:1-3

The Call of Jeremiah

4A message from the LORD came to me:

5“I knew you before I formed you in the womb;

I set you apart before you were born

and appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.”

6I said,

“Lord GOD!

I don’t know how to speak for you;

I’m too young.”

7But the LORD told me,

“Don’t say you’re too young;

you’ll go where I send you

and say what I tell you.

8You don’t need to be afraid of them;

I’ll protect you.”

9He reached out and touched my mouth,

“I’ve put my message in you

10and appointed you over nations and kingdoms

to pull up and tear down,

to overthrow and destroy,

to build and plant.”	Jer 1:4-10

11A message from the LORD came to me:

“What do you see, Jeremiah?”

“An ‘almond’ branch.”

12“Yes; I’m ‘watching,’

and I’ll certainly do what I say.”

13Another message came to me:

“What do you see?”

“A boiling pot facing this way from the north.”	Jer 1:11-13

14Then he said,

“Evil is going to pour out from the north onto the people in this country. 15I’m calling the armies in the kingdoms up north. Each one will set a throne at Jerusalem’s gates, against its walls all round, against the towns in Judah. 16I’ll render judgment on this nation for leaving me and sacrificing to other gods, for worshiping what they’ve made with their own hands. 17Gird up your loins. Get up and tell them everything I’ve told you. Don’t let them intimidate you, or I’ll dishearten you in front of them. 18Today, I’m making you like a fortified city, like an iron pillar, like bronze walls against the whole land, Judah’s kings, officials, priests, and people. 19They’ll fight you, but they won’t win, because I’m with you.”	Jer 1:14-19

Israel Forsakes God

2:1A Message from the LORD came to Me:

2“Go proclaim in Jerusalem that the LORD says,

‘I remember your devotion when you were young,

your love as my betrothed,

your following me in the open country

through uncultivated land.

3Israel was holy to me,

the first fruits of my harvest;

everybody that tried to eat some of it became guilty,

and disaster fell on them.’”                                                 Jer 2:1-3

4A Message from the LORD to the House of Jacob

and the Families of Israel

5The LORD says,

“What did your ancestors find wrong with me

that they left me and followed emptiness

and became empty themselves?

6They didn’t say, ‘Where’s the LORD

that brought us out of Egypt

and led us through the wilderness,

through deserts and pits,

drought and deep darkness,

through land nobody crossed,

where nobody lived?’				Jer 2:4-6

7I brought you to a productive land

to eat the good things it produced,

but you defiled it

and made my permanent possession detestable.

8The priests didn’t say, ‘Where’s the LORD?’

Those who administered the Law didn’t know me;

the rulers sinned against me;

the prophets prophesied by Baal

and followed things that didn’t profit.	Jer 2:7-8

9“So I’ll contend with you and your grandsons.

10Sail to Cyprus and see;

send to Kedar and look carefully

to see if there’s anything like this!

11Has any nation ever changed gods

to what weren’t gods?

But my people have exchanged their honor

for what are worthless.

12Be appalled at that, sky;

shudder and be dismayed.

13My people have committed two sins:

they’ve left me,

the fountain of living water,

and hewed out cracked cisterns

that can’t hold water.	Jer 2:9-13

14“Is Israel a slave or a home-born servant?

Why has he become prey?

15Young lions have roared at him loudly;

they’ve made his country a wasteland

and destroyed his towns without residents.

16Egyptians from Memphis and Tahpanhes

have broken the crown on his head.

17Haven’t you done this to yourself

by leaving the LORD your God,

when he was leading you along his way?	Jer 2:14-17

18What are you doing on the road to Egypt

to drink the water in the Nile?

Why go to Assyria

to drink the water of the Euphrates?

19Your own sins will correct you;

your apostasies will rebuke you.

Know then that it’s sinful, a bitter thing

to leave the LORD your God;

you don’t respect me at all,” the Lord GOD of hosts says.   Jer 2:18-19

20“Long ago I broke your yoke

and tore off your slave chains;

but you said, ‘I won’t serve!’

On every tall hill under every green tree,

you’ve lain down like a prostitute.

21Yet I planted you as a choice stock,

as faithful seed.

How then have you turned yourself

into the degenerate sprouts of a wild vine?

22Though you wash yourself with lye and lots of soap,

I can still see the stain from your sin,”

the Lord GOD says.		Jer 2:20-22

Israel an Unfaithful Wife

23“How can you keep saying, ‘I’m not defiled;

I haven’t gone after the images of Baal’?

Look at your way in the valleys!

Acknowledge what you’ve done!

You’re a restless young camel,

pacing back and forth,

24a wild donkey accustomed to the desert,

in her heat sniffing the wind.

Who can control her?

They don’t need to waste energy looking for her;

she’ll come to them in her month.

25Don’t run after them till your feet are sore

and your throat’s dry.

But you said, ‘Don’t try to change me!

I love those foreign gods;

I’ll keep living their way.’	Jer 2:23-25

26“Like a thief embarrassed at getting caught,

the House of Israel is embarrassed—

they, their kings and officials,

priests and prophets,

27who say to a tree, ‘You’re my father,’

to a stone, ‘You’re my mother.’

They turn their backs on me;

but when trouble comes, they’ll call out,

‘Get up and save us.’

28Where are the gods you made for yourselves?

Have them save you if they can.

Judah, you have as many gods

as you have towns.	Jer 2:26-28

29“Why complain to me?

You’ve all sinned against me.

30I’ve disciplined you for nothing;

you didn’t respond to it.

Your sword has killed your prophets

like a ravenous lion kills prey.

31Generation, listen to the LORD’s message.

Have I been a desert to Israel

or a land of deep darkness?

Why do my people say, ‘We’re free to roam;

we won’t come to you anymore’?	Jer 2:29-31

32Can a young woman forget her jewelry,

or a bride her wedding dress?

Yet my people have forgotten me time and again.

33You scheme so well to find love!

You’ve even taught immoral women how to do it

34The blood of the innocent poor

you’ve spattered on your clothes

though you didn’t catch them breaking in;

but despite that

35you say, ‘I haven’t done anything wrong;

surely he’s not mad at me!’	Jer 2:32-35

36How lightly you gad around from one way to another;

Egypt will humble you like Assyria did.

37You’ll leave here with your hands on your head,

because the LORD has rejected the ones you depend on;

you won’t prosper by them.”	Jer 2:36-37

3:1God says,

“If a husband divorces his wife

and she marries another man,

will he take her back?

Wouldn’t that pollute the land?

But you’re a prostitute with lots of lovers;

yet you turn back to me to get help.

2Look up at the barren hills;

where haven’t you committed adultery?

You sit by the roads waiting for them

like a nomad in the desert.

You pollute the land

with your sinful prostitution.

3So I’ve withheld showers;

spring rain hasn’t come;

yet you’re a brazen prostitute

that refuses to be ashamed.

4Haven’t you called out to me just now,

‘Father, you’re the friend I had when I was young’?

5‘Are you going to stay angry forever?

Are you always going to be offended?’"	Jer 3:1-5

Judah Follows Unfaithful Israel

6At the time of King Josiah, the LORD said to me:

“Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She’s gone up on every tall hill and carried on her prostitution under every green tree. 7I thought that after she’d done that, she’d come back to me. But she didn’t, and her unfaithful sister saw it. 8I gave Israel divorce papers and sent her away for her adultery, but her unfaithful sister Judah wasn’t afraid. She left and became a prostitute too. 9Because prostitution was a small matter to her, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. 10Despite all this, her unfaithful sister Judah didn’t come back to me with all her heart, only in pretense.”	       Jer 3:6-10

Hope Even for Unfaithful Israel

11The LORD told me:

“Unfaithful Israel has proved to be more upright than unfaithful Judah. 12Go deliver this message toward the north,

‘Come back, unfaithful Israel;

I won’t stay angry forever.

13Just own up to your unfaithfulness to me;

you scattered your favors to foreigners

under every green tree, and you haven’t obeyed me.

14Come back, unfaithful children,

because I’m your master.

I’ll bring back to Zion one from this town and two from that family.

Jer 3:11-14

15I’ll give you shepherds after my own heart who will feed you knowledge and insight. 16When you’ve multiplied in the land, they won’t say anymore ‘The Ark of the LORD’s covenant.’ It won’t be remembered or missed or remade. 17At that time, they’ll call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD. All the nations will gather there to be in his presence. They’ll stop following their stubborn, sinful hearts. 18Judah will follow Israel; together they’ll come back from exile in the north to the land I gave their ancestors.	     Jer 3:15-18

19“Then I said how I’d include you among my children

and give you a pleasant land,

the most beautiful inheritance in the world!

I said, ‘Call me “Father”

and not turn aside from following me.’

20But like an unfaithful wife that leaves her husband,

you’ve been unfaithful to me, Israel.”	Jer 3:19-20

21On the barren hills is the sound of

Israel’s people crying and pleading

because they’ve perverted their way

and forgotten their God.

22“Come back, unfaithful children;

I’ll heal your unfaithfulness.”

“We’re coming back to you

because you’re our God.

23The hills are a delusion,

the orgies on them as well.

Truly, in the LORD our God

lies Israel’s salvation.	Jer 3:21-23

24“But from the time we were young, shameful things have consumed our ancestors’ labors, flocks and herds, sons and daughters. 25Let’s lie down in our shame and cover ourselves with our humiliation. We and our ancestors have sinned against the LORD our God. We haven’t obeyed him.”         	   Jer 3:24-25

4:1“If you want to come back, you can;

get rid of your detestable idols

and don’t waver back and forth with them.

2Swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives,’

honestly, justly, uprightly;

then the nations will be blessed in him

and glory in him.”

Coming Destruction from the North

3The LORD says to the people in Judah and Jerusalem:

“Break up your heart’s fallow ground

and don’t throw your seed among its thorns.

4Circumcise yourselves to the LORD;

remove the foreskins of your heart,

people in Judah and Jerusalem,

so my anger won’t flare because of your sins

and burn with nobody to put it out.”	Jer 4:1-4

5Declare in Judah and Jerusalem:

“Blow the bugle in the land;

call out and say,

‘Flee to the fortified cities.’

6Lift up a standard toward Zion!

Run for refuge;

hurry because I’m bringing

widespread destruction from the north.”

7A lion has come up out of its thicket,

one that destroys nations;

it’s left its den to devastate your land

and make your towns empty ruins.

8Put on burlap for that;

lament and wail,

because the LORD’s fierce anger

hasn’t turned away from us.	Jer 4:5-8

9“At that time,” the LORD says,

“the hearts of the king and officials will fail,

the priests will be terrified,

and the prophets horrified.”

10Then I said, “Lord GOD, you completely misled this nation and Jerusalem when you said they’d have peace; they have a sword at their throat!”

11-12“I’ll answer them, ‘A scorching wind from the desert’s barren hills will blow on you, a wind too strong for winnowing grain or sweeping a threshing floor. It will come at my command to pronounce condemnation on you.’ 	   Jer 4:9-12

13Judah’s enemy rises up like clouds;

his chariots go up like a whirlwind;

his horses are faster than eagles.

‘Misfortune awaits us! We’re doomed!’”	Jer 4:13

14Jerusalem, wash the evil off your heart

so you can be saved;

how long will you harbor bad thoughts?

15A voice declares from Dan

and announces from Mount Ephraim

that disaster is on the way.

16“Warn the nearby nations now! Announce it in Jerusalem,

besiegers are coming from a far country

to raise their battle cries at the towns in Judah.

17Like watchmen around a field, they’re against it all around

because it’s rebelled against me,” the LORD says.

18“Your ways and deeds have brought this on you;

this bitter punishment has cut you to the heart!” 	Jer 4:14-18

Jeremiah Anguish over Judah’s Desolation

19My soul, my soul! I’m in anguish!

My heart’s pounding, I can’t stay still.

My soul, you’ve heard the bugle’s signal for war.

20Disaster on top of disaster is in store,

devastating the whole land.

It’s destroyed my tents in no time;

my curtains were gone in a flash.

21How long do I have to look at the standard

and listen to the bugle?

22“My people are foolish; they don’t know me;

they’re ignorant kids that don’t understand.

They’re good at doing bad,

but they don’t know how to do good.”	Jer 4:19-22

Jeremiah’s Vision of Coming Disaster

23I looked at the earth;

it was unformed and empty;

I looked up at the sky;

it didn’t shed any light.

24I looked at the mountains and hills,

quaking back and forth.

25I didn’t see any people;

the birds had flown away.

26The fertile land had become a desert;

its towns lay in ruins

in the face of the LORD’s fierce anger.	Jer 4:23-26

27The LORD says,

“The whole country will be a wasteland,

but I won’t completely destroy it.

28The earth will mourn,

and the sky will grow dark;

I’ve told you my intentions,

and I won’t change my mind.”

29At the sound of calvary and archers, every town is scattering;

they’re running into thickets and hiding in rocks;

they’re abandoning the towns.	Jer 4:27-29

30What are you going to do, desolate one?

Though you’re dressed in scarlet

and decorate yourself with gold jewelry

and accent your eyes with mascara,

making yourself beautiful won’t do any good,

because your lovers despise you,

intent on killing you.

31I hear a woman crying out in labor,

the anguish of one giving birth to her first child,

the cry of the young woman of Zion gasping for breath,

stretching out her hands and saying,

“Misfortune awaits me; I’m being murdered.”	Jer 4:30-31

Jerusalem Refuses to Repent

5:1“Wander back and forth in the streets in Jerusalem;

search all around in it.

Look in its open squares:

if you can find one honest person,

one that looks for the truth,

I’ll pardon it.

2Although they swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives,’

they don’t mean it.

3LORD, aren’t you looking for honesty?						You’ve struck them,

but they didn’t feel anything;

you’ve consumed them,

but they’ve refused to be corrected;

they’ve set their faces like stone

and refused to repent.”	Jer 5:1-3

4Then I said, “They’re poor and foolish,							because they don’t know the way of the LORD							or the ordinance of their God.							5I’ll go to their leaders and speak to them;								surely they know the way of the LORD,

what their God requires.

As a group, their leaders have broken his yoke off

and kicked his traces.

6So a lion from the woods will kill them;

a wolf from the desert will destroy them;

a leopard is watching their towns,

ready to maul anyone that ventures out,

because their sins are many,

their apostasies. numerous.	Jer 5:4-6

7“Why should I pardon you?

Your offspring have left me

and sworn by what aren’t gods.

When I fed them to the full,

they committed adultery

and trooped to houses of prostitution.

8They were well-fed, lusty stallions,

each one neighing for his neighbor’s mare.

9Won’t I punish them

and avenge myself on a nation like that?”

the LORD says.                     Jer 5:7-9

10“Go through its rows of grapevines

and cut down all but a few;

strip away their branches

because they don’t belong to me.

11Israel and Judah have dealt deviously with me.

12They’ve misjudged me and said,							‘He won’t do anything;									misfortune won’t fall on us;								we won’t see sword or famine.							13His prophets are windbags;								they don’t have any message from him.’						Indeed, those things will happen to them!”		Jer 5:10-13

14So the LORD God of hosts says.

“Since they’ve claimed that,

I’ll make my word fire in your mouth,

make these people kindling,

and burn them up.

15I’ll bring a distant nation against you, Israel,

an ancient, enduring one

whose language you don’t know,

whose speech you can’t understand.

16Their quiver is like an open grave;

they’re all powerful men.

17They’ll eat your harvest and your food,

kill your children,

eat your flocks and herds,

eat the fruit on your grapevines and fig trees,

and destroy with the sword

the fortified towns you rely on.	Jer 5:14-17

18Yet even at that time,” the LORD says, “I won’t destroy you completely. 19When they say, ’Why has the LORD our God done this to us?’ tell them, ‘As you’ve left me and served foreign gods in your country, so you’ll serve foreigners in someone else’s country.’		   Jer 5:18-19

20“Tell Jacob, announce it in Judah, 						21‘Foolish, senseless people, listen to this,							you that have eyes, but don’t see,									and ears, but don’t hear,						22You’re not going to respect me?								You’re not going to tremble in my presence?’”								the LORD says.        	    	Jer 5:20-22a

“I’ve made sand a boundary for the ocean,							an eternal decree it can’t cross;				though the waves toss and roar,

they can’t wash over it.

23But my people have a stubborn, rebellious heart;						they’ve turned aside and left.

24They don’t say in their hearts,

‘Let’s respect the LORD our God,

who sends rain in its season,

autumn and spring,

who keeps for us

the set weeks for harvest.’	Jer 5:22b-24

25Your iniquities have deprived you of those things;

your sins have robbed you of them.

26Sinners among my people

lie in wait like fowlers in a blind;

they set traps to catch people.

27Like cages full of birds,

their houses are full of deceit;

that’s how they’ve become important and rich.

28They’re healthy and sleek,

excelling in sinful things.

29Won’t I punish them?

won’t I avenge myself on a nation like that?”

the LORD says.	Jer 5:25-29

30“A shocking, horrible thing is happening in the land;

31the prophets prophesy falsely,

the priests rule on their own authority,

and my people like it that way!

But how will this end for you?	Jer 5:30-31

Jerusalem Under Siege

6:1“People of Benjamin, get out of Jerusalem!

Blow a bugle in Tekoa,

sound the ram’s horn over Beth-haccerem,

because great destruction

looms down from the north.

2I’ll destroy attractive, delicate Zion.

3‘Shepherds’ [commanders] will lead their companies there

and pitch camps around it,

each with his own area to subdue.

4Get ready for war with it;

get up! attack at noon!

But misfortune would await us; it’s getting late;

shadows are getting longer.

5So get up! Let’s attack at night

and destroy its fortified towers.”	Jer 6:1-5

6The LORD of Hosts says,

“Cut down its trees;

build a siege wall against it.

Punish Jerusalem;

there’s nothing in it but oppression.

7As a well keeps its water fresh,

this city keeps its sinfulness fresh.

I hear violence and destruction in it;

its sickness and wounds are constantly evident to me.

8Jerusalem, pay attention to the warning,

or I’ll separate you from me

and make you desolate and unoccupied.”	Jer 6:6-8

9The LORD of Hosts says,

“They’ll thoroughly glean you like a remnant in Israel;

they’ll pass over you again

like someone that gathers grapes

picks over the branches one more time.”

10How should I warn them?

They’ve covered their ears and can’t listen;

any message from the LORD offends them.  		Jer 6:9-10

11But I’m full of the LORD’s anger;

I’m tired of holding it in!

“I’ll pour it out on children in the streets,

on groups of young men;

husbands and wives will both be taken,

the old and gray as well.

12Their houses will pass on to other people,

their fields and wives too,

because I’ll reach out against the people in the land.

13That’s because every one’s greedy								from least to greatest;

every one cheats										from prophet to priest.

14They try to bandage over my people’s wounds

by saying, ‘Everything’s all right,’ when it’s not.

15Are they ashamed of their disgusting acts?

Not at all. They can’t even blush;

so they’ll fall with the falling.

When I punish them,

I’ll cast them down,” the LORD says.	Jer 6:11-15

16The LORD said,

“Stand beside the road and ask where the ancient paths are;

ask where the good road is and walk on it;

you’ll find some rest.

But they say, ‘We’re not going to walk there.’

17I posted a watchman over you and said,

‘Listen to the bugle!’

But they said, ‘We don’t have to listen to it.’	Jer 6:16-17

18“So listen, nations;

know, community, what’s among them.

19Listen, earth; I’m going to bring disaster on them,						a disaster that results from their intentions,							because they ignored me									and wouldn’t accept my Law.

20Why offer me frankincense from Sheba

and calamus from some distant land?

Your burnt offerings aren’t acceptable;

your sacrifices don’t please me.”	Jer 6:18-20

21The LORD says,

“I’ll lay obstacles in front of my people

so they’ll trip over them;

Fathers and sons together,

neighbors and friends will perish.”	Jer 6:21

22The LORD says,

“A big army will rise up

from the remote parts of the world;

a nation will come from a land up north.

23They take up bow and spear;

they’re cruel with no mercy.

They roar like the ocean and ride on horses,

arrayed for battle against you, Zion."

24We’ve heard the report about them; our hands hang limp;

birth pangs have seized us like a woman in labor.

25Don’t go out in the field or walk on the road,

because the enemy has a sword;

they terrorize everywhere.

26Put on burlap, my people, and roll in ashes;

mourn like you would for an only son—

a bitter lamentation,

because the destroyer will come at you suddenly.	Jer 6:22-26

27“Jeremiah, I’ve made you an assayer among my people

so you can test them and know how they live.

28They’re stubborn and rebellious,

and go around slandering.

They’re as hardened as bronze and iron—

corrupt, every one.

29The bellows blow fiercely,

but the refining doesn’t purify;

the sinfulness does not burn off.

30Assay them as ‘rejected silver’

because the LORD has rejected them.”	Jer 6:27-30

7:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

Jeremiah Speaks at the Temple

2“Stand in the entrance to the LORD’s Temple and deliver this message, ‘Listen to a message from the LORD, all of you in Judah that go in these gates to worship him! 3If you mend your ways, I’ll let you live here. 4Don’t trust in these deceptive words, “This is the LORD’s Temple, the LORD’s Temple, the LORD’s Temple!” 5If you mend your ways

and practice goodness with one another,

6if you don’t oppress foreigners, orphans, or widows;

and don’t shed innocent blood here

or follow other gods to your own ruin—

7then I’ll let you keep living in this land that I gave your ancestors forever.

8“‘You’re trusting in deceiving words to no avail. 9Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, sacrifice to Baal, and follow other gods you’ve not known? 10Then will you come and try to depend on me in this Temple that wears my name, and think you’re safe—and go on doing those same detestable things? 11Do you regard this Temple as a den of thieves? I’ve seen for myself what it is.       			Jer 7:1-11

12“‘Go to Shiloh, which I identified myself with first. See what I did to it because my people sinned. 13Now you’ve done the same things. I spoke to you about them, getting up early and speaking to you, but you ignored me. I called you, but you wouldn’t answer. 14So, what I did to Shiloh I’ll do to the Temple that wears my name—that you trust in—and to the place I gave you and your ancestors. 15I’ll throw you out of my sight into exile like I did your relatives, Ephraim’s offspring.’

16“Don’t pray for my people, Jeremiah; don’t lift up a petition for them. Don’t intercede with me; I won’t listen. 17Don’t you see what they’re doing in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 18The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, the women knead dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven.  They pour out liquid offerings to other gods to spite me. 19Do they spite me? Aren’t they doing spite to themselves to their own disgrace? 20So I’ll pour out my anger on people and animals here, trees in the field and produce from the ground. It will burn and not be put out.          	Jer 7:12-20

21“Go on and add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat. 22When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn’t speak to them about burnt offerings and sacrifices so much as 23I commanded them, ‘Obey me, and I’ll be your God, and you’ll be my people. Follow the way I command you so things will go well for you.’ 24Yet they didn’t listen or obey. They followed their own ideas and conducted themselves according to their stubborn, sinful hearts. They went backward, not forward. 25From that time till now, I’ve sent you my prophets, getting up early every day and sending them. 26But you ignored me. You stiffened your neck and did more evil than your ancestors.         	   Jer 7:21-26

27“Tell them that, but they won’t listen; call to them, but they won’t answer. 28Tell them, ‘Truth has disappeared from this nation that didn’t obey the LORD their God or accept correction.

29‘Cut off your hair and throw it away;

take up a lamentation on the barren hills.

The LORD has rejected and abandoned

the generation he’s angry with.’

30“Judah has done what I’ve forbidden. Its people have put their detestable things in the Temple that wears my name and defiled it. 31They’ve built high places in Topheth in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, and burned their sons and daughters, which I didn’t command. Such a thing never entered my mind! 32So the time’s coming when it won’t be called Topheth anymore, or The Valley of (Ben)Hinnom. They’ll call it The Valley of Slaughter because they’ll bury in Topheth till there’s no place left to bury. 33Those people’s dead bodies will feed the birds and animals, and nobody will chase them away. 34Then I’ll put a stop to the joy and happiness, the voices of bride and groom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. The land will lie in ruins.”      	Jer 7:27-34

8:1The LORD says,

“At that time, they’ll bring out of their graves the bones of Judah’s kings, its officials, priests, prophets, and the people of Jerusalem. 2They’ll spread them out to the sun, moon, and stars, which they’ve loved, served, and worshiped. They won’t be gathered up or buried. They’ll be like manure on the ground. 3The remnant of this evil family will chose death rather than life.  	Jer 8:1-3

Sin and Treachery

4“Tell them, ‘The LORD says,

“When people fall down,

don’t they get back up?

When they get off course,

don’t they get back on it?”

5Why then do my people, Jerusalem,

turn away and keep backsliding?

They hang onto deceit and refuse to return.

6I’ve been listening to what they’re saying,

and it’s not right.

Nobody’s repented or said,

‘What have I done?!’

Everybody keeps up their old habits

like a horse charging into battle.

7Even a stork in the sky knows when to migrate;

so does a turtledove, swift, or thrush.

But my people don’t know my patterns of living.	Jer 8:4-7

8“How can you say, ‘We’re wise;

we have the LORD’s Law’?

The scribes’ lying pen

makes a lie out of it.

9The wise are put to shame;

they’re intimidated and trapped.

They’ve rejected the LORD’s word;

so what kind of wisdom do they have?

10So I’ll give their wives to other people

and their fields to conquerors;

because every one is greedy

from least to greatest;

every one cheats

from prophet to priest.

11They try to bandage over my people’s wounds					by saying, ‘Everything’s all right,’ when it’s not.

12“Are they ever ashamed of their disgusting acts?					Not at all! They can’t even blush;							so they’ll fall among the fallen

when I punish them,” the LORD says. 		Jer 8:8-12

13“When I snatch them away,									there won’t be any grapes left on the vine								or figs on the tree,										and their leaves will wither;								what I’ve given them will be gone.”						14Why are we sitting here?									Let’s get to fortified cities to die;

the LORD our God has doomed us

by giving us poisoned water to drink.

15We looked for peace, but it didn’t come;

we waited for healing, but terror came.	Jer 8:13-15

16From Dan we can hear the horses snorting;

at the sound of his stallions’ neighing

the whole land quakes;

they’re coming to devastate the land

and everything in it,

the city and its people.

17“I’m sending ‘snakes’ [troops] among you,

adders you can’t charm,

and they’ll bite you,”		the LORD says.		Jer 8:16-17

Jeremiah Mourns over Sinful Judah

18My sorrow can’t be healed;

my heart is sick!

19Listen! It’s my people’s outcry from a distant land:

“Isn’t the LORD in Zion?

Isn’t its king there?”

“Why have they made me angry

with their carved images and foreign idols?”

20“Harvest is past, summer’s over;

and we’re not saved.”	Jer 8:18-20

21I’m hurting for my people’s hurt;

I mourn, panic has seized me.

22Isn’t there any salve in Gilead?

Isn’t there any doctor there?

Why hasn’t my people’s health been restored?	Jer 8:21-22

9:1Oh that my head was a body of water

and my eyes a fountain of tears,

so I could weep day and night

for my people slain!

2I wish I had an inn in the desert,

so I could escape from my people;

because they’re all adulterers, a pack of liars.

3“They bend their tongues like bows;

lies, not truth, dominate the land.

The people move from one sin to another;

they don’t know me. 	Jer 9:1-3

4“Be leery of your neighbor;

don’t trust your own brother,

because every brother takes advantage of brother

and every neighbor slanders.

5They all deceive their friends;

nobody tells the truth.

They’ve taught their tongues how to lie;

they wear themselves out sinning.

6They live in deceit;

by deceiving, they refuse to know me,”

the LORD says.    	Jer 9:4-6

Judgment for Disobedience

7So he says:

“I’ll refine them and assay them;

what else can I do with them?

8Their tongues are deadly arrows that deceive;

they talk peace to one another,

but inside they’re setting an ambush for them.

9Am I not going to punish them for such things

and avenge myself on a nation like that?			Jer 9:7-9

10“I’ll weep and wail for the mountains

and take up a dirge for the pastures,

because they’re laid waste, so nobody travels that way.

Nobody hears cattle bawling;

birds and animals have left.

11I’ll make Jerusalem a pile of ruins, a den for jackals,

and the towns in Judah ghost towns.”	Jer 9:10-11

12Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is the LORD talking to that can pass it on? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert nobody travels through? 13The LORD answers,

“They’ve abandoned the Law I set before them;

they haven’t followed it or obeyed me.

14They’ve followed Baal and their stubborn heart

like their ancestors taught them.

15So I’ll feed them bitter plants to eat

and give them poisoned water to drink.

16I’ll scatter them among nations

they and their ancestors never knew,

and chase them with the sword till I’ve wiped them out.” Jer 9:12-16

17The LORD of Hosts says:

“Call for mourners;

call for wailing women!

18Have them hurry and raise up wailing for us

so our eyes shed tears

and our eyelids flow with water.

19There is wailing in Zion,

‘We’re ruined!

We’re disgraced

because we’ve left our country,

and they’ve torn down our houses.’”

20Listen to the LORD’s message, women;

your ears need to hear what he has to say.

Teach your daughters how to wail;

teach your friends a dirge.

21Death has come up into our windows

and climbed into our houses;

it’s killed our children in the streets

and our young men in the town squares.

22Say, “The LORD says,

‘Corpses will fall like manure in the pasture,

like bundles behind the reaper;

but nobody will gather them up.’”	Jer 9:17-22

23The LORD says,

“Don’t let the wise brag about their wisdom,

or the strong boast of their strength.

or the rich gloat over their wealth.

24Instead, they need to take pride

in knowing I’m the LORD

who practices enduring love, justice, and goodness in the world,

because that’s what I delight in.

25“The time’s coming when I’ll punish everyone that’s circumcised in body but not in heart—26Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and the ones in the desert that cut the corners of their hair.

All the nations are uncircumcised;

everyone in Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”     	Jer 9:23-26

God and Idols

10:1Listen to the message the LORD’s giving you, Israel:

2“Don’t pick up the ways other nations live;

don’t let the signs in the sky

terrify you that terrify them.

3Their customs are delusions.

They cut down a tree in the woods,

and their craftsmen carve it with a tool;

4they decorate it with silver and gold

and fasten it down with hammer and nails

so it won’t shift.

5Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber patch.

They can’t talk;

they can’t walk, so they have to be carried!

Don’t be afraid of them;

they can’t do any good or harm.”	Jer 10:1-5

6There’s none like you, LORD;

you’re great and powerful.

7Who wouldn’t respect you, King of nations?

It’s your due!

There’s no one like you among

the wise in any kingdom.

8But their instruction is completely foolish;

they’re nothing but wood!

9People bring beaten silver from Tarshish

and gold from Uphaz;

craftsmen and goldsmiths make the idols;

they dress them in violet and purple,

artisans’ work.

10But the LORD is a real God,

a living God and everlasting King.

The ground shakes at his anger;

the nations can’t endure his indignation.	Jer 10:6-10

11Tell them this: “The gods that didn’t make earth and sky

will perish from it.”

12He’s the One that made the earth by his power,

that built the world by his wisdom,

that stretched out the sky by his intelligence.

13When he speaks, there’s thunder in the rain above;

he makes clouds come up from the horizon,

makes lightning for the rain,

and sends wind out of his storehouses.

14Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;

idols disgrace their goldsmiths,

because molten images misrepresent;

they can’t even breathe.

15They’re worthless objects to ridicule;

when they’re punished, they perish.

16Jacob’s portion is not like them;

his God has made everything;

Israel is his inheritance;

his name is Yahveh of Hosts.	Jer 10:11-16

The Looming Destruction

17Pick up your baggage,

you that live under siege!

18The LORD says,

“I’m tossing out the people that live here

and causing them distress

so no one can find them later.”	Jer 10:17-18

19I’m hurt and my wound can’t heal;

it’s pain I have to bear.

20My tent’s destroyed;

its guy ropes have snapped.

My children are gone;

they don’t exist anymore.

There’s nobody to set up my tent again

or hang my curtains.

21The shepherds don’t use any sense;

they don’t look to the LORD;

so they haven’t prospered,

and their flock has scattered.

22There’s a loud uproar in the north

that’s headed for the towns in Judah

to make them desolate, dens for jackals.	Jer 10:19-22

Jeremiah’s Prayer

23I know, LORD, that we don’t set our own way;

when we walk, we don’t set the direction of our steps.

24Correct me, but in due measure,

not with your anger, or you’d destroy me.

25Pour out your anger on nations that don’t know you,

on families that don’t call on you;

because they’ve devastated Jacob

and laid waste his homeland.	Jer 10:23-25

11:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

Judah’s Broken Covenant

2“Listen to this covenant and tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem 3that the LORD God of Israel says, ‘People are under a curse who ignore the covenant 4that I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the iron furnace. I said, “If you listen to what I’m telling you, you’ll be my people, and I’ll be your God.”  5Doing what I tell you confirms the oath I swore to give you a land flowing with milk and honey, like it is now.’”

I answered, “Yes, LORD.”

6He told me,

“Deliver this message in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, ‘Do what the covenant says. 7From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt till now, I solemnly and persistently warned them to listen to me, 8but they didn‘t. They followed their own stubborn hearts. So I brought on them what the terms of the covenant warned would happen if they didn’t keep it.’”   	  Jer 11:1-8

9Then the LORD said,

“I’ve found mutiny among the people in Judah and Jerusalem. 10They’ve returned to their ancestors’ sins by going after other gods. Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers. 11So I’m going to bring a disaster they can’t escape. Even if they call out to me, I’ll ignore them. 12Then the towns in Judah and the people in Jerusalem will call out to the gods they burn incense to, but they won’t save them when disaster comes. 13Judah, you have as many gods as towns. You have as many incense altars to Baal as you have streets in Jerusalem.

14“So, Jeremiah, don’t pray for my people or lift up a cry for them in this disaster. 15What right does my beloved have to live in my house when she’s done so many disgusting things? Can sacrificing meat make her disaster go away and make her happy?”        		  Jer 11:9-15

16The LORD once called you a green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form. With the noise of a great fury, he’s set it on fire and burned up its branches. 17Israel and Judah, the LORD of Hosts that planted you has pronounced disaster on you because you’ve provoked him by burning incense to Baal.

A Plot Against Jeremiah

18LORD, I found out from you their plots against me.

19I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter;

I didn’t know they’d said,

“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit;

let’s cut him off from the land of the living

so nobody remembers him.”

20But, LORD of Hosts, who judges justly,

who tries heart and mind,

let me see you pay them back,

because I’ve turned my worries over to you.	    	Jer 11:16-20

21So this is what the LORD says about the ones in Anathoth that tell me they’ll kill me if I prophesy in his name:

22“Their young men will die by the sword;

their boys and girls will starve to death;

23None of them will survive the disaster

l’m bringing to punish them.”        	Jer 11:21-23

Jeremiah’s Complaint

12:1You render justice, LORD,

so I’ll argue my case to you.

Why do the wicked prosper,

and the devious live in ease?

2You planted them and they took root;

they grew and bore fruit.

You’re near their lips

but far from their mind.

3But, LORD, you know me;

you see me.

You examine my attitude toward you.

Drag them off like sheep for slaughter;

set them apart to be butchered.

4How long will the land mourn

and the pastures wither?

The animals and birds have disappeared

because the people there are sinners

that say, “He doesn’t see what’s in store for us.”	Jer 12:1-4

God’s Reply

5“If racing against men wears yousg out,

how can you compete with horses?

If you fall down on cleared ground,

how will you fair in the jungle by the Jordan?

6Even the members of your own family

have turned against you and yelled at you;

don’t trust them even if they say nice things to you.	Jer 12:5-6

7“I’ve abandoned my Temple,

forsaken my permanent possession,

and delivered my loved ones to their enemies.

8My permanent possession has roared at me

like a lion in the woods,

and I’ve detested them.

9Is my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?

Are birds of prey swooping at it from every direction?

Round up the wild animals;

bring them to gorge!	Jer 12:7-9

10Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard;

they’ve tramped down my field

and made it barren.

11They’ve made it desolate;

it mourns to me.

The whole country has become a wasteland

because nobody’s taking care of it.

12Destroying armies have come

on all the barren hills.

The sword of the LORD is devouring

from one end of the land to another;

there’s no peace for anybody.

13They’ve sown wheat and reaped thorns;

they’ve worn themselves out for nothing.

Be ashamed of your harvest

because of the LORD’s fierce anger.”	Jer 12:10-13

A Message for Israel’s Neighbors

14This is what the LORD says about neighboring nations that strike at my people’s inheritance:

“I’m about to uproot them from their lands along with Judah. 15But afterward I’ll relent and bring these nations back to their territories. 16Then, if they’ll learn to swear by me, ‘As sure as the Lord lives,’ like they taught my people to swear by Baal, I’ll let them live among my people. 17But any nation that won’t listen, I’ll uproot and destroy.”	Jer 12:14-17

The Ruined Linen Loincloth

13:1The LORD told me, “Go buy a linen waistcloth and put it on. Don’t wash it.”

2So I bought one and put it on.

3Then he said,

4“Take it to the Euphrates and hide it in a crevice in a rock.” 5So I went and hid it there. 6A long time later the LORD told me to go get it. 7I went and dug it out of where I’d put it. It was ruined.

8Then he told me,

9“This waistcloth illustrates how I’ll ruin arrogant Judah and Jerusalem. 10These people are following their own stubborn hearts in serving and bowing to other gods; they won’t be good for anything—like this waistcloth. 11As it clings to a person’s waist, so I made Israel and Judah for clinging to me so they could be my people, a name, praise, and glory; but they’ve ignored me. 	   Jer 13:1-11

12“So tell them that the LORD God of Israel says to fill every jug with wine. When they say, ‘Don’t we very well know how to do that?’ 13then say, ‘The LORD says, “I’m about to make everybody drunk in this land, from kings on David’s throne, to priests and prophets, and the residents in Jerusalem! 14I’ll pit them against one another, even parents against children. Pitying, feeling sorry, having compassion won’t keep me from destroying them.”’” 	  Jer 13:12-14

Exile Threatened

15Listen; don’t be proud;

the LORD has spoken.

16Honor him

before he brings darkness,

before you stumble on the darkened mountains.

If you look for light then,

he’ll turn it into darkness and gloom.

17If you don’t listen,

my soul will sob in secret,

my eyes will weep bitterly,

tears will run down my cheeks

because the LORD’s flock’s been captured.

18Tell the king and queen mother,

“Take a low seat,

because your beautiful crown

has been taken from your head.”

19The towns in the Negev will be closed;

nobody will be able to open them;

Judah will go into exile.		Jer 13:15-19

A Prayer for Healing

20“Look who’s coming from the north.

Where are the beautiful sheep

of the flock you were given?

21What will you say when the LORD appoints over you

former allies that you taught?

Won’t pains come on you

like a woman in childbirth?

22If you say to yourself,

‘Why has this happened to me?’

It’s because of how sinful you are

that your skirt has been torn off,

and you’re being raped.

23Can a Nubian change the color of his skin

or a leopard change its spots?

Then can you do good

that have the habit of doing evil?

24So I’ll scatter you like chaff in the desert wind.

25That’s the lot I’ve measured out to you,” the LORD says, 		Jer 13:20-25a

“because you’ve forgotten me and trusted in lies.

26So I have stripped your skirt off over your face

to show your shame.

27I’ve seen your detestable deeds:

your adulteries and neighing,

your lewd prostitution right out in the open on the hills.

Misfortune awaits you, Jerusalem!

How long will you stay defiled?”		Jer 13:25b-27

14:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

About the Drought

2“In Judah’s towns,

commerce has died off at their gates;

the people sit on the ground mourning;

their outcry goes up from Jerusalem.

3Nobles send servants to draw water,

but the cisterns are dry.

They come back with empty pots,

demoralized and covering their heads.	Jer 14:1-3

4The ground is cracked

because there’s been no rain;

farmers are demoralized, too, and cover their heads.

5Does out in the country

are abandoning their newborn fawns

because there’s no grass.

6Donkeys stand on the barren hills

and pant for air like jackals;

their eyes are blurry

because there’s no grass.”	Jer 14:4-6

7The people say,

“Although our iniquities show that we’re guilty, LORD,

at least do something for your reputation.

Yes, we’re guilty of countless apostasies;

we’ve sinned against you.

8Israel’s Hope, our Savior in distress,

why are you acting like a foreigner to us

or a traveler just pitching his tent for the night?

9Why are you like someone overwhelmed,

like a strong man that can’t rescue?

Yet you’re among us, LORD;

we’re identified with you;

don’t abandon us!”	Jer 14:7-9

10The LORD answers,

“They like to wander;

they don’t watch where they’re going.

So I don’t accept them as mine;

I remember their iniquity

and take account of their sins.”	Jer 14:10

11The LORD told me, “Don’t pray for them. 12I’ll ignore their outcry when they fast. When they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won’t accept them. I’ll put an end to them with sword, famine, and disease.”

13But I said, “Lord GOD, the prophets are telling them they won’t see sword or famine, that you’ll give them lasting peace here.”

14He answered, “The prophets are prophesying falsely in my name. I haven’t spoken to them. They’re prophesying false visions, worthless fortunetelling, the deceptions in their own minds. 15Though I haven’t sent them, they keep saying there won’t be sword or famine here. So they’ll meet their end by sword and famine! 16The people they’re prophesying to will be victims thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem. There won’t be anybody to bury them, their wives, or children. I’ll pour out their own wickedness on them.	   Jer 14:11-16

17“Tell them this,

‘My eyes flow with tears

day and night without end

because the young virgin—my people—

has been struck a powerful blow;

she has a severely infected wound.

18If I go out in the country,

there are corpses slain by the sword.

If I go in the city,

there’s famine and disease

because prophet and priest ply their trade in the land

and they don’t know what they’re doing.’”	Jer 14:17-18

19Have you completely rejected Judah?

Do you despise Zion?

Why wound us so bad we can’t heal?

We waited for peace, but nothing good came;

we hoped for healing, but terror came instead!

20We know we’re ungodly, LORD;

we know about our ancestors’ sin;

we’ve sinned against you too.

21For your own reputation, don’t despise us;

don’t bring disgrace on your glorious throne

or annul your covenant with us.

22Can any nation’s idols bring rain?

Can the sky grant showers?

Isn’t that from you, LORD our God?

So we’re putting our hope in you

because you can do that. 	Jer 14:19-22

The LORD Will Not Relent

15:1Then the LORD told me,

“Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here, my heart wouldn’t be with this nation. Send them away! 2If they ask you where to go, tell them the LORD says,

‘Those destined for death, go to death!

Those destined for the sword, go to the sword!

Those destined for famine, go to famine!

Those destined for captivity, go to captivity!’

3I’ll send four kinds of destruction on you: the sword to slay, dogs to drag away, buzzards to devour, and scavengers to consume. 4I’ll see that the kingdoms abhor you because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.		           		          		  Jer 15:1-4

5Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?

Who’s going to cry for you

or come to ask how you’re doing?

6You’ve left me and keep getting worse;

so I’ll go ahead and destroy you;

I’m tired of holding back.

7I’ll winnow you with a winnowing fork

at the country’s ports of entry.

I’ll bereave you of your children

and destroy you as my people

because you refuse to turn back from your ways.

8You’ll have more widows than sand by the sea;

I’ll bring at you a destroyer at noon,

mother of young men,

and suddenly bring down anguish and dread on you.

9She that bore seven sons will pine away

and gasp for breath.

Her sun will set in the daytime;

she’ll be disgraced and humiliated.

So I’ll turn any survivors over

to their enemies’ sword,” the LORD says.	Jer 15:5-9

Jeremiah’s Complaint

10“Misfortune awaits me, mother that bore me

to experience conflict in the world!

I haven’t lent or borrowed;

yet everybody curses me.”

11The LORD said, “I’ll set you free for good;

I’ll make your enemy appeal to you

when disaster and distress come.

12Can anybody smash iron,

the iron from the north, or bronze?	Jer 15:10-12

13Because of your sins within your borders, I’ll give away your wealth and treasures as plunder free of charge. 14Your enemies will take it to a country you don’t know about, because my anger has been fired up. It’ll burn you up.”

15“LORD, you know me; remember me; notice me;

take vengeance on my persecutors.

In light of your patience, don’t let me die young;

remember that I’m dealing with disgrace to honor you.

16When I discovered your words, I devoured them;

they became a delight to me

because I wear your name,

Yahveh God of hosts.		Jer 15:13-16

17I didn’t sit with the revelers;

because your hand was on me, I sat by myself,

filled with indignation over their sin.

18Why does my pain persist?

Why don’t my wounds heal?

Are you going to be like a seasonal stream

we can’t depend on?”	Jer 15:17-18

19So the LORD says,

“If you’ll come back, I’ll restore you;

you can stand in my presence.

If you’ll separate the precious from the worthless,

you can become my spokesman.

They may turn on you,

but don’t turn on them.

20Then for my people I’ll make you

into a fortified wall made out of bronze;

though they fight you, they won’t win

because I’ll save you.

21I’ll keep you away from sinners

and rescue you from cruel people.”	Jer 15:19-21

16:1A Message from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,

That Came to Me

Day of Disaster

2“Don’t get married or have children here.” 3This is what the LORD says about children born here and their parents,

4“They’ll die from disease,

not mourned or buried.

They’ll come to an end by sword and famine,

and lie like manure on the ground.

Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky

and the scavengers on the ground.			           Jer 16:1-4

5“Don’t go in a house to mourn with people, cry, or console them. From this nation I’ve withdrawn my peace, my enduring love, my mercy. 6From least to greatest will die in the land. There won’t be any friends to bury them, mourn for them, cut themselves, or shave their head for them. 7People won’t offer them a meal to comfort them in mourning or give them a cup to drink to console them for their father or mother.  8Don’t go to sit and eat with them. 9I’m going to eliminate celebration and happiness here, the happy voices of bride and groom.     	  Jer 16:5-9

10“When you tell people that, they’ll say, ‘Why has the LORD our God declared so much catastrophe on us? What did we do to him?’ 11Tell them, ‘Your ancestors abandoned me for other gods, bowed to them, served them, and didn’t keep my Law. 12You’ve done worse than they did, following your own stubborn hearts and ignoring me. 13So I’m going to expel you from this land to one where you and your ancestors have never been. You’ll serve other gods there because I won’t help you.

Hope Despite Disaster

14“The time’s coming when people won’t swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ 15They’ll swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives who brought the Israelites back from the countries up north where he’d banished them.’ I will return them to the land I gave their ancestors.

16“I’ll send lots of fishermen to fish for them, lots of hunters to hunt for them in every mountain, hill, and cave. 17I see what they’re doing; their sin’s not hid from me. 18But first I’ll doubly repay their sin because they’ve polluted my permanent possession with the carcasses of their detestable idols and carved images.” 				Jer 16:10-18

Hope Despite Disaster

19 LORD, my strength and fortress

my refuge in troubled times,

nations around the world will come to you and say,

“We didn’t inherit anything but lies from our ancestors,

foolish idols that can’t do anything.”

20Can mortals make gods?

Things like that aren’t gods! 	Jer 16:19-20

21So the LORD says,

“Now I’ll show them my strength and power;

at last they’ll learn that I’m The LORD.”	Jer 16:21

Judah’s Sin

17:1“Judah’s sin is recorded with an iron stylus;

with a diamond point it’s engraved on their heart

and the horns on their altars.

2As well as they remember their children,

they remember their pagan altars and Asherah poles

beside every green tree on the tall hills.

3My mountain in the open country,

I’ll give your wealth and treasures for spoil

as the price for your sin throughout your territory.

4You’ll voluntarily let go of the inheritance I gave you;

I’ll make you serve your enemies	in a foreign land

because you’ve sparked my anger

that will keep burning.”	Jer 17:1-4

5The LORD says,

“People are under a curse who trust in other people,

who rely on physical strength,

who turn their hearts away from me.

6They’re like a tamarisk shrub in the desert

that won’t flourish;

they’ll live in stony wastes,

in a salted land with no inhabitants.

7Fortunate are the people that trust in the LORD,

that put their faith in him.

8They’re like a tree planted by water

that sends down its roots

and doesn’t worry when hot weather comes.

Its leaves stay green;

it doesn’t worry about a year-long drought;

it keeps bearing fruit.	Jer 17:5-8

9“The heart is more deceitful than anything;

it’s desperately corrupt.

Who can make sense of it?

10I, the LORD, search hearts and test minds

to repay everyone according to their deeds

as measured by consequences.			Jer 17:9-10

Jeremiah’s Trust in God

11People that make a fortune unjustly

are like a partridge that gathers a brood she didn’t hatch;

in midlife they’ll lose their wealth

and in the end be fools.”

12From the beginning, our sanctuary

has been a glorious throne on high.

13 LORD, hope of Israel,

everybody that leaves you ends up disgraced;

a record will be kept of those who turn away on earth

because they’ve left the LORD, the spring of fresh water.

14 LORD, I’ll be healed if you heal me;

I’ll be saved if you save me;

you’re the only one I praise.

15They keep asking to me,

“Where’s a message from the LORD?

Let it come now!”

16But I haven’t hurried away from serving as your shepherd;

I haven’t desired a time for disaster, as you know.

Whatever I said, I said to your face.

17Don’t be a terror to me;

you’re my refuge in disaster.

18Disgrace those who harass me;

don’t let me be the one disgraced.

Bring disaster on them;

crush them with double disaster!	Jer 17:11-18

Observing the Sabbath

19The LORD told me,

“Go stand in the gate that Judah’s kings use, and in the other gates around Jerusalem. 20Say, ‘Listen to the LORD’s message, Judah, kings of Judah, people living in Jerusalem who use these gates: 21For your own good, don’t carry any load on the Sabbath or bring anything in through these gates. 22Don’t carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or work. Set the Sabbath aside like I told your ancestors. 23But they stiffened their necks and wouldn’t follow directions.	       	      		    		     Jer 17:19-23

24“’Listen carefully and don’t carry any load through this city’s gates on the Sabbath. Set it aside by resting on it. 25Then through these gates will come kings and officials who sit on David’s throne, who ride in chariots and on horses, people of Judah and Jerusalem. People will live in this city permanently. 26They’ll come in from the towns in Judah and places around Jerusalem, from Benjamin, the western foothills, the hill country, and the Negev. They’ll bring thanksgiving sacrifices to the LORD’s Temple. 27If you don’t set the Sabbath aside, I’ll light a fire in Jerusalem’s gates. It will spread to the palaces in Jerusalem, and it won’t be put out.’”	      		   Jer 17:24-27

18:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

The Potter’s Shop

2“Go down to the potter’s shop. I’ll give you my message there.”

3When I got down to his shop, he was there, working at his wheel. 4But the jar he was making with his hands didn’t come out the way he wanted; so he made another one out of it that he was satisfied with.	        	  Jer 18:1-4

5Then the LORD’s message came to me:

6“Israel, can’t I deal with you like this potter did? You’re like clay in my hands. 7At one time I might talk about uprooting, tearing down, or destroying a nation. 8If it turns from its sin, I’ll relent. 9At another time I might talk about planting it or building it up. 10If it doesn’t obey, I’ll change my mind about the good I was going to do for it. 11So tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘I’m preparing a catastrophe for you. Turn back from your sinful lives, every one of you. Reform your ways and deeds.’

12“But they say, ‘We’re not going to do that! We’re going to make our own plans and do what we want to!’” 		      	                    Jer 18:5-12

13So the LORD says,

‘Ask around the nations;

who ever heard of anything like that?

The virgin Israel has done something terrible.

14Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave

the rocky mountaintops out in the open country?

Does the cold, flowing mountain water ever dry up?

15My people have forgotten me

and burn incense to foreign gods;

they stumble off their ancient ways

to walk on footpaths instead of a good road.

16They end up making their land desolate,

something for other people to mock;

everybody that goes by just shake their heads at.

17I’ll scatter them ahead of their enemies like an east wind

and turn my back on them when disaster comes.’”	Jer 18:13-17

The Potter’s House

18Then they said,

“Let’s lay a plot to stop Jeremiah.

We’ll still have the Law through our priests;

we can get our advice from other advisors;

the message can come from other prophets!

Let’s spread rumors about him

and ignore what he says.”

19“Listen, LORD;

do you hear what my opponents are saying!?

20Should people repay good with bad?

They’ve dug a pit to put me in.

Remember how I stood in your presence

to speak good on their behalf

and turn your anger away from them.	Jer 18:18-20

21So let their children starve;

deliver them to the sword.

Have their wives become childless widows;

let their husbands be struck down

and their young men die in battle.

22May they scream in their houses

when raiders suddenly break into them,

because they’ve dug a pit to capture me

and hidden snares for me to step in.

23LORD, you know about their deadly designs against me.

Don’t forgive their iniquity;

don’t blot out their sin;

overthrow them in anger!”				Jer 18:21-23

Jeremiah’s Broken Flask

19:1The LORD says,

“Go buy a clay pot. Take some elders and senior priests along 2to the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom by the entrance to the Potsherd Gate. Deliver my message there, 3‘Listen to a message from the LORD, kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. I’m about to bring such catastrophe here that will make everybody’s ears ring when they hear about it. 4You’ve abandoned me and made this a foreign place, and burned sacrifices here to gods that you, your ancestors, and the kings of Judah never knew. You’ve filled it with innocent people’s blood 5and built high places for Baal so you can burn your sons as offerings to him. I never commanded that. Such a thing never even entered my mind! 6So the time’s coming when this place won’t be called Topheth or The Valley of (Ben)Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter. 7I’ll void the plans that Judah and Jerusalem have. I’ll make them fall by the sword and give their carcasses to buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 8This city will be desolate, something to gasp at. Everybody that goes by will marvel at its disaster. 9They’ll eat their sons and daughters during the siege and distress their enemies bring on them.’       	Jer 19:1-9

10“Then break the pot in front of the men that go with you. 11Say, ‘The LORD of Hosts says, “Just like a shattered potter’s jug you can’t repair, I’ll shatter this nation and this city. They’ll bury people in Topheth; there won’t be any place else to bury them. [12] 13Their houses, including the kings’ palace, will be defiled like Topheth, because on their roofs they burned sacrifices to the host of heaven and poured out liquid offerings to other gods.”’”

14Jeremiah came back from Topheth and spoke to the people in the court of the LORD’s Temple,

15“The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m about to bring on this city and surrounding towns the entire catastrophe I’ve declared against it. You’ve stiffened your necks and ignored me.’”	Jer 19:10-15

Jeremiah and Pashur

20:1When Pashhur son of Immer, the priest in charge of the LORD’s Temple, heard Jeremiah prophesying that, 2he had him beaten and put in stocks at the upper Benjamin Gate of the Temple. 3The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah told him,

“The LORD doesn’t call you Pashhur, but The Man Surrounded by Terror. 4He says, ‘I’m going to make you a terror to yourself and your friends. While you watch, they’ll fall by their enemies’ sword. I’ll turn Judah over to the king of Babylon to carry away and kill. 5I’ll turn over this city’s wealth, its produce, its expensive things, the treasures of Judah’s kings to take to Babylon. 6Pashhur, you, everybody in your house, and the friends you’ve falsely prophesied for will go into captivity and be buried in Babylon.’”   	Jer 20:1-6

Jeremiah’s Complaint

7“LORD, you’ve deceived me;

you’re stronger than I am and have prevailed.

I’m a laughingstock all day long;

everybody makes fun of me.

8When I speak, I cry out

violence and destruction.

Because of me your message has led

to constant disgrace and derision.

9But if I say, ‘I won’t remember him

or speak in his name anymore,’

my heart burns inside me

like fire in my bones.

I get tired of trying to hold it in;

I can’t endure it.	Jer 20:7-9

10I’ve heard many whispering,

‘There’s terror everywhere!

Denounce him; let’s denounce him!’

My trusted friends watch for my downfall and say,

‘Maybe he’ll make a mistake

so we can take revenge on him.’

11But you’re with me like a dreaded warrior,

so the ones that persecute me will trip and fall.

They’ll be totally ashamed because they’ll fail

with a disgrace people won’t forget.

12LORD of Hosts, you that test the godly,

who see the heart and mind,

let me watch you take revenge on them

because I’ve turned my concerns over to you.”

13Sing praise to the LORD!

he delivers the poor from their oppressors.		Jer 20:10-13

14Curse the day I was born;

don’t celebrate the day my mother bore me!

15Curse the one that told my father,

“You have a baby!” and made him so happy.

16Let that man be like the cities

the LORD overthrew without restraint.

Terrify him with a morning battle cry,

a shout of alarm at noon,

17because he didn’t kill me before I was born

and make my mother my tomb—

make her womb pregnant forever.

18Why was I ever born

to see trouble, sorrow, and shame? 			Jer 20:14-18

21:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

When King Zedekiah Sent Him Pashhur Son of Malchijah

and Zephaniah the Priest, Son of Maaseiah

Jerusalem to Fall to Nebuchadnezzar

2“Inquire from the LORD for us; Nebuchadnezzar is attacking us. Maybe the LORD will show us one of his wonderful acts so our enemy will withdraw.”

Jer 21:1-2

3Jeremiah told them,

“Tell Zedekiah 4that the LORD God of Israel says, ‘I’m going to make your weapons useless for fighting those who are laying siege outside the wall. I’ll let them come to the center of the city. 5I’ll fight you myself with outstretched hand and strong arm in anger, wrath, and fury. 6I’ll strike down people and animals with a severe plague. 7After that, I’ll turn over to Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah, his officials, and people that survive the sword, famine, and disease. He won’t spare, he won’t pity, he won’t have mercy.’          	Jer 21:3-7

8“Tell the people the LORD says, ‘I’m giving you a choice, a way to live and a way to die. 9If you stay in the city, you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease. If you surrender, you’ll have your life as the reward of war. 10I’ve decided to give this city to the king of Babylon to burn.’          	  Jer 21:8-10

11“Tell the king of Judah’s household, ‘Listen to the LORD’s message, 12dynasty of David:

“Render justice every morning;

deliver from their oppressors those being robbed

so my anger won’t flare

and burn with nobody to put it out

because of your sins.			   	  Jer 21:11-12

13“I’m against you, Jerusalem,

you that live above the valley in that rocky fortress,

you that say, ‘Who can touch us up here?

Nobody can break in where we live.’

14I’ll punish you in proportion to your sin;

I’ll set a fire in your forest

and burn up everything around you.”’”		     Jer 21:13-14

Message About Judah’s Kings

22:1The LORD says,

“Go to the king’s palace in Judah and say, 2‘Listen to this message from the LORD, king of Judah on David’s throne—you, your officials, and your people that come in these gates. 3“Be just and good. Deliver from their oppressors those who’ve been robbed. Don’t mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, or shed innocent blood here.  4If you do that, kings who sit on David’s throne will come in these palace gates with attendants riding in chariots and on horses. 5If you won’t, I swear by myself that this palace will be empty.”’”

6He says this about the king of Judah’s palace:

“You’re like Gilead to me,

like the top of Lebanon;

yet I’ll make a desert out of you,

an empty city.

7I’ll send destroyers against you with their weapons

to cut down your best cedars

and throw them in the fire.				        Jer 22:1-7

8“Nations will pass this city and say, ‘Why did the LORD do that to this great city?’ 9People will answer, ‘Because they abandoned his covenant with them and served other gods.’

10“Don’t mourn for the dead king;

weep bitterly for the one that’s leaving;

he’ll never come back to see his native land.”	Jer 22:8-10

Message About Jehoahaz

11This is what the LORD says about Shallum/Jehoahaz son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father and was exiled from here:

“He’s never coming back;

12where he goes is where he’ll die.

Message About Jehoiakim

13“Misfortune awaits Jehoiakim

that’s built his palace with forced labor,

his upper rooms with injustice:								he made his countrymen work for him for nothing;							14he said, ‘I’ll build myself a grand palace									      with large upper rooms, 									            cut out windows for it,											panel it with cedar,											and paint it red.’			Jer 22:11-14 		15Do you think you’re a king because you traffic in cedar?					Didn’t your father eat and drink,									do justice and goodness?									Things went well for him.							16He defended the poor and needy;

isn’t that what it means to know me?						17But you have eyes and heart									only for your own dishonest gain,								for shedding innocent blood,									for practicing oppression and violence.”		Jer 22:15-17

18So the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:

“They won’t mourn for him, as in								‘My brother,’ ‘My sister!’						  They won’t mourn for him, as in								‘My master’ or ‘He had such splendor!’							19They’ll bury him like a donkey,								dragged off and thrown out of Jerusalem.				20Go up to Lebanon and cry out;									shout in Bashan.

Cry out from Abarim											because your lovers have been destroyed.				21I spoke to you in your prosperity;								but you said, ‘I don’t have to do that!’							That’s the way you’ve acted since you were young.	Jer 22:18-21		22The wind will blow your allies away;								your buddies will go into captivity.							Your sinfulness will disgrace you.							23You that live nested in cedars from Lebanon,							how you’ll groan when pangs come on you								like a woman in childbirth!

Message About Jehoiachin

24“As I live,” the LORD says, “even if you, Coniah/Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I’d pull you off 25and hand you to the executioners you dread: Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. 26I’ll expel you and your mother from your native land. 27You won’t return to the land you’ll yearn to see. 	Jer 22:22-27

28“Why is Coniah/Jehoiachin a despised, shattered pot,						an unwanted container?							Why have he and his descendants been expelled							into a foreign country?							29Land, land, land,										listen to the LORD’s message:							30‘Let the records show that this man had no children;							he was a failure in his own time.						He won’t have a descendant to succeed him							on David’s throne in Judah.’”		Jer 22:28-30

The Righteous Branch

23:[1] 2This is what the LORD God of Israel says about shepherds that scatter and destroy his sheep instead of tending to them, “I’m about to tend to you for the evil you’ve done. 3But I’ll gather the remnant of my flock out of the countries where I’ve driven them, and bring them back to their pasture to reproduce and multiply. 4I’ll raise up shepherds to tend them. They won’t be afraid anymore, and none of them will go missing.

5“The time’s coming

when I’ll raise up a good Branch for David;

he’ll reign as King, deal wisely,

and carry out justice and goodness in the land.

6In his time Judah will be safe;

Israel will live safely.

They’ll call him Yahveh Our Goodness.

7People won’t swear then, ‘As sure as the LORD lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt.’ 8They’ll swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives who brought Israel’s descendants back from the north countries where he’d banished them.’ They’ll live again on their own land.”        	Jer 23:1-8

9As for the false prophets:

My heart’s broken; my body’s shaking;

I’m like someone drunk on wine

because of the LORD and his holy message.

10The country is full of adultery;

it languishes under a curse.

The pastures have dried up;

the prophets all do evil;

they misuse their authority.	Jer 23:9-10

11“Prophet and priest are ungodly;

I’ve found their wickedness right in my Temple.

12So their road will be a slippery path in the dark

where they’ll be driven and fall down.

I’ll bring catastrophe on them

when I punish them.	Jer 23:11-12

13“I’ve seen something offensive about the prophets in Samaria;

they’ve prophesied by Baal and misled my people.

14Now I’ve seen something horrible about the prophets in Jerusalem;

they’ve committed adultery and followed lies.

They encourage the ones that do evil,

so nobody turns back from sin.

They’ve become like Sodom to me,

like the people in Gomorrah.

15So this is what the LORD says about the prophets:

‘I’ll feed them bitter plants to eat

and give them poisoned water to drink,

because the prophets in Jerusalem

have spread ungodliness in the land.’”	Jer 23:13-15

16The LORD of Hosts says,

“Ignore your prophets;

they’re giving you false hopes.

They talk to you about visions they imagine,

not visions from me.

17They keep telling those who despise me

that the LORD has said they’ll have peace;

they say to the ones who follow their own stubborn heart

that catastrophe won’t happen to them.

18But who has stood in the council of the LORD

to see and hear his message?

Who has paid attention to what he says?

19An angry storm has gone out like a tornado,

like a micro-burst on the heads of sinners.

20The LORD’s anger won’t let up

till he’s carried out his intentions.

Later, you’ll understand.	Jer 23:16-20

21“I didn’t send those prophets;

yet they hurried to deliver their ideas;

I didn’t speak to them;

yet they kept on prophesying.

22If they’d stood in my council,

they would’ve delivered my message

and turned back from their own ways and deeds.

23“Am I a God that’s close by

and not one that’s far off?

24Can anybody hide from me?

Don’t I fill earth and sky? 	     Jer 23:21-24

25“I’ve heard what the false prophets have lied in my name, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’ 26How long will they prophesy lies from their imagination, 27and try to get my people to forget me by telling dreams to one another like their ancestors who forgot me for Baal? 28The prophet that has a dream can go ahead and tell it, but he must tell my message faithfully. Straw’s different from wheat. 29My word is like fire, like a sledgehammer that breaks rock into pieces. 30I’m against prophets that steal messages from one another 31and claim I said it, 32that prophesy lying dreams and mislead my people so recklessly. They’re no benefit them at all.     	Jer 23:25-32

33“When a prophet, priest, or layman asks you, ‘What’s the LORD’s burden?’ tell him he’s the burden, and the LORD is going to throw him off. 34Any prophet, priest, or layman that says, ‘The LORD’s burden,’ I’ll punish along with his family. 35You’re to ask your brother and fellow citizen, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ ‘What has the LORD said?’ 36Don’t use the expression ‘the LORD’s burden’ anymore; that ‘burden’ is nothing but somebody’s own idea that perverts the message from the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God. 37So ask the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ ‘What has the LORD said?’ 38If you say, ‘The LORD’s burden,’ 39I’ll throw you away with the city I gave you and your ancestors. 40I’ll permanently disgrace you.’” 	      Jer 23:33-40

Two Baskets of Figs

24:1Nebuchadrezzar/Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon Jeconiah/Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials in Judah along with the craftsmen and artisans. Then the LORD showed me two baskets of figs sitting in front of the Temple. 2One basket had nice figs in it, like first-ripe ones; the other basket held rotten ones.

3He said, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”

I said, “Figs, really good ones and really bad ones you can’t eat because they’re rotten.”

Jer 24:1-3

4Then his message came to me:

5“The LORD God of Israel says, ‘Like those good figs, I’ll treat as good the captives of Judah that I’ve sent out to Babylonia. 6I’ll tend to them and bring them back. I’ll build them up, not tear them down; plant them, not pull them up. 7I’ll give them a heart to know me because I’m the LORD. They’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God. They’ll come back to me with all their heart.

8‘But like those bad figs, I’ll treat Zedekiah, his officials, the remnant in Jerusalem, and the ones living in Egypt. 9I’ll make them something every kingdom can see: a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, a curse wherever I scatter them. 10I’ll send them sword, famine, and disease till they’re gone from the land I gave them and their ancestors.’”	        	Jer 24:4-10

25:1A Message to Jeremiah About the People in Judah

in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

(the First Year of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon)

Seventy Years of Captivity

2Jeremiah told the people in Judah and Jerusalem:

3“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, till now (23 years), the LORD’s message has been coming to me. I’ve spoken to you again and again, but you’ve ignored me. 4He has sent you his prophets over and over, 5‘Turn from your sinful ways and deeds, and live on the land I’ve given you and your ancestors forever. 6Don’t worship and serve other gods. Don’t make me angry with what you’ve made with your hands, and I won’t hurt you.’ 7But you ignored me and made me angry with what you’ve made with your hands to your own hurt.		         	    Jer 25:1-7

8“‘So, because you haven’t obeyed me, 9I’m going to send for the armies in the north and for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant, and bring them against this land and surrounding nations. I’ll destroy them, make them something to abhor, to gasp at, a permanent wasteland. 10I’ll take away the joy and happiness, the voices of bride and groom, the sound of millstones, the light from lamps. 11This whole region will be desolate. Those nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.

12“‘When the 70 years are up, I’ll punish the king of Babylon and the Babylonians for their sin. I’ll make it a permanent wasteland 13and bring on it everything I’ve threatened in this scroll that Jeremiah prophesied. 14Many nations and great kings will make slaves out of them too. I’ll pay them back for what they’ve done and their hands have made.’”				       Jer 25:8-14

The Cup of God’s Anger

15The LORD God of Israel told me, “Take this cup of the wine of my anger and make the nations drink it. 16They’ll stagger and go crazy because of the sword that’s coming among them.”

17The LORD handed me the cup, and I made the nations drink it: 18Jerusalem and the towns in Judah, its kings and officials—to make them a ruin, something to abhor, to gasp at and curse, like it is now: 19Pharaoh, Egypt’s king, his attendants, officials, and people; 20foreigners, the kings of Uz, the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); 21Edom, Moab, the Ammonites; 22the kings of Tyre, Sidon, and the regions beyond the sea; 23Dedan, Tema, Buz, those who clip the hair on their temples; 24the kings of Arabia and the foreigners that live in the desert; 25the kings of Zimri, Elam, Media; 26the north near and far, one with another—all the kingdoms in the region. The king of Sheshach/Babylon will drink after them.     	Jer 25:15-26

27“Tell them the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘Drink it, get drunk, vomit, fall down, and not get up; I’m sending a sword among you.’ 28If they try to refuse, tell them the LORD of Hosts says, ‘You will drink it! 29I’m about to bring a catastrophe on this city I’ve identified with, and you think you’ll avoid getting punished?! I’m calling for a sword against everybody on the earth.”

Jer 25:27-29

30“Prophesy these things against them:

‘The LORD will roar from on high

and speak from his holy dwelling place.

He’ll roar mightily against his fold.

He’ll shout like someone treading grapes,

against everybody on earth.

31The judgment cry will resound to the end of the earth,

because the LORD is indicting the nations.

He’s entering into judgment with everybody;

he’s delivering sinners to the sword.”	Jer 25:30-31

32The LORD of Hosts says,

“Catastrophy is moving out from nation to nation;

a great storm is brewing

from the most remote parts of the earth.

33The LORD will slay from one end of earth to the other.

They won’t be mourned, gathered, or buried;

they’ll be like manure on the ground.

34Wail, shepherds; cry out;

wallow in ashes, you flock leaders.

It’s time for you to be scattered and slaughtered;

you’ll fall like the best of the flock.	Jer 25:32-34

35The shepherds won’t be able to get away;

the flock leaders can’t escape.

36Listen to the shepherds’ cries,

the wailing of the flock leaders!

The LORD’s destroying their pasture.

37The peaceful folds will become a wasteland

because of his fierce anger.

38He has left his hiding place like a lion looking for prey

because their land has become abhorrent,

because of how fierce the oppressing sword is,

and because of his fierce anger.”	Jer 25:35-38

26:1A Message from the LORD at the Beginning

of the Reign of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

Jeremiah Escapes Death

2The LORD says,

“Stand in the court of Yahveh’s Temple and speak to the towns in Judah that have come to worship here. Don’t hold back a word! 3Maybe they’ll listen so I can change my mind about the catastrophe I’m planning for them. 4Tell them, ‘If you won’t follow the Law I’ve given you 5or listen to the prophets I’ve sent you time and again, 6then I’ll make this Temple like Shiloh and this city accursed to every nation.’”

7The priests, the prophets, and the people were listening to Jeremiah saying this. 8When he finished, they grabbed him, “You have to die! 9Why did you prophesy in the Yahveh’s name that this Temple will be like Shiloh and this city without residents?” The people gathered around him.					Jer 26:1-9

10When the officials of Judah heard about that, they came up from the king’s palace to the Yahveh’s Temple and sat in the entrance of the New Gate. 11The priests and prophets told the officials and the people, “This man has to die! You’ve heard him prophesy against this city.”

12Then Jeremiah answered,

“The Yahveh sent me to prophesy the message you heard. 13If you mend your ways and deeds and obey him, he’ll change his mind about this misfortune. 14Do to me what you like. 15Just know that if you put me to death, you’ll bring innocent blood on yourselves, this city, and its people.”          	Jer 26:10-15

16The officials and the people told the priests and prophets, “This man doesn’t deserve to die. He’s spoken to us in the name of Yahveh our God.”

17Some elders of the land stood up and told the assembly,

18“Micah of Moresheth prophesied at the time of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He told the people in Judah,

‘Yahveh of Hosts has said,

“Zion will be plowed like a field;

Jerusalem will become a ruins;

the Temple mount will be a thicket.”’

19Did Hezekiah and Judah put him to death? Didn’t they respect Yahveh and ask for his blessing? Yahveh changed his mind about the misfortune he‘d pronounced on them. We’re about to do ourselves great harm.”	Jer 26:16-19

20Another man prophesied in Yahveh’s name, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. Like Jeremiah, he was prophesying against this city and the land. 21When King Jehoiakim, his officials, and soldiers heard it, the king tried to put him to death, but Uriah found out and fled to Egypt. 22The king sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some others to Egypt, 23and they brought him back. Jehoiakim killed him with a sword and threw his body into the graves for commoners. 24But Ahikam son of Shaphan defended Jeremiah; so he wasn’t executed.

Jer 26:20-24

2“Make yokes and straps and put them on your neck. 3Send back a message to the kings of Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, Tyre, and Sidon by the couriers that come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah. 4Have them tell their masters, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, 5“By my power I made the world, its people and animals. I’ll give it to whoever pleases me. 6I’ve given these countries to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. I’ve even given him the wild animals. 7Every nation will serve him, his son, and his grandson till the time when many nations and great kings make him and his land their servant. 	     Jer 27:1-7

8“Any kingdom that doesn’t surrender and put its neck under his yoke, I’ll punish with sword, famine, and disease. 9Don’t listen to prophets, fortunetellers, dreamers, soothsayers, and sorcerers that tell you not to surrender; 10they’re lying. You’ll be exiled and perish. 11But a nation that puts its neck under his yoke, I’ll let remain on its land, cultivate it, and keep living there.”’”

12I told Zedekiah, king of Judah,

“Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Surrender and you’ll stay alive! 13Why die by sword, famine, and disease like the LORD warned any nation that wouldn’t serve him? 14-15I didn’t send the prophets that tell you otherwise. They’re prophesying falsely in my name. As a result, I’ll drive you out; you and those prophets will perish.” 	Jer 27:8-15

16I told the priests and the people,

“The LORD says not to listen to prophets that tell you the articles from the Temple will soon come back from Babylon. 17Surrender and you’ll stay alive! Why let this city become a ruin? 18If those prophets have the LORD’s message, let them ask him that the articles still in his Temple not go to Babylon. 19The LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the stands, the articles still in this city—20things Nebuchadnezzar didn’t take when he exiled Jeconiah and the nobles in Judah and Jerusalem—[21] 22‘He’ll take them to Babylon till I go and bring them back.’”   				Jer 27:16-22

Jeremiah Condemns Hananiah

28:1That same year in the fifth month, fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the LORD’s Temple with the priests and the people standing there:

2“The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’ve broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3Within two years I’ll bring back the articles from the LORD’s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon.  4I’ll also bring back Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah that went to Babylon. I’ll break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”

5Jeremiah answered him, 	  Jer 28:1-5

6“Amen! May the LORD do just that! Bring back the articles and exiles from Babylon! 7But listen to what I’m telling you! 8For centuries, the prophets have prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms about war, catastrophe, and disease. 9A prophet that predicts a peace that actually comes, is one the LORD has actually sent.”

10Then Hananiah grabbed the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 11He told the people, “The LORD says, ‘In the same way, two years from now I’ll break Nebuchadnezzar’s yoke from off the neck of all the nations.’”

Jeremiah left.			  Jer 28:6-11

12A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

After Hananiah Had Broken the Yoke off His Neck

13“Go tell Hananiah that the LORD says, ‘You’ve broken a wooden yoke, but I’ve replaced it with an iron one 14on those nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar. I’ve even given him the wild animals.’

15“Hananiah, the LORD didn’t send you. You made the people believe a lie. 16So he says you’re going to die this year because you’ve advised rebellion against him.”

17Hananiah died two months later in the seventh month.	       Jer 28:12-17

29:1The Letter Jeremiah Sent from Jerusalem

to the Rest of the Elders, Priests, Prophets, and People

Nebuchadnezzar Had Taken from Jerusalem to Babylon

Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles

(2This was after King Jeconiah/Jehoiachin, the queen mother, the court officials, the other officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and smiths were deported from Jerusalem.) 3Jeremiah sent the letter by Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, ambassadors Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon:	         		Jer 29:1-3

4“The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to the exiles he’s sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, 5‘Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they grow. 6Get married and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands to have sons and daughters. Multiply there, don’t decrease. 7Look out for the welfare of the city where I’ve sent you. Pray to me on its behalf; in its welfare you’ll fair well. 8Don’t let your prophets and fortunetellers mislead you with their dreams. 9They’re lying in my name. I haven’t sent them.

10“At the end of 70 years in Babylon, I’ll fulfill my promise to bring you back here. 11I know my plans for giving you hope and a future. 12Then you’ll pray, and I’ll listen. 13You’ll look for me and find me when you search with all your heart. 14I’ll restore your fortunes and gather you back to the place I exiled you from.	       		Jer 29:4-14

15“Because you’ve said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ 16this is what I say about the king on David’s throne and about your brothers in this city who didn’t go into exile with you: 17-18I’ll chase them with sword, famine, and disease. They’ll be like burst-open figs no one can eat because they’re rotten. I’ll make them a terror, a curse, something abhorred, to gasp at, a disgrace among the nations where I’ve banished them. 19They didn’t listen when I sent them my prophets time and again. 20So, you exiles that I’ve sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to what I’m telling you.

21“This is what the LORD says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in my name: ‘I’ll deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar; he’ll execute them in your presence. 22The exiles from Judah in Babylon will use this curse, “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab that the king of Babylon roasted in fire.” 23They acted foolishly in Israel and committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives. They lied in my name. I’m the One who knows; I see everything that happens.’”	Jer 29:15-23

A Message for Shemaiah

24Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,

25“Because you’ve sent letters in your own name to the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest and all the other priests, and said, 26‘The LORD has made you priests in place of Jehoiada, to oversee his Temple over every mad man that prophesies, to put him in stocks and an iron collar. 27Why haven’t you rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you? 28He sent to us in Babylon and said, “It will be a long exile. Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they grow.”’”	Jer 29:24-28

29Zephaniah the priest read that letter to Jeremiah, 30and a message came from the LORD to Jeremiah, 31“Send to all the exiles:

‘The LORD says this about Shemaiah because he’s prophesied to you though I didn’t send him and made you believe a lie: 32“I’m about to punish him. He won’t have any descendants or see the good I’m going to do for my people, because he incited rebellion against me.”’”      	Jer 29:29-32

30:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

A Promise to Restore Israel

2“The LORD God of Israel says, ‘Write in a scroll everything I’ve told you, 3because the time’s coming when I’ll restore the fortunes of Israel and Judah. I’ll bring my people back to take over the land I gave their ancestors.’”

4This is what the LORD said about Israel and Judah:

5“I’ve heard the sound of terror and dread;

there’s no peace.

6Ask and see if a man can have a baby.

Why do I see every man

with his hands on his crotch

like a woman in childbirth?

Why have their faces turned pale?

7That day will be like no other,

a time of Jacob’s distress,

but I’ll deliver him from it.

8I’ll break the yoke off his neck and tear off its straps. Foreigners won’t enslave him anymore. 9He’ll serve the LORD his God and David his king that I’ll raise up for him.”    	Jer 30:1-9

10“Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;

don’t be distressed, Israel.

From a long way off, I’ll save you and your offspring

from the land where you’re captive.

Jacob will come back and be at ease;

nobody will terrorize him.

11‘I’m with you to save you,

to destroy the nations where I’ve scattered you.

You’re the one I won’t destroy completely.

I’ll discipline you justly

and certainly not let you go unpunished.	Jer 30:10-11

12“Your wound can’t heal;

you’re too seriously injured.

13There’s nobody to argue your case,

no healing for your sore,

no recovery for you.

14All your lovers have forgotten about you;

they’re not looking for you.

I’ve wounded you like a cruel enemy would

because your sins were severe and numerous.

15Why cry out because of your injury?

Your pain can’t be relieved.

I’ve done that to you

because of your great iniquity,

your many sins.

16So everybody that devours you will be devoured;

your captors will go into captivity.

Your plunderers will become plunder;

those who prey on you I’ll make prey.

17I’ll restore you to health and heal your wounds,

because they’ve called you an outcast and said,

‘That’s Zion; nobody cares about it.’	Jer 30:12-17

18“The LORD says,

‘I’ll restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents

and have mercy on where he’s living.

The city will be rebuilt on its ruins;

the palace will stand in its rightful place.

19Thanksgiving will go out from them,

and the sound of people having fun.

I’ll multiply them, not decrease them;

I’ll honor them; they’ll be significant.

20They’ll have children like before;

their community will be safe with me;

I’ll punish their oppressors.	Jer 30:18-20

21One of their own will lead them;

their ruler will come from among themselves.

I’ll bring him near, and he’ll approach me;

who would dare risking his life to approach me on his own?

22You’ll be my people,

and I’ll be your God.’”	Jer 30:21-22

23The LORD’s storm!

His anger has gone out like a tornado;

it will burst down on the heads of sinners.

24The LORD’s fierce anger won’t relent

till he’s accomplished his purpose.

Later you’ll understand.	Jer 30:23-24

31:1“At that time,” the LORD says,

“I’ll be the God of every family in Israel,

and they’ll be my people.

2The people that survived the sword

found grace in the desert

when Israel was looking for rest.”

3The LORD appeared to him from afar and said,

“I’ve loved you with enduring love;

so I’ve drawn you with lovingkindness.

4I’ll rebuild you, virgin of Israel!

You’ll pick up your tambourines again

and join the dance.

5You’ll plant your vineyards on Samaria’s hills again;

you that plant them will enjoy them.

6There’ll be a time when watchmen

on the hilltops in Ephraim will call out,

‘Let’s go up to Zion to the LORD our God.’”	Jer 31:1-6

7The LORD says,

“Sing out loud with happiness for Jacob;

shout among the chiefs of the nations.

Proclaim, give praise, and say,

‘LORD, save the remnant of Israel.’

8I’ll bring them from the north country;

I’ll gather them from the remote parts of the world,

the blind and lame among them,

the pregnant,

and those in labor—

that large company will come back here.

9They’ll come weeping,

and I’ll be leading them with consolation;

I’ll make them walk by streams

on a straight path where they won’t stumble;

I’m Israel’s father;

Ephraim’s my firstborn.”	Jer 31:7-9

10Nations, listen to a message from the LORD

and announce it in distant lands:

“The One that scattered Israel will gather him

and keep him like a shepherd keeps his flock.”

11The LORD has ransomed Jacob,

redeemed him from someone stronger than he is.

12“They’ll come and shout for joy on Zion’s hill,

and be radiant over the bounty from the LORD—

the grain, new wine, and olive oil;

the young in the flock and herd;

they’ll thrive like a watered garden

and never wilt again.

13The virgins will celebrate in the dance;

the young men and old will celebrate together.

I’ll turn your mourning into joy,

comfort you, and replace sorrow with happiness.

14I’ll fill the soul of the priests with abundance;

my goodness will be satisfying to my people.”	Jer 31:10-14

15The LORD says,

“A sound was heard in Ramah,

weeping and bitter crying,

Rachel weeping for her children;

she couldn’t be consoled,

because they were gone.”				Jer 31:15

16The LORD says,

“Don’t cry or shed tears;

your work will be rewarded.

They’ll come back from their enemy’s land.

17There’s hope for your future;

your children will return to their own land.

18I’ve heard Ephraim moaning,

‘You’ve disciplined me like an untrained calf.

Bring me back so I can be restored

because you’re the LORD my God.

19After I turned around, I repented;

after I was instructed, I struck my thigh.

I was ashamed and humiliated

because I carried the disgrace of my youth.’

20Is Ephraim my dear son,

my delightful child?

As often as I’ve spoken against him,

I’ll still remember him.

My heart yearns to have mercy on him.			Jer 31:16-20

21“Set up road signs, erect guideposts;

look at the highway you used when you left.

Come, virgin of Israel;

come back to your cities.

22How long will you wander around,

unfaithful daughter?

The LORD has created a new thing in the world—

a woman protecting a man.”	Jer 31:21-22

23The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “They’ll speak this message again in Judah’s towns when I restore their fortunes:

‘The LORD bless you, righteous home, holy hill!’

24Judah’s townspeople, farmers and herdsmen will live in harmony. 25I’ll satisfy the weary and refresh the fainting.”		   Jer 31:23-25

26Then I woke up; my sleep was pleasant.

27“The time’s coming when I’ll sow Israel and Judah with people and animals. 28As I’ve watched over them to pull up, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster; so I’ll watch over them to plant and build. 29They won’t say anymore,

‘The parents ate sour grapes,

and the children’s mouths puckered.’

30Everybody will die for their own sin. Those who eat sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths pucker.

31“The time’s coming,” the LORD says, “when I’ll make a new covenant with Israel and Judah. 32It won’t be like the one I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. They broke that covenant even though I was a husband to them. 33I’ll make this kind of covenant with them: I’ll put my Law inside them; I’ll write it on their heart. I’ll be their God and they’ll be my people. 34No one will be teaching their brother and fellow citizen to know the LORD, because they’ll all know me from least to greatest. I’ll forgive their sin; I won’t keep it in mind anymore.”                	Jer 31:26-34

35The LORD says—

who provides the sun to light the day

and the moon and stars for light at night,

who makes the sea roar,

whose name is Yahveh of Hosts—

36“If this fixed order can disappear,

then Israel’s offspring can disappear

from being a nation that serves me.

37If the sky above can be measured

and the earth’s foundations can be explored,

then I can throw away Israel’s offspring

for everything they’ve done.	Jer 31:35-37

38“The time’s coming,” the LORD says, “when the city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 39The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb and then turn to Goah. 40The whole valley of dead bodies and ashes, the fields over to the Brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate on the east—will be sacred to me, never again uprooted or thrown down.”	       	Jer 31:38-40

32:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

in the Tenth Year of Zedekiah, King of Judah

(Eighteenth Year of Nebuchadnezzar)

Jeremiah Buys a Field

2-3Babylon’s army was laying siege to Jerusalem. Zedekiah had shut Jeremiah up in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace, and said,

“Why do you prophesy that the LORD says, ‘I’m about to give the city to the king of Babylon. 4Zedekiah won’t escape; the king of Babylon will speak to him face to face.  5He’ll take him to Babylon till I visit him. If you fight the Babylonians, you’ll lose’?”

6Jeremiah said,

“A message from the LORD came to me, 7‘Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is coming to tell you to buy his field in Anathoth; you have first-right to redeem it.’”

8He did come to me in the courtyard of the guard like the LORD said, and told me, “Buy my field at Anathoth in Benjamin. It’s yours to redeem.” 	  Jer 32:1-8a

Then I knew it was a message from the LORD. 9I bought the field from my cousin and weighed out 6.8 oz 17 shekels of silver for him. 10I called in witnesses, signed and sealed the deed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. 11I took the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, and the unsealed copy, 12and gave them to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in front of Hanamel and the witnesses who signed it in the presence of the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. 13In front of them I told Baruch, 	Jer 32:18b-13

14“The LORD of Hosts says, ‘Take the sealed deed of purchase and the unsealed copy and put them in a clay jar to preserve them a long time. 15People will buy houses, fields, and vineyards in this land again.’”

16After I gave Baruch the deed, I prayed, 17“Lord GOD, you made earth and sky by your great power! There’s nothing’s you can’t do. 18You show enduring love to thousands, but pay the consequences of one generations’ sins on the next, great powerful God. Your name is Yahveh of Hosts. 19You’re great in counsel and powerful in deed. You see everything people do and repay them accordingly. 20You showed signs and wonders in Egypt, in our time in Israel, and elsewhere. You’ve made a name for yourself. 21You brought your people out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand, outstretched arm, and great terror. 22You gave them this land you swore to their ancestors you’d give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 23They took possession of it, but they didn’t obey your Law; so you brought this catastrophe on them. 24Siege mounds have come up to take it by sword, famine, and disease. You’ll give it to the Babylonians. What you said has happened. 25Lord GOD, you told me to buy the field and call witnesses, even though you’re giving the city to the Babylonians.’”

Jer 32:14-25

26A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

27“I’m the LORD God of all people. Is there anything I can’t do? 28I’m about to give this city to the Babylonians, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. 29They’ll come in and set it on fire and burn down the houses where people made me angry by offering incense to Baal on the roofs and pouring out liquid offerings to other gods. 30From the beginning, Israel and Judah have been doing everything I’ve forbidden. 31This city has been provoking me ever since they built it. I’m going to put it out of my sight 32because of the sinful things the kings, leaders, priests, prophets, and people in Judah and Jerusalem have done. 33They turned their back on me. Though I taught them over and over, they wouldn’t accept my instruction. 34With the detestable things they put in it, they defiled the Temple that wears my name. 35They built high places to Baal in the Valley of (Ben)Hinnom and sacrificed their sons and daughters as burnt offerings to Molech. I didn’t command that! It never entered my mind that they would do something so detestable.     	Jer 32:26-35

36So this is what the LORD God of Israel says about this city he has given over to sword, famine, and disease: 37“I’ll gather them out of the lands where I drive them in my anger, wrath, and great indignation, and bring them back here to live safely. 38They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. 39I’ll give them one heart and one way so they’ll always respect me for the good of them and their descendants. 40I’ll make an everlasting covenant not to abandon them and to put respect for me in their hearts so they won’t abandon me. 41With all my heart and soul, I’ll enjoy doing them good and faithfully planting them in this land. 42Just as I brought this catastrophe on them, I’ll bring on them all the good I’m promising. 43People will buy fields in this land that you say is ‘a waste without people or animals,’ a land lost to the Babylonians. 44They’ll call witnesses and seal deeds in Benjamin, in Jerusalem, in the towns in Judah, the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev. I’ll restore their fortunes.”	Jer 32:36-44

33:1The LORD’s Second Message to Jeremiah

While Confined in the Courtyard of the Guard

2This is what the LORD says who made the earth, formed and established it: 3“Call out to me, and I’ll tell you important things you don’t know.” 4The God of Israel says this about the houses in this city—including the palace of Judah’s kings—that were torn down to get materials for defending against the siege mounds and the sword, 5“They’re coming to fight the Babylonians and fill the houses with the corpses of men that in my anger I’ve destined to die. I withdrew because of their sinfulness. 6Later I’ll bring them health and healing, and show them true prosperity and peace. 7I’ll restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them like they were before. 8I’ll cleanse them from their sin against me. 9This city will have a world-wide reputation for joy, praise, and honor to me. The nations will hear about the good I’m doing for it, and tremble at the peace I’m making for it.”	        	   Jer 33:1-9

10The LORD says, “You say this place is a waste without people or animals—desolate towns in Judah and streets in Jerusalem. 11But you’ll hear again the sound of happiness, the voices of bride and groom, of people who say,

‘Thank the LORD of Hosts;

he’s good;

his love endures forever.’

You’ll hear people bringing thank offerings to his Temple. I’ll restore the fortunes of the land like they were in the beginning.’

12The LORD of Hosts says, “Shepherds will bed down their flocks in the towns that are ‘a waste without people or animals.’ 13Flocks will pass again under the hands of the one that’s counting them in the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, in Benjamin, around Jerusalem, and Judah.      	   Jer 33:10-13

14“The time’s coming when I’ll keep the promise I’ve made about Israel and Judah. 15A good Branch will sprout from David and carry out justice and goodness in the land. 16Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live safely. His name will be Yahveh Is Our Goodness [Yahveh Tsidekenu]. 17David will always have a man on the throne. 18The Levitical priests will always have a man to offer me burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices.”

Jer 33:14-18

19A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

20“If my covenant with day and night could be broken so they wouldn’t happen at their appointed times, 21then my covenant could also be broken so that David wouldn’t have a descendant on his throne and the Levitical priests wouldn’t serve as my ministers. 22As the stars in the sky can’t be counted and the sand on the shore can’t be numbered, that’s how much I’ll multiply the descendants of David my servant and the Levites my ministers.”	Jer 33:19-22

23A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

24“Have you noticed how the people say the LORD has rejected the two families he chose? They don’t consider my people one nation. 25My covenant with day and night stands. As sure as I’ve established the patterns of earth and sky, 26I’ll keep the offspring of Jacob and choose a descendant of David to rule the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I’ll show them mercy and restore their fortunes.’” 		      	Jer 33:23-26

34:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

When Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon

and His Army and the Kingdoms He Ruled Were

Fighting Jerusalem and Surrounding Towns

A Warning to Zedekiah

2Go tell Zedekiah, king of Judah, that the LORD says, “I’m giving this city to the king of Babylon, and he’ll burn it. 3You’ll be captured and turned over to him. You’ll see him in person, he’ll speak to you directly, and you’ll go to Babylon.” 4But listen to the LORD, Zedekiah! “You won’t die by the sword; 5you’ll die in peace. As they burned spices for the kings before you, they’ll burn spices and lament, ‘Ah, lord!’ for you. I’ve spoken.”

6That’s what Jeremiah told Zedekiah 7while Babylon’s army was fighting Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah, the only fortified cities left in Judah. 	  Jer 34:1-7

8A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

After King Zedekiah Made an Agreement

with the People in Jerusalem to Declare Liberty

A Warning to Zedekiah

9Each man was to free his Hebrew male and female slaves so nobody would enslave a fellow Jewish. 10The officials and the people obeyed and agreed not to hold them as slaves any longer. 11But afterward they went back on their word and brought their freed slave back into subjection.					Jer 34:8-11

12Then a message from the LORD came to Jeremiah:

13The LORD God of Israel says, “I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of bondage in Egypt. 14At the end of seven years, set your fellow Hebrew free that’s been sold to you. But your ancestors didn’t obey me. 15Recently you changed and did what was right. You freed your fellow citizen and made a covenant in my presence. 16But you’ve gone back on your word and profaned my name. You’ve enslaved again the slaves you’d freed.	Jer 34:12-16

17“You haven’t obeyed me by releasing your brother and fellow citizen; so I’m releasing you to sword, famine, and disease. I’ll make you something other kingdoms abhor. 18-20The ones that didn’t keep that covenant, I’ll release to their enemies that want to kill them: officials in Judah and Jerusalem, court officers, priests, and common people who cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. Their dead bodies will feed the buzzards from the sky and scavengers on the ground. 21I’ll deliver Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies, 22and direct them to attack this city again, burn it, and fill Judah with ghost towns.”

Jer 34:17-22

35:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

at the Time of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

The Obedience of the Racabites

2“Go bring the Rechabites to a room in the LORD’s Temple and offer them wine.”

3I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, his brothers and sons—the whole family of Rechabites—4to the LORD’s Temple to the office for the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God. It was close to the officials’ quarters, above the room for Maaseiah son of Shallum, the doorkeeper. 5I put pitchers of wine and cups in front of the Rechabites, “Have a drink!”

6But they said,

“We won’t drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab/Jehonadab son of Rechab told us, ‘Never drink wine, you or your descendants, forever. 7Don’t build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards, or own them. Live in tents so you’ll live a long time in the land.’ 8We, our wives, sons, and daughters have obeyed him. 9We don’t build houses or own vineyards, fields, or seed. 10We live in tents. 11But when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the land, we came to Jerusalem before the Babylonian and Syrian armies got here. So we’ve been living in Jerusalem.”	         Jer 35:1-11

12Then a message from the LORD came to Jeremiah,

13The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,

“Tell the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Won’t you receive instruction and listen to me? 14The descendants of Jonadab still observe his command not to drink wine. I’ve spoken to you time and again, but you’ve ignored me. 15I’ve sent you prophets time and again and said, “Turn from your sinful way, correct your deeds, don’t go after other gods so you can live in the land I’ve given you and your ancestors.” But you’ve ignored me. 16Jonadab’s descendants have observed their ancestor’s command, but you’ve ignored me. 17So, I’m bringing on Judah and Jerusalem the disaster I’ve threatened.

I spoke to them, but they ignored me;

I called out to them, but they didn’t answer.’”

18Then Jeremiah told the Rechabites, “The LORD of Hosts says, ‘Because you’ve obeyed Jonadab, 19he’ll always have descendants to serve me.’” 	Jer 35:12-19

36:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

Baruch Reads Aloud the LORD’s Messages

2“On a scroll, write down everything I’ve told you about Israel, Judah, and the nations from Josiah’s time till now. 3Maybe Judah will listen to the catastrophe I intend to bring on them to get them to repent. Then I’ll forgive them.”

4Jeremiah called for Baruch son of Neriah, and he wrote down the LORD’s messages that Jeremiah dictated. 5He told Baruch,

“I can’t go to the LORD’s Temple. 6So you go on a fast day and read to the people the messages you’ve written. Read them to the people in Judah who come from their towns. 7Maybe they’ll turn from their sinful ways and ask for his forgiveness. The LORD has pronounced great anger against them.”

8Baruch did that and read the messages in the Temple.	Jer 36:1-8

9In the ninth month, fifth year of Jehoiakim/Coniah, the people in Jerusalem and Judah declared a fast to the LORD. 10What Jeremiah said, Baruch read in the quarters of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entry of the New Gate to the Temple.

11When Micaiah son of Gemariah heard it, 12he went down to the secretary’s office in the king’s palace. The officials were sitting there—Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and the others. 13He told them what he heard Baruch reading to the people. 14They sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah (son of Shelemiah son of Cushi) to Baruch and said, “Bring the scroll you read to the people.”

So Baruch took it to them. 	Jer 36:9-14

15“Sit down and read it to us.”

16When they heard it, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, “We have to report this to the king. 17Tell us how you wrote this. Did Jeremiah dictate it?”

18“He dictated it to me, and I wrote it in ink on the scroll.

19The officials said, “Both of you, go hide. Don’t tell anybody where you are.”

King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll

20So they reported to the king what it said, but they’d deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the secretary. 21He sent Jehudi to get it, and he read it to the king and the officials standing beside him. 22The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier beside him. 23When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them in the brazier till he’d burned up the whole scroll. 24The king and his attendants weren’t afraid and didn’t tear their clothes. 25Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with him not to burn the scroll, he did it anyway. 26He told Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah; but the LORD hid them.	Jer 36:15-26

27A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

After the King Burned the Scroll

Baruch Had Written at Jeremiah’s Dictation

Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll

28“Take another scroll and write down everything again. 29Say to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, ‘You burned this scroll and said, “Why did you write that the king of Babylon will destroy this land and empty out its people and animals?” 30This is the LOR’s answer: ‘You won’t have any descendant to sit on David’s throne. They’ll toss your dead body out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. 31I’ll punish you, your family, and your attendants for your sins. I’ll bring on you and the people in Jerusalem and Judah the catastrophe I’ve declared—but they didn’t listen.’”

32So Jeremiah gave Baruch another scroll, and dictated everything Jehoiakim had burned, and added similar messages.		Jer 36:27-32

Jeremiah Imprisoned

37:1Zedekiah son of Josiah, that Nebuchadnezzar had appointed as king in Judah, ruled in place of Coniah son of Jehoiakim. 2But he, his attendants, and the people that were left ignored what the LORD said through Jeremiah.

3Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah to say, “Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf.” 4Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people because they hadn’t put him in prison yet. 5Meantime, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt. When the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard about that, they lifted the siege.					Jer 37:1-5

6A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

7“Tell the king that sent you to inquire from me, ‘Pharaoh’s army that‘s come out to help you will go back to Egypt. 8The Babylonians will come back and attack this city, capture and burn it. 9Don’t deceive yourselves into thinking they’ll leave. 10Even if you’d defeated the whole Babylonian army and only the wounded were left in their tents, they’d get up and burn the city.’”

11When the Babylonian army lifted the siege from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, 12Jeremiah left Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to take over some property there. 13At the Benjamin Gate, a sentry named Irijah (son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah) arrested him, claiming he was deserting to the Babylonians! 14Jeremiah denied it, but he wouldn’t listen. He arrested him and took him to the officials. 15They were mad at Jeremiah, and beat him and put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they’d converted into a prison. 	 Jer 37:6-15

16When he’d been in the dungeon many days, 17King Zedekiah secretly brought him to his palace to ask him if any message had come from the LORD.

“Yes! You’ll be turned over to the king of Babylon! 18How have I sinned against you, your attendants, or the people that you’ve put me in prison? 19Where are your prophets now that said the king of Babylon wouldn’t attack you or this land? 20But listen now, my lord the king. Don’t put me back in Jonathan’s house to die.”

21King Zedekiah commanded them to commit him to the courtyard of the guard. They gave him a loaf of bread each day from the bakers’ street till the bread in the city ran out. So he remained in the courtyard of the guard. 	 Jer 37:16-21

Jeremiah Put in a Cistern

38:1Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard what Jeremiah was telling the people:

2“The LORD says, ‘If you stay in the city, you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease. If you surrender, you’ll have your life as a reward of war. 3The king of Babylon’s army is going to capture the city.’”

4The officials told the king,

“Execute him. He’s discouraging the fighting men in the city and the people by telling them things like that. He’s not looking out for their welfare, but their harm.”

5King Zedekiah said, “Do with him whatever you want.”

6They put Jeremiah in a cistern that belonged to Malchijah the king’s son in the court of the guardhouse. They let him down with ropes. There wasn’t any water in it, but he sank in the mud. 					Jer 38:1-6

7But Ebed-melech the Nubian, a eunuch in the king’s palace, heard they’d put him in the cistern. The king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate. 8Ebed-melech left the palace to speak to him,

9“My lord the king, these fellows have done something awful to Jeremiah; they’ve put him in a cistern. He’ll starve to death; there’s no more bread in the city.”

10The king said, “Take 30 men from here under your authority and get him out before he dies.”

11So Ebed-melech took them to a place under the storeroom in the king’s palace. They took worn-out clothes and rags, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. 12“Put these under your arms over the ropes.” 13They pulled him up out of the cistern, and he remained in the court of the guardhouse.       	Jer 38:7-13

Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again

14Then King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought to the third entrance of the LORD’s Temple, “I’m going to ask you something. Don’t keep back anything from me.”

15Jeremiah said, “If I tell you, won’t you put me to death? If I give you advice, you won’t take it.”

16But King Zedekiah swore to him privately, “As sure as the LORD lives who made this life for us, I won’t put you to death or turn you over to the ones who want to kill you.”

17So Jeremiah said,

“The LORD God of hosts says, ‘You’ll live if you go out to the officials of Babylon. The city won’t be burned, and you and your household will survive. 18If you don’t surrender, the city will fall, they’ll burn it, and you won’t escape.’”

Jer 38:14-18

19King Zedekiah said, “I’m afraid the Jews that have deserted to the Babylonians may turn me over to them, and they’ll torture me.”

20“They won’t do that. Obey the LORD so you’ll live. 21If you keep refusing to go out, this is what the LORD has shown me. 22The women that are left in the palace are going to be brought out to the officers of Babylon, and they’ll say,

‘Your trusted friends have deceived you

and prevailed over you.

Now that your feet are sunk in the mire,

they desert you.’

23They’ll bring out your wives and sons to the Babylonians, and you won’t escape. The king of Babylon will capture you and burn the city.”

24Zedekiah told Jeremiah,

“Don’t tell anybody what you’ve said, and you won’t die. 25If the officials hear that I’ve talked to you, ‘Tell us what you and the king talked about; don’t keep back any of it from us, and we won’t put you to death’; 26then tell them, ‘I pleaded with the king not to put me back in Jonathan’s house to die.’”

27Then the officials came to question Jeremiah. So he told them what the king commanded him, and they dropped the issue since nobody had heard the conversation. 28So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse till Jerusalem fell.	Jer 38:19-28

The Fall of Jerusalem

39:1In the tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and began to lay siege to it. 2The ninth day, fourth month, eleventh year of Zedekiah, they breached the wall. 3The officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer the Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the rest. 4When Zedekiah and his soldiers saw them, they fled at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls and headed toward the Arabah. 5But the Babylonian army caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him up to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 6He executed Zedekiah’s sons right in front of him and executed the nobles of Judah. 7Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in bronze restraints, and took him to Babylon. 8The Babylonians burned the king’s palace and the people’s houses and tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 9Nebuchadnezzar exiled to Babylon the rest of the people in the city and the ones that defected to him. 10Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, left some people in Judah that didn’t have anything, and gave them vineyards and fields. 	Jer 39:1-10

11Nebuchadnezzar gave Nebuzaradan orders about Jeremiah, 12“Look after him; don’t harm him. Deal with him like he tells you.” 13So Nebuzaradan, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and the leading officials of the king of Babylon 14sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah to take him home. So he stayed among the people.	Jer 39:11-14

15A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

While He Was in the Guardhouse

16“Go tell Ebed-melech the Nubian, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “I’m about to bring my message on this city for disaster, not prosperity. It’ll take place before yousg on that day. 17But yousg won’t be given over to the men you dread. 18I’ll rescue you so you won’t fall by the sword. You’ll have to save your life by being a reward of war, because you’ve trusted in me.”’”

Jer 39:15-18

40:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

After Nebuzaradan Released Him from Ramah,

When He’d Taken Him Bound in Chains

Among the Exiles from Jerusalem and Judah

That Were Being Exiled to Babylon

Jeremiah Freed

2The captain of the bodyguard took Jeremiah and told him,

“The LORD your God declared this catastrophe on this place. 3He brought it on and did what he declared. Because your people sinned against him and ignored him, this happened to youpl. 4But I’m freeing yousg from your chains. If you prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along. I’ll take care of you. But if you prefer not to, don’t. The whole land is open to you. Go wherever seems right. 5Go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan that the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns in Judah. Stay with him among the people or go somewhere else.”

So he gave him a ration and a gift, and released him. 6Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah and stayed with him among the people that were left in the land.	  Jer 40:1-6

Governor Jedaliah Assassinated

7The commanders of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah over the land and put him in charge of the men, women, and children, the poorest left in the land. 8So they and their men went to Gedaliah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah; Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite. 9Gedaliah swore to them and their men,

“Don’t be afraid to serve the Babylonians. If you stay and serve the king of Babylon, you’ll survive. 10I’ll be at Mizpah to represent you to the Babylonians that come to us. Gather in wine, summer fruit, and oil, and put them in storage containers. Live in the towns you’ve taken over.         	          Jer 40:7-10

11The Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and appointed Gedaliah over them. 12They came back to him in Judah and gathered a bumper crop of wine and summer fruit.

13Johanan and the commanders of his forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 14and said, “Are you aware that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael to kill you?” But Gedaliah didn’t believe it. 15Then Johanan spoke secretly to him,

“Let me go kill Ishmael; nobody will know it. Why should he take your life, and the Jews that have gathered to you, get scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”

16But Gedaliah said, “Don’t do that. What you’re telling me isn’t true.”        	   Jer 40:11-16

41:1In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama from the royal family and a chief officer of the king, along with 10 men, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. While they were eating there, 2Ishmael and the 10 men got up and struck down Gedaliah with the sword. 3He struck down the Jews that were with Gedaliah as well as the Babylonian soldiers there.	         			   Jer 41:1-3

4The next day, before anybody knew what had happened, 580 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria with their beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed. They had grain offerings and incense to present at the LORD’s Temple. 6Ishmael went out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come in to Gedaliah.” 7But as soon as they came in the city, he and the men killed them and threw them in a cistern. 8But 10 of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us. We have stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey stashed in the field” so he didn’t kill them. 9The cistern that Ishmael filled with corpses was the one King Asa had made because of Baasha, king of Israel. 10Then he took captive everybody left in Mizpah, the king’s daughters, and the remaining people that Nebuzaradan had put under Gedaliah’s charge. He set out with them to cross over to the Ammonites.       Jer 41:4-10

11But Johanan son of Kareah and his commanders heard what Ishmael had done. 12So they took all the men and went to fight him; they found him by the large pool in Gibeon. 13When the people with Ishmael saw Johanan and his commanders, they were happy. 14So the ones Ishmael had taken captive defected to Johanan. 15But Ishmael escaped from Johanan with 8 men and went to the Ammonites. 16Johanan and his commanders took from Mizpah the remnant of the people he’d recovered from Ishmael—the soldiers, the women, children, and eunuchs. 17They went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem, with the intention of going to Egypt. 18They were afraid of the Babylonians since Ishmael had struck down Gedaliah.

Jer 41:11-18

Jeremiah’s Warning to Stay in Judah

42:1Then Johanan, his commanders, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and the people least to greatest came 2to Jeremiah,

“Please honor our petition. Pray for us to the LORD your God for this remnant. There are just a few of us left, as you can see. 3Pray that the LORD will tell us what we should do.”

4Jeremiah said,

“I’ll pray to him and not keep back a word of his answer.”

5They said,

“May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we don’t obey his whole message. 6Whether pleasant or not, we’ll listen so things will go well with us. 				  Jer 42:1-6

7Ten days later, a message came to Jeremiah. 8He called Johanan, his commanders, and the people,

9“The LORD says, 10‘If you stay in this land, I’ll plant you and build you up, and relent from the catastrophe I’ve inflicted on you. 11Don’t be afraid; I’ll deliver you from the king of Babylon 12and show you mercy so he’ll have mercy and return you to your own land. 13But if you say, 14“We’ll go stay in Egypt, where we won’t be near war, hear the bugle, or go hungry,” [15] 16then the sword you fear will catch up with you, the famine you’re anxious about will follow soon after you arrive, and you’ll die there. 17Everybody that goes to Egypt will die by sword, famine, and disease. Nobody will survive the catastrophe I’ll bring.’”

Jer 42:7-17

18“‘As I’ve poured out my anger on the people in Jerusalem, I’ll pour it out on you in Egypt. You’ll become a curse, something abhorred, a disgrace. You won’t be coming back here.’ 19The LORD is telling you today not to go to Egypt! 20You’re only deceiving yourselves. You said, ‘Pray to the LORD our God; we’ll do whatever he says.’ 21But you’re not doing it. 22So understand that you’ll die by sword, famine, and disease where you want to go live.”     	   Jer 42:18-22

43:1As soon as Jeremiah finished, 2Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and the arrogant men told him, “You’re lying. The LORD didn’t say not to go live in Egypt. 3Baruch son of Neriah is prompting you to turn us over to the Babylonians so they can execute us or exile us to Babylon.”  4-5So Johanan and the commanders took to Egypt the entire remnant that had come back from the countries where they’d been driven: 6men, women, children, the king’s daughters, everyone Nebuzaradan had left with Gedaliah, together with Jeremiah and Baruch. 7They got as far as Tahpanhes. 		   Jer 43:1-7

8The LORD told Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,

9“Bury some big rocks in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes so some of the Jews can see it. 10Tell them that the LORD of Hosts says, ‘I’m going to send for Nebuchadnezzar my servant and set his throne on those rocks. He’ll spread his canopy over them 11when he comes to strike Egypt. The ones destined to die will die; the ones destined for captivity will go captive, the ones destined for the sword will die by the sword. 12-13He’ll burn the temples of Egypt’s gods and shatter the obelisks in Heliopolis. He’ll wrap himself with Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself in his coat and leave unscathed.’” 			  Jer 43:8-13

44:1A Message to Jeremiah for the Jews Living in Egypt

in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the Territory of Pathros

Disaster Because of Idolatry

2“Yahveh of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘You’ve seen the catastrophe I brought on Jerusalem and the towns in Judah; they’re in ruins. Nobody’s living in them 3because their sinfulness made me angry.  They kept serving and burning sacrifices to gods they and their ancestors hadn’t known. 4Yet I sent them my prophets time and again, saying not to do that detestable thing. 5‘But they didn’t listen, turn from their sin, or quit burning sacrifices to other gods. 6So my anger boiled over and burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem.’ 7Now Yahveh says, ‘Why harm yourselves and slay man and woman, child and infant, from Judah and leave yourselves without even a remnant? 8You’ve made me angry with the things you’ve made with your hands and the sacrifices you’ve burned to other gods in Egypt. You’ll be destroyed and become a curse and disgrace among the nations. 9Have you forgotten your ancestors’ sinfulness, the sinfulness of Judah’s kings and their wives, the sinfulness you and your wives committed in Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 10You haven’t humbled yourselves or respected me to this day or followed the Law and statutes I set before you and your ancestors.’	   Jer 44:1-10

11“So Yahveh of Hosts says, ‘I’ll destroy everybody that’s from Judah 12and remove the remnant that’s determined to go live in Egypt. From least to greatest will meet their end here by sword or famine. They’ll become a curse, something abhorred, a disgrace. 13Like I’ve punished Jerusalem, I’ll punish Egypt with sword, famine, and disease. 14Only a few refugees will ever make it back to the land they long to see.’”	   Jer 44:11-14

15The men that knew their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods and the women that were standing by—including a large number from Pathros—answered Jeremiah,

16“We don’t have to listen to you! 17We’ll keep burning sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her like we and our ancestors, our kings and officials did in Judah and Jerusalem. We were well off then with plenty of food and no misfortune. 18Since we stopped doing that, we’ve lacked everything and met our end by sword and famine.” 19The women said, “When we were burning sacrifices to her, pouring out liquid offerings to her, and making sacrificial cakes in her image, didn’t our husbands know it?” 	   Jer 44:15-19

20Jeremiah responded, 21“Didn’t Yahveh know about the smoking sacrifices you and your ancestors, kings and officials, and common people burned? 22He wouldn’t put up with your sinful deeds and detestable acts anymore. So your land has become a ruin, abhorred, a curse, and uninhabited. 23This catastrophe has fallen on you because you’ve burned sacrifices and sinned against him, and didn’t obey him or follow his Law, statutes, or testimonies. [24] 25You and your wives have said, ‘We’ll keep our vows to burn sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out liquid offerings to her.’ Go ahead and keep your vows! 26But listen to what Yahveh says, ‘I’ve sworn by my great name that nobody from Judah that’s in Egypt will ever invoke my name again, “As the Lord Yahveh lives . . .” 27I’ll see to it that they’re harmed. They’ll meet their end by sword and famine. 28Only a few will ever make it back to Judah. Then the remnant in Egypt will know whose message will stand, theirs or mine. 29-30This is how you’ll know: I’ll punish you here too and deliver Pharaoh Hophra [Apries] to his enemies like I turned Zedekiah over to Nebuchadnezzar.’”          	  Jer 44:20-30

45:1The Message Jeremiah Spoke to Baruch

When He’d Written It in a Scroll at Jeremiah’s Dictation

in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

Disaster Because of Idolatry

2“This is what the LORD God of Israel says to you, Baruch: 3‘You said, “Misfortune awaits me! The LORD has added sorrow to pain. I’m exhausted from groaning. I can’t sleep.”’ 4Tell him the LORD says, ‘What I’ve built up I’m about to tear down. What I’ve planted I’m about to uproot—the whole land. 5Are you anticipating great things for yourself? Don’t. I’m going to bring disaster on everybody, but I’ll give you your life as a reward of war wherever you go.’”

Jer 45:1-5

A Message About Egypt

46:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah About the Nations

2A Message to Egypt about Pharaoh Necho’s Army

That Was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish,

Which Nebuchadnezzar Defeated

in the Fourth Year of Jehoiakim Son of Josiah, King of Judah

3“Line up the shields and bucklers,

and advance for battle!

4Harness the horses, mount the steeds,

take your positions, put your helmets on!

Polish the spears;

put on the coats of mail!

5But what do I see?

Egypt’s army is panicking; they’re retreating.

Their soldiers are being defeated;

they’re fleeing without looking back.

They’re terrorized in every direction,”

the LORD says.                      Jer 46:1-5

6The fast can’t flee;

the strong can’t escape.

They’ve stumbled and fallen

in the north by the Euphrates.

7Who is this that’s flooding like the Nile,

like rivers out of their banks?

8Egypt floods like the Nile,

like rivers whose water surges.

It has said, “I’ll flood the land;

I’ll destroy city and residents.”

9Advance, horses; drive wildly, chariots,

so the infantry can march forward:

Nubia and Put, that wield the shield,

Lybians, that bend the bow.				Jer 46:6-9

10That day belongs to the Lord GOD of hosts,

a time of revenge on his enemies.

The sword will devour till it’s satisfied

and drink its fill of their blood.

There’ll be a slaughter for the Lord GOD of hosts

in the north by the Euphrates.

11Go up to Gilead and buy salve,

virgin daughter in Egypt!

In vain do you use lots of medicines;

they won’t heal you up.

12The nations have heard about your humiliation;

the whole world has heard your distress cry.

One soldier stumbles over another,

and they both fall together.				Jer 46:10-12

13The Message the LORD Spoke to Jeremiah

About Nebuchadnezzar Coming to Strike Egypt

14“Declare it in Egypt, announce it in Migdol,

tell it in Memphis and Tahpanhes;

‘Be prepared and stand ready

because the sword has taken everybody around you.’

15Why are your soldiers prostrate?

Because the LORD has beat them down.

16He made many stumble;

they have fallen overt one another.

Then they said, ‘Get up! Let’s go back

to our own people, to our native land,

away from the oppressor’s sword.’			Jer 46:13-16

17They cried out there,

‘Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just a lot of noise;

he’s let the stated time pass by!’

18“As I live,” the King says,

whose name is Yahveh of Hosts,

“somebody is coming like Tabor among the mountains

or like Carmel by the sea.

19Get your baggage ready for exile,

daughter that lives in Egypt,

because Memphis will be desolate,

burned down, and uninhabited.

20Egypt is a pretty heifer,

but a horsefly is coming from the north!

21Egypt’s mercenaries are like grain-fed calves;

even they have retreated and fled together.

They didn’t stand their ground;

their catastrophe has descended on them;

it’s their time to be punished.				Jer 46:17-21

22“Egypt is as silent as a snake slithering away,

because its enemies are moving in on it like an army,

like woodsmen with axes.

23They’ll cut down its forest;

it certainly won’t exist anymore,

even though it’s too numerous to count.

24Egypt has been humbled,

delivered to the powerful ones up north.”	Jer 46:22-24

25The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, “I’m going to punish Amon of Thebes, Egypt along with its gods and kings, Pharaoh and those who put their trust in him. 26I’m going to deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar and his officers, who want to kill them. Afterwards people will live in Egypt like before. 	  Jer 46:25-26

27“But you, Jacob my servant,

don’t be afraid or intimidated!

I’ll rescue you from a long way off

and your descendants from where they’re captive.

Israel will come back and be secure,

with nobody to make him shudder.

28Jacob, don’t be afraid;

I’m with you.

I’ll make a complete end to the nations

where I’ve driven you,

but I won’t make a complete end of you;

I’ll discipline you appropriately—

(not leave you unpunished).”	Jer 46:27-28

47:1A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah

About the Philistines Before Pharaoh Conquered Gaza

2The LORD says,

“A flood is swelling up from the north;

it will become a tsunami.

It’ll flood the land and everything in it,

the cities and those who live in them.

People will cry out;

everybody in the land will wail.

3Because of the noise of stallions,

rushing chariots, wheels,

fathers won’t look back for their children;

they’ll be too overwhelmed	Jer 47:1-3

4by what’s coming

to destroy the Philistines,

to cut off from Tyre and Sidon

every ally that’s left.

The LORD will destroy the Philistines,

the remnant along the coast of Crete.

5Gaza will be bald;

Ashkelon will lie in ruins.

Remnant in the plain,

how long will you gash yourselves?

6Sword of the LORD,

how long before you’re still,

before you go back into your sheath?

7But how can it be still

when the LORD has ordered it to attack

against Ashkelon and the seacoast?”	Jer 47:4-7

48:1About Moab

The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,

“Misfortune awaits Nebo—laid waste;

Kiriathaim will be disgraced—taken;

the fortress will be humiliated—torn down.

2No more renown for Moab;

disaster’s in store for Heshbon

to cease being a nation!

Put Madmen to silence too;

chase it with a sword.	Jer 48:1-2

3“An outcry from Horonaim,

‘Devastation and destruction!’

4Moab’s to be destroyed;

its little ones cry out in terror.

5At the ascent to Luhith,

Moab’s refugees go up crying;

at the descent to Horonaim

they’ve heard the anguished cry.

6Run, save yourselves

so you can be a juniper in the countryside.	Jer 48:3-6

7Because you trusted in your wealth and skill,

you’ll be captured too.

Chemosh will go into exile

with his priests and officials.

8A destroyer will come on every city;

no city will escape.

The valley will perish;

the plateau will be destroyed like the LORD said.

9Give Moab wings so it can fly away;

its towns will be desolate without residents.

10A curse on the one that does the LORD’s work halfheartedly;

a curse on the one that restrains his sword from blood.	Jer 48:7-10

11“Moab hasn’t been disturbed since it was founded;

its dregs haven’t been unsettled.

It hasn’t been poured from jug to jug—

or carried into exile.

So it still tastes clean;

its aroma has body.

12“But the times coming,” the LORD says, “when I’ll send it to the ones that upset jugs, and they’ll turn it upside down. They’ll empty its jugs and shatter its jars. 13Moab will be disillusioned with Chemosh like Israel lost confidence in Bethel.

14How can you claim to be great soldiers,

brave men in battle?

15Moab will be destroyed;

its towns will be under attack;

its elite young men will go down in slaughter,”

the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts.

16“Moab’s disaster is on its way;

its destruction will be swift.

17Mourn for it, you that live near it,

you that know its name.

Say, ‘How the powerful scepter has broken

that splendid staff!’	Jer 48:11-17

18“Come down from your glory

and sit on parched dirt,

people in Dibon;

the one that destroyed Moab

is coming after you.

He’ll destroy your fortresses.

19Stand by the road and watch,

people in Aroer;

ask him that’s fleeing and her that’s escaping,

‘What’s happened?’

20‘Moab has been disgraced;

it’s shattered.

Wail and cry out;

declare by the Arnon,

‘Moab’s been destroyed.’	Jer 48:18-20

21“Judgment has also come on the plateau—on Holon and Jahzah, on Mephaath, 22Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 23on Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 24on Kerioth, Bozrah, and the towns in Moab near and far. 25Moab’s horn has been cut off and his arm broken,” the LORD says.

26“Get him drunk because he’s gotten arrogant toward the LORD. So Moab will wallow in his own vomit, something to be ridiculed. 27Wasn’t Israel someone you ridiculed? Was he a thief caught stealing? Every time you spoke about him, you shook your head in scorn. 		  Jer 48:21-27

28“Leave the towns and live in caves, people in Moab;

be like pigeons nesting in the cliffs along the gorge.

29We’ve heard about Moab’s great pride,

his haughtiness, arrogance, and self-exaltation.

30I know his insolence,” the LORD says,

“but it’s pointless;

his idle boasts are empty claims.

31So I’ll wail can cry out for Moab;

I’ll moan for the people of Kir-heres/hareseth.

32“More than for Jazer,

I’ll weep for you, vine of Sibmah!

Your branches once reached the sea,

the Sea of Jazer [Dead Sea].

The destroyer has destroyed

your summer fruits and grape harvest.	Jer 48:28-32

33So happiness and joy have been taken away

from Moab’s fertile fields.

I’ve made wine quit flowing from the winepresses;

nobody will tread them with shouts of joy;

the shouts won’t be shouts of joy.

34“From Heshbon, Elealeh, and Jahaz, from Zoar, Horonaim, and Eglath-shelishiyah, they’ve raised their voice; because even the water in Nimrim will dry up. 35I’ll put an end to Moab that offers sacrifice on the high place and burns incense to its god. 36So my heart wails like a flute for Moab and the people in Kir-heres. They’ve lost the abundance it produced. 37Every head’s bald; every beard’s shaved off. Everybody has gashes on their hands and burlap around their waists. 38There’s mourning everywhere in Moab’s streets and on its housetops, because I’ve broken it like a pot nobody cares about. 39How shattered it is! How they wail! How Moab has turned its back in humiliation. So it’s something to laugh at, an object of terror to everyone around it.”	        Jer 48:33-39

40The LORD says,

“One will fly fast like an eagle

and spread its wings against Moab.

41Its towns will be taken,

its fortresses seized.

So the hearts of the strong men of Moab

will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

42Moab will be destroyed from being a people

because it’s become arrogant toward the LORD.

43Terror, pit, and snare are coming on you.

44The one that runs from the terror

will fall into a pit.

The one that climbs out of the pit

will step in a snare.

That’s what I’ll bring on Moab

when I punish it. 	Jer 48:40-44

45“Refugees will stand in the shadow of Heshbon

with no strength to flee any farther;

fire has erupted from Heshbon,

a flame from Sihon.

46Misfortune awaits you, Moab!

The people of Chemosh will perish;

your sons will be taken captive,

your daughters too.

47Yet later I’ll restore Moab’s fortunes.”

That’s the judgment on Moab.	Jer 48:45-47

49:1About Ammon

The LORD says,

“Doesn’t Israel have any descendants?

Doesn’t he have an heir?

Why then has Malcam/Milcom taken possession of Gad,

and his people settled in its towns?

2The time’s coming

when I’ll raise the battle cry

against Rabbah of the Ammonites.

It’ll be a desolate mound;

its towns will be burned,

Then Israel will expel the ones that expelled him.	 Jer 49:1-2

3“Wail, Heshbon, because Ai is destroyed!

Cry out, young women of Rabbah;

put on burlap and lament;

run back and forth inside the walls.

Malcam/Milcom will go into exile

along with his priests and officials.

4Why do you brag about your fertile valleys?

Your valleys are flowing away, unfaithful daughter

that trusts in her treasures and says,

‘Who’s going to attack me?’

5I’m going to bring terror on you

from every direction.

Every one of you will be driven out headlong

with nobody to round up the refugees.

6Yet later I’ll restore Ammon’s fortunes.”			Jer 49:3-6

7About Edom

The LORD of Hosts says,

“Is there no wisdom in Teman?

Has good advice disappeared from the prudent?

Has its wisdom declined?

8Turn around, run away,

live deep in the deserts, people in Dedan,

because I’ll bring disaster on Esau

when I punish him.

9If grape-gatherers come to you,

wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?

If thieves came at night,

wouldn’t they destroy only enough for themselves?	Jer 49:7-9

10But I’ll strip bare Esau’s land

and expose its hiding places

so its people can’t hide.

Its inhabitants will be killed,

relatives and friends;

its land won’t be alive anymore.

11But leave its orphans behind; I’ll keep them alive;

its widows will need to depend on me.”	Jer 49:10-11

12The LORD says,

“Is there no wisdom in Teman?

Has good advice disappeared from the prudent?

Has its wisdom declined?

8Turn around, run away,

live deep in the deserts, people in Dedan,

because I’ll bring disaster on Esau

when I punish him.

9If grape-gatherers come to you,

wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?

If thieves came at night,

wouldn’t they destroy only enough for themselves?	Jer 49:7-9

10But I’ll strip bare Esau’s land

and expose its hiding places

so its people can’t hide.

Its inhabitants will be killed,

relatives and friends;

its land won’t be alive anymore.

11But leave its orphans behind; I’ll keep them alive;

its widows need to trust me.”	Jer 49:10-11

12The LORD says,

“If the ones that didn’t deserve the cup have to drink it, will you be let off? You will drink it! 13I’ve sworn by myself that Bozrah will be something to abhor, a disgrace, a ruin, a curse. Its towns will lie in permanent ruins.”

14I’ve heard a message from the LORD;

a messenger is going among the nations and says,

“Gather together and attack it;

rise up for battle!”

15I’ll make you small among the nations;

people will despise you.

16The terror you inspired

has deceived you into an arrogant attitude,

you that live in the clefts of the rock,

that occupy the height of a hill.

Though you make your nest high like an eagle’s,

I’ll bring you down from there. 				Jer 49:12-16

17“Edom will be something to abhor. Everybody that goes past it will be horrified and hiss at its wounds. 18Like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, and its neighbors, nobody will live there. 19Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I’ll chase everybody away from it. I’ll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me.  20So listen to the LORD’s plan for Edom, his intentions for Teman. They’ll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 21The ground will shake at their downfall. The outcry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea. 22It’s enemy will soar high and swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah. The hearts of Edom’s mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor.”	      	 Jer 49:17-22

23About Damascus

“Hamath and Arpad are in panic;

they’ve heard bad news.

They’re disheartened;

their anxiety rages like a sea

that can’t be quieted.

24Damascus is helpless;

Its people have fled.

Panic, anguish, and pain have gripped it

like a woman in labor.

25How that famous city has been deserted,

the city of my joy!

26Its young men will fall in its streets;

its soldiers will go silent that day,”

the LORD of Hosts says.

27“I’ll set fire to the walls of Damascus

that will burn down Benhadad’s fortified towers.”	Jer 49:23-27

28About Kedar and the Kingdoms of Hazor

That Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon Defeated

“Attack Kedar;

destroy the people from the east.

29They’ll take away their tents and flocks,

their ornate tent curtains, goods, and camels.

They’ll cry out,

‘There’s terror everywhere!’

30Run! Flee! Live in deep caves,

people in Hazor,” 		the LORD says.      		 Jer 49:28-30a

“Nebuchadnezzar has devised a plan against you

and plotted a scheme:

31to attack a nation that’s at ease,

that lives securely,

that  doesn’t have gates or bars,

that lives apart by itself.

32Their camels will be plunder;

their livestock will be spoil.

I’ll scatter to the winds

those who clip the hair on their temples

and bring catastrophe from every direction,”

the LORD says.

33“Hazor will be a haunt for jackals,

a permanent wasteland.

Nobody will live there.”					Jer 49:30b-33

34A Message from the LORD to Jeremiah About Elam

at the Beginning of the Reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah

35“The LORD of Hosts says,

‘I’m going to break the bow of Elam,

the main weapon of their power.

36I’m going to bring on Elam the four winds

from the four ends of the sky.

I’ll scatter them to all those winds;

there won’t be any nation

the refugees from Elam can flee to.

37I’ll scatter Elam ahead the enemies

that want to kill them.

I’ll bring catastrophe on them,

my fierce anger.

I’ll send out the sword after them

till I’ve consumed them all.

38Then I’ll set my throne in Elam

and destroy its king and officials.

39Yet later I’ll restore Elam’s fortunes.’”			Jer 49:34-39

50:1A Message the LORD Spoke About Babylon,

the Land of the Babylonians, Through the Prophet Jeremiah:

2“Announce it among the nations;

hoist a standard everyone can see:

‘Babylon has been captured,

Bel humbled,

Marduk shattered,

its images disgraced,

its idols smashed.’

3A nation has come down against it from the north. It will make the land something to abhor; nobody will live there. People and animals will wander off.

4“At that time, Israel and Judah will return home. They’ll go along weeping, looking for the LORD their God. 5They’ll ask how to get to Zion and turn in that direction to join the LORD in an everlasting covenant they won’t forget.  										           Jer 50:1-5

6“My people have become lost sheep. Their shepherds had led them astray and abandoned them on the mountains. They’ve gone along from mountain to hill and lost track of their resting place. 7Everyone that came at them has devoured them. Their enemies have said, ‘We didn’t do anything wrong; they’d sinned against the LORD, where goodness lives, who was their ancestors’ hope.’

8“Wander away from Babylon and leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like male goats at the head of the flock. 9I’m going to bring against Babylon a horde of great nations from farther north. They’ll draw up their battle lines and capture it. Their arrows will fly from skilled soldiers that won’t come back empty-handed. 10Babylonia will become plunder. Those who plunder it will gather as much as they want,” 	the LORD says.	   Jer 50:6-10

11“Though you’re happy and jubilant now,

you that plundered my permanent possession,

though you run around like a heifer on grass

and neigh like a stallion,

12your mother will be ashamed;

she that bore you will be humiliated.

She’ll be the least of the nations,

a parched wilderness, a desert.

13Because of the LORD’s anger,

Babylon will be empty,

completely desolate.

Everybody that goes past it will be appalled

and gasp at its wounds.

14Draw up your battle lines on every side of Babylon,

you that bend the bow.

Shoot at it; don’t spare your arrows

because it’s sinned against the LORD.	Jer 50:11-14

15Raise your battle cry at it everywhere!

It has given up; its pillars have fallen;

its walls have been torn down.

This is the LORD’s revenge:

carry out that revenge on it;

do to it what it’s done to others.

16Eliminate the sower from Babylon

and the one that swings the sickle at harvest time.

Each one will retreat from the sword

back to their own people;

they’ll flee to their own land.	Jer 50:15-16

17“Israel is like a flock driven away and scattered by lions. The king of Assyria devoured it first. Then Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, broke its bones. 18So the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I’m going to punish Babylon like I punished Assyria. 19I’ll bring Israel back to his pasture so he can graze on Carmel and Bashan. He’ll eat as much as he wants in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. 20At that time, they’ll search for Israel’s iniquity and Judah’s sin, but they won’t find any. That’s because I’ll pardon the ones I’m leaving as a remnant.’          		  Jer 50:17-20

21“Go up against the land of Merathaim

and the people in Pekod.

Slay and destroy them,” the LORD says.

“Do everything I’ve commanded you.

22The noise of battle is in the land

and great destruction.

23How the sledgehammer of the whole world

has been cut off and broken!

How Babylon has become

something to abhor among the countries!	Jer 50:21-23

24I set a snare for you and caught you, Babylon,

while you weren’t watching.

You’ve been found and captured

because you’ve engaged the LORD in conflict.”

25The LORD has opened his armory

and brought out his weapons of wrath.

This is his work against the Babylonians.

26Attack it from the farthest border;

open your arms, pile it in heaps,

destroy it.

Don’t leave anything.

27Kill its young bulls with the sword;

let them go down to slaughter!

Misfortune awaits them because their time has come,

the time for their punishment.

28There’s the sound of fugitives from Babylon;

it speaks of the LORD’s revenge for his Temple.		Jer 50:24-28

29“Summon many nations against Babylon,

every one that bends the bow;

camp against it all the way around;

don’t let anyone escape.

Repay it according to its work;

do to it everything it has done,

because it’s been arrogant against the LORD,

the Holy One of Israel.

30So its young men will fall in its streets;

its fighting men will fall silent then.

31I’m against you, arrogant one;

it’s time for me to punish you.

32The arrogant one will stumble and fall

with nobody to help him up.

I’ll set fire to its towns

and consume his surroundings.”	Jer 50:29-32

33The LORD of Hosts says,

“Israel is oppressed,

Judah as well.

All who have taken them captive

have held onto them fast

and won’t let go.

34Their redeemer is strong;

his name is Yahveh of Hosts.

He’ll certainly argue their case

and give rest to their land;

he’ll bring unrest to the people in Babylon.

35A sword against them,

their officials and wise men!       				Jer 50:33-35

36A sword against their fortunetellers

so they’ll become fools!

A sword against their fighting men

so they’ll be shattered!

37A sword against their horses and chariots,

against the foreigners in it

so they’ll become women!

A sword against its treasures

so they’ll be plundered!

38A drought to dry up its water

because it’s a land of idols,

and they’re crazy about their idols

39“So the desert animals will live there along with jackals and owls. Nobody will ever live in it again 40as when I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors. 		  Jer 50:39-40

41“People are coming from the north;

a big empire with many kings

will rise up from the remote parts of the earth.

42They take hold of bow and javelin;

they’re cruel with no mercy.

They roar like the sea; they ride on horses,

arrayed against you like soldiers for battle, Babylon.

43The king of Babylon has heard the reports about them,

and his hands hang limp;

anguish has seized him,

agony like a woman in childbirth.	      Jer 50:41-43

44“Like a lion from the thickets by the Jordan suddenly attacking a sheepfold, I’ll chase everyone away from it in an instant. I’ll appoint over it anyone I choose. Who can take me to court? What shepherd can oppose me?”

45So listen to what the LORD has planned for Babylon and the Babylonians. They’ll drag off the little ones in the flock and empty the pasture. 46At the shout, “Babylon’s been captured!” the ground will shake. The nations will hear the shout. 	  Jer 50:44-46

51:1The LORD says,

“I’m going to stir up the spirit of the destroyer

against Babylon and the people in Leb-kamai.

2I’ll send foreign winnowers to Babylon

to devastate its land.

On every side they’ll oppose it

at the time of its catastrophe.

3Let the defending archer not bend his bow

or stand in his coat of mail.

Don’t spare the young men;

devote the whole army to destruction.

4They’ll fall down dead in the land of the Babylonians,

pierced through in their streets.”	Jer 51:1-4

5God, the LORD of Hosts,

has not abandoned Israel and Judah

even though their land is full of guilt

in front of the Holy One of Israel.

6Escape from Babylon;

save yourselves!

Don’t get destroyed in its punishment;

this is the LORD’s revenge;

he’s going to render retribution to it.

7Babylon has been a gold cup in the LORD’s hand,

intoxicating the whole region.

The nations have drunk its wine;

so they’re acting crazy.	Jer 51:5-7

8All of a sudden Babylon has fallen!

Wail for it!

Bring salve to heal its pain.

9We tried to heal Babylon, but it didn’t heal;

so abandon it and get to your own country.

Its judgment has reached heaven;

it towers as high as the sky.

10The LORD has brought about our vindication;

let’s recount in Zion the work of the LORD our God!	Jer 51:8-10

11Sharpen the arrows, fill the quills!

The LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes

to destroy Babylon.

It’s the LORD’s revenge for his Temple.

12Raise up a standard against the walls of Babylon;

post a strong guard, station sentries, set men in ambush!

It’s the LORD’s revenge for his Temple.

13You that live by lots of water, abundant in treasures,

your end has come; your life cord’s been cut.

14The LORD of Hosts has sworn by himself:

“I’ll fill you with soldiers like locusts;

they’ll raise shouts of victory over you.”	Jer 51:11-14

A Hymn of Praise to the LORD

15He’s the One that made the earth by his power,

that established the world by his wisdom,

that stretched out the sky with his intelligence.

16When he speaks, there’s thunder in the rain above;

he makes clouds rise up from the horizon,

makes lightning for the rain,

and brings wind out of his storehouses.

17Every mortal is stupid and ignorant;

goldsmiths are disgraced by their idols

because their molten images misrepresent;

they can’t even breathe.

18They’re worthless objects to ridicule;

when they’re punished, they perish.

19Jacob’s portion is not like theirs.

His God has made everything;

Israel is his inheritance;

his name is Yahveh of Hosts. 				Jer 51:15-19

Babylon’s Destruction

20“You’re my battle-ax and weapon;

I’ll shatter nations with you;

I’ll destroy kingdoms.

21I’ll break horse and rider in pieces,

22chariot and occupant,

man and woman, young and old.

23With you I’ll destroy shepherd and flock,

farmer and ox team,

governors and prefects.	Jer 51:20-23

24“I’ll repay Babylon and the Babylonians

for the devastation they’ve brought on Zion

right in my presence,” 	the LORD says.

25“I’m against you, destroying mountain

that destroys the world.

I’ll reach out against you

and roll you down from the crags

and make you a burned-out ruble.

26They won’t reuse from you

a cornerstone or foundation stone.

You’ll be as permanent wasteland.”	Jer 51:24-26

27Set up a standard in the land;

blow the bugle among the nations.

Consecrate the nations against it;

summon Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.

Appoint a marshal against it;

bring on horses like bristling locusts.

28Prepare the nations against it,

the kings of the Medes,

their governors and officials,

and every land they control.

29So the ground shakes

because the LORD’s intention against Babylon stands:

to make it an uninhabited wasteland.	Jer 51:27-29

30The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting;

they’re staying in the barracks.

They’ve used up their strength

and become like women.

Their houses are on fire;

the bars of its gates are broken.

31One courier runs to another,

one ambassador runs to another

to tell the king of Babylon

his city’s been captured from end to end.

32They’ve seized the fords;

they’ve burned the fortifications;

the army is in panic.	Jer 51:30-32

33The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says,

“Babylon is like a threshing floor tamped firm;

in a little while threshing will begin on it.	Jer 51:33

34“Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,

has devoured me and crushed me.

He has set me down like an empty cup,

swallowed me like a monster,

filled his stomach with my delicacies,

and rinsed me out.”

35Zion will say,

“May the violence done to us

be done to Babylon.”

Jerusalem will say,

“May my blood be on the people in Babylon.”

36So the LORD says,

“I’ll argue your case

and take full revenge for you;

I’ll dry up its River

and dry up its oasis.	Jer 51:34-36

37Babylon will be a pile of rubble, a den for jackals,

something to abhor and gasp at;

nobody will live there.

38They’ll roar together like young lions;

they’ll growl like lion cubs.

39When they get hungry,

I’ll serve them their banquet.

I’ll make them drunk till they pass out

and put them to sleep forever.

40I’ll bring them down like lambs to slaughter,

like rams and male goats for sacrifice.	Jer 51:37-40

41“How Sheshak has been captured!

What the whole world praised has been seized!

How Babylon has become something to abhor among the nations!

42The River has flooded Babylon,

swamped it in crashing waves.

43Its towns have become something to abhor,

a parched land, a desert,

a land where nobody lives

and nobody visits.

44I’ll punish Bel in Babylon

and make him vomit what he’s swallowed.

The nations won’t stream to him anymore;

even Babylon’s walls have fallen down!	Jer 51:41-44

45“Get out of there, my people!

Save yourselves from my fury!

46Don’t let your heart faint;

don’t be afraid at the report in the land

when a report comes one year,

another one comes a year later,

and violence is in the land

with ruler against ruler.

47So the time’s coming

when I’ll punish the idols in Babylon.

Its whole land will be disgraced;

its slain will fall inside it.

48Earth and sky and everything in them

will shout for joy over Babylon,

because its destroyers will come from the north,”

the LORD says.		Jer 51:45-48

49Babylon will fall in payment for the slain in Israel

and the whole region.

50You that have escaped the sword,

leave! Don’t stay!

Remember the LORD from afar

and keep Jerusalem in your mind.

51We’re ashamed because we’ve heard reproof;

disgrace shows on our faces

because foreigners have entered

the holy places in the LORD’s Temple.	Jer 51:49-51

52“So the time’s coming

when I’ll punish its idols,

and the mortally wounded will groan throughout its land.

53Even if Babylon ascends to the sky

and fortifies its lofty fortress,

destroyers will come to it from me,”

the LORD says.		Jer 51:52-53

54There’s an outcry from Babylon,

great destruction in the land of the Babylonians!

55The LORD is going to destroy it

and quiet its loud noise.

The waves of enemies will roar,

and the noise from their uproar will increase.

56The destroyer is coming against Babylon;

he’ll capture its strong men.

The LORD is a God that exacts recompense;

he’ll fully repay.

57“I’ll make its officials and wise men drunk,

its governors, officers, and strong men too;

they’ll sleep forever,”

the King says, whose name is Yahveh of Hosts.

58“Babylon’s thick walls will be completely torn down,

its massive gates set on fire;

so the nations will have worked for nothing;

the builders will have worn themselves out

only to get their work burned.” 	Jer 51:54-58

59The Message Jeremiah Gave to Seraiah Son of Neriah,

Grandson of Mahseiah, When He Went with Zedekiah, King of Judah,

to Babylon in the Fourth Year of His Reign

(Seraiah Was Quartermaster.)

60Jeremiah wrote in one scroll the catastrophe to come on Babylon. 61He told Seraiah,

“As soon as you get to Babylon, read this message out loud: 62‘LORD, you’ve promised to cut this place off so nothing will live in it, people or animals, so it’ll be a permanent desolation.’ 63As soon as you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. 64Say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink and not float back up because of the catastrophe I’m going to bring on it. The workers will have worn themselves out for nothing.’”

Jeremiah’s message ends here.	  Jer 51:59-64

The Fall of Jerusalem

52:1Zedekiah was 21 when he became king and ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 2He did all the evil Jehoiakim had done. 3Because of the LORD’s anger over that, he put Jerusalem and Judah out of his presence.

Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon. 4The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar came with his army, set up camp against Jerusalem, and built a siege wall around it. 5The city lay under siege till Zedekiah’s eleventh year. 6The ninth day, fourth month, the famine was so severe in the city that the people didn’t have any food left. 7Then they broke into the city, and the fighting men fled at night through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden, even though the Babylonians were all around the city. They went toward the Arabah, 8but the Babylonian army overtook the king in the plains by Jericho. His whole army scattered from him. 9They captured him and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 10He executed Zedekiah’s sons right in front of him and executed the officials of Judah. 11Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze bonds, and took him to Babylon. He put him in prison till his death. 	  Jer 52:1-11

The Temple Burned

12The tenth day, fifth month, nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the king of Babylon’s bodyguard, came to Jerusalem. 13He burned the LORD’s Temple, the king’s palace, the houses in Jerusalem, and the important buildings. 14The Babylonian army tore down the walls around Jerusalem. 15Nebuzaradan took into exile some of the poorest people, people left in the city, those who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. 16He left some destitute to dress grapevines and plow fields.                    		       Jer 52:12-16

17The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze pillars in front of the LORD’s Temple, the stands, and the bronze sea; and carried their bronze to Babylon. 18They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, basins, pans—all the bronze articles for the Temple service. 19The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, firepans, basins, pots, lampstands, dishes for incense and liquid offering bowls, what was gold and fine silver. 20The 2 pillars, the sea, the 12 bronze bulls under the sea, and the stands King Solomon had made for the LORD’s Temple—the bronze in all those items was too much to weigh. 21Each pillar was 27ft tall and 18ft in circumference—4 fingers thick and hollow. 22The bronze capital on each pillar was 7½ft high, with bronze network and pomegranates all around it. 23There were 96 pomegranates on the sides—100 altogether.

Jer 52:17-23

24Nebuzaradan took

Seraiah the chief priest,

Zephaniah the assistant priest,

three of the Temple’s doorkeepers,

25one city official that oversaw the fighting men,

seven of the king’s council they found in the city,

the secretary to the commander of the army who mustered the people, and

60 men they found in the city.

26He took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 27and the king put them to death there in Hamath. So they led Judah away into exile.

28These are the people Nebuchadnezzar carried away:

in his seventh year, 3,023 Jews;

29in his eighteenth year, 832 from Jerusalem;

30in his twenty-third year Nebuzaradan took away, 745 Jews:

4,600 in all.	 Jer 52:24-30

Jehoiachin Released

31The twenty-fifth day, twelfth month, thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin’s exile, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, was gracious to Jehoiachin and brought him out of prison. 32He was kind to him and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings that were with him in Babylon. 33So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals with the king regularly 34till his death.          	  Jer 52:31-34

THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH

Jerusalem Deserted

1:1How lonely the city sits that used to bustle with people!

She’s like a widow that was once great among the nations!

The princess among the provinces has become a slave!

2She cries bitterly at night; tears are on her cheeks.

Nobody among her lovers is there to comfort her.

Her friends have betrayed her

and become her enemies.

3Judah has gone into exile in suffering and hard servitude;

she’s spread out among the nations now;

with no resting place.

Her pursuers have caught up with her in the middle of her distress.

4The roads to Zion are in mourning

because nobody attends the appointed festivals.

Her gates are desolate, her priests groan,

her virgins suffer, and she suffers bitterly herself.	Lam 1:1-4

5Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper.

The LORD has made her suffer for her many sins.

Her children have gone away captive to the foe.

6The majesty is gone from Zion;

her officials are like bucks that can’t find pasture;

they’ve fled away weak before their pursuers.

7In her time of suffering and homelessness,

Jerusalem remembers her treasured things from before;

when her people fell to her adversaries and nobody helped her,

the enemies gloated over her and mocked her downfall.

8Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she’s become filthy.

Everybody that honored her before despises her now,

because they’ve seen her nakedness;

she groans and turns away.	Lam 1:5-8

9Her uncleanness was in her skirts;

she didn’t give any thought to her doom;

so she’s fallen terribly with no comforter.

10The foe has reached out for her treasured things;

she has watched the nations invade her sanctuary,

people you commanded not to enter your community.

11The people are groaning as they look for bread;

they’ve given their treasured things for food to stay alive;

“Look, LORD, I’m despised.

12Is it nothing to you that go by?

Look and see if there’s any pain like my pain

that was severely dealt out to me,

that the LORD inflicted in his fierce anger.	Lam 1:9-12

13He sent fire from on high into my bones, and it descended on them.

He spread a net for my feet and turned me back;

he left me desolate and faint all day long.

14He has tied my sins together into a yoke around my neck;

he has made my strength fail,

and turned me over to those I can’t withstand.

15The Lord has rejected the strong men that are with me;

he has called an appointed time against me to crush my young men;

like a winepress he has trodden down the young virgin Judah.

16I weep for those things; my eyes run down with tears

because there’s no comforter near to restore my soul.

My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.”	Lam 1:13-16

17Zion holds out her hands, but there’s no one to comfort her;

the LORD has commanded against Jacob

that his neighbors would be his enemies;

Jerusalem has become something filthy in their minds.

18“The LORD is good; I’ve rebelled against his command;

listen now, all you nations, and look at my pain;

my virgins and young men have gone into captivity.

19I called to my lovers, but they deceived me;

my priests and elders perished in the city

as they looked for food to stay alive.

20Look, LORD, because I’m in distress; my soul is in turmoil.

My heart’s upset because I’ve been rebellious.

The sword bereaves in the street; it’s like death in the house.	Lam 1:17-20

21They’ve heard that I’m groaning with nobody to comfort me.

My enemies have heard about my trouble;

they’re glad you’ve done it.

Bring the time you’ve promised,

and let them be like me.

22Pay attention to their sinfulness,,

and deal with them like you’ve dealt with me for my sins.

I groan a lot, and my heart is faint.”	Lam 1:21-22

Destruction for Sin

2:1How the Lord in his anger has covered Zion under a cloud!

He has thrown down Israel’s splendor from heaven to earth;

he hasn’t remembered his footstool in his wrath.

2Without mercy the Lord has swallowed up the residents in Jacob.

In his anger he has thrown down Judah’s fortresses

and leveled the kingdom and its officials to the ground in dishonor.

3In his fury he has cut down Israel’s power

and stopped restraining the enemy.

He has burned like a fire in Jacob

and consumed it everywhere.

4He has bent his bow like an enemy;

he has set his right hand like an adversary

and killed everybody we took pride in.

He has poured out his anger like fire in the tent of Zion.	Lam 2:1-4

5The Lord has become like an enemy;

he has swallowed up Israel,

laid its palaces in ruins,

destroyed its fortresses,

and multiplied mourning and groaning in Judah.

6He’s violently treated his Tabernacle like a garden shed

and laid in ruins his appointed meeting place.

The LORD has stricken from memory

the appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion,

and deposed king and priest in his angry indignation.

7The Lord has rejected his altar, disowned his sanctuary,

and delivered to the enemy the walls of its palaces.

A clamor was raised in the LORD’s Temple

like that of an appointed festival day.

8The LORD decided to destroy the wall around Zion.

He stretched out a line

and didn’t restrain his destroying.

He made rampart and wall mourn;

they’ve broken down together.	Lam 2:5-8

9Its gates have sunk into the ground;

he has ruined and broken its bars

and scattered its king and officials among the nations.

There’s no law anymore;

prophets don’t have visions from the LORD.

10The elders of Zion sit silent on the ground;

they’ve thrown dust on their heads

and wrapped themselves in burlap.

The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.

11My eyes are worn out from crying;

my spirit is in turmoil;

my heart is poured out on the ground

because my people have been destroyed;

the little ones and babies pass out in the street.

12They ask their mothers, “Where is the bread and wine?”

as they faint like wounded men in the city streets,

as their life dies out on their mother’s chest.	Lam 2:9-12

13What can I say for you?

What can I compare you to, young woman in Jerusalem?

What can I liken you to, as I comfort you, young virgin in Zion?

Your ruin is as wide as the sea; who can restore you?

14Your prophets have deceived you with false visions;

they haven’t exposed your iniquity to restore you from sin;

they’ve seen false, misleading oracles for you.

15Everybody that goes by claps their hands at you;

they gasp and shake their heads at Jerusalem,

“Is this the city they used to say was ‘perfectly beautiful,

a delight to the whole world’?”

16Your enemies mock you;

they scoff and snarl,

and shout, “We’ve swallowed you up!

That’s what we’ve been waiting for;

at last it’s here to see.”	Lam 2:13-16

17The LORD has accomplished his purpose

and carried out the threat he ordained long ago.

He has destroyed without pity

and enabled your enemies to celebrate over you

and increased the power of your adversaries.

18Their heart appealed to the Lord,

“Resident of Zion, let your tears run down like a river day and night;

don’t give yourself any relief or let your eyes rest.

19Get up, cry out loud at the beginning of the night watches;

pour your heart out like water to the Lord;

lift your hands up to him for the life of your little ones

who are faint from hunger at the end of every street.”

20See, LORD, look! Who else have you ever dealt with this way?

Should women eat their offspring, little babies born healthy?

Should prophet and priest be killed in your sanctuary?	Lam 2:17-20

21Young and old lie on the ground in the streets;

my virgins and young men have fallen by the sword.

You’ve slain them in your anger,

slaughtered them without mercy.

22You invited terrors on every side of me as to an appointed festival.

Nobody escaped or survived your anger.

My enemy destroyed the ones I cared for and raised.	Lam 2:21-22

Hope in the LORD’s Faithfulness

3:1I have seen suffering

under the rod God used in his anger.

2He has driven me out and made me walk in the dark;

3he has turned his hand against me repeatedly all day.

4He made my skin and body waste away,

and broke my bones.	Lam 3:1-4

5He besieged me with bitterness and hardship.

6He made me live in dark places

like the dead from long ago.

7He walled me in so I couldn’t escape

and put heavy chains on me.

8Even when I call for help,

he shuts out my prayer.	Lam 3:5-8

9He has blocked my road with hewn stones

and made my paths crooked.

10He’s like a bear lying in wait for me,

like a lion in unexpected places.

11He dragged me off the road, tore me to pieces;

and made me desolate.

12He bent his bow and made me a target for his arrow;	Lam 3:9-12

13he shot deep into me the arrows from his quiver.

14I’m a laughingstock to my people,

mocked in musical ditties all day.

15He filled me with bitterness

and made me drink wormwood.

16He cracked my teeth with gravel

and made me grovel in the dust.	Lam 3:13-16

17I’ve been set apart from peace

and forget what happiness is like.

18So I say, “My strength is gone,

and so is my hope in the LORD.”

19Remember my suffering and homelessness.

20I certainly remember

and am humbled within.	Lam 3:17-20

21I recall this and have hope from it:

22The LORD’s love never stops coming;

his mercies don’t end.

23His faithfulness is great;

it’s renewed every morning.

24I say to myself, “The LORD is my portion;

so I have hope in him.”	Lam 3:21-24

25The LORD is good to those who depend on him,

people that look for him.

26They do well to wait silently for his salvation.

27It’s good for people to bear the yoke when they’re young,

28to sit alone in silence, since God has laid it on them,

29to put their mouth in the dust—maybe there’s hope,

30to turn their cheek to their abuser,

to be filled with disgrace;

31because the LORD won’t reject forever.	Lam 3:25-31

32If he causes grief, he’ll have mercy

according to his enduring love;

33because he doesn’t willingly hurt people or grieve them.

34-36God doesn’t approve

of crushing every prisoner in the land under his feet,

of depriving people of justice in the presence of the Most High,

of defrauding people in his lawsuit.

37Who is there that speaks and it happens

unless the Lord has commanded it?

38Don’t both good and bad come from the Most High?	Lam 3:32-38

39Why should we complain in light of our sins?

40Let’s examine our ways and return to the LORD.

41Let’s lift up our heart and hands toward God in heaven;

42we’ve sinned and rebelled; you haven’t pardoned us.

43You’ve covered yourself with anger and chased us;

you’ve slain without pity.

44You’ve wrapped yourself in a cloud

so no prayer can get to you.	Lam 3:39-44

45You’ve made us residue and refuse among the nations.

46Our enemies rail out against us.

47Panic and pitfall descend on us, devastation and destruction.

48My eyes run with streams of tears

because my people are being destroyed.

49My eyes will keep pouring out

50till the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.

51My eyes bring pain to my soul

because of all the residents in my city.

52For no reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird;

53they’ve silenced me in the pit, and put a stone over me;

54water closed over my head; I said, “I’m lost.”

55I called to you, LORD, from down in the pit.	Lam 3:45-55

56You heard my plea

and didn’t hide from my prayer for relief, my call for help.

57You came and said, “Don’t be afraid!”

58Lord, you pled my case and redeemed my life.

59LORD, you’ve seen my oppression; judge my case.

60You’ve seen their revenge, their schemes against me.

61You’ve heard their taunts.

62My assailants’ whispers aim at me all day.

63Look at their sitting and rising;

I’m what they mock in their song.

64Pay them back, LORD, according to what they’ve done;

65harden their heart so your curse will fall on them.

66Chase them in anger and destroy them from under the sky!	Lam 3:56-66

The LORD’s Anger Satisfied

4:1How the gold has tarnished; how pure gold has changed!

The holy stones lie scattered at the beginning of every street.

2The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in gold,

are treated like clay pots that potters make!

3Even jackals nurse their young,

but my people have become cruel like wild ostriches.

4The infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst;

little ones beg for bread, but nobody gives them any.

5People that used to eat delicacies sit desolate in the streets;

the ones brought up in purple lie on ash heaps.

6The iniquity of my people is worse than the sin of Sodom,

which was overthrown without hands in one moment.

7Zion’s Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk,

healthier looking than corals, like polished lapis lazuli.	Lam 4:1-7

8Now they’re darker than soot, not recognizable in the streets;

their skin is shriveled on their bones, withered like wood.

9Those killed with the sword are happier than those slain by hunger;

they pine away, stricken for lack of crops in the field.

10Merciful women boiled their own children;

they became their food because my people were being destroyed.

11The LORD has accomplished his wrath,

poured out his hot anger,

and sparked a fire in Zion that has consumed its foundations.

12The kings and inhabitants of the region

didn’t believe enemies could get in the gates of Jerusalem. 	Lam 4:8-12

13Because of its prophets’ sins and its priests’ iniquities—

who shed the blood of good people in it—

14they wandered in the streets, blind and defiled with blood

so nobody would even touch their clothes.

15They shouted at them, “Get away! Unclean! Don’t touch!”

So they fled and wandered.

People in the nations said, “They can’t stay here anymore.”

16The LORD has scattered them;

he won’t continue to care especially about them;

they didn’t honor the priests or bless the elders.	Lam 4:13-16

17Our eyes failed us; looking for help was useless;

we certainly watched for a nation that couldn’t save.

18People dogged our steps so we couldn’t walk in the streets;

our end came near, our days failed, we were through.	Lam 4:17-18

19Our pursuers were faster than eagles in the sky;

they chased us on the mountains and ambushed us in the desert.

20Our very breath, the LORD’s anointed, was captured in their pits;

we’d said about him, “In his shadow we’ll live among the nations.”

21Celebrate and be happy, Edom that lives in Uz;

the cup will come around to you as well; you’ll be drunk and naked.

22The punishment for your sinfulness is finished, Zion;

he won’t exile you any longer.

But he’ll punish your iniquity, Edom;

he’ll expose your sins!	Lam 4:19-22

Prayer for Restoration

5:1LORD, remember what’s happened to us;

look at our disgrace!

2Our inheritance has been turned over to foreigners,

and our houses belong to aliens.

3We’ve become orphans without fathers;

our mothers are like widows.

4We have to pay for drinking water and buy wood.

5Our drivers put yokes on our necks;

we’re worn out; we can’t get any rest.	Lam 5:1-5

6We’ve submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.

7Our fathers sinned, and they’re gone,

but we have to suffer for their sins.

8Slaves rule us; nobody can deliver us from them.

9We risk our lives just getting bread

because of the sword in the open country.

10Our skin is hot like an oven,

because of the burning heat of famine.

11They rape the women in Zion

and the virgins in the towns in Judah.	Lam 5:6-11

12They hang up officials by their hands

and show no respect for old men.

13Young men work at the grinding mill

and stagger under loads of wood.

14Elders are gone from the city gate,

young men have quit their music.

15The joy in our hearts is gone;

our dancing has turned into mourning.

16The crown has fallen from our head;

misfortune awaits us because we’ve sinned!

17Our heart is faint because of it;

our eyes are weak.

18Jackals prowl in desolate Zion.	Lam 5:12-18

19LORD, you rule forever;

your throne goes on for endless generations.

20Why don’t you keep us in mind forever?

Why abandon us so long?

21Restore us to yourself, LORD, so we can be restored;

renew our days as of old,

22unless you’ve completely rejected us

and are really angry with us.	Lam 5:19-22

EZEKIEL

A Vision of Living Beings and

the Glory of the LORD

1:1The fifth day, fourth month, thirtieth year, I was by the Chebar River with the exiles. The sky opened up, and I saw a vision of God. (2The fifth month, fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, 3God’s message came to Ezekiel, and God’s hand came on him.) 4A strong north wind was blowing, and a large cloud with a bright glow around it flashed constantly with lightning. In the cloud was something like glowing metal 5and four figures like living beings with human forms. 6Each one had four faces and four wings. 7They had straight legs, and their feet resembled calf hooves that shined like polished bronze. 8There were hands under their wings, 9and the wings of all four touched each other. Their faces didn’t turn as they moved straight forward. 10Each one had the faces of a man, an eagle, a lion on the right, and a bull on the left. 11Their wings spread out above them, two wings touching the wings of the next living beings and two covering their bodies. 12They went straight forward wherever the spirit went, without turning as they went. 13Among the beings were what looked like burning coals, like torches moving back and forth. The fire burned bright, and lightning kept flashing out of it. 14The living beings darted back and forth like bolts of lightning.	Ezek 1:1-14

15A wheel appeared on the ground beside each living being. 16The wheels looked like glowing chrysolite built with a wheel inside a wheel. 17When they moved in any of the four directions, they moved without turning. 18Their rims were tall with eyes all the way around.            19-20When the living beings left the ground or moved, the wheels moved with them. The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. [21]

22A bright expanse glowed like crystal above them. 23Under it their wings stretched out toward one another, and two wings covered the sides of their bodies. 24Their wings sounded like rushing water, like the Almighty, like war, like an army camp. When they stood still, they lowered their wings, 25and a voice spoke from the expanse above them.	Ezek 1:15-25

26High above the expanse was a throne the color of lapis lazuli; the One sitting on it resembled a man. 27From the waist up, he glowed like metal on fire; from the waist down, he resembled fire. The radiance around him was 28like a rainbow on a rainy day. This scene looked like the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice, 	     Ezek 1:26-28

2:1“Son of man, stand up so I can talk to you!” 2When the Spirit stood me up, 3he said,

“I’m sending you to the Israelites, a rebellious people. They and their ancestors have been sinning against me to this day. 4Tell those impudent, stubborn children, ‘The Lord GOD says.’ 5Whether they listen or not, they’ll know a prophet’s been there. 6Don’t be afraid of them or intimidated by what they say, though you’re surrounded by briars and thorns and sitting on scorpions. 7Tell them what I’ve said whether they listen or not.      	Ezek 2:1-7

8“Don’t be like that rebellious house. Eat what I’m giving you.” 9A hand held out a scroll to me. 10When he unrolled it for me, I could see writing on both sides—lamentations, mourning, and misfortune. 3:1“Eat this scroll and go speak to Israel.” 2So I opened my mouth, and he fed it to me. 3It tasted sweet like honey.	Ezek 2:8-3:3

[4] 5-6“I’m not sending you to people that speak a hard foreign language you can’t understand. I’m sending you to people that should listen; 7but they won’t listen to you, because they won’t listen to me. The whole house is stubborn. 8I’ve made your face and forehead as hard as theirs, 9like corundum, harder than flint. So don’t be afraid of them or be intimidated by them though they’re rebellious people. 10Listen closely and take everything to heart that I tell you. 11Go to your people in exile and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says,’ whether they listen or not.”

12The Spirit picked me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me, “Bless the LORD in his place.” 13I was hearing the wings of the living beings that touched one another and had the wheels beside them. 14The Spirit took me away; I felt bitter and angry, and the LORD’s hand weighed heavy on me. 15I went to the exiles by the Chebar River at Tel-abib and sat there with them for a week, feeling overwhelmed.	Ezek 3:4-15

A Watchman for Israel

16A week later a message came from the LORD:

17“Son of man, I’ve appointed you to be a watchman for Israel. Whenever you hear something from me, warn them. 18When I tell sinful people they’re going to die, and you don’t warn them so they can live, they’ll die in their sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for it. 19If you’ve warned them, and they don’t change, they’ll die in their sin, but you’ve delivered yourself. 20On the other hand, when good people start sinning and I block them, they’ll die. Since you didn’t warn them, they’ll die in their sin. I won’t consider the good they’d done, but I’ll hold you responsible for their death. 21But if you’ve warned them and they quit sinning, they’ll live because they listened, and you’ll deliver yourself.”

Ezek 3:16-21

22The LORD put hand on me there and said, “Get up and go out to the plain, and I’ll talk to you.” 23The glory of the LORD was there, glory like I’d seen by the Chebar River; I fell on my face. 24The Spirit came into me and stood me up, and said,

“Go shut yourself up in your house. 25They’ll tie you up with ropes so you can’t go out among them. 26I’ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you can’t talk. You won’t be able to rebuke them because they’re a rebellious house. 27But when I speak to you and you tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says,’ the ones that listen will listen; the ones that won’t, won’t. They’re a rebellious house.         	    Ezek 3:22-27

Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized

4:1“Now, son of man, take a tablet and etch Jerusalem on it. 2Lay a siege against it with a siege wall and ramp, pitch camps, and position battering rams all around it. 3Then set up an iron plate as a wall between you and the city. Face it and press the siege against it. It’s an omen for Israel.

4“Lie down on your left side, and I’ll lay Israel’s punishment on you. You’ll bear their punishment for the number of days you lie on it. 5Lie like that one day for each of the 390 years they’ve sinned. 6When you’ve finished, lie down on your right side, and bear Judah’s sin. I’ve assigned you 40 days, one for each year. 7Then you’ll face the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. 8I’ve tied you up with ropes so you can’t turn from one side to the other till you’ve finished the days of your siege.	Ezek 4:1-8

9“Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in one container and bake bread. Eat it for the 390 days you’re lying on your side. 10Once a day eat 8 oz 20 shekels of food 11and drink a quart ⅙ hin of water. 12Eat it like a barley cake after you’ve baked it in front of them over human feces. 13That’s how the Israelites will eat their bread unclean among the nations where I’ll banish them.”

14But I said, “Lord GOD, since I was a kid, I’ve never defiled myself by eating ceremonially unclean meat, anything that died, anything an animal had torn in pieces.”

15He said, “I’ll give you cow manure instead of human feces to bake your bread. 16I’m going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They’ll ration bread by weight with fear and water by measure in alarm. 17Bread and water will be scarce; people will look at one another in dismay and waste away in their sin.”

Ezek 4:9-17

5:1“Son of man, take a sharp sword and shave off your hair and beard. Divide up the hair on a scales. 2Burn a third of it in the center of the city when the siege is over. Strike a third of it with a sword all around the city. Scatter another third of it in the wind, because I’m going to chase my people with a drawn sword. 3Attach a few to the hem of your robe. 4Throw a few in the fire. They’ll spread from the fire to the whole House of Israel.  5I’ve set Jerusalem in the center of the nations. 6It rebelled against my ordinances and statutes more than those other nations did.” 	Ezek 5:1-6

7So the Lord GOD says, “I’m against you; there’s more turmoil in you than in the nations around you. You haven’t followed my statutes or observed my ordinances or even [LXX] the ordinances of surrounding nations. 8I’ll carry out judgments on you for the nations to see. 9Because of your detestable deeds, I’ll do to you what I’ve never done before or will ever do again. 10Fathers will eat their own sons and sons will eat their fathers. My condemnations will scatter your remnant in every direction. 11As I live, I’ll withdraw from you because you’ve defiled my sanctuary with your detestable idols and carved images. I won’t pity or spare. 12A third of you will die by disease and starvation, a third will fall by the sword, a third I’ll scatter in every direction from the drawn sword.	      Ezek 5:7-12

13“That’s how I’ll vent my fury on you. You’ll know I’ve said it. 14I’ll make a wasteland out of you among the nations, something everyone that passes by will consider a disgrace, 15a taunt, a warning, something they’ll abhor when I carry out condemnations on you in anger and rebuke. 16When I send you the deadly arrows of famine meant for your foes, I’ll intensify it to break your staff of bread. 17Wild animals will bereave you of your children. Disease, sword, and bloodshed will surge through you. I’ve said so.”     	 Ezek 5:13-17

A Prophecy Against the Mountains of Israel

6:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, face Israel’s mountains and prophesy, 3‘Listen to the Lord GOD’s message to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys: “I’m going to bring a sword against you and destroy your high places. 4Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars smashed. You’ll fall slain in front of your idols, 5and I’ll scatter your bones around your altars. 6Everywhere you live, towns will be waste, high places desolate, idols broken, incense altars cut down, and the religious objects you’ve made, destroyed. 7You’ll know I’m the LORD.

8“But I’ll leave a few of you. Some will escape the sword in the nations where you scatter. 9You’ll think back to me where they take you captive—how you’ve hurt me with your adulterous hearts and with eyes that carried on prostitution with idols. You’ll abhor yourselves for those detestable deeds. 10You’ll know I’m the LORD, that I meant it when I said I’d inflict you with this disaster.”’	  Ezek 6:1-10

11“The Lord GOD says, ‘Clap your hands, stomp your feet, say, “This has happened because of Israel’s abominations. It will fall by sword, famine, and disease! 12The one that’s far off will die by the disease. The one that’s nearby will fall by the sword. The one that’s left and besieged will starve to death.” That’s how I’ll vent my fury on you. 13Your slain will lie among your idols, around your altars, on every tall hill and mountaintop, under every green tree and leafy terebinth tree—where you offered a soothing aroma to your idols. 14The land will be more desolate than the desert toward Diblah. That’s how you’ll know I’m the LORD.’”         	   Ezek 6:11-14

The End Has Come

7:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, the Lord GOD says to Israel, ‘The end is coming on the four corners of your land. 3I’ll judge you by your ways, direct my anger at you, and bring your detestable things against you. 4I won’t pity or spare when I bring on you the consequences of your deeds with the detestable things you’ve used.’ 5A disaster—a unique disaster—is coming! 6The end is here! It has awakened against you! 7You’re doomed, resident in the land—confusion instead of happy shouting on the mountains. [8] 9You’ll know that I the LORD am striking you.

10“The rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed, 11violence has grown into a rod of sinfulness. Nothing will remain of their multitude, their wealth, or anything outstanding that they have. 12The buyer shouldn’t celebrate, the seller shouldn’t mourn, because anger is aimed at their abundance. 13The seller won’t regain what he sold as long as they’re both alive, because the vision about their affluence won’t fade away. Because of his sin, neither will live. 	  Ezek 7:1-13

14“They’ve blown the bugle and everything’s ready, but nobody is going to battle because I’m angry with their whole population. 15The sword’s outside; famine and disease are inside. The ones out in the country will die by the sword; famine and disease will kill the ones in the city. 16Even when survivors escape, they’ll be on the mountains like pigeons from the valley, mourning over his sinfulness. 17Hands will hang limp; knees will be like water. 18They’ll put on burlap and shudder. Their faces will blush; their heads will be bald. 19They’ll toss their silver into the streets and abhor their gold. Their silver and gold won’t be able to deliver them from the LORD’s anger. They won’t satisfy their hunger with it because that’s what made them stumble. 20The beautiful jewels they were so proud of, they used for making detestable idols; so I’ll turn their wealth into something detestable to them. 21I’ll give them to foreigners as plunder, to the sinful as spoil; and they’ll defile them. 22I’ll look the other way while invaders profane my precious land. Robbers will go in and defile it 23and make it desolate.

Ezek 7:14-23a

“The land’s filled with bloody crimes; the city’s full of violence. 24So I’ll bring the worst of the nations to take over their houses. I’ll put an end to their proud strength and profane their holy places. 25When anguish comes, they’ll look for peace, but there won’t be any, 26just disaster on top of disaster, rumor on top of rumor. They’ll find no vision from a prophet; the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders. 27The king will mourn; the prince will put on rags; the people’s hands will tremble. I’ll deal with them by the way they’ve acted, judge them by their own judgments. They’ll know I’m the LORD.’”

Ezek 7:23b-27

Idolatry in the Temple

8:1The fifth day, sixth month, sixth year, I was sitting in my house with Judah’s elders sitting in front of me, and the hand of the Lord GOD came down on me. 2I saw what looked like a man. From the waist down, he looked like fire; from the waist up, he looked like bright glowing metal. 3He reached out with a hand and took hold of my hair. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and sky, and took me in a vision to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, to the seat of the idol that provokes jealousy. 4The glory of Israel’s God was there—like what I’d seen in the plain.

5He said, “Son of man, look north.” North of the altar gate at the entrance, I saw this idol that made God jealous. 6“Do you see the detestable things Israel is doing here to keep me out of my own sanctuary? But you’ll see still more detestable things.”  	   Ezek 8:1-6

7Then he took me to the entrance to the court and showed me a hole in the wall. 8“Dig through the wall.” I dug through it and found an entrance. 9“Go in and see what awful, detestable things they’re doing.” 10I went in and saw the shape of every crawling thing, every animal and detestable thing along with Israel’s idols carved all around the wall. 11Seventy elders of Israel were standing in front of them with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one was holding a censer, and the fragrance of the incense was rising in a cloud.

12“See what Israel’s elders are doing in the dark in the room of carved images? They’re saying, ‘The LORD’s not watching us; he’s abandoned the land.’ 13You’ll see still more detestable things they’re doing.”          	   Ezek 8:7-13

14He took me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple. Women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz. 15“See that? You’ll see still more detestable things.”

16He took me to the inner court. At the entrance to the Temple between the porch and altar, about 25 men with their backs to the Temple were facing east, prostrating themselves toward the sun.

17“See that? Isn’t it enough for Judah to do those detestable things, that they’ve filled the land with violence and provoked me time and again? They’re putting a twig up their nose. 18I’ll deal in anger. I won’t pity or spare. Though they call out loudly, I’ll ignore them.”	  Ezek 8:14-18

Idolaters Killed

9:1He shouted, “Executioners, come here with your weapons.” 2Six men, each holding a shattering weapon, came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. One of them was wearing linen with a scribe’s inkhorn on his hip. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.

3The glory of God rose up from the cherub it rested on and went to the threshold of the temple. He called out to the man with the inkhorn, 				          	          Ezek 9:1-3

4“Go all over the city and mark the foreheads of people who sigh and groan over the detestable things going on here.” 5-6He told the others, “Follow him and kill old men, young men, girls, little children, and women. Don’t pity or spare, but don’t touch anybody with the mark. Start at my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders that were in front of the Temple. 7He told them, “Defile the Temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down the people in the city. 8While they were striking them down and I was by myself, I fell on my face and shouted, “Lord GOD! Are you going to destroy the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out your anger on Jerusalem?”

9He told me, “The sinfulness of Israel and Judah is extreme. The land is filled with blood; the city is full of perversion. They’re saying, ‘The LORD has abandoned the land; he’s not watching us!’ 10I won’t pity or spare. I’ll bring the consequences of their actions on their own heads.”

11The man with the inkhorn reported, “I’ve done what you said.”	             Ezek 9:4-11

The LORD’s Glory Leaves the Temple

10:1Then in the expanse above the cherubs, I saw something like a sapphire stone shaped like a throne. 2He spoke to the man dressed in linen, “Go between the turning wheels under the cherubs and fill your hands with coals. Scatter them over the city.” I watched him go in.

3The cherubs were standing on the right side of the Temple when he went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 4The glory of the LORD rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the Temple. The cloud filled the Temple, and the bright glory of the LORD filled the court. 5The cherubs’ wings could be heard all the way to the outer court—like God Almighty when he speaks.	Ezek 10:1-5

6When he told the man in linen to take fire from between the turning wheels, he went in and stood beside a wheel. 7A cherub reached out to the fire between the cherubs, took some coals, and put them in the man’s hand. He took them and went out. 8The cherubs had what looked like a man’s hand under their wings.

9Then I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one beside each one. The wheels glowed like chrysolite. 10All four looked alike as if one wheel was inside another wheel. 11When they moved they went in any of four directions without turning from the direction they faced. 12Their whole bodies were covered with eyes—backs, hands, wings, and their wheels. 13I heard the wheels called “whirling wheels.” 14They had four faces each—a cherub, man, lion, and eagle.

Ezek 10:6-14

15The cherubs rose up—the living beings I’d seen by the Chebar River. 16When they moved, the wheels went beside them. When they lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels stayed beside them. 17When they stood still, the wheels stood still, because the spirit of the living beings was in them.

18The glory of the LORD went from the Temple threshold to stand above the cherubs. 19When they left, I saw them lift their wings and rise up from the ground with the wheels beside them. They stood at the entrance of the Temple’s east gate, and the glory of God hovered over them. 20They were the living beings I’d seen below God by the Chebar River; so I knew they were cherubs. [21-22]    	Ezek 10:15-22

Judgment on Israel’s Leaders

11:1The Spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the Temple. There were 25 men at the entrance of the gate, including Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. 2He told me,

“Those men devise sin and give bad advice in this city. 3They say, ‘Isn’t it time to build houses? This city is the pot and we’re the meat.’ 4So prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!”	Ezek 11:1-4

5The Spirit of the LORD fell on me:

“Say, ‘The LORD says, “I know your thoughts. 6You’ve multiplied the slain in this city and filled its streets with them. 7So the slain are the meat, and the city is the pot; but I’ll take you out of it. 8You’ve been afraid of the sword; so I’ll bring the sword on you. 9I’ll remove you from the city and deliver you to foreigners to carry out your condemnation. 10You’ll fall by the sword all the way to Israel’s border. 11This city won’t be a pot for you, and you won’t be the meat in it. 12You’ll know I’m the LORD because you haven’t followed my statutes or carried out my ordinances. You’ve followed the ordinances of the nations around you.”’”

13As I prophesied, Pelatiah died. I fell on my face and shouted, “Lord GOD! Are you going to put an end to the remnant of Israel completely?”	Ezek 11:5-13

A New Heart and Spirit for Israel

14A message from the LORD came to me:

15“Son of man, your brothers, relatives, fellow exiles, and the whole House of Israel are the ones the people in Jerusalem have told, ‘Go far away from the LORD; we’ve received this land.’ 16So say, ‘The Lord GOD says, “Though I’ve removed them far away, yet I’ve been a sanctuary for them a little while where they’ve gone. 17I’ll gather them out of those countries back to Israel.”’ 18They’ll get rid of its abominations and detestable things. 19I’ll give them one heart and a new spirit. I’ll take out their stone heart and give them a real one 20so they can follow my statutes and keep my ordinances. They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. 21Those who go after detestable things will have the consequences of their conduct come down on their own heads,”

the Lord GOD says.	                      Ezek 11:14-21

22Then the cherubs lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of God hovered over them. 23His glory went up from the city and stood above the mountain east of it. 24The Spirit of God lifted me up and took me in a vision to the exiles in Babylonia. So the vision I’d seen left me. 25I told the exiles what the LORD had shown me.    	        Ezek 11:22-25

Judah’s Exile Symbolized

12:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, you’re living with a rebellious people. They have eyes but don’t see, and ears but don’t hear. 3So get together baggage for exile and go into exile in the daytime so they can watch; go from one place to another. Maybe they’ll understand, though they’re a rebellious people. 4Bring your baggage out in the daytime. Then go out in the evening as if you’re going into exile. 5Make a hole in the wall so they can watch you go out through it.	Ezek 12:1-5

6“Put the baggage on your shoulder and carry it out in the dark. Cover your face so you can’t see where you’re going. I’m using you as an object lesson for Israel.”

7So in the daytime I brought out my baggage like an exile. In the evening I made a hole in the wall with my hands. I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder while they watched.	 Ezek 12:6-7

8In the morning a message from the LORD came to me:

9“Son of man, hasn’t the rebellious House of Israel asked you what you’re doing? 10Tell them the Lord GOD says this oracle is about the official in Jerusalem and the House of Israel that’s there. 11‘I’m an object lesson for you. As I’ve done, you’ll do. You’ll go into exile.’ 12The official that’s among you will put his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. He’ll make a hole in the wall to take it out. He’ll cover his face so he can’t see where he’s going. 13I’ll throw my net over him and take him to Babylon in the land of the Babylonians, but he won’t see it even though he’s going to die there. 14I’ll scatter in every direction his helpers and troops, and chase them with a sword. 15They’ll know I’m the LORD when I scatter them among the countries. 16I’ll spare a few from sword, famine, and disease so they can confess their detestable acts to the nations where they go.”  	Ezek 12:8-16

17A message from the LORD came to me:

18“Son of man, eat your bread cringing; drink your water shuddering with anxiety. 19Then tell the people the Lord GOD says, “The people in Jerusalem will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with alarm, because everybody living there will strip them violently. 20The populated towns will be laid waste; the land will be desolate. They’ll know I’m the LORD.’”	Ezek 12:17-20

21A message from the LORD came to me:

22“Son of man, what’s this proverb you people have about Israel, ‘The days are long and every vision fails’? 23Tell them the Lord GOD says, ‘I’ll make this proverb stop being used. The time’s coming soon for fulfilling every vision. 24From now on, there won’t be false vision or flattering fortunetelling in Israel. 25I’ll speak, and it’ll happen without delay. In your days, rebellious people, what I’ll say I’ll do.’”

26A message from the LORD came to me:

27“Son of man, Israel is saying, ‘The vision he sees is for years from now.’ 28Tell them, “None of what I’m saying will delay any longer. It will happen soon,’” 	the Lord GOD says.	Ezek 12:21-28

False Prophets Condemned

13:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, prophesy against Israel’s prophets who prophesy their own ideas, 3‘The Lord GOD says, “Misfortune awaits foolish prophets that follow their own imagination and haven’t seen anything. 4Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins. 5You haven’t gone up into the breaches or built the wall around the House of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD. 6They see falsehood and lying fortunetelling who say, ‘The LORD says,’ when he hasn’t sent them. They’re just hoping their message will be what happens. 7Didn’t you see a false vision and say a lying fortunetelling when you said, ‘the LORD says’? I’m not the one that spoke.”’” 	   Ezek 13:1-7

8“So because you’ve lied, 9I’m against the prophets that see false visions and say lying fortunetelling. You won’t be in the council of my people, be recorded in the registry of Israel, or go to the land of Israel. You’ll know I’m the Lord GOD. 10That’s because you’ve misled my people by saying, ‘Peace!’ when there isn’t any. When somebody builds a wall, he daubs it with whitewash. 11Tell him it will fall. A downpour will come, hailstones will fall, violent wind will blow. 12When it falls, won’t they ask you where the plaster is you daubed on it?”

Ezek 13:8-12

13So the Lord GOD says, “In my anger I’ll make a violent wind break out with hailstones and a downpour to bring down that wall. 14What you daubed with whitewash I’ll bring down till its foundation shows. When it falls, it will bring you down with it. You’ll know I’m the LORD. 15I’ll spend my anger on the wall and the ones that whitewashed it. I’ll tell you, ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers too, 16along with the prophets in Jerusalem that see visions of peace for it when there isn’t any.’

17“Now, son of man, set your face against your people that are prophesying from their own imagination. Prophesy against them, 18‘Misfortune awaits women that sew magic bands on everybody’s wrists and make every size of veil for the people’s heads to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down my people, but preserve others for yourselves? 19For handfuls of barley and scraps of bread, you’ve profaned me to my people, killing some who shouldn’t die and protecting others that shouldn’t live. You’ve done it by lying to my people.’	    Ezek 13:13-19

20“I’m against the magic bands you use to hunt lives like birds. I’ll tear them off your arms and let go the ones you hunt like birds. 21I’ll tear off your veils and deliver my people from you. They won’t be in your hands to be hunted. 22Since you disheartened good people with falsehood when I didn’t cause them grief, since you’ve encouraged the sinful not to turn from their sins and have kept them alive, 23your women won’t see false visions anymore or practice fortunetelling. I’ll deliver my people from you. That’s how you’ll know I’m the LORD.”	Ezek 13:20-23

Israel’s Idolatrous Leaders Condemned

14:1Then some elders of Israel came and sat down in front of me. 2A message from the LORD came to me:

3“Son of man, these people have set up idols in their hearts, and put their sins in front of them to trip over. Should they consult me? 4So tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says, “If any Israelites or immigrants in Israel set up idols in their heart, put their sin in front of them to trip over, and then come to a prophet to inquire from me, I’ll answer them myself because of their many idols. 5I’ll do it to lay hold of the hearts in Israel that are alienated from me by their idols.”’ 	Ezek 14:1-5

6’So repent and turn away from your detestable idols. [7] 8I’ll oppose you and make an example out of you and a proverb. I’ll cut you off from my people. So you’ll know I’m the LORD. 9But if the prophet is tempted to speak a message, I’m the one that tempted him, and I’ll destroy him from my people. 10The inquirer and the prophet will get the same punishment for their iniquity. 11That’s so Israel won’t stray from me anymore and defile themselves with their sins.’”	Ezek 14:6-11

Jerusalem Not Spared

12A message from the LORD came to me:

13“Son of man, if a country is unfaithful to me, and I destroy its food supply, send famine on it, and slay its people and animals, 14even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they’d only deliver themselves. 15If I let wild animals overrun it and make it so dangerous nobody would go through it,16though these three men were in it, as I live, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They’d only deliver themselves; the country would be a wasteland. 17If I bring a sword on that country to cut off people and animals, 18though these three men were in it, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They’d only deliver themselves. 19If I send a disease on it and pour out my anger on it to slay people and animals, 20even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they couldn’t deliver their own sons or daughters. They would only deliver themselves by their goodness.

Ezek 14:12-20

21“How much more, then, when I send my four severe judgments against Jerusalem: sword, famine, wild animals, and disease to slay people and animals in it! 22But some children will survive and come out to you to comfort you from the catastrophe I’ve brought on Jerusalem. 23They’ll comfort you when you see their deeds, and you’ll know I’ve done it for a reason.” 	Ezek 14:21-23

Jerusalem, a Useless Vine

15:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, how does the wood in a grapevine compare to the wood in a tree limb? 3Can you make anything out of grapevine wood, say, a peg to hang a bucket on? 4If it’s been put in the fire for fuel, is burned on both ends and charred in the middle, can you make anything out of it? 5If it’s intact and you can’t make it into anything, how much less when fire has burned and charred it.” 6So the Lord GOD says, “Like grapevine wood that I’ve put in the fire for fuel, I’ve given up the people in Jerusalem. 7Though they’ve come out of the fire, it’s charred them. You’ll know I’m the LORD when I set myself against them. 8I’ll make the country desolate because they’ve been unfaithful.”	Ezek 15:1-8

Jerusalem, an Unfaithful Wife

16:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, confront Jerusalem about her detestable things. 3Say, ‘Your birth was from the Canaanites—an Amorite father and a Hittite mother. 4When you were born, your umbilical cord wasn’t cut off, you weren’t washed, or rubbed with salt, or even wrapped in cloth. 5Nobody took pity on you to do any of those things for you. You were tossed out in an open field because you were repulsive.

Ezek 16:1-5

6“When I went by and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you, ‘Live!’ 7I made you as numerous as plants in a field. You grew up tall and filled out. Your breasts formed and your hair grew, but you were naked and bare. 8Then I went by and saw you were at the age to be sexually active; so I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my word and made a covenant with you so you’d be mine. 9I gave you a bath, washed off your blood, and anointed you with oil. 10I dressed you with embroidered cloth, put porpoise-skin sandals on you, wrapped you in fine linen, and covered you with silk. 11I adorned you with bracelets, a necklace, 12a ring in your nostril, earrings, and a beautiful crown. 13You wore gold and silver, fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and olive oil. So you were especially beautiful and advanced to royalty. 14You became famous in every country because of your beauty. It was perfect because of the splendor I put on you.” 	  Ezek 16:6-14

15“But you trusted in your beauty and played the prostitute because you were famous. You poured out your prostitutions on every passer-by that was willing. 16You took some of your clothes and made high places of various colors and played the prostitute on them. That shouldn’t have happened. 17You took the beautiful gold and silver jewels I gave you and made male images so you could carry on prostitution with them. 18You took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered my oil and incense to them. 19The bread I gave you, the fine flour, olive oil, and honey I fed you, you offered in front of them for a soothing aroma. 20You took the sons and daughters you bore to me and sacrificed them to idols. Were your prostitutions a small thing? 21You slaughtered my children and offered them up to idols by making them pass through fire. 22Besides your abominations and prostitutions, you forgot your youth when you were naked, squirming in your blood.  	Ezek 16:15-22

23“Then after all your sinfulness (The Lord GOD says, ‘Misfortune awaits you!’), 24you built a shrine and made a high place in every square. 25You build a high place at the head of every street and made your beauty detestable. You spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your prostitution. 26You carried on prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, to make me angry. 27I reached out against you, diminished your rations, and delivered you to those who hate you, the young women of the Philistines, who are embarrassed by your lewd behavior. 28You carried on prostitution with the Assyrians 29and multiplied it with the merchants of Babylon. You still weren’t satisfied.”’” 	Ezek 16:23-29

30“How lovesick your heart is,” the Lord GOD says, “while you do all this brazen prostitution. 31When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you weren’t like a prostitute—32you adulteress wife that takes strangers instead of your husband! 33Men pay prostitutes but you pay your lovers! 34Nobody carries on prostitution like you do. You do the paying!” 	Ezek 16:30-34

35So, prostitute, listen to what the LORD says, 36“Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers and your detestable idols, and because of your sons’ blood that you gave to idols, 37I’ll gather the lovers you had pleasure with, the ones both loved and hated. I’ll gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them. 38That’s how I’ll judge you—like women that commit adultery or shed blood. I’ll bring on you the blood of anger and jealousy. 39I’ll deliver you to your lovers. They’ll tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip off your clothes, steal your jewels, and leave you naked. 40They’ll stir up a mob against you, stone you, and cut you to pieces with swords. 41Many women will watch me burn your houses and carry out judgments on you. I’ll make you quit being a prostitute. You won’t be paying your lovers anymore. 42I’ll calm my fury against you. My jealousy will leave you, and I’ll be at peace. 43Since you’ve forgotten your youth and angered me with those things, I’ll bring your deeds down on your own head. So you won’t continue to commit that lewdness in addition to your other disgusting deeds.	Ezek 16:35-43

44“Everybody that quotes sayings will quote this one about you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ 45You’re your mother’s daughter, who despised her husband and children. You’re your sisters’ sister, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite; your father was an Amorite. 46Your older sister is Samaria that lives north of you with her daughters. Your younger sister is Sodom that lives south of you with her daughters. 47You haven’t just done disgusting things like theirs; you’ve done worse. 48As I live, Sodom your sister and her daughters haven’t done like you and your daughters have done. 49This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she didn’t help the poor and needy. 50They were arrogant and committed disgusting sins in my presence; so I removed them. 51Samaria didn’t commit half the sins you did. 52Deal with your disgrace because you’ve made judgment easier on your sisters. Your sins are worse than theirs. They’re better than you. Be ashamed and deal with your disgrace, because by comparison you make your sisters look good.	Ezek 16:44-52

53“But, I’ll overturn the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, along with your captivity, 54so you can deal with your humiliation, and feel ashamed of everything you’ve done when you become a consolation to them. 55Your sisters, Sodom and Samaria with their daughters, will come back to their former condition, and you with your daughters will come back to your former condition. 56-57Before your own sinfulness was revealed, you wouldn’t even say the name of your sister Sodom in your pride. 57So now you’ve become the disgrace of the Edomites and everybody around them, the disgrace of the Philistines, people around you that despise you. 58You’ve borne the penalty for your lewdness. 59I’ll do to you what you’ve done—you that have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.	Ezek 16:53-59

60“Nevertheless, I’ll remember my covenant with you when you were young, and I’ll establish an everlasting covenant with you. 61Then you’ll remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, Samaria and Sodom, your older and younger ones. I’ll give them to you as daughters even though they’re not part of our covenant. 62That’s how I’ll re-establish my covenant with you, and you’ll know I’m the LORD. 63In your humiliation, you won’t open your mouth when I forgive you for everything you’ve done,”

the Lord GOD says.	Ezek 16:60-63

Two Eagles and a Vine

17:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, tell Israel this parable. 3‘A large eagle with big wings, long pinions, and full plumage of many colors flew to Lebanon and plucked off 4the top of a cedar tree. He took it to a land filled with merchants and planted it in a city full of tradesmen. 5He also took a seedling from the land and planted it in fertile soil, like a willow beside a stream. 6It took root and became a low, spreading vine with branches turned upward toward the eagle and roots growing down into the soil. It put out shoots and grew branches. 	Ezek 17:1-6

7‘But then another large eagle came along with big wings and full plumage. Now the vine bent its roots and branches toward him so he would water it. 8It was already planted in good soil beside plenty of water so it could grow branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.’ 9Say, ‘The Lord GOD asks, “Will it thrive? I’ll pull it up by the roots, cut off its fruit, and let its leaves wither. I won’t need great strength or a big army to uproot it. 10If it’s transplanted, will it thrive? It will completely wither when the east wind blows on it in the soil where it had grown so well before.”’” 	   Ezek 17:7-10

11A message from the LORD came to me:

12“Say to this rebellious nation, ‘Do you know what that parable means? The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and officials to Babylon. 13He made a covenant with one royal family member and put him under oath. He took away the leaders in the land 14so the kingdom would stay subject to him and not try to mount an insurrection. That way it could continue. 15But the royal seed rebelled and sent ambassadors to Egypt to get horses and troops. Will that work? Will anybody avoid the consequences of doing something like that? Can he get away with breaking the covenant? 16As I live, he’ll die in Babylon—in the land of the king that put him on the throne, whose oath he disregarded, whose covenant he broke. 17Pharoah’s large, powerful army won’t help the royal seed in war, when the Babylonians build mounds and siege walls to take countless lives. 18The royal seed disregarded the oath by breaking the covenant; he pledged allegiance but rebelled. He won’t get away with it.’”

19So the Lord GOD says, “As I live, I’ll bring down on his head the consequences of the solemn oath he disregarded, and the covenant sworn in my name that he broke. 20I’ll cast my net over him, take him to Babylon, and condemn him there for his unfaithfulness to me. 21His elite troops will fall by the sword; survivors will scatter in every direction. You’ll know I the LORD have said it.” 	Ezek 17:11-21

22-23“I’ll pluck a young tender twig from the highest branches of a cedar tree and plant it on Israel’s high mountain. It will put out branches, produce seed, and become a stately cedar birds will nest in. 24All the trees will know I’m the LORD. I’ll cut down the tall tree, grow up the short one, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I’m the LORD; I’ll do what I say.” 	Ezek 17:22-24

The Soul That Sins Will Die

18:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“What do you mean by the proverb about Israel,

‘The parents ate sour grapes,

and the children’s mouths puckered’?

3As I live, you won’t be using that proverb in Israel anymore. 4Every soul belongs to me, the parent’s as well as the children’s. The soul that sins is the one that dies.

5“If a man practices goodness,

6doesn’t eat at the mountain shrines or

look up to the idols in Israel,

defile his neighbor’s wife or

approach a woman during her period;

7if he doesn’t oppress anybody, but

restores the debtor’s pledge;

if he doesn’t steal,

but feeds the hungry and clothes the naked,

8if he doesn’t lend money with interest,

if he keeps from sinning and

carries out true goodness between people,

9if he follows my statutes and ordinances to deal faithfully—

he’s good; he’ll live.” 	       Ezek 18:1-9

10“If he has a violent son that

sheds blood and

does any of those sins to a brother 11(though the father didn’t

do any of them himself)—

eats at the mountain shrines and

defiles his neighbor’s wife,

12oppresses the poor and needy,

steals,

doesn’t return a pledge, but

looks up to idols and

commits disgusting acts,

13lends money with interest—

will he live? No! He’s committed detestable acts;

put him to death. His blood will be on himself.	Ezek 18:10-13

14“If he has a son that’s seen his father’s sins and doesn’t do them—

15if he doesn’t eat at the mountain shrines or

look up to idols in Israel or

defile his neighbor’s wife,

16if he doesn’t oppress anybody or

keep a pledge or steal,

but gives bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked,

17refuses to hurt the poor,

doesn’t charge interest,

but carries out my ordinances and follows my statutes—

he won’t die for his father’s sins; he’ll live.                   	Ezek 18:14-17

18Because the father practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what wasn’t good, he’ll die for his own sins.

19“Yet you say, ‘Why shouldn’t a child take the punishment for a parent’s sins?’ When children practice goodness and observe my statutes, they’ll live. 20The one that sins is the one that dies. An offspring won’t take the punishment for a parent’s sins or vice versa. A person’s goodness or sinfulness applies to the one that does it. 		Ezek 18:18-20

21“If sinful people quit sinning, keep my statutes, and practice goodness, they’ll live. 22The sins they’ve committed I won’t hold against them. Because they’re practicing goodness now, they’ll live. 23Do I get any satisfaction out of seeing a sinner die,” the Lord GOD says, “instead of turning from sin and living?

24“But when good people turn away from their goodness, and do what sinful people do, will they live? I won’t consider their good deeds before; they’ll die for the treachery they’re committing now. 25Yet you say the LORD’s way’s not right. Listen, Israel! Aren’t your ways the ones that aren’t right? 26When good people turn away from their goodness, they’ll die in their sin. 27When sinful people quit sinning and practice what’s right, they’ll save their life. 28They’ll live because they thought it over and turned away from their sin. 29But Israel says, ‘The LORD’s way isn’t right.’ Aren’t my ways right, Israel? Aren’t your ways the ones that aren’t?  		Ezek 18:21-29

30“So I’ll judge you, Israel, each person by their own behavior. Repent and quit sinning so your sins won’t make you stumble. 31Get rid of them. Make a new heart and spirit for yourselves! Why die, Israel? 32I don’t get any satisfaction out of seeing somebody die. So repent and live.”	   Ezek 18:30-32

A Funeral Song for Israel’s Princes

19:1“Sing this funeral song for Israel’s officials:

2‘What was your mother?

A lioness among lions!

She lay down among young lions;

she raised her cubs.

3When she brought up one of her cubs,

he became a young lion,

learned to catch prey,

and devoured people.	Ezek 19:1-3

4Then nations heard about him.

They captured him in their pit

and took him with hooks to Egypt.

5‘As time went on, she saw

that her hopes for him were lost,

and took another of her cubs

and made him a young lion.

6He walked among the lions;

he became a young lion,

earned to catch prey,

and devoured people.	Ezek 19:4-6

7He destroyed their fortresses

and laid waste their towns;

everybody in the land

was terrified at his roaring.

8Then nations attacked him

on every side from their provinces.

They threw their net over him

and captured him in their pit.

9With hooks they put him in a cage

and took him to the king of Babylon.

They took him in hunting nets

so people couldn’t hear him anymore

on the mountains in Israel.			Ezek 19:7-9

10‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,

planted near water.

It was fruitful with lots of branches

because it had plenty of water.

11Its strong stems became rulers’ scepters.

It was taller than the clouds,

so it could be seen with its mass of branches.

12But it was plucked up in fury

and dashed to the ground.

The east wind dried up its fruit

and tore off and withered its strong branches.

Fire burned it up.					Ezek 19:10-12

13Now it stands in the wilderness,

in a dry, thirsty land.

14The fire that broke out in its branches

and burned up its fruit

didn’t leave any branch

strong enough to be a ruler’s scepter.’”

A Dirge						   Ezek 19:13-14

Israel’s Rebellion

20:1The tenth day, fifth month, seventh year, some of Israel’s elders came to inquire from the LORD and sat in front of me. 2A message from him came to me:

3“Son of man, tell Israel’s elders the Lord GOD says, ‘Are you coming to inquire from me? As I live, I won’t let you.’

4“Are you willing to judge them, son of man? Then remind them about their ancestors’ detestable deeds. 5Tell them that when I chose Israel, swore to Jacob’s descendants, and made myself known to them in Egypt, 6I swore I’d take them out of Egypt to a land I’d chosen, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all the lands. 7I told them to throw away the detestable things their eyes feasted on and not defile themselves with Egypt’s idols. I’m the LORD their God. 8But they wouldn’t discard them.     	Ezek 20:1-8a

“So I resolved to pour out my anger on them in Egypt. 9I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the nations that I revealed myself to by bringing Israel out of Egypt. 10So I took them into the desert, 11and gave them my statutes and ordinances that would give people life if they kept them. 12I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us so they’d know I’m the LORD who sanctifies them. 13But Israel rebelled. So I resolved to pour out my anger on them in the desert and wipe them out. [14] 15I swore to them there that I wouldn’t bring them to the land I’d given them. [16] 17Yet I didn’t wipe them out in the desert. 	Ezek 20:8b-17

18“I told their children in the desert, ‘Don’t follow the statutes of your fathers, keep their ordinances, or defile yourselves with their idols. 19I’m the LORD your God: follow my statutes and keep my ordinances, 20sanctify my Sabbaths as a sign between us so you can know that I’m the LORD their God.’ 21But the children wouldn’t do it. 22I withdrew my hand to keep my name from being profaned in the nations that saw me bring them out of Egypt. 23I swore to them in the desert that I’d scatter them among the nations 24for their rebellion. 25I let them keep statutes that weren’t good and ordinances that couldn’t give life. 26I pronounced them unclean for making their firstborn pass through fire so I could make them desolate.	Ezek 20:18-26

Judgment and Restoration

27“So, son of man, tell Israel the Lord GOD says, ‘Your ancestors blasphemed me by acting deceitfully against me. 28When I did bring them to the land I swore to give them, they looked at every tall hill and leafy tree, and offered their sacrifices there and presented their provoking offerings. They made their soothing aroma and poured out their liquid offerings. 29Then I said to them, “What’s the ‘high place’ that you go to?” Its name is still Bamah. 30So say to Israel the Lord GOD says, ‘Will you defile yourselves like your ancestors did and carry on prostitution with their detestable things? 31When you offer your gifts—making your sons pass through fire—you’re still defiling yourselves with your idols. Will you inquire from me, House of Israel? As I live, I won’t let you.

32“What you imagine won’t happen—as when you say you’ll be like the nations and tribes in the lands and serve wood and stone.’	  Ezek 20:27-32

33“As I live, I’ll rule you with a strong hand, outstretched arm, and anger poured out. 34From the lands where you’re scattered, 35I’ll take you to the wilderness of the nations and judge you directly 36like I judged your ancestors in the desert in Egypt. 37I’ll make you pass evaluation and bring you into the covenant. 38I’ll purge from you the rebels that sin against me. I’ll bring you out of the land where you’re living temporarily, but you won’t enter Israel. So you’ll know I’m the LORD.

39“Go on and serve your idols, Israel; later you’ll listen. You won’t profane my holy name anymore with your idols and offerings.   	    Ezek 20:33-39

40-41“On my holy hill, Israel’s high mountain, the whole House of Israel will serve me. Like a soothing aroma, I’ll accept you there and seek your contributions and choice gifts with your holy things. I’ll prove myself holy among you for the nations to see 42when I bring you to the land I swore to give your ancestors. 43You’ll think back there to the ways you defiled yourselves, and you’ll despise yourselves for the sins you’ve committed. 44You’ll know I’m the LORD when I’ve dealt with you to maintain my reputation more than to punish your sins.’”		  	Ezek 20:40-44

Judgment Against the Negev

45A message from the LORD came to me:

46“Son of man, face Teman. Prophesy against the south, against the forest in the Negev, 47‘Listen to what the Lord GOD says, “I’m about to light a fire in you that will burn up every tree in you, green or dry. It won’t go out till it has burned the whole surface from south to north. 48Everybody will see that I lit it.”’”

49Then I said, “Lord GOD, they’re saying I’m just telling stories.”

Ezek 20:45-49

Babylon, God’s Sword of Judgment

21:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, face Jerusalem. Speak against its sanctuaries and prophesy against Israel, 3‘The LORD says, “I’ll draw my sword and slay the good and the bad in you, 4everybody from south to north. 5Everyone will know I’ve drawn it, and it won’t go back into its sheath.”’

6“Son of man, moan with breaking heart and bitter grief. 7When they ask why you’re moaning, say, ‘Over the news that’s coming. Hearts will melt, hands will go limp, spirits will faint, knees will be as weak as water.” 	Ezek 21:1-7

8Again, a message from the LORD came to me:

9“Son of man, prophesy,

‘A sword, a sword,

sharpened and polished!

10sharpened for slaughter,

polished to flash like lightning!

Or should we be happy? Son, you’ve despised the rod and everything wood. 11A sword is sharpened and polished for the executioner. 12Cry out and wail, son of man. It’s against my people and their officials. They’ve been delivered to the sword, so strike your thigh. 13It won’t be for disciplining. What good would that do if you despise the rod? 	Ezek 21:8-13

14‘So prophesy, son of man. Clap your hands; bring the sword down twice, three times on the slain, for the great slaughter on everyone around. 15Their hearts will melt and many will fall at their gates. I’ve provided the glittering sword, made for striking like lightning, wrapped and ready for slaughter, 16to cut sharp wherever its aimed. 17I’ll clap my hands and vent my fury. I’ve said so.’”

Ezek 21:14-17

18A message from the LORD came to me:

19“Son of man, mark two roads for the king of Babylon to take that fork off from the same land. Put up a sign at the beginning of the road to each city. 20Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah in Ammon and Jerusalem in Judah. 21The king of Babylon is standing at the fork in the road ready to use fortunetelling, to shake arrows, to consult household idols, to inspect the liver. 22The lot for Jerusalem comes into his right hand, to set up battering rams against its gates, to lift up the battle cry for slaughter, to build mounds and a siege wall. 23It will seem to them like false fortunetelling; they’ve sworn solemn oaths. But he’s remembering their sin; so he’ll seize them.

24“So the Lord GOD says, ‘Because you’ve made your sin memorable and your transgressions evident in everything you do, they’ll take you. 25You slain, sinful, prince of Israel, whose time has come for final punishment, 26take off your turban, remove your crown. Things are going to be different. Raise up what’s low, abase what’s high. 27I’ll make it a ruin. There won’t be any trace of it till the one comes that I’ve given the right to have it.’ 	Ezek 21:18-27

28“So prophesy, son of man, ‘The Lord GOD says about the Ammonites and their disgrace: ‘a sword drawn, polished to slaughter like lightning—29while they see false visions for you, while they tell you lying fortunes—to place that sword on the necks of the sinful slain at their time of final punishment. 30Put it back in its sheath. I’ll condemn you where you originated. 31I’ll pour out my indignation on you, blow fire on you out of my anger, and turn you over to brutal men that know how to destroy. 32You’ll be fuel for the fire; your blood will be spilled in your own land. You’ll be forgotten. I’ve said so.’”	   Ezek 21:28-32

Israel’s Sins

22:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, are you willing to judge the bloody city? Then tell it about its abominations. 3Say, ‘The Lord GOD says,

“A city that sheds blood in it,

a city whose time will come,

a city that makes idols to defile itself!

4-5You’ve become guilty by shedding blood

and defiled by making idols.

You’ve brought your appointed time near,

you infamous one full of turmoil;

I’ve made you a disgrace to nations near and far,

something to ridicule. 			        	Ezek 22:1-5

6“Every ruler in Israel is intent on shedding blood, each according to his power. 7They treat parents with contempt, oppress foreigners, wrong the fatherless and widows. 8They despise my holy things and profane my Sabbaths. 9Slanderous men accuse falsely to get the death penalty, eat at the mountain shrine, commit lewd acts. 10They uncover their father’s nakedness and rape women that are in their period. 11One commit detestable acts with his neighbor’s wife, another defiles his daughter-in-law, another rapes his sister. 12You do murder for hire, charge interest, oppress other people for gain, and forget me.”

13“I slap my hand at your bloodshed and crooked gain. 14Will you have the courage and strength to deal with me when I do what I’ve said? 15I’ll scatter you across the nations and burn off your uncleanness. 16You’ll profane yourself in the sight of the nations. You’ll know I’m the LORD.”’”  	  Ezek 22:6-16

17A message from the LORD came to me:

18“Son of man, Israel is slag to me. Its people are bronze and tin, iron, lead, and silver from a furnace. 19So the Lord GOD says, ‘Because you’re slag, I’m going to gather you to Jerusalem. 20Like they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin and melt it down in a furnace, I’ll melt you down there 21with fire from my anger. [22]’” 			      Ezek 22:17-22

23A message from the LORD came to me:

24“Son of man, say, ‘You’re a polluted land that won’t get any rain to wash it off all during the time of my indignation.’ 25There‘s a conspiracy among your prophets. Like a roaring lion mauling its prey, you devour lives. You steal treasure and precious things and make many widows.

26Israel’s priests violate my Law and profane my holy things. They don’t distinguish holy from profane or teach the difference between clean and unclean. They don’t observe my Sabbaths, and they dishonor me among themselves. 27Israel’s leaders are like wolves tearing apart prey. They shed blood and destroy lives to get gain. 28Its prophets smear whitewash for them, see false visions, tell lying fortunes for them, and say, ‘The Lord GOD says,’ when I haven’t said. 29They oppress and rob the people, wrong the poor and needy, and mistreat temporary residents with injustice.

30“I looked for someone to build the wall around it and stand in the gap for Israel so I wouldn’t destroy it, but I didn’t find anybody.  31So I’ve poured out my indignation on them. I’ve burned them up with the fire from my anger and brought the consequences of their ways on their heads.” 	  Ezek 22:23-31

The Adultery of Oholah and Oholibah

23:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. 3They carried on prostitution in Egypt when they were young. Their breasts were pressed there and their virgin bosom was handled. 4Their names were Oholah the older and Oholibah her sister. They became mine and had children. Samaria is Oholah; Jerusalem is Oholibah.

5“Oholah played the prostitute while she belonged to me, and doted on her lovers, the Assyrians, her neighbors, 6who dressed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on their horses. 7She bestowed her prostitution on them, choice men of Assyria. She defiled herself with their idols. 8She didn’t abandon her prostitution from the time she was in Egypt. When she was young, men had lain with her, and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. 9So I gave her to her lovers, the Assyrians. 10They uncovered her nakedness; they took her children but killed her with a sword. So she became a byword among women, and they carried out judgments on her.

Ezek 23:1-10

11“Her sister Oholibah saw that and became even more corrupt in doting on her lovers. Her prostitution was worse than her sister’s. 12She doted on the Assyrians, nearby governors and officials, magnificently attired, horsemen riding horses, all desirable young men. 13I saw that she’d defiled herself; they both had followed the same path. 14So she increased her prostitution. She saw men painted on the wall, images of Babylonians painted with vermilion, 15wearing waistbands, with flowing turbans on their heads, all looking like officers, like Babylonians in Babylonia, the land where they were born. 16When she saw them, she doted on them and sent messengers to them in Babylonia. 17The Babylonians came to her bed of lust and defiled her with their prostitution. When they’d defiled her, she became disgusted with them. 18She uncovered her prostitution and her nakedness.

Then I became disgusted with her like I had with her sister. 19She still increased her prostitution and remembered her youth when she carried on prostitution in Egypt. 20She doted on her paramours, whose members are like donkeys’ and whose issue is like horses’. 21So she longed for the lewdness of her youth when the Egyptians handled her young breasts. 	  Ezek 23:11-21

God’s Judgment on Oholibah

22“So, Oholibah, the Lord GOD says, ‘I’ll arouse your lovers against you—the ones you’re alienated from—and bring them against you from every direction: 23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and the Assyrians, desirable young men, governors and officials all, officers and soldiers every one, riding horses. 24They’ll attack you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and an army of soldiers arrayed against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet. I’ll let them judge you by their customs, 25and I’ll direct my jealousy against you in anger. They’ll cut off your nose and ears, and any survivors will fall by the sword. They’ll capture your children and burn your survivors. 26They’ll strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. 27That’s how I’ll stop your lewdness and prostitution with Egypt so you won’t look up to it or remember it anymore. 28I’ll turn you over to the ones you despise, people you’re alienated from. 29They’ll deal with you in hate, take your property, and leave you naked. 30Your lewdness and prostitution will be exposed. 31You’ve followed your sister’s ways; so I’ll give you her cup to drink.’   	    Ezek 23:22-31

32“The Lord GOD says,

‘You’ll drink your sister’s cup,

which is deep and wide.

You’ll be laughed at and ridiculed

because it holds a lot.

33You’ll be filled with drunkenness and distress:

the cup of horror and desolation,

the cup of your sister Samaria.

34You’ll drink it and drain it.

Then you’ll dash it to pieces

and beat your breasts.

I’ve said so.

35Because you’ve thrown me away and forgotten me, take the punishment for your lewdness and prostitution.’”	 Ezek 23:32-35

God’s Judgment on Both Sisters

36The LORD said:

“Son of man, will you willing to judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then remind them of their detestable acts. 37Say,

‘You’ve committed adultery and murder—

adultery by worshiping your idols,

murder by burning your children as food for them—

children you bore to me.

38You’ve defiled my sanctuary

and profaned my Sabbaths.

39The very day you killed your children for your idols,

you went into my sanctuary to worship—my Temple!

40“You sisters” even sent messengers

to bring men from a long way off.

You took baths,

put on eyeshadow and fine jewelry,

41and sat down on a splendid couch

by a table where you’d put my oil and incense.

42The sound of debauchery surrounded you,

and common drunks were brought in from the wilderness.

They put bracelets on your wrists

and beautiful crowns on your heads.       	Ezek 23:36-42

43Then I said about you women

that were worn out from committing adulteries,

“Will these guys commit adultery

with women in that condition?!”

44But they slept with you like prostitutes,

Oholah and Oholibah, lewd women.

45But good men will condemn you

for your adultery and murder.’

46“The Lord GOD says,

‘Bring an army against them;

turn them over to terror and plunder:

47stone them,

cut them down with swords,

kill their children,

burn their houses.

48That’s how I’ll stop lewdness in the land.

Warn every woman not to do like “the sisters” have done,

49“Your lewdness will come back on you

as the penalty for worshiping idols.

That way you’ll know I’m the Lord GOD.’”		Ezek 23:43-49

The Cooking Pot

24:1The tenth day, tenth month, ninth year, a message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, write down the date. Today the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem. 3Tell the rebellious people a parable, ‘The Lord GOD says,

“Put a pot on and pour water in it;

4put good pieces of meat in it,

thigh and shoulder;

fill it with choice bones.

5Take the best of the flock

and put wood under the pot.

Boil it hard;

seethe the bones with the meat.”	Ezek 24:1-5

6‘The Lord GOD says,

“Misfortune awaits the bloody city;

it awaits the rusty pot!

Take out piece after piece

without choosing which ones.

7The blood she shed is in her;

she put it on a bare rock;

she didn’t pour it on the ground

and cover it with dirt.

8To cause anger to rise up

and take revenge,

I’ve put her blood on a bare rock

so it won’t be covered.”		Ezek 24:6-8

9‘So the Lord GOD says,

“Misfortune awaits the bloody city!

I’ll make it a big pile.

10Pile on the wood, kindle the fire,

boil the meat well,

mix in the spices,

burn the bones.

11Then set it empty on the coals

to get it hot

so its bronze will glow,

its dross will dissolve,

and its rust will burn off.

12I’ve worked hard for nothing,

because its extreme rust isn’t gone;

let it rust in the fire!			Ezek 24:9-12

13In your filthiness is lewdness;

I wanted to clean you up,

but you didn’t want to be clean.

You won’t be clean from your filthiness

till I’ve spent my anger on you.

14I, the LORD, have said it; it’s coming, I’ll do it. I won’t hold back. I won’t pity or be sorry. I’ll judge you according to your ways and deeds.”’”	 Ezek 24:13-14

Ezekiel’s Wife Dies

15A message from the LORD came to me:

16“Son of man, I’m about to take away the delight of your eyes in one stroke, but don’t mourn or cry or shed tears. 17Groan silently; don’t perform ritual mourning for the dead. Wrap your turban on, put your shoes on, don’t cover your mouth in sorrow, or eat the bread of mourning.” 	Ezek 24:15-17

18I told the people about it in the morning; that evening my wife died. The next morning, I did what God told me.

19The people said, “Won’t you tell us what you’re doing means for us?”

20I told them,

“A message from the LORD came to me, 21‘Tell Israel, “I’m about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes and soul. The children you’ve left behind will fall by the sword. 22Do what I’ve done. Don’t cover your mouth in sorrow or eat the bread of mourning. 23Put your turbans on your heads and your shoes on your feet. Don’t mourn or weep, but pine away in your sins and groan to one another. 24Follow Ezekiel’s example. When it comes, you’ll know I’m the Lord GOD.”’ 	Ezek 24:18-24

25“Son of man, won’t that be when I take their fortresses away from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, their children—26when somebody escapes and comes to you with the news? 27Then you can speak to the one that escaped. You’ll be a sign to them. They’ll know I’m the LORD.”

Ezek 24:25-27

A Message for Ammon

25:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Face the Ammonites and prophesy against them, 3‘Because you said, “Ha!” at my sanctuary when it was profaned, and at Israel when it became a wasteland, and at Judah when they went into exile, 4I’m going to turn you over to the people from the east. They’ll set up their camps among you and live there, eat your fruit and drink your milk. 5I’ll turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and the Ammonites a resting place for flocks. 6Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and celebrated with scorn at Israel, 7I’ll give you to the nations for spoil, cut you off from the peoples, and make you perish from the land so you’ll know I’m the LORD.’	Ezek 25:1-7

A Message for Moab

8“The Lord GOD says, ‘Because Moab and Seir consider Judah like any other nation, 9I’m going to take away Moab its frontier towns, the pride of its land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 10I’ll give it and the Ammonites to the people from the east and the Ammonites will pass from memory. 11I’ll carry out judgments on Moab. They’ll know I’m the LORD.’”

12“The Lord GOD says, ‘Edom has taken revenge on Judah and incurred grievous guilt, 13so I’ll slay its people and animals and lay it waste. They’ll fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan. 14I’ll take revenge on Edom by my people Israel. They’ll act in Edom according to my anger; so they’ll know my payback.’

A Message for Philistia

15“The Lord GOD says, ‘The Philistines have acted in scornful revenge to destroy with everlasting enmity. 16So I’ll slay the Cherethites and destroy the remnant along the coast. 17I’ll carry out severe vengeance with angry rebukes. They’ll know I’m the LORD.’” 	Ezek 25:8-17

A Message for Tyre

26:1The first day of the month, eleventh year, a message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, Tyre has said about Jerusalem, ‘Ha! its gate’s broken; it has swung open to me. I’ll be filled now that it’s laid waste.’ 3But the Lord GOD says, ‘I’ll bring nations against you, Tyre, like waves in the sea. 4They’ll destroy your walls and tear down your towers. I’ll scrape away the rubble and make you a bare rock, 5a place for spreading nets by the sea. I’ve spoken: you’ll become spoil for the nations, 6and your inhabitants on the mainland will die by the sword. You’ll know I’m the LORD.’”	Ezek 26:1-6

7“From the north I’ll bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and an enormous army. 8He’ll slay your inhabitants on the mainland with the sword, build siege walls, put up a mound and a roof of shields against you. 9He’ll aim his battering rams at your walls and tear down your towers with his axes. 10The huge number of his horses will cover you with dust; your walls will shake from his cavalry, wagons, and chariots when they pour through your gates like men overwhelming a breached city. 11He’ll trample your streets with his horses and slay your people with the sword. He’ll tear down your strong pillars, 12make spoil out of your wealth, and plunder your merchandise. He’ll tear down your walls, destroy your beautiful houses, and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea. 13So I’ll silence your songs and harps. 14You’ll be a bare rock, a place to spread nets. You won’t rebuild; I’ve said so.” 			Ezek 26:7-14

15“The Lord GOD says to Tyre, ‘Won’t the whole coastland quake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter is taking place in you? 16Then the rulers of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, strip off their embroidered clothes, and dress themselves with cringing. They’ll sit on the ground, shaking every moment, appalled at you. 17They’ll chant a dirge for you,

“How you’ve disappeared from the seas, renowned city!

You and your residents were powerful seafarers

that imposed fear on people everywhere!

18The islands trembled the day you fell.

Yes, the islands in the sea

were distressed at your passing.”’” 	Ezek 26:15-18

19The Lord says GOD, “When I make you a desolate city, like towns with no residents, when I wash the deep up over you and big rivers flood you, 20then I’ll take you down to the Pit to the people of old and make you live in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places. So people won’t live in you, but I’ll set glory among the living. 21I’ll bring terror on you, and you won’t exist anymore. Though people look for you, they’ll never find you.” 	Ezek 26:19-21

A Lament for Tyre

27:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre 3that sits at the port to the sea, the nations’ merchant to many ports, The Lord GOD says,

‘Tyre, you’ve said “I’m perfectly beautiful.”

4Your borders extend into the heart of the sea;

your builders have perfected your beauty.

5They’ve made your planks out of fir trees from Seir;

they’ve taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.

6They shaped your oars out of oaks from Bashan;

with ivory they’ve inlaid your deck with boxwood from Cyprus.

7Your sail was made out of fine embroidered linen from Egypt;

it became your identifying mark.

Your awning was blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.

8The residents of Sidon and Arvad rowed for you;

your wise men, Tyre, were on board as your navigators.

9The elders of Gebal and its skilled men caulked your seams.

All the ships in the sea and their sailors were with you,

dealing in your merchandise.’ 	Ezek 27:1-9

10“Persia, Lud, and Put were soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls and set forth your splendor. 11Men from Arvad and your army stood all around on your walls, and brave soldiers were in your towers. Their shields hung on your walls and completed your beauty.	Ezek 27:10-11

12“Tarshish was your customer because you had such a store of all kinds of wealth; they bought your merchandise with silver, iron, tin, and lead. 13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they bought your merchandise with men’s lives and bronze containers. 14Beth-togarmah gave horses, war horses, and mules for your wares. 15Dedan traded with you. Distant lands served as your markets; they paid with ivory tusks and ebony. 16Syria was your customer because you had an abundance of goods; they bought your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 17Judah and Israel traded with you; they bought your merchandise with wheat from Minnith, cakes, honey, olive oil, and salve. 18Damascus was your customer because you had an abundance of goods, an abundance of all kinds of wealth, and because of the wine from Helbon and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan paid for your casks of wine from Izal with wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane. 20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 21Arabia and the princes of Kedar traded with you; 22they paid with gold, precious stones, and the finest spices. 23Haran, Canneh, Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you 24for choice garments, clothes made out of blue and embroidered work, carpets of many colors and in tightly wound cords. 				Ezek 27:12-24

25The ships of Tarshish carried your wares.

You were full and quite magnificent

in the heart of the seas.

26“Your rowers have taken you

onto stormy high seas;

the east wind has capsized you

in the middle of the sea.

27Your wealth, your wares and your merchandise,

your sailors and captains,

ship builders and merchants,

all the soldiers and everyone on board—

sinks into the sea.

28At the outcry of your terrified captains,

the countryside shakes.	Ezek 27:25-28

29The ones that row, the captains of the sea,

abandon ship and stand on shore.

30They wail over you

and cry bitterly.

They throw dust on their heads

and wallow in ashes.

31They shave their heads for you

and put on burlap.

They weep bitterly for you.					Ezek 27:29-31

32As they wail, they take up

a funeral song for you:

‘Who is like Tyre

that’s silent at the bottom of the sea?

33When your wares came from the sea,

you satisfied many nations.

With your great wealth and merchandise,

you enriched kings everywhere.			Ezek 27:32-33

34Now the sea has wrecked you

in open water;

your merchandise and crew

have sunk with you.

35The people that live along the coasts

are appalled at what’s happened to you.

Their kings are horribly afraid;

their countenance has fallen.

36The merchants among the nations gasp at you;

you’ve come to a horrible end

and won’t exist anymore.’”			Ezek 27:34-36

A Message for Tyre’s King

28:1A message from the LORD came to me again:

2“Son of man, tell the leader of Tyre, ‘The Lord GOD says,

“You’re arrogant; you’ve said,

‘I’m a god; I sit in God’s seat

in the heart of the sea.’

But you’re a mortal, not God,

though you vaunt yourself up as if you were God.

(3You think you’re wiser than Daniel,

that no secret is a match for you.

4By your wisdom and intelligence,

you’ve become rich

and gained gold and silver for your treasuries.		Ezek 28:1-4

5By your great wisdom and trade,

you’ve increased your wealth,

and you’re arrogant because of it.)”

6‘So the Lord GOD says,

“Because you’ve exalted yourself as if you were God,

7I’ll bring foreigners on you,

the most ruthless of nations.

They’ll draw their swords

against the beauty of your wisdom

and defile your splendor.

8They’ll bring you down to the Pit,

and you’ll die like those killed

in the middle of the sea.				Ezek 28:5-8

9Will you still say, ‘I’m a god,’

in the presence of your slayer?

Though you’re a mortal, not God,

will you still say, ‘I’m a god,’

in the hands of the ones who mortally wound you?

10You’ll die the death of the uncircumcised

by the hand of foreigners.

I’ve said so!”’” 		Ezek 28:9-10

11A message from the LORD came to me:

12“Son of man, chant a dirge for the king of Tyre.

Tell him, ‘The Lord GOD says,

“You had the seal of perfection,

wise and perfectly beautiful.

13You were in Eden, God’s orchard.

You wore every precious stone:

rubies, topaz, diamonds,

beryl, onyx, and jasper

lapis lazuli, turquoise, emeralds.

There was gold workmanship

for your settings and engravings.

They were prepared the day you were created.

14I placed an anointed cherub to guard you;

you were on God’s holy mountain

and walked among the burning stones.			Ezek 28:11-14

15You were blameless in your ways

from the time you were created

till sin became obvious in you.

16By the abundance of your trade,

you became violent and sinned.

So I’ve thrown you as profane

from God’s mountain.

I’ve destroyed you, guardian cherub,

from among the burning stones.

17You became proud of your beauty

and corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor.

I threw you on the ground;

I put you in front of kings

so they could see you.					Ezek 28:15-17

18By the great number of your sins

committed in your trading,

you profaned your sanctuaries.

So I’ve brought fire out of you,

and it burned you up.

I’ve turned you to ashes in the world

in front of everybody that sees you.

19Everybody that knows you

is appalled at what’s happened to you.

You’ve panicked

and won’t exist anymore.”’”				Ezek 28:18-19

A Message for Sidon

20A message from the LORD came to me:

21“Son of man, face Sidon and prophesy against it.

22‘The Lord GOD says,

“I’m against you, Sidon,

and I’ll be honored by what I do to you.

They’ll know I’m the LORD,

when I carry out judgments on you;

I’ll demonstrate my holiness by what I do to you.

23I’ve sent disease to you

and blood in your streets.

The wounded will fall in you

by the sword everywhere.

You’ll know I’m the LORD.				Ezek 28:20-23

24“For Israel there won’t any longer be a briar to prick or a thorn to hurt them from any that scorn them. They’ll know I’m the Lord GOD.”

25‘The Lord GOD says, “When I gather Israel back from the nations where they’re scattered and demonstrate my holiness in them in front of the nations, then they’ll live in the land I’ve given Jacob. 26They’ll live in it securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. I’ll carry out judgment on everybody that scorns them. They’ll know I’m the LORD their God.”’”	  Ezek 28:24-26

A Message for Egypt

29:1The twelfth day, tenth month, tenth year, a message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, turn toward Pharaoh, Egypt’s king, and prophesy against him and Egypt. 3Say,’The Lord GOD says,

“I’m against you, Pharaoh, Egypt’s king,

you big crocodile that lies in your streams,

that has said, ‘My Nile belongs to me; I made it.’

4I’ll put hooks in your jaws

and make the fish in your streams cling to your scales.

I’ll drag you out on the shore

with fish clinging to your scales.	Ezek 29:1-4

5I’ll abandon you to the wilderness,

you and the fish in your streams.

You’ll fall in the open field

and not be buried.

I’ll make you food for scavengers on the ground

and buzzards from the sky.

6Then you residents in Egypt will know I’m the LORD,

because to Israel you were only a staff made out of reeds.

7When he took hold of you,

you cut his hands;

when he leaned on you,

you broke and his loins buckled.				Ezek 29:5-7

8‘So the Lord GOD says, “I’m going to bring a sword against you, and slay people and animals. 9Because you said, ‘The Nile belongs to me, I made it,’ 10I’m against you and your streams. Egypt will become a wasteland from Migdol to Syene to the border of Nubia. 11People and animals won’t travel through it; nobody will live there for 40 years. 12So I’ll make Egypt desolate among desolate lands and its cities desolate among desolate cities for 40 years. I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations.

13‘The Lord GOD says, “After 40 years, I’ll gather the Egyptians back from where they’ve scattered. 14I’ll return their fortunes and make them go back to the land of Pathros and become a minor kingdom there. 15Egypt will be low among the kingdoms and never again raise itself above them. I’ll make it too small for that. 16Israel will never rely on it again. They’ll be reminded of their sin in going back to Egypt. They’ll know I’m the Lord GOD.”’ 	  Ezek 29:8-16

17The first day, first month, twenty-seventh year, a message from the LORD came to me:

18“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army struggle hard against Tyre. Every head became bald, and every shoulder was rubbed raw. But he and his army didn’t get enough from Tyre to pay for the struggle. 19So I’ll give him Egypt so he can carry off its wealth, capture its spoil, and seize its plunder to pay his army. 20I’ve given him Egypt for his struggle because he acted on my behalf. 21At that time, I’ll make a horn sprout for Israel and open your mouth among them. They’ll know I’m the LORD.”	Ezek 29:17-21

A Lament for Egypt

30:1A message from the LORD came to me again:

2“Son of man, prophesy, ‘The Lord GOD says,

“Wail, ‘Oh for the day!’

3The day of the LORD is near,

a cloudy day of doom for the nations.

4A sword will come at Egypt;

there’ll be anguish in Nubia

when the slain fall in Egypt.

They’ll carry away its wealth

and tear up its foundations.

5Nubia, Put, Lud, Arabia, Libya, and the people of any land allied with them will fall by the sword with them.	Ezek 30:1-5

6’The LORD says:

“Those who support Egypt will fall;

its proud power will collapse.

From Migdol to Syene

they’ll fall by the sword.

7They’ll be desolate among desolate lands;

its cities will lie desolate among devastated cities.

8They’ll know I’m the LORD

when I set Egypt on fire

and break down its helpers.

9At that time, I’ll send ambassadors in ships

to terrify secure Nubia;

anguish will come down on them as at Egypt’s doom.

It’s coming!”

10‘The Lord GOD says,

“By Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,

I’ll put an end to Egypt’s wealth.				Ezek 30:6-10

11Him and his people, the most ruthless of the nations,

I’ll bring in to destroy the land.

They’ll draw their swords against it

and fill the country with the slain.

12I’ll dry up the Nile’s canals

and sell the land to evil men.

I’ll use foreigners to make the land desolate

and everything that’s in it,

I the LORD have said it.					Ezek 30:11-12

13‘The Lord GOD says,

“I’ll destroy the idols

and make images cease in Memphis.

There won’t be a prince in Egypt anymore;

I’ll put fear in Egypt.

14I’ll make Pathros desolate,

set fire to Zoan,

and carry out judgment on Thebes.

15I’ll pour out my anger on Sin, Egypt’s fortress;

I’ll slay the population in Thebes,

16I’ll set Egypt on fire.

Sin will writhe in anguish;

Thebes will be breached;

Memphis will endure daily distress.				Ezek 30:13-16

17The young men of On and Pi-beseth

will fall by the sword;

the women will go into captivity.

18It will be a dark day in Tehaphnehes

when I break the yoke bars of Egypt there.

The pride in its power will be gone;

a cloud will cover it,

and Egypt’s inhabitants will go into captivity.

19So I’ll carry out judgments on Egypt,

and they’ll know I’m the LORD.”’”				Ezek 30:17-19

20The seventh day, first month, eleventh year, a message from the LORD came to me:

21“Son of man, I’ve broken the arm of Pharaoh, Egypt’s king. It hasn’t been put in a sling to mend or wrapped with a bandage to get strong enough to hold a sword.’ 22So the Lord GOD says, ‘I’ll break both of his arms, the good arm and the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand. 23I’ll scatter the Egyptians among the nations. 24I’ll strengthen the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. Pharaoh will groan from his wounds. 25I’ll strengthen the king of Babylon’s arms, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall. When the king of Babylon holds out his sword against Egypt 26and I scatter the Egyptians among the nations, they’ll know I’m the LORD.”’”       	Ezek 30:20-26

A Cedar in Lebanon

31:1The first day, third month, eleventh year, a message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, tell Pharaoh and his large host,

‘Who is as great as you?

3Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon

with beautiful branches and forest shade

and its top in the clouds.

4The water made it grow, the underground water made it tall;

rivers continually flowed where it was planted;

it sent out its channels to all the trees.

5So it was taller than any other tree.

It grew lots of long branches

because it had plenty of water;

it spread them out.	Ezek 31:1-5

6Birds nested in it;

animals from the countryside gave birth under it;

all the nations lived in its shade.

7So it was beautiful in its size and the length of its branches

because its roots went down to abundant water.

8The cedars in God’s forest couldn’t match it;

the cypress couldn’t compare with its branches;

the trees in the plane couldn’t equal its limbs.

No tree in God’s forest could compare with its beauty.

9I made it beautiful with its many big branches;

all the trees in Eden, which were in God’s orchard,

were jealous of it.					Ezek 31:6-9

10‘So the Lord GOD says, “Because it was tall with its top in the clouds and was proud of its height, 11I’ll give it to a despot to deal with according to the sinfulness it deserves. 12Foreign tyrants will cut it down and leave its limbs on the mountains and in the valleys. They’ll lie piled up in the ravines. Everybody on earth will leave its shade. 13Birds will live on its remains, and animals will be on its fallen branches. 14None of the trees beside water will grow tall and set their tops in the clouds or their terebinth trees stand tall in their height. They’ll die, given over to the underworld among mortals.”	Ezek 31:10-14

15‘The Lord GOD says, “When it goes down to Sheol, I’ll chant dirges, close the deep over it, and hold back its many streams. I’ll cover Lebanon with gloom for it, and the trees will wither away because of it. 16The nations will shake from the sound of its fall when I send it down to the Pit. The well-watered trees of Eden, Lebanon’s best, will find comfort in the nether world. 17They’ll go down with it to those slain by the sword, who were its strength and lived under its shade among the nations. 18Which of Eden’s trees equals you in size and beauty? Yet you’ll go down with Eden’s trees to the underworld and lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword. That’s the way it will be with Pharaoh and his large army!”’ 			Ezek 31:15-18

A Lament for Pharaoh

32:1The first day, twelfth month, twelfth year, a message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, chant a dirge for Pharaoh, Egypt’s king. Tell him,

‘You consider yourself a young lion among the nations,

but you’re like a sea monster in the ocean.

You splash around in your rivers,

stir up the water with your feet,

and muddy the rivers.’”

3The Lord GOD says,

“I’ll cast my net over you

along with a host of nations

and haul you up from the water.

4I’ll dash you to the ground,

toss you out in an open field,

let the birds light on you,

and have the animals gorge on you.	Ezek 32:1-4

5I’ll scatter your bodies on the mountains

and fill the valleys with your carcasses.

6The land will soak up your blood

all the way to the mountains;

I’ll fill the ravines with you.

7When I blot you out,

I’ll veil the sky, darken the stars,

and cover the sun with a cloud;

the moon won’t shine.

8I’ll darken the lights in the sky above you

and cover your land in darkness.			Ezek 32:5-8

9I’ll trouble many nations when I take you captive among them to lands you haven’t known. 10They’ll be appalled at what’s happened to you. Because of you, their kings will be horribly afraid when I brandish my sword at them. When you fall, they’ll shudder every minute for their own life.” 		  Ezek 32:9-10

11The Lord GOD says,

“The sword of Babylon’s king will come on you. 12I’ll make your large army fall by the swords of powerful men, all of them tyrants over nations.

They’ll crush Egypt’s pride

and destroy its army.

13I’ll destroy its livestock from beside the waterways;

nobody’s foot or animal’s hoof

will muddy them anymore.

14I’ll make their waterways soak up the water

and make their streams flow like olive oil.”

15When I make Egypt desolate

and the land lacking in what filled it,

when I strike everybody that lives there,

they’ll know I’m the LORD.

16That’s the dirge the nations will chant over Egypt and its army.” 	Ezek 32:11-16

17The fifteenth day, first month, twelfth year, a message from the LORD came to me:

18“Son of man, wail for Egypt’s army. Along with the powerful nations, take it down to the nether world with those who go down to the Pit.

19‘Who are you more beautiful than?

Go make your bed with the uncircumcised.’

20They’ll fall among those slain by the sword. Egypt will be delivered to the sword; they’ll take it and its army away. 21Out of Sheol the strong among the powerful will talk about Egypt and its allies. ‘The uncircumcised have gone down, they lie still, slain by the sword.’ 	Ezek 32:17-21

22“Assyria is there with all its company, all slain by the sword. 23They who had spread terror among the living lie in the most remote parts of the Pit,

24“Elam is there with its army around its grave, all of them fallen by the sword. They who had spread terror among the living bore their disgrace with the ones they sent down to the Pit. 25They’ve made a bed for Elam among the slain—all uncircumcised.

26“Meshech, Tubal, and their armies are there, their graves around them, all slain by the sword, uncircumcised, though they’d spread terror among the living. 27They don’t lie beside the fallen heroes of old, the uncircumcised who went down to Sheol with their weapons, whose swords were laid under their heads, whose shields rested on their skeletons. Though the living once feared them, 28they’ll be broken among the uncircumcised and lie with the ones they’d slain.		    			Ezek 32:22-28

29“Edom is there, its kings and princes, who, despite their power, lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword with those who go down to the Pit.

30“All the chiefs from the north are there too, and all the Sidonians, who, for the terror resulting from their power, went down in disgrace with the ones they’d slain. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the Pit.”

31The Lord GOD says, “Pharaoh will see them and be comforted for his army slain. 32Though I had spread the fear of him among the living, he and his army will lie among the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.”   	Ezek 32:29-32

Ezekiel Is Israel’s Watchman

33:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Tell your people, ‘If I bring the sword on a country, and the people’s watchman 3blows the ram’s horn to warn them—4then those who don’t pay attention are responsible for their own death. 5If they’d taken warning, they would’ve saved their life. 6If the watchman sees the sword coming and doesn’t warn the people, if the sword takes some people, they’ll be taken away in their sin, but I’ll hold the watchman responsible for it.’

7“Son of man, I’ve made you a watchman for Israel so you’ll hear a message from me to warn them. 8When I tell sinful people they’re going to die, but you don’t warn them, they’ll die in their sin, but I’ll hold you responsible for it.  9But if you warn them and they don’t turn from your way, they’ll die in their sin, but you’ve saved your life.	  Ezek 33:1-9

10“Now, son of man, tell Israel, ‘You’ve said, “Our sins are on us and we’re rotting away in them. How can we survive?”’ 11Tell them, ‘As I live,’ the Lord GOD says, ‘I don’t get any satisfaction out of seeing sinful people die. I want them to turn from their way and live. Turn back from your sinful way! Why die, Israel?’ 12Son of man, tell your fellow citizens, ‘People’s goodness won’t deliver them when they sin. People’s sinfulness won’t prevent them from living when they quit doing it. Good people can’t have life from goodness when they practice sin. 13When I say to good people they’ll surely live and they presume on their goodness and keep sinning, I won’t consider their good deeds; they’ll die in that sin. 14But when I say to sinful people, ‘You’ll surely die,’ and they quit sinning—15if they return a pledge, repay what they stole, follow the statutes that give life and don’t sin—they’ll surely live. 16I won’t hold their past sins against them. They’re doing good; they’ll live.	 Ezek 33:10-16

17“Yet your people say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right,’ when it’s their own way that’s not right. 18When good people turn from their goodness, they’ll die because now they’re practicing sin. 19When sinful people turn from their sinfulness, they’ll live because they’re practicing goodness. 20Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s way is not right.’ House of Israel, I’ll judge each of you by your own ways.” 				Ezek 33:17-20

Israel’s Fall Explained

21The fifth day, tenth month, twelfth year of our exile, refugees from Jerusalem arrived to tell me the city had fallen.  22The LORD’s hand had been heavy on me the evening before. When they came the next morning, he made me able to talk again.

23A message from him came to me:

24“Son of man, those who live in Israel’s waste places are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land. So to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.’ 25Tell them the Lord GOD says, ‘You eat meat with blood in it and look up to your idols as you shed innocent blood. Should you have the land? 26You rely on your sword, you commit disgusting deeds, you defile your neighbor’s wife. Should you have the land? 27As I live, those who live in the waste places will fall by the sword. Whoever is in the open country wild animals will kill. The ones in strongholds and caves will die from disease. 28I’ll make the land desolate; pride about its power will stop. Israel’s mountains will be so desolate nobody can get through them. 29They’ll know I’m the LORD when I make the land desolate because of their disgusting deeds.’  	Ezek 33:21-29

30“Son of man, your fellow citizens talk about you by the walls and in their doorways, ‘Come on, let’s hear a message from the LORD.’ 31They come and sit with you like my people, but they do the lustful things they talk about and set their hearts on making money. 32As far as they’re concerned, you’re someone with a beautiful voice that plays an instrument well and sings love songs. They hear what you’re saying, but they don’t do it. 33So when what you say does happen—as it surely will—they’ll know a prophet was among them.”  	  Ezek 33:30-33

Prophecy Against Israel’s Shepherds

34:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, prophesy against Israel’s shepherds. ‘The Lord GOD says, “Misfortune awaits you, shepherds that feed yourselves! Shouldn’t shepherds feed the flock? 3You eat the healthy and dress with their wool. You slaughter the healthy sheep without feeding the flock. 4You don’t strengthen the sickly, heal the diseased, bandage up the crippled, bring back the scattered, or look for the lost. With force and severity, you bully them. 5They’re scattered all over the world because they didn’t have a shepherd; they became prey for wild animals. 6My flock wandered around in the mountains and tall hills; nobody looked for them.

Ezek 34:1-6

7‘So, shepherds, listen to the LORD: [8-9] 10“Give me my sheep. You’re fired. I’ll protect my flock so you can’t eat them anymore.”’”

11The Lord GOD says, “I’ll look for my sheep myself. 12Like a shepherd does when he’s among them, I’ll bring them back from where they scattered on a cloudy, gloomy day. 13-14I’ll gather them from other countries, feed them on good pasture, and graze them on Israel’s high mountains, by its streams, in populated places. 15I’ll lead my flock to rest, 16bandage up the crippled, doctor the sick, watch over the healthy and strong. I’ll feed them with justice.” 	  Ezek 34:7-16

17The Lord GOD says, “My flock, I’ll decide between one sheep and another, between rams and billy goats. 18Do you care so little about feeding on good pasture that you tramp it down? Do you care so little about drinking clean water that you muddy it up with your hooves? 19My flock has to eat what you tramp down and drink what you muddy up!”

20So the Lord GOD says, “I’ll decide between healthy sheep and sickly ones. 21You butt and shove with your shoulder and gouge the weak with your horns till you drive them off. 22I’ll protect my flock so they won’t be prey anymore, and judge one sheep from another. 23I’ll set one shepherd over them, my servant David; he’ll feed them. 24I’ll be their God; he’ll be their prince. I’ve said so.  				Ezek 34:17-24

25“I’ll make a peace treaty with them and get rid of dangerous animals so they can be safe in the countryside and sleep in the woods. 26I’ll make them and the places around my mountain a blessing. It will rain when it’s supposed to—showers of blessing. 27The trees in the orchard will bear their fruit; the ground will grow its crops. They’ll know I’m the LORD when I’ve broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from those who enslave them. 28They won’t be prey for other nations anymore, and the animals in the world won’t devour them. Nobody will make them afraid. 29Their land will be famous for growing crops, and they won’t be victims of famine or have to put up with insults from other nations. 30They’ll know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and they’re Israel, my people. 31My ‘sheep’ in my pasture, you’re my people and I’m your God,”

the Lord GOD says.	 Ezek 34:25-31

Prophecy Against Mount Seir

35:1A message from the Lord came to me:

2“Son of man, face Mount Seir and prophesy against it, 3‘The Lord GOD says,

“I’m against you, Mount Seir;

I’ll make you a wasteland.

4I’ll lay your towns waste,

and you’ll be desolate.

You’ll know I’m the LORD.

5In your endless enmity, you delivered Israel to the sword at the time of its catastrophe, its final punishment. 6So as I live, I’ll deliver you to bloodshed. Since you haven’t despised bloodshed, it’ll pursue you. 7I’ll make Mount Seir a waste and slay everyone that tries to escape or return there. 8I’ll fill its mountains with the dead. They’ll fall in its hills, valleys, and ravines. 9I’ll make it a permanent wasteland and its towns uninhabited. It will know I’m the LORD.	  Ezek 35:1-9

10“Mount Seir has said, ‘I’m going to take over those two lands and make them mine’—though the LORD was there. 11So as I live,” the Lord GOD says, “I’ll deal with you in proportion to the anger, envy, and hate you’ve shown them. I’ll make myself known among them when I condemn you. 12You’ll know that I’ve heard your contempt for the mountains in Israel, ‘They’re desolate; they’ve been given to us to devour.’ 13I’ve heard you speak arrogantly against me over and over. 14While the whole world celebrates, I’ll make you desolate. 15As you celebrated Israel’s desolation, you’ll be desolate, Mount Seir and all Edom. You’ll know I’m the LORD.”   	Ezek 35:10-15

Prophecy to the Mountains of Israel

36:1“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, ‘Listen to 2what the Lord GOD says, “Your enemy has ridiculed you, ‘Ha!’ and ‘The everlasting mountains are ours now!’” 3So prophesy, ‘For good reason other nations made you desolate and crushed you from every direction, took possession of you, and mocked and whispered.’” 4So, mountains of Israel, listen to the message from the Lord GOD to the mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, desolate wastes and abandoned towns that have become prey and objects of derision. 5In my burning jealousy, I’ve spoken against those nations, particularly Edom that took over my land with wholehearted joy and scornful attitude. I’ve sworn to drive it out to become prey. 6So prophesy to Israel’s mountains and hills, ravines and valleys, ‘I’ve spoken in my anger because you’ve had to endure the insults from other nations. 7I swear they will endure insults.’” 	Ezek 36:1-7

8“But you, mountains of Israel, will grow branches and bear fruit for my people because they’ll be coming back soon. 9I’ll return to you, and you’ll be cultivated and planted. 10People will multiply in Israel to live in the towns and rebuild the places in ruins. 11People and animals will reproduce in you. I’ll make you lived-in like before and treat you better than at first. So you’ll know I’m the LORD. 12My people carry on their lives in you and own you. You’ll become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.” 13The Lord GOD says, “Other nations tell you, ‘You’ve devoured your people and bereaved them of children,’ 14but you won’t do that anymore. 15I won’t let you listen to their insults anymore. You won’t make your nation stumble anymore.”	Ezek 36:8-15

16A message from the LORD came to me:

17“Son of man, when Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it with their ways and deeds. Their way was unclean like a woman in her period. 18So I poured out my anger on them for the blood they’d shed, because they’d defiled the land with their idols. 19I scattered them among the nations and judged them by their ways and deeds. 20When they got to those nations, they profaned my holy name, because people said, ‘These are the LORD’s people; yet they’ve come out of his land.’ 21I was concerned about my holy name that they’d profaned among the nations.

22“So, tell Israel, ‘It’s not so much for your sake that I’m about to act; it’s in regard to my holy name that you’ve profaned where you’ve gone. 23I’ll vindicate the holiness of my great name. Then the nations will know I’m the LORD.”	   								    	   	   Ezek 36:16-23

24“I’ll bring you back from the nations, 25sprinkle clean water on you to cleanse you from your filthiness and idols, 2and give you a new heart and spirit. I’ll take out your stone heart and give you a physical one, 27and put my spirit in you so you’ll follow my statutes and observe my ordinances. 28You’ll live in the land I gave your ancestors. You’ll be my people, and I’ll be your God. 29I’ll save you from your uncleanness, send you abundant crops of grain, and keep famine away from you. 30I’ll multiply fruit on your trees and produce in the fields. 31You’ll remember your sinful ways and deeds, and abhor yourselves. 32Understand that I’m not doing this because you deserve it. Be ashamed of yourselves, Israel!” 	Ezek 36:24-32

33“When I cleanse you from your sins, the towns will be rebuilt and lived in again. 34The land will be cultivated for everybody to see that goes by. 35They’ll say, ‘This wasteland has become like the Orchard of Eden. The desolate, ruined towns are fortified and lived in.’ 36Then the nations that are left around you will know I’ve rebuilt the ruined places and replanted what was desolate. I’ll do what I’ve said.”

37The Lord GOD says, “I’ll let Israel ask me to increase their people like a flock. 38People’s flocks will fill the wasted towns like sacrifices in Jerusalem at festival time. They’ll know I’m the LORD.” 	Ezek 36:33-38

A Valley of Dry Bones

37:1-2The LORD’s hand was on me. He took me out in spirit and put me down in a valley full of dry bones, 2and had me walk around among them.

3“Son of man, can these bones come alive?”

“Lord GOD, you know.”

4“Prophesy over them, ‘Dry bones, listen to the LORD. 5I’ll put breath in you so you can come to life. 6I’ll put sinews on you, make flesh grow back, and cover you with skin. You’ll know I’m the LORD.’”

7As I prophesied, there was a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8I saw sinews on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but they weren’t breathing. Ezek 37:1-8

9He told me to prophesy to their breath, “The Lord GOD says to come from the four winds and breathe on these slain so they can come to life.”

10So I prophesied and breath came into them, they came to life, and stood up, a big army.

11Then he said,

“Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They’re saying, ‘Our bones are dried up. Our hope is gone. We’re completely cut off.’ 12So prophesy that the Lord GOD says, ‘I’ll open your graves and resurrect you, and take you to Israel. 13You’ll know I’m the LORD when 14I’ve put my breath in you, you’ve come to life, and I’ve put you in your own land.’” 	Ezek 37:9-14

Reunion of Israel and Judah

15A message from the LORD came to me again:

16“Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and the people of Israel, his companions.’ Take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and the House of Israel, his companions.’ 17Then put them together in your hand to make one stick. 18When your people ask you what these sticks mean, 19say that the Lord GOD says, I’ll take Joseph’s stick—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and the tribes of Israel, his companions. I’ll put them with Judah’s stick, to make one stick in my hand.’ 20The sticks you write on they’ll see in your hand. 21Tell them the Lord GOD will gather the people of Israel from among the nations where they’ve gone and bring them home. 22He’ll make them one nation under one king. 23They won’t defile themselves with idols, detestable things, or any of their sins. He’ll deliver them from the places where they live, where they’ve sinned, and cleanse them. They’ll be his people, and he’ll be their God.”

Ezek 37:15-23

24-25“My servant David will be their king, their one shepherd forever. They’ll follow my ordinances and keep my statutes. They and their descendants will live permanently on the land I gave Jacob, where your ancestors lived. 26I’ll make an everlasting peace treaty with them, bless and multiply them, set my sanctuary among them, 27live with them, and be their God; and they’ll be my people. 28The nations will know I’m the LORD who sanctifies Israel when my sanctuary is with them forever.”’”	Ezek 37:24-28

A Message for Gog

38:1A message from the LORD came to me:

2“Son of man, face Gog of the land of Magog, the prince that rules Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 3‘The Lord GOD says, “I’m against you, Gog. 4I’ll turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and take you out—you, your army, horses and horsemen, all splendidly attired, a large army with buckler and shield, wielding swords; 5Persia, Nubia, and Put with them, all with shield and helmet; 6Gomer with all its troops; Beth-togarmah from the remote parts of the north with all its troops—many nations with you.

7“Be prepared, you and the armies allied with you as their commander. 8After a long time, you’ll be drawn to a land restored from the sword, whose residents live safely. They will have gathered from many nations to the mountains in Israel, which had been a continual waste. 9You and your troops will come down on them like a storm, like a cloud over the land.”           	       Ezek 38:1-9

10‘The Lord GOD says, “At that time, you’ll start plotting, 11‘I’m going to go up against a land with unwalled villages, against people at rest, that live safely, that don’t have walls, bars, and gates. 12I’ll capture spoil, seize plunder, attack waste places that are lived in now and people that gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, and think the world revolves around them.’ 13But Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish and its surrounding villages, will ask you, ‘Do you think the army you’ve gathered can capture lots of spoil, seize plunder and goods, carry off silver and gold, and drive away livestock?’	 			Ezek 38:10-13

14“So, son of man, prophesy against Gog that the Lord GOD says, ‘When my people are living securely, you’ll know it, won’t you? 15You’ll come from the far north, riding horses, a great army 16swooping down like a cloud over the land. In the last days, Gog, I’ll bring you against my land so the nations can see my holiness displayed by what happens to you.’    	Ezek 38:14-16

17‘The Lord GOD says, “Aren’t you the one I spoke about in former times through my prophets in Israel? They predicted for years that I’d bring you against them. 18‘When Gog comes against Israel, my fury will flare.’ 19In my zeal and blazing anger, there will be a violent earthquake in Israel. 20Fish in the sea, buzzards from the sky, scavengers in the open country, things crawling on the ground, and everybody in the world will shudder at my presence. Mountains will crumble, cliffs will collapse, walls will crash to the ground. 21I’ll call for a sword against Gog on all my mountains. His swordsmen will turn against each other. 22With disease and blood I’ll render judgment on him: rain on him, his troops, and many allies, a torrential rain with hailstones, fire, and sulfur. 23I’ll show my greatness, sanctify myself, make myself known where many nations can see me. They’ll know I’m the LORD.”’	 Ezek 38:17-23

39:1“Son of man, prophesy against Gog, ‘The Lord GOD says, “I’m against you, ruler of Meshech, and Tubal. 2I’ll turn you around, drive you on, take you up from the most remote parts in the north, and bring you against Israel. 3I’ll knock the bow out of your left hand and the arrows out of your right hand. 4-5You and your troops will fall on the mountains in Israel. I’ll feed you to every vulture and wild animal in the open country. I’ve said so. 6I’ll rain down fire on Magog and those who live securely in distant lands. They’ll know I’m the LORD.’

Ezek 39:1-6

7“I’ll make my holy name known among my people; I won’t let it be profaned anymore. The nations will know I’m the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. 8The day I’m talking about is coming; it will happen.’

9“For seven years, the people in the towns of Israel will go out and build fires with the weapons, shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears. 10They won’t get wood from the pasture or gather firewood from the woods; they’ll build fires out of weapons and plunder the ones that plundered them,”				                      	the Lord GOD says. 	Ezek 39:7-10

11“When I give Gog a burial ground in Israel—in the valley east of the Dead Sea, it will block travelers. They’ll bury Gog with all his army there and call it the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 12It will take Israel seven months of burying to clean up the land. 13The common people will do the burying to their renown when I glory myself,” the Lord GOD says. 14“They’ll appoint men to go through the land and bury the ones left on the ground. 15When they see a human bone, they’ll put a marker by it till those who do the burying put it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 16The city’s name will be Hamonah [Horde]. So they’ll clean up the land.”

Ezek 39:11-16

17“Son of man, tell every bird and wild animal, ‘Gather to the great sacrifice I’m going to make for you on the mountains in Israel so you can eat flesh and drink blood. 18You’ll eat the flesh of powerful men and drink the blood of princes as if they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—grain-fed animals from Bashan. 19You’ll eat till you’re gorged and drink blood till you’re drunk from the sacrifice I’ll make for you. 20At my table you’ll gorge on horses, charioteers, and mighty warriors,’”	 the Lord GOD says.	   Ezek 39:17-20

21“I’ll demonstrate my honor among the nations. They’ll see the judgment I’ve carried out on them. 22Israel will know I’m the LORD their God from then on. 23The nations will know Israel went into exile for their sin, and I hid from them. I abandoned them to their enemies, and they fell by the sword. [24]”’”

25So the Lord GOD says, “Now I’ll restore Jacob’s fortunes and have mercy on the whole House of Israel. I’ll be zealous for my holy name. 26When they live securely in their own land with nobody to threaten them, they’ll forget their shame and unfaithfulness to me. 27When I bring them back from the nations, they’ll sanctify me in a way many lands can see. 28They’ll know I’m the LORD their God because I exiled them and then gathered them back. I won’t leave any of them there. 29I won’t hide from them anymore because I’ve poured out my Spirit on Israel.” 		Ezek 39:21-29

VISION OF THE NEW TEMPLE AREA

40:1At the beginning of the twenty-fifth year of our exile, tenth month, fourteenth year after the city fell, the LORD’s hand weighed heavy on me. 2In visions he took me to Israel and set me on a tall mountain. On it to the south was a structure like a city. 3He took me over there. Standing in the gate was a bronze-looking man with a flax line and a measuring rod in his hand. 4He told me,

“Son of man, look, listen, pay attention to everything I show you. That’s why the LORD brought you here. Tell Israel everything you see.” 	Ezek 40:1-4

The East Gate

5There was a wall all the way around the Temple. The man holding a measuring rod (10' 4" long, each cubit being 17.72" ordinary cubit plus 2.95" ordinary palm = 20.8" royal cubit) measured the thickness and height of the wall at 10' 4" 1 reed each. 6Then he went to the east gate, up its steps, and measured its threshold at 10' 4" 1 reed wide and deep. 7The guard rooms were 10' 4" 1 reed square with 8' 7" 5 cubits between them. The threshold of the gate facing inward was 10' 4" 1 reed, 8and the porch of the gate facing inward was 10' 4" 1 reed. 9He measured the porch of the gate at 13' 10" 8 cubits; the porch of the gate faced inward. 10There were 3 guardrooms on each side of the gate, all the same size. The side pillars were square. 11The opening of the gate was 17' 3" 10 cubits wide and 20' 5" 13 cubits deep. 12There was a barrier wall in front of the guardrooms 21" 1 cubit thick on each side, and the guardrooms were 10' 4" 6 cubits square. 13He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other as 43' 1" 25 cubits wide from one door to the opposite door. 14He made the side pillars 103' 6" 60 cubits high. The gate extended around to the side pillar of the courtyard. 15From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was 86' 3" 50 cubits. 16There were beveled windows narrowing inward toward their side pillars within the gate all around; the same for the porches. The porch had windows all around inside, and the dividing walls were decorated with palm trees. 	Ezek 40:5-16

The Outer Court

17Then he took me to the outer court. There were rooms and a pavement made for the court all the way around—30 rooms that faced the pavement. 18The lower pavement ran alongside the gates, corresponding to their length. 19Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the outside of the inner court at 172' 5" 50 cubits on the east and north.

The North Gate

20He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court that faced north. 21It had 3 guardrooms on each side, and its side pillars and porches had the same measurements as the first gate. It was 86' 3" long and 43' 1" wide 50 x 25 cubits. 22Its windows and porches and its palm tree had the same measurements as the gate that faced east. 7 steps led up to it, and its porch was in front of them. 23The inner court had a gate across from the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; he measured 172' 5" 1o0 cubits from one gate to the other. 	Ezek 40:17-23

The South Gate

24Then he led me south to the south gate. He measured its side pillars and porches; they were the same as the others. 25The gate and its porches had windows all the way around like the other windows. It was 86' 3" long and 43' 1"wide 50 x 25 cubits. 26There were 7 steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them. It had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. 27The inner court had a gate facing south, and he measured 86' 3" 50 cubits from gate to gate.

Gates to the Inner Court

28Then he took me to the inner court by the south gate. It was the same size as the others. 29Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches were the same size as the others. The gate and its porches had windows all the way around; it was 86' 3" by 43' 1" 50 x 25 cubits. 30There were porches all the way around that measured 43' 1" by 8' 7" 25 x 5 cubits. 31Its porches faced the outer court. There were palm trees on its side pillars; its stairway had 8 steps.	 Ezek 40:24-31

32He took me to the inner court on the east side. That gate had the same measurements as the others. 33Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches measured the same as the others. The gate and its porches had windows all the way around; it was 86' 3" by 43' 1" 50 x 25 cubits. 34Its porches faced the outer court.  There were palm trees on its side pillars on each side; its stairway had 8 steps.

35Then he took me to the north gate. It also had the same measurements as the others. 36Its guardrooms, side pillars, and porches were the same as the others. The gate had windows all the way around; it, too, was 86' 3" by 43' 1" 50 x 25 cubits. 37Its side pillars faced the outer court. There were palm trees on each side of its side pillars; its stairway had 8 steps.              Ezek 40:32-37

Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices

38There was a room with its doorway by the side pillars at the gates, where they would wash the burnt offering. 39In the porch of the gate, there were 2 tables on each side for slaughtering the burnt offering, sin offering, and guilt offering. 40On the outer side, as you went up to the gate toward the north, there were 2 tables on each side of the gate; 414 tables were on each side next to the gate—8 tables for slaughtering sacrifices. 42For the burnt offering there were 4 hewn-stone tables 2' 7" 1½ cubits square and 1' 8" high 1 cubit. On them they lay the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 43The double hooks—4" 1 handbreadth long—were fastened on the Temple all the way around. The meat from the offering was to be laid on the tables.	Ezek 40:38-43

Rooms for the Priests

44From the outside to the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, one of which was at the side of the north gate with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the east gate facing north. 45He said,

“This room that faces south is for the priests that oversee maintenance of the Temple. 46The room that faces north is for the priests that are in charge of the altar. These are the descendants of Zadok from the Levites, who approach the LORD to minister to him.”

The Temple Courtyard and Temple

47He measured the court at 172' 5" 100 cubits square. The altar stood in front of the Temple.

48Then he took me to the porch of the Temple and measured each side pillar of it—8' 7" 5 cubits square; each side of the gate was 5' 2" 3 cubits square. 49The porch measured 34' 6" x 19' 20 x 11 cubits. At the stairway by which it was ascended, were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side.					Ezek 40:44-49

41:1Then he took me to the nave and measured the side pillars. Each pillar was 10' 4" 6 cubits square. 2The entrance was 17' 3" 10 cubits wide; the sides of the entrance were 8' 7" 3 cubits on each side. He measured the length and width of the nave at 69' x 34' 6" 40 x 20 cubits. 3He went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway at 3' 5" 2 cubits, and the doorway at 6' 10" high and 12' 1" wide 6h x 7w cubits. 4He measured the front of the nave at 34' 6" 20 cubits square He told me, “This is the Holy Place.”	 Ezek 41:1-4

5He measured the Temple wall at 10' 4"' 6 cubits and the width of the side rooms at 6' 11" 4 cubits all around the Temple. 6The side rooms were three stories high, 30 rooms on each floor. They extended to the wall on their inside all around so they could be fastened and not be fastened into the wall of the Temple. 7The side rooms surrounding the Temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the Temple went up by stages on all sides of it, the width of the Temple increased as it went higher. So one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story. 8I saw also that the Temple had a raised platform all around. The foundations of the side rooms were 10' 4" 6 long cubits. 9The outer wall of the side rooms was 8' 7" 5 cubits thick. But the space between the side rooms belonging to the Temple 10and the outer rooms was 34' 6" 20 cubits wide all around the Temple. 11The doorways of the side rooms opened onto the part of the platform that was left free, one door to the north and one to the south. The width of the part that was left free was 8' 7" 5 cubits all around.	Ezek 41:5-11

12The building in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was 105ft wide. The building’s wall was 8' 7" 5 cubits thick all around, and it was 155' 3"long 90 cubits. 13Then he measured the Temple at 172' 5" 100 cubits long. The separate area with the building and its walls was also 172' 5" 100 cubits long. 14The front of the Temple and the separate area along the east side were 172' 5" 100 cubits.

15He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side at 172' 5" 100 cubits. 	Ezek 41:12-15a

He also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court. 16The nave of the Temple, the inner room, and the outer vestibule were paneled. Around all three there were windows with recessed frames. The threshold was paneled with wood all around from the floor to the windows (which were covered), 17to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. On all the walls round about in the inner room and the nave were carved likenesses 18of cherubs alternating with palm trees. Each cherub had two faces: 19the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole Temple round about. 20From the floor to above the door, cherubs and palm trees were carved on the wall.	Ezek 41:15b-20

21The doorposts of the nave were square. In front of the Holy Place was something like 22an altar of wood 3' 5" x 3' 5" x 5' 2" 2 x 2 x 3 cubits tall. Its corners, base, and sides were wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.” 23The nave and Holy Place each had a double door. 24The doors had two swinging leaves apiece. 25On the doors of the nave were carved cherubs and palms trees, such as were carved on the walls. There was a wood canopy in front of the vestibule outside. 26There were recessed windows and palm trees on each side on the side walls of the vestibule.	 Ezek 41:21-26

Rooms for the Priests

42:1Then he took me north to the outer court, to the rooms across from the Temple yard and the north building. 2The length of the building on the north side was 172' 5" x 86' 3" 50 x 100 cubits. 3Beside the 34' 6" 20 cubits that belonged to the inner court and facing the pavement of the outer court, there was a three-story gallery. 4In front of its rooms was an inner walkway 17' 3" wide x 172' 5" long 10 x 100lcubits with doorways on the north. 5The upper rooms were narrower, because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle floors of the building. 6The rooms had three stories and didn’t have any pillars like the pillars in the courts. So the upper rooms were set back more than the lower two levels. 7The outer wall beside the rooms toward the court was 86' 3" 50 cubits long. 8The rooms in the outer court were 86' 3" 50 cubits long. The rooms facing the Temple were 172' 5" 100 cubits long. 9Below those rooms, was the east entrance as you enter them from the outer court, where the outside wall begins. 	Ezek 42:1-9

10On the east across from the yard and the building there were rooms 11with a passage in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and with the same exits, arrangements, and doors. 12Below the south rooms, there was an entrance on the east side—where a person goes into the passage—and across from them there was a dividing wall.

13Then he told me,

“The north and south rooms, across from the separate area, are holy rooms where the priests that are near the LORD are to eat the most holy things. They’ll lay the most holy things there—the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering; because the place is holy. 14When the priests go in, they’re not to go out to the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there the holy vestments that they minister in. They’ll put on other clothes so they can go to the parts of the building that’s open to the public.”

15When he’d finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out through the east gate, and measured all the way around the Temple: 165170' 500 reeds on the east, 17north, 18south, and 19west sides. 20The Temple had a wall all the way around it, 5170' 500 reeds long in both directions, to separate the holy from the common.	Ezek 42:10-20

The LORD’s Glory Returns to the Temple

43:1Then he led me to the east gate, 2and the glory of Israel’s God was shining through it. His voice sounded like crashing water, and the earth radiated with his glory. 3The vision I saw was like the one when he came to destroy the city, like the one by the Chebar River. I fell on my face. 4The glory of the LORD came into the Temple through the east gate. 5The Spirit lifted me up and took me to the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the Temple.	 Ezek 43:1-5

6While a man stood beside me, I heard someone talking to me from the Temple:

7“Son of man, this is the place for my throne and the soles of my feet, where I’ll live among the people of Israel permanently. Israel and its kings won’t defile my holy name anymore, either by their prostitution, by the dead bodies of their kings, 8or by setting their threshold beside my threshold or their doorposts beside my doorposts with only a wall between them and me. They’ve defiled my holy name with their disgusting deeds; so I’ve consumed them in my anger. 9Now they need to put their idolatry and their kings’ dead bodies far away from me so I can live among them from now on.    	Ezek 43:6-9

10“Son of man, describe to Israel what the Temple its layout look like and so they’ll regret their sins. 11If they regret everything they’ve done, then picture the Temple, its appearance, its exits and entrances, and full layout. Show them its ordinances and laws. Write them down in their presence so they can observe them. 12This is the rule for the Temple: the whole area on top of the mountain will be most holy.

The Altar

13“These are the measurements of the altar: the base will be a 20.7" 1 long cubit square with a 3.4" 1 handbreadth border. This will be the height: 14from the base on the ground to the lower ledge is 3' 5" 2 cubits, with a width 20.7" 1 cubit; from the smaller ledge to the large ledge is 6' 11" 4 cubits, with a width of 20.7" 1 cubit. 15The altar hearth will be 6' 11" 4 cubits; from the altar hearth projecting upward will have 4 horns 20.7" 1 cubit high. 16The altar hearth will be 20' 8" 12 cubits square. 17The ledge will be 24' 1" 14 cubits on four sides with a rim around it 10.3" ½ cubit wide and a base 20.7" 1 cubit wide all the way around. The altar’s steps will face east.” 					Ezek 43:10-17

18“He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord GOD says, ‘These are the statutes at the time it’s built, to offer burnt offerings on it and sprinkle blood on it. 19For a sin offering, give a young bull to the Levitical priests that have descended from Zadok, who come near to me to minister. 20Put some of its blood on the altar’s four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border around it. Cleanse it and atone for it that way. 21Take the bull of the sin offering and burn it in the appointed place in the Temple outside the sanctuary. 22On the second day, offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering. They’re to cleanse the altar like they cleansed it for the bull. 23When you’ve finished cleansing it, present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock. 24Present them before the LORD. The priests are to sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD. 25For a week each day prepare a goat for a sin offering, a young bull, and a ram from the flock without blemish. 26For a week atone for the altar and purify it to consecrate it. 27From the eighth day on, the priests are to offer your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings; and I’ll accept you.’” 					Ezek 43:18-27

The Prince, Levites, and Priests

44:1Then he brought me back through the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; it was shut. 2The LORD told me,

“Keep this gate shut. Nobody is to go in through it because I’ve gone in through it. 3The prince will sit in it to eat bread in my presence. He’ll go in by the vestibule of the gate and go out the same way.	 Ezek 44:1-3

4Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. I looked and watched the glory of the LORD fill the Temple; I fell on my face. 5The LORD said,

“Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears everything I tell you about the statutes and laws of the LORD’s Temple. Mark well the ones who can and can’t be admitted to the sanctuary. 6Tell the rebellious people in Israel, ‘Enough of your abominations! 7Enough bringing foreigners—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—into my sanctuary to profane my Temple, when you offered me my food, the fat and blood. You made my covenant void—besides all your abominations. 8You’ve not taken care of my holy things yourselves; you’ve set foreigners to take care of my sanctuary.  	 Ezek 44:4-8

9“No foreigner living among the Israelites—uncircumcised in heart and flesh—can enter my sanctuary. 10The Levites that left me when Israel went astray after their idols will be punished. 11Yet they will minister in my sanctuary and oversee the gates to the Temple: they’ll slaughter the burnt offering and sacrifice for the people, and minister to them. 12Because they ministered to them in front of their idols and Israel stumbled over them, I’ve sworn that they’ll be punished: 13they won’t come near to serve as priests to me or approach any of my things most holy; they’ll bear their disgrace and the abominations they’ve committed. 14Yet I’ll give them responsibility for the Temple, its service, and everything done in it. 					Ezek 44:9-14

15“But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept charge of my sanctuary when Israel left me, will come near to minister to me. They’ll serve me to offer the fat and blood. 16They’ll go into my sanctuary; they’ll come near to my table to minister to me and keep my charge. 17When they go in at the gates of the inner court, they’ll wear linen vestments, not wool, while they’re ministering at the gates of the inner court and in the Temple. 18They’ll wear linen turbans and underclothes around their waist, nothing that will make them sweat. 19When they go to the people in the outer court, they’ll take off those vestments, lay them in the holy rooms, and put on other clothes so they won’t transmit holiness to the people. 20They’re not to shave their heads or let their hair grow long; they’ll trim it. 21They’re are not to drink wine when they go into the inner court.

22Priests are not to marry a widow or divorced woman, only a virgin from Israel or a priest’s widow. 23They’ll teach my people the difference between holy and profane, clean and unclean. 24In disputes, they’ll act as judges and judge by my ordinances. They’ll keep my laws and statutes at my stated festivals and set aside my Sabbaths. 25They’re not to defile themselves by going near a dead person except for father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or virgin sister. 26After he’s defiled, he’ll wait a week and then be clean. 27The day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister, he’s to offer a sin offering for himself.

Ezek 44:15-27

28“Don’t give them an inheritance in Israel; I’m their possession. 29They’ll eat the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering. Every devoted thing in Israel will belong to them. 30First part of the harvest of every kind and every kind of contribution will be for the priests. Give the priest the first of your dough to bring a blessing on your house. 31The priests aren’t to eat any bird or animal that’s died naturally or been torn to pieces by animals. 	Ezek 44:28-31

Division of the Land

45:1“When you divide the land by lot for inheritance, allot to the LORD, a holy district 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits; it will be holy throughout. 2Inside it will be a holy place 861' 500 cubits square with 86' 3" 50 cubits open all the way around. 3Inside the district, set aside a section 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits for the sanctuary, the most holy place, 4the holy portion of the land. It will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary who come near to minister to the LORD, a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 5Another section 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits will be for the Levites, the ministers of the Temple, and as their possession for towns to live in. 6Alongside the section designated as the holy district, assign for the possession of the city an area 1.63 x 8.2 miles 5,000 x 25,000 cubits. It will be for the whole House of Israel. 	Ezek 45:1-6

7“The prince will have land on both sides, alongside the holy district and the property for the city, on the west side and on the east side. Its length will correspond to one of the tribal portions and extend from the east to the west boundary of the land. 8He’ll own it so my officials won’t any longer oppress my people, but they’ll give the rest of the land to the tribes of Israel.

Warnings for the Princes

9“Stop it, officials of Israel! Stop evicting my people! Stop violence and destruction. Practice justice and goodness.

10“Use accurate balances, ephahs, and baths. 11An ephah and a bath will be the same amount; so they both contain 1.1 bushels .1 homer. 12A shekel will be 20 gerahs; 60 shekels will equal a mina.    	Ezek 45:7-12

Offerings and Festivals

13“This is the offering you’re to provide: .18 bushel  ⅙  ephah from 11 bushels 1 homer of wheat, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah from 11 bushels 1 homer of barley; 14and the prescribed portion of olive oil (that is, 9 gallons  1 bath  of oil), .9 gallon .1 bath from each 90 gallons 1 cor (which is 90 gallons 10 baths, or 1 homer, because 10 baths equal 1 homer); 15and one sheep from each flock of 200 from the watering places of Israel—for a grain offering, a burnt offering, and a peace offering, to make atonement for them,” the Lord GOD says. 16“All the general populace will give this offering for the prince. 17He will provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and liquid offerings for the festivals, new moons, and Sabbaths—at the stated festivals. He’ll provide the sin offering, grain offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, to atone for Israel.	Ezek 45:13-17

18“On the first day of the first month, take a young bull without blemish and purify the sanctuary. 19The priests will take blood from the sin offering and put it on the door posts of the Temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court. 20To atone for the Temple, they’re to do that on the seventh of the month for everybody that goes astray or sins in ignorance.

21“On the fourteenth day of the first month, observe the Passover festival for a week; eat bread without yeast. 22On that day the prince will provide a bull for a sin offering for himself and the people. 23Each day of the festival he’ll provide a burnt offering to the LORD: 7 bulls and 7 rams without blemish, and 1 male goat for a sin offering. 24He’ll provide a grain offering: 4½ pecks 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 25On the fifteenth day, seventh month, for the week of the festival, he’ll provide sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and olive oil.” 	Ezek 45:18-25

46:1‘The Lord GOD says, “The gate in the inner court that faces east will be shut the six working days, but open on Sabbaths and new moons. 2The prince will go in through the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gate post. The priests will provide his burnt offering and peace offerings. He’ll worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate won’t be shut till that evening. 3The people will also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on Sabbaths and new moons. 4The prince’s burnt offering on the Sabbath will be 6 lambs and 1 ram without blemish. 5The grain offering will be a 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the ram, and a grain offering with the lambs as much as he can give, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah.  6On the new moon, he’ll offer 1 young bull, 6 lambs, and 1 ram, all without blemish. 7He’ll provide a grain offering, 4½ pecks 1 ephah with the bull and the ram, and as much as he can give with the lambs, and 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil for each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 8The prince will enter through the porch of the gate and leave the same way.

Ezek 46:1-8

9“When the people present themselves to the LORD at the stated festivals, the one that goes in through the north gate to worship will leave through the south gate. The one that goes in through the south gate will leave through the north gate. Nobody will leave through the same gate they entered. 10When they go in, the prince will go in with them; when they go out, he’ll go out. 11At the feasts and stated festivals, the grain offering will be 4½ pecks bushel 1 ephah with each bull and ram, and with the lambs as much as a person can give, together with 1½ gallons 1 hin of olive oil with each 4½ pecks 1 ephah. 12When the prince provides a freewill offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He’ll provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he’ll go out, and the gate will be shut behind him.

Ezek 46:9-12

13“Each morning, provide a year-old lamb without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD. 14Provide a grain offering with it, .18 bushel ⅙ ephah and ½ gallon ⅓ of a hin of olive oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by ongoing ordinance. 15So a lamb and a grain offering with the olive oil will be provided every morning.

16‘The Lord GOD says, “If the prince gives a son a gift out of his inheritance, it will be a permanent possession. 17But if he gives a servant a gift from his inheritance, it will go back to the prince at the Year of Jubilee. His inheritance will belong only to his sons. 18The prince won’t confiscate people’s inheritance or chase them off their land. He’ll give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so my people won’t be separated from their possessions.”’”

Ezek 46:13-18

19Then he took me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy rooms for the priests, which faced north. There was a place at the far back toward the west. 20He said, “This is where the priests will boil the guilt offerings and sin offerings, and bake the grain offering so they won’t bring them out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.” 21Then he took me to the four corners of the outer court. There was a small court in each corner, 22four enclosed corner courts, all the same size—69' x 51' 8" 40 x 30 cubits. 23There was a row of masonry around them, and boiling places were made under the rows all the way around. 24He told me, “These places are where the ministers of the Temple will boil the nations’ sacrifices.”   	Ezek 46:19-24

A River of Healing from the Temple

47:1Then he took me back to the Temple door. Water was running east from under the threshold of the Temple, which faced east. It was running down from under the right side of the Temple from south of the altar. 2He brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. Water was trickling from the south side.

3When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured 1,723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through the water, which was up to my ankles. 4Again he measured 1,723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my knees. He measured another 1,723ft 1,000 cubits and led me through water up to my waist. 5He measured 1,723ft 1,000 cubits again, a river I couldn’t cross because it was too deep to ford; it was deep enough to swim in. 6He said, “Do you see that?”

Ezek 47:1-6a

He took me back to the riverbank. 7Lots of trees were growing on both sides of the river now. 8He said,

“This water runs east down to the Arabah, to the sea, and makes it fresh. 9Wherever the water goes, everything that forms schools will live. There’ll be lots of fish because the water will be fresh. 10Fishermen will spread their nets from En-gedi to En-eglaim. There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 11But its swamps and marshes will stay salty. 12On both riverbanks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves won’t wither, and their fruit won’t fail. They’ll bear year around because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will provide food and their leaves provide healing.”

Ezek 47:6b-12

The Boundaries of the Land

13The Lord GOD says,

‘When you divide up the land among the 12 tribes, give Joseph two portions, 14and dividepl the inheritance equally like I swore to your ancestors.

15“These will be the boundaries for the land. The north boundary will run from the Mediterranean Sea past Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad; 16Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, (on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazerhatticon by the border of Hauran. 17So the boundary will run from the Sea to Hazarenan on the north border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. 18The east boundary will run from Hazarenan between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel. From the north border to the Dead Sea as far as Tamar. 19The south boundary will extend from Tamar as far as the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. 20The west boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea from the southern boundary to a point across from Lebo-hamath.

21-22“So divide the land by lots as an inheritance for the tribes and the foreigners that live among you; and have sons. Treat foreigners like native-born Israelites. Allot them an inheritance 23in the tribe where each one lives,”

the Lord GOD says.	Ezek 47:13-23

Division of the Land

48:1“These are the names of the tribes. Beginning on the northern boundary, from the sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, as far as Hazar-enon (on the northern boundary of Damascus beside Hamath) running from the east side to the west: one portion each for Dan, 2Asher, 3Naphtali, 4Manasseh, 5Ephraim, 6Reuben, 7and Judah. 	Ezek 48:1-7

8“Adjoining Judah from east to west will be the allotment set aside from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits wide and equal to one of the portions. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it. 9-10The allotment set aside to the LORD will be 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits, running east and west. The allotment will be for the priests 11that are sanctified from the descendants of Zadok, who kept my charge and didn’t go astray when Israel went astray—like the Levites did. 12It will be an allotment to them from the land, a most holy place beside the Levites’ portion. 13Alongside the boundary of the priests, the Levites will have a portion 8.2 x 3¼ miles 25,000 x 10,000 cubits. 14They won’t sell or temporarily exchange any of it or pass the first part of its harvest to anyone else, because it’s holy to the LORD.  				Ezek 48:8-14

15“The remainder, 1.63 x 8.2 miles 5,000 x 25,000 cubits, will be for common use by the city, for houses and open spaces. The city will lie in the middle of it. 16It will be square, measuring 1.47 miles on a side. 17The city will have an open space 430' 7" 250 cubits wide all the way around it. 18The rest of the length alongside the holy allotment will be 3¼ miles 10,000 cubits wide running east and west. Its crops and produce will feed the workmen in the city. 19The workmen in the city—from all the tribes—will cultivate it. 20The whole allotment will be 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits square. Set it aside with the city’s property.

21“What’s left on both sides of the holy portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince, extending from east to west 8.2 miles 25,000 cubits parallel to the holy portion. The holy portion with the Temple in the middle, 22the property of the Levites, and the property of the city will be inside the prince’s portion, which will lie between Judah and Benjamin. 	Ezek 48:15-22

23“For the rest of the tribes from east to west: one portion each for Benjamin, 24then Simeon, 25then Issachar, 26then Zebulun, 27then Gad. 28Joining Gad at the south side, the boundary will be from Tamar to the water at Meribath-kadesh to the River of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. 29That’s the land you’ll divide by lot to the tribes of Israel,”

the Lord GOD says. 	Ezek 48:23-29

The Gates of the City

30“The city, which is 1¼ miles on a side, 31will have gates that bear the names of the tribes:

three gates on the north side: Reuben, Judah, and Levi;

32three on the east: Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan;

33three on the south: Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; and

34three on the west: Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.

35The city will be 5.9 miles 18,000 cubits around and named Yahveh Is There [Yahveh Shammah].”   			Ezek 48:30-35

DANIEL

Daniel Taken to Babylon

1:1In the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, laid siege to Jerusalem. 2The LORD delivered Jehoiakim to him, along with articles from God’s Temple. He took them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar/Babylonia and put them in the treasury. 3He ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the Israelites, including members of the royal family and the nobles, 4young men with no defects, good looking, intelligent, educated men that could serve in the king’s court. He had him teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians, 5and allotted them a daily ration of the royal food and the wine he drank. He assigned them three years of education; then they were to enter his personal service. 6Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the tribe of Judah. 7The chief eunuch renamed them: Daniel was Belteshazzar, Hananiah was Shadrach, Mishael was Meshach, and Azariah was Abed-nego.	Dan 1:1-7

8But Daniel made up his mind not to defile himself with the king’s wine and royal food, and asked the chief eunuch to let him not defile himself. 9God had given the chief eunuch respect and affection for Daniel, 10but he told him,

“The king specified what you should eat and drink. I’m afraid my lord would see that you weren’t as healthy as the other youths your age. You’d put my life in danger from him.”

11Daniel told the steward that the chief eunuch had appointed to oversee them,

12“Test us for ten days. Let us have vegetables and water. 13Then look at us and the youths that eat the king’s food, and deal with us by what you see.”

14He agreed and tested them for ten days. 15After ten days he could see that they looked better and were healthier than the ones who ate the king’s food. 16So the steward took away their wine and royal food and fed them vegetables.	 Dan 1:8-16

17God gave these four youths an aptitude for learning and skill in every branch of literature and wisdom. Daniel understood visions and dreams. 18At the end of the time the king had specified, the chief eunuch brought them in. 19The king talked to them, and none of them impressed him like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service. 20In every matter of wisdom and understanding he asked them about, he found them ten times more capable than the magicians and enchanters in his whole empire. 21Daniel continued till the first year of King Cyrus. 	Dan 1:17-21

Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream

2:1In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, haunting dreams kept him awake. 2He gave orders to call in the magicians, conjurers, sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him what he’d dreamed. When they came in, 3he told them, “I had a dream, and I’m disturbed about what it means.”

4The astrologers said in Aramaic, “Long live the King! Tell us the dream, and we’ll tell you what it means.”

5“I’m giving an unalterable command. If you don’t tell me what I dreamed and its meaning, I’ll have you torn limb from limb, and make your houses trash piles. 6But if you tell me, I’ll reward you with gifts and high honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.”

7“Tell us the dream, and we’ll tell you what it means.”

8“You’re stalling because you can see I’ve given an unalterable command. 9If you don’t tell me the dream, there’s only one decree for you. You’ve conspired to lie and say bogus things till I change my mind. Tell me what I dreamed so I know you can tell me what it means.”

10“Nobody can do that. No great king or ruler has ever asked such a thing from any magician, conjurer, or astrologer. 11What you’re demanding is not possible. Nobody but the gods can tell you that, and they don’t live in mortal flesh.”

12At this, the king was furious and gave orders to destroy the wise men in Babylon. 13The decree went out to execute them, and they started looking for Daniel and his friends to kill them.

Dan 2:1-13

God Gives Daniel the Dream’s Interpretation

14With prudence and discretion Daniel answered Arioch, captain of the king’s bodyguard, who’d gone out to execute the wise men, 15“Why is the king’s decree so urgent?” Arioch told him what had happened. 16So Daniel went in and asked the king for some time so he could tell him the interpretation. 17He went home and informed his three friends about the matter 18so they could ask for mercy from the God of heaven about that mystery, so Daniel and his friends wouldn’t die with the rest of the wise men in Babylon. 19The mystery came to Daniel in a vision during the night, and he blessed the God of heaven:

20“God be blessed forever

because of his wisdom and power.

21He’s the One that changes times and seasons,

removes kings and appoints them.

He gives the wise their wisdom

and the knowledgeable their insight.

22He reveals profound, hidden things;

he knows what’s in the dark,

and light lives in him.

23I thank and praise you, my ancestors’ God,

because you’ve given me wisdom and authority.

Just now you’ve told me what we’ve asked for,

the answer to the king’s demand.”	Dan 2:14-23

24So Daniel went in to Arioch and said, “Don’t execute the wise men! Take me to the king. I’ll give him the interpretation.”

25Arioch hurried him to the king, “I’ve found a man among the Jewish exiles from Judah that can tell you the interpretation!”

26The king answered Daniel (Belteshazzar), “Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”			 Dan 2:24-26

27Daniel said,

“Wise men, conjurers, magicians, and fortunetellers can’t tell you that. 28But there’s a God in heaven that reveals secret things, and he’s revealed to you what’s going to happen. That’s what you dreamed in your bed. 29You were thinking about what will happen in the future, and he that reveals secret things was showing you that. 30The mystery hasn’t come to me because of my wisdom any more than anybody else’s, except for telling you so you can understand what’s going through your mind.	      Dan 2:27-30

31“You saw a large, frightening statue that had exceptional splendor. 32Its head was fine gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, 33its legs were iron, and its feet were iron and clay mixed. 34As you watched, a stone was hewn out without hands and struck the statue’s iron and clay feet and crushed them. 35It crushed the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold all at one time. They became like chaff on the summer threshing floors, and the wind carried them away without a trace. But the stone that struck the statue became a huge mountain that covered the whole world.   	Dan 2:31-35

36“That’s what you dreamed. Now we’ll tell you what it means. 37You’re the king of kings that God has given the kingdom, power, strength, and honor. 38Wherever people, animals, or birds live, he’s put them under your control. You’re the gold head. 39After you, a lesser kingdom will rise up. Then a third, bronze kingdom will rule the world. 40There’ll be a fourth kingdom that’s as strong as iron. As iron crushes and shatters everything, it will shatter and crush the other three. 41As the feet and toes were partly potter’s clay and partly iron, the fourth kingdom will be a divided one, some parts with the toughness of iron and other parts with the weakness of clay. 42As some toes were iron and some were clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 43The iron mixed with clay means they’ll be allied peoples that won’t stick to one another, like iron and clay won’t stick together.

44During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will be setting up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or left for another people. It’ll crush those other kingdoms and put an end to them, but it will last forever. 45You saw a stone hewn out of the mountain without hands that crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God has shown you what will happen in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation sure.”    	Dan 2:36-45

46King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face in homage to Daniel and gave orders to present him with an offering and fragrant incense. 47He said, “Truly your God is the greatest of gods and the Lord over kings, who reveals secrets! You’ve explained that mystery!” 48He promoted Daniel, gave him many high honors, and made him ruler over the province of Babylon and chief prefect over the wise men in Babylon. 49Daniel asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to administer the province while Daniel was at the king’s court. 	Dan 2:46-49

Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue

3:1Nebucharnezzar made a gold image 90ft tall and 18ft wide, and set it up on the Plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 2Then he sent word to gather the satraps, prefects, governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image. 3They came and stood in front of it. 4The herald declared loudly,

“Every people, nation, and language group, 5when you hear the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, pipes, and other instruments, fall down and worship the gold image the king has set up. 6Whoever doesn’t will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace.”

7So when the people heard the instruments, they all fell down to the image in worship.    Dan 3:1-7

The Blazing Furnace

8Some astrologers came and accused the Jews.

9“Long live the King! 10You decreed that when everybody hears the music, they’re to fall down and worship the gold image. 11Whoever doesn’t, will be thrown in the blazing furnace. 12Some Jews you appointed to administer the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego—have disregarded you. They don’t serve your gods or worship your gold image.”

13In a rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring them in. 	Dan 3:8-13

14“Is it true you won’t serve my gods or worship the gold image I set up? 15If you’re ready, when you hear the instruments, fall down in worship to the image I’ve made. If you don’t, you’ll be thrown directly into the blazing furnace. What god can deliver you from me?”

16Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered him,

“We don’t need to answer you about that. 17If that happens, the God we serve can deliver us from the blazing furnace and from you. 18Even if he doesn’t, we’re not going to serve your gods or worship the image you set up. 	Dan 3:14-18

19He was irate and changed his attitude toward them. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than normal, 20and commanded some brave soldiers from his army to tie them up and throw them in. 21They tied them up in their cloaks, tunics, turbans, and other clothes to throw them in. 22Since the king’s command was strict and the furnace was extremely hot, the fire killed the soldiers that carried them. 23They fell into the blazing furnace still tied up.

24Nebuchadnezzar was astounded. He jumped up and exclaimed to his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men in the fire?”

“Yes.”

25He answered, “Look! I see four men not tied up, walking around in the fire unharmed. The fourth looks like a god!”	 Dan 3:19-25

26He went up to the door of the blazing furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego, come out of there, you servants of the Most High God. Come here!” They came out of the fire. 27The satraps, prefects, governors, and king’s high officials gathered around and saw that the fire hadn’t burned their bodies, singed their hair, or scorched their clothes; and there wasn’t any burnt smell on them.

28Nebuchaznezzar said,

“Bless Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego’s God. He sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him. They set aside my command and yielded up their bodies not to serve or worship any god but their own. 29So I decree that any people, nation, or language group that says anything offensive about their God will be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to trash piles. No other god that can deliver like that.”

30The king advanced them even more in the province of Babylon.	Dan 3:26-30

Nebuchadnezzar Praises God

4:1King Nebuchadnezzar to the peoples, nations, and language groups that live all over the empire:

“Peace and prosperity!

2It has seemed good to me to tell about the signs and wonders the Most High God has done for me.

3How great his signs,

how amazing his wonders!

His kingdom’s eternal,

his dominion’s forever!

Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream About a Tree

4I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house,

living in prosperity in my palace. 	Dan 4:1-4

5A dream terrified me;

fantasies and visions alarmed me.

6So I ordered the wise men in Babylon

to come and explain what the dream meant.

7The magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers came.

I told them the dream,

but they couldn’t interpret it.

8But finally Daniel (named Belteshazzar after my god),

who has the spirit of the holy gods, came in,

and I told him the dream,

9‘Belteshazzar, chief magician,

since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you

and no mystery baffles you,

tell me what I was looking at

and what it means. 					Dan 4:5-9

10I was in bed

when I saw a really tall tree in the middle of the country.

11It had grown tall and strong,

as high as the sky,

and visible all over the world.

12Its leaves were beautiful,

its fruit abundant,

enough for everyone.

Animals in the pasture lived in its shade;

birds in the sky roosted in it;

everyone fed themselves from it.	Dan 4:10-12

13As I kept watching, an angel watcher, a holy one,

came down from the sky 14and shouted,

“Chop it down and cut off its limbs;

strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.

Let the animals run from under it

and the birds fly from its branches.

15But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,

with an iron-bronze band around it

in the new grass of the pasture.

Let him be wet with the dew from the sky

and share the grass with the animals.

16Let his mind change from a man’s to an animal’s mind

for seven periods of time.

17This sentence is by the angel watchers’ decree

a command from the holy ones

so the living can know

that it’s the Most High who rules the human realm,

gives it to the one his chooses,

and sets over it the lowliest of men.”	Dan 4:13-17

18That’s the dream I had. Tell me what it means, Belteshazzar. None of the wise men in my kingdom can do it. You can; you have the spirit of the holy gods in you.’

Daniel Interprets the Second Dream

19Daniel was distressed for a while as his thoughts about the meaning of the dream alarmed him.

The king said, ‘Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its meaning alarm you.’

Belteshazzar answered,

‘If only the dream applied to those who hate you,

and its meaning applied to your enemies, my lord!

20The tree you saw that grew tall and strong,

as high as the sky

and visible all over the world,

21whose leaves were beautiful

and its fruit abundant,

enough for everybody,

that animals in the pasture lived under,

whose branches birds roosted in—

22that’s you, O King.

You’ve grown tall and strong;

your majesty has become great

and reached the sky;

you exercise dominion everywhere. 			Dan 4:18-22

23The angel watcher you saw,

a holy one, came down from the sky and shouted,

“Chop down the tree and destroy it;

but leave the stump with its roots in the ground

with an iron-bronze band around it

in the new grass in the pasture.

Let him be wet with the dew from the sky

and share grass with wild animals

till seven periods of time pass.”

24That means it’s a decree by the Most High

that will happen to you:

25you’ll be driven from society

and live with the animals in the pasture.

You’ll eat grass like a cow

and be wet with the dew from the sky.

Seven periods of time will pass

till you recognize

that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm

and gives it to the one he chooses.			Dan 4:23-25

26The stump with its roots means

you’ll receive your empire back

after you recognize that heaven rules.

27So, O King, may my advice please you:

break away now from your sins by doing good,

from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor,

in case your prosperity can continue.”		Dan 4:26-27

The Dream’s Fulfillment

28“That all happened to Nebuchadnezzar. 29A year later, he was walking on his palace roof in Babylon 30an saying, ‘Isn’t this Babylon the Great that I’ve built as a royal residence by my power and splendor?’ 31While he was still saying it, a voice from heaven said, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, you’ve lost your sovereignty.

32You’ll be driven from society

and live with the animals in the pasture.

You’ll eat grass like a cow,

for seven periods of time

till you recognize

that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm

and gives it to the one he chooses.’

33At once it happened.

He was driven from society

and began to eat grass like a cow.

His body was wet from dew

till his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers

and his nails like birds’ claws.	Dan 4:28-33

Nebuchadnezzar Restored

34“But when that was past, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to the sky, my sanity came back, and I praised and honored the Most High who lives forever.

His rule is everlasting;

his kingdom continues to all generations.

35All people on earth amount to nothing,

but he does what he decides in the host of heaven

and among people on earth.

Nobody can shove his hand away

or say, ‘What are you doing?’

36“At the same time as my sanity returned,

my majesty and splendor came back to me

for the glory of my empire;

my advisors and nobles began to trust me,

so I was secure again in my sovereignty

and became greater than before.

37Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,

praise, lift up, and honor the King of heaven;

because everything he does is true,

his ways are just,

and he can humble the arrogant.” 	Dan 4:34-37

The Handwriting on the Wall

5:1King Belshazzar held a huge feast for 1,000 of his nobles and drank wine with them. 2While he was tasting the wine, he sent for the gold and silver items his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple in Jerusalem. 3The king, his nobles, wives, and concubines drank out of them, 4and praised their idols made out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

5All of a sudden, the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and started writing on the plaster wall across from the lampstand. The king could see the back of the hand as it wrote. 6His face grew pale with terror, his hip joints went slack, his knees knocked. 7He shouted for his conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. He told the wise men in Babylon, “Anybody that can read this inscription and tell me what it means will dress in purple, wear a gold chain around his neck, and be third in the empire.” 8His wise men came in, but they couldn’t read it or explain what it meant. 9He was scared, his face grew more pale, and his nobles were baffled.	 Dan 5:1-9

10When the queen heard about what the king and his nobles said, she came in the banquet hall,

“Long live the King! Don’t let your imagination run away with you or your face go pale. 11There’s a man in your kingdom that has the spirit of the holy gods. In your predecessor’s time, he showed enlightenment, insight, and wisdom like the gods have. King Nebuchadnezzar appointed him chief of magicians, conjurers, astrologers, and fortunetellers. 12That was because this Daniel—that the king named Belteshazzar—had a special spirit, knowledge, insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas, and solving of difficult problems. Call him; he’ll tell you what the inscription means.”	 Dan 5:10-12

Daniel Interprets the Handwriting

13They brought Daniel in, and he asked him,

“Are you the Daniel that’s among the exiles from Judah my predecessor brought back? 14I’ve heard you have the spirit of the gods in you and you have insight, understanding, and extraordinary wisdom. 15I’ve just now brought in the wise men and conjurers to read this inscription and interpret it, but they can’t do it. 16I’ve heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read the inscription and tell me what it means, you’ll dress in purple, wear a gold chain around your neck, and be third in the empire.” 	Dan 5:13-16

17Daniel said,

“Keep your gifts or give your rewards to someone else, but I’ll read the inscription and tell you what it means. 18O King, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, honor, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar. 19Because of his grandeur, the peoples, nations, and language groups trembled in front of him. He executed or spared, elevated or demoted anybody he wanted to. 20But his heart and spirit became so proud that he acted out his arrogance. He was deposed, and his honor was taken away. 21He was driven away from society, and his mind became like an animal’s mind. He lived with wild donkeys and ate grass like a cow. His body was wet from dew till he recognized that it’s the Most High that rules the human realm and appoints over it whoever he chooses. 22Yet you, a successor of his, Belshazzar, haven’t humbled yourself, even though you knew that. 23You’ve raised yourself against the Lord of heaven by bringing in the vessels from his Temple. You, your nobles, wives, and concubines have been drinking wine out of them and praising gods made out of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that can’t see, hear, or understand. But you haven’t honored the God that holds your life-breath and destiny in his hand. 24-25He has sent the hand that wrote this inscription: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’

Dan 5:17-25

26It means:

‘MENE’: God has ‘numbered’ the time for your reign and ended it.

27‘TEKEL’: you’ve been ‘weighed’ on the scales and found wanting.

28‘PEREZ’: your empire has been ‘divided’ and given to the Medes and Persians.”

29Belshazzar gave orders to dress Daniel in a purple robe, put a gold chain around his neck, and proclaim him third in the empire. 30That night Belshazzar the Babylonian king was killed, 31and Darius the Mede took over the empire at about age 62.	 Dan 5:26-30

Daniel in the Lions’ Den

6:1King Darius thought it good to appoint 120 satraps to oversee the empire. 2He put three commissioners over them. (Daniel was one of them.) The satraps would report to them, and they would protect the king’s interests. 3Daniel soon distinguished himself among the satraps and other commissioners because he had exceptional ability. The king planned to appoint him over the whole empire. 4Then the commissioners and satraps tried to find some grounds for accusing him of mismanaging government affairs, but they couldn’t find any evidence of corruption. He was dependable, and they couldn’t find him negligent. 5They said, “We won’t find any grounds for accusing him unless it’s in connection with the Law of his god.”     	Dan 6:1-5

6They went to the king together and said,

“Long live King Darius! 7The commissioners, prefects and satraps, high officials and governors have agreed that you should enforce a statute that anybody who asks for anything from any mortal or god but you for 30 days will be thrown in the lions’ den. 8Now, establish the injunction and sign the document so it can’t be revoked—like the law of the Medes and Persians.”

9So Darius signed the injunction.

10When Daniel found out he’d signed it, he went home. In his roof room with windows open toward Jerusalem, he continued to kneel three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God. 11Those men came to his house together and found him making petition to his God; 12so they went to the king, “Didn’t you sign an injunction that anybody who asks anything from any mortal or god besides you for 30 days would be thrown into the lions’ den?”

He said, “It’s true; the law of the Medes and Persians can’t be revoked.”

13They answered, “Daniel, an exile from Judah, is not honoring your injunction. He keeps praying to his God three times a day.”	  Dan 6:6-13

14When the king heard it, he was deeply distressed and tried all day to figure out some way to rescue Daniel. 15Then those men came back and said, “You know, O King, it’s the law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute the king makes can be revoked.”

16So he gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. He told Daniel, “The God you constantly serve will deliver you himself.” 17They brought a stone and laid it over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his signet ring and his nobles’ signet rings so nothing could be changed. 18He spent the night in his palace fasting. No entertainment was brought to him, and he couldn’t sleep.	 Dan 6:14-18

19He got up at dawn and hurried to the lions’ den. 20Worried, he called out, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has the God you constantly serve, delivered you from the lions?”

21Daniel said,

“Long live the King! 22My God sent his angel and shut their mouths. They haven’t hurt me because he considered me innocent. I haven’t committed any crime against you either.”

23The king was really relieved and had him brought up out of the den. They didn’t find any injury on him because he’d trusted in his God. 24The king ordered the men to be brought who had maliciously accused Daniel, and threw them, their children, and wives into the den. They hadn’t hit the den floor before the lions pounced on them and crushed their bones.

Dan 6:19-24

25Then Darius wrote to the peoples, nations, and language groups in the empire:

“Peace and prosperity!

26I decree that in all my kingdom, people tremble in fear before Daniel’s God.

He’s the living God that endures forever;

his kingdom will never be destroyed;

his rule will never end.

27He delivers and rescues, and performs signs and wonders

on earth and in the sky—

and delivered Daniel from the lions.”

28So Daniel enjoyed success during the regency of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

Dan 6:25-28

Daniel’s Vision of the Four Beasts

7:1Previously, in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream while he was in bed. He wrote down this summary of it:

2“During the night I had a vision. Four winds were churning up the Mediterranean Sea, 3and four different beasts emerged from it.

4The first was like a lion with wings like an eagle. As I watched, its wings were pulled off, and it was made to stand on its two hind legs like a human being and receive a human mind.

5A second beast resembling a bear came up. It was rearing up on one side and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. They told it, ‘Go ahead and gorge on many people!’

6As I continued to watch, another beast came up, like a leopard with four heads and with four wings on its back; it received authority.

7Then a fourth beast came up, dreadful, terrifying, very strong with big iron teeth. It devoured, crushed, and tramped down its victims’ remains. It wasn’t like the other beasts and had ten horns.   	Dan 7:1-7

The Ancient of Days Reigns

8“While I was thinking about its horns, a little horn grew up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots in its presence. This horn had eyes like a human and a mouth that bragged.

9I kept watching and thrones were set,

and the Ancient of Days took his seat.

His clothes were white like snow;

his hair was like clean wool.

He sat on a fiery throne

with wheels of blazing fire.

10A molten river was flowing out from him.

Thousands upon thousands attended him;

millions upon millions stood in front of him.

Court began to hold session,

and the books were opened.				        Dan 7:8-10

The Son of Man Receives Dominion

11“I kept watching because the horn kept bragging. The beast was killed, and its body thrown into the blazing fire and destroyed. 12The other beasts had their authority revoked, but they were allowed to live for a season and a time longer.

13“I kept watching the vision.

One like a son of man was coming

with the clouds in the sky.

He approached the Ancient of Days,

led into his presence.

14He received dominion, honor, and a kingdom

so all peoples, nations, and language groups would serve him.

His dominion was eternal;

his kingdom would never be destroyed. 	Dan 7:11-14

The Vision Interpreted

15“The vision troubled me. 16I went to one of those standing nearby and asked what it meant. He told me, 17‘Those four huge beasts are kings that will arise in the world. 18But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and have it for all ages to come.’ 19I wanted to know what the fourth beast meant. It was different from the others and very dreadful with its iron teeth and bronze talons; it ate up, crushed, and tramped the others down. 20I wanted to know what the ten horns meant and the other horn that grew up, that the three horns fell in front of—the horn that had eyes, a bragging mouth, and bigger size than the others. 21As I watched, that horn fought the holy people and overpowered them. 22Then the Ancient of Days came and rendered judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came for them to take over the kingdom.		  Dan 7:15-22

23“He said, ‘The fourth beast will be a kingdom that’s different from the others. It will devastate the whole world, tramp it down, and crush it. 24The ten horns in that kingdom are ten kings. Another, different kind of king will rise up after them and overthrow them. 25He’ll defy the Most High and oppress his holy people. He’ll try to change their festival cycle and their laws, and they’ll be delivered to him for a time, times, and half a time. 26But the court will sit in judgment and take away, annihilate, and destroy his power permanently. 27Then the holy people of the Most High will receive the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve him.’

28“The revelation ended. My thoughts scared me, and my face grew pale. I kept the matter to myself.”	 Dan 7:23-28

Daniel’s Vision of the Ram and the Goat

8:1In the third year of Belshazzar’s regency, I, Daniel, had another vision. 2I was in Susa the capital, in the province Elam beside the Ulai Canal. 3I looked up and saw a ram with two horns standing by the canal. The horns were long, one longer than the other even though the longer one had grown up last. 4The ram was butting west, north, and south. No other animals could stand up to it, and nobody could rescue anyone from it. It did what it pleased and became great. 			Dan 8:1-4

5A male goat was coming from the west across the earth without touching the ground. It had a conspicuous horn between its eyes. 6It came toward the ram that was by the canal and rushed at him in powerful fury. 7It butted the ram and broke off its two horns. The ram wasn’t strong enough to resist it; so it slammed the ram to the ground and tramped on it. 8The male goat promoted itself highly. But as soon as it got powerful, its big horn broke, and in its place four conspicuous horns sprouted up in four directions. 	Dan 8:5-8

9A little horn came up out of one of them and grew very big toward the south, east, and the Glorious Land. 10It grew up to the stars, knocked some of them to earth, and tramped on them. 11It even promoted itself against the Commander of the host, canceled the daily sacrifice to him, and tore down his sanctuary. 12Because of sin, the army will be given over to the horn along with the daily sacrifice. The horn will dash truth to the ground and do whatever it wants to. 13Then I heard a holy one speaking and another one answering,

“How long will the vision last about the regular sacrifice while sin causes horror, so that the holy place and the army both get overrun?”

14He told me, “For 2,300 mornings and evenings. Then the holy place will be restored to its rightful position.”	Dan 8:9-14

Gabriel Interprets the Vision

15When I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was trying to understand it, one that looked like a man was standing in front of me. 16I heard a man between the banks of Ulai call out, “Gabriel, tell him what the vision means.” 17So he came closer, and I fell on my face in fear. But he said, “Son of man, the vision deals with the end of time.” 18While he was talking to me, I fainted facedown on the ground, but he took hold of me and stood me up. 19He said,

“I’m letting you know what will happen at the end of indignation; it deals with the appointed end of time. 20The ram you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia. 21The shaggy goat represents Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is its first king. 22The broken horn and the four horns that came up in place of it represent four kingdoms that will grow out of his nation, though not with his power. 23Toward the end of their rule, when sinners have become extreme, a king will rise up insolent, adept at intrigue, 24and very powerful. He’ll cause extraordinary destruction and do whatever he wants to. He’ll destroy powerful men and the holy people. 25Through his shrewdness, he’ll make deceit succeed by his influence. He’ll honor himself in his own mind and destroy many by surprise. He’ll even oppose the Prince of princes and be broken without human agency. 26The vision about the mornings and evenings is real; but keep it to yourself because it deals with the distant future.”

27I lay sick and drained for several days. Then I got up to carry on the king’s business, but the vision kept troubling me, and nobody came to explain it to me.	Dan 8:15-27

9:1The First Year of Darius Son of Ahasuerus,

a Mede by Birth, King of the Babylonians

Daniel’s Prayer for His People

2I, Daniel, read in the scroll that the LORD had set 70 years for Jerusalem to lie in ruins, as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet. 3So I turned my attention to the Lord God and looked to him in prayer with fasting, burlap, and ashes. 4I confessed,         	 Dan 9:1-4a

“LORD, great awesome God that keeps covenant and enduring love for those who love you and keep your commandments, 5we’ve sinned, we’ve committed iniquity, we’ve acted sinfully and rebelled, we’ve turned away from your commandments and ordinances. 6We’ve ignored your prophets who spoke in your name to our kings, our officials, our ancestors, and the common people. 7You’re good, but we’re openly shameful—people of Judah, Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far in all the countries where you’ve driven us for our unfaithfulness. [8] 9You have mercy and forgiveness although we’ve rebelled, 10haven’t obeyed, haven’t followed the laws your prophets set before us. 11Because Israel has sinned against your Law and turned aside from obeying you, you’ve poured out on us and our rulers the curse you swore in the Law of Moses. 12You’ve confirmed what you said by bringing this catastrophe on us. Nothing under heaven has ever been done like what you’ve done to Jerusalem. 13This catastrophe has come on us, but we still haven’t sought your blessing by paying attention to your truth. 14So you’ve brought on us the catastrophe you held in store. You’re good in everything you do, but we still haven’t obeyed you. 15Lord our God who brought a people out of Egypt with a powerful hand and made a permanent name for yourself, we’ve sinned; we’ve been wicked. 16In keeping with all your righteous acts, turn your anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Our ancestors’ iniquities and our own sins have made Jerusalem and your people a byword to everybody around us. 17So listen to my prayer and supplication. For your honor, smile on your desolate sanctuary. 18Turn your ear and listen; open your eyes and look at the city and our desolation. We’re not presenting our supplication because we have any merits, but because you have great mercy. 19Lord, listen! forgive! do something! don’t delay! It’s your name the city and your people are wearing!     	Dan 9:4b-19

The Seventy-Week Prophecy

20While I was praying—confessing my sin and my people’s sin before the LORD my God on behalf of his holy mountain—21the man Gabriel that I’d seen at the beginning, came to me in my exhaustion about the time of the evening offering. 22He instructed me,

“Daniel, I’ve come to inform you. 23When you began your supplications, a decree went out. I’m here to tell you about it because you’re highly valued. Listen so you can understand the vision.

24“Seventy sets of seven [hebdomads] have been decreed for your people and your holy city. That’s to end sin, to atone for iniquity, to bring everlasting goodness, to fulfill prophetic vision, to anoint a most holy place. 25Understand that from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem till Messiah the Prince will be 7 sevens plus 62 sevens [hebdomads]. It will be rebuilt with streets and a moat in a stressful time. 26Then after 62 sevens, Messiah will be killed and have nothing, and the army of the ruler that will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will come with a flood. To the end there’ll be war with desolations decreed. 27He’ll make a firm treaty with many for one set of seven [hebdomad]. In the middle of that set of seven, he’ll stop sacrifice and grain offering. As a result of his abominations, he will pour out total desolation—with destruction in turn decreed on the one that caused the desolation.”	Dan 9:20-27

Daniel’s Vision of a Messenger

10:1The third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a message came to Daniel (Belteshazzar) about great warfare. He understood that the vision was about future events.

2At that time, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three weeks. 3I didn’t eat any tasty food or meat, drink any wine, or use any lotions that whole time. 4The twenty-fourth of the first month, I was on the bank of the Tigris River. 5I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of pure gold from Uphaz around his waist. 6His body was like beryl, his face flashed like lightning, his eyes flamed like torches, his arms and feet shined like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like an enormous crowd. 7I was the only one that saw the vision, but such an overwhelming sense of dread came over the men that were with me that they ran and hid. 8So I was alone. My strength was gone, and my healthy appearance grew deathly pale. 9When I heard him start to speak, I passed out facedown on the ground.			        	        Dan 10:1-9

10A hand took hold of me and helped me up shaking onto my hands and knees. 11He said, “Daniel, man highly esteemed, understand what I’m about to tell you. Stand up; I’ve been sent to you.”

I stood up shaking.

12“Don’t be afraid. You’ve been heard from the first day you determined to understand this and humble yourself before your God. I’ve come in answer to what you’ve said. 13The prince of Persia resisted me for two days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I’d been left there with the kings of Persia. 14Now I’ve come to let you understand what will happen to your people later. The vision deals with the future.” 	Dan 10:10-14

15When he said that, I looked down at the ground speechless. 16Someone resembling a man touched my lips, and I said to the one standing in front of me,

“Sir, I’m in anguish over the vision. 17How can a servant like me talk to someone like you? I feel drained. I can hardly breathe.”

18He touched me to encourage me, 19“Man highly esteemed, you needn’t be afraid. Be at peace, take courage!” 	Dan 10:15-18

As soon as he spoke, my strength came back, and I said, “Go ahead and speak; you’ve strengthened me.”

20He said, “Do you understand why I’ve come? I’m going back now to fight the prince of Persia. The prince of Greece is coming, 21but I’ll tell you what’s inscribed in the Book of Truth. There’s nobody standing firmly with me against those forces except Michael your prince. 11:1In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to encourage and protect him. 	Dan 10:19-11:1

Kings of the North and South

2“Three more kings will come to power in Persia. A fourth will gain far more wealth than the others. As soon as he gains power by his wealth, he’ll stir up the empire against Greece. 3A strong king will come to power there and rule as he pleases. 4But not long after he ascends to power, his kingdom will break up into the four points of the compass. It won’t pass on to heirs or continue with the authority he exercised. His sovereignty will cease and pass on to others than descendants.

5“Then the king of the South will grow strong along with one of his commanders. But his commander will gain more power than he has and obtain a large kingdom of his own.

6After some years they’ll form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will be given to the king of the North to make a marriage alliance. But she won’t retain her influence there. She and her father won’t last, and they’ll be given up along with her attendants and supporters.	Dan 11:2-6

7“In those times, one of her relatives in the South will come to power in her place, attack the king of the North, enter his fortress, and defeat him. 8He’ll carry off their idols to Egypt, their molten images, their precious gold and silver items. For some years he’ll refrain from attacking the king of the North. 9Then the latter will invade the realm of the king of the South, but he’ll soon go back to his own land.

10“But the sons of the king of the North will gather a group of large forces and wage war. They’ll keep on coming, overrun, pass through, and carry the war as far as his fortress. 11Then the king of the South will be angry and go to fight the king of the North. The latter will raise a large army, but he’ll fall to the other. 12When the enemy army is defeated, the king of the South will get proud and execute thousands, but he won’t prevail for long. 13The king of the North will raise a bigger army than before; and after some years, he’ll press on with that large army and lots of equipment.        	Dan 11:7-13

14“In those times, there’ll be an uprising against the king of the South. Violent men among your people will also lift themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they’ll fall. 15Then the king of the North will come, throw up a siege mound, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South won’t have the strength to stand their ground, not even their best troops. 16The one that comes against him will do as he pleases, and nobody will be able to withstand him. He’ll stay for a time in the Glorious Land and control it. 17He’ll be determined to come with the power of his whole kingdom and to bring a proposal for peace that he’ll put into effect. He’ll give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow the kingdom from within, but she won’t take a stand for him. 18Then he’ll turn his attention to the coastland and capture many cities. But a commander will put a stop to his insolence and repay him for it. 19So he’ll take refuge in the fortresses in his own land, but he’ll stumble and fall and fall out of the picture. 	Dan 11:14-19

20“Then in his place one will rise up and send a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. Yet within a short time he’ll die, though not in anger or in battle. 21In his place a despicable man will come to power who isn’t in line for royal succession. He’ll come in peace time and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 22He’ll sweep away armies, including the prince of the covenant. 23After he makes various alliances, he’ll act deceitfully and seize power with a small force. 24Without warning he’ll enter the richest parts of the realm and accomplish what his predecessors had never done. He’ll distribute plunder, booty, and possessions among them. He’ll plot against fortresses, but only for a while. 25He’ll stir up his courage against the king of the South with a large army. So the king of the South will mobilize a very big army, but he won’t stand because there’ll be plots against him. 26The members of his own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be slain. 27Both kings will be intent on evil and lie to each other at the conference table; but to no avail because the end will come at the appointed time.

28The king of the South will head for home with considerable substance. On the way, he’ll set himself against the people of the holy covenant, and do a lot of damage before going on back to his own land.	Dan 11:20-28

29“At the appointed time, he’ll invade the South again, but this time it won’t turn out like before. 30Ships from Kittim will attack him. He’ll retreat and take his out anger on the people of the holy covenant. So he’ll come and listen to the ones that forsake the holy covenant. 31His army will defile the Temple fortress, forbid the daily burnt offering, and set up the abomination that makes desolate. 32By flattery he’ll turn to godlessness those who’ve violated the covenant, but the people that know their God will stay strong and resist him. 33Wise leaders among the people will instruct many, though they’ll fall by flame and sword, be captured and robbed. 34They’ll receive little help, and many who do join them won’t be sincere. 35Some of the wise will fall victim to persecution as a means of refining and cleansing them, making them pure till the time of the end, because the appointed time is still to come. 	Dan 11:29-35

36“The king will do as he pleases, put himself above every god, and blaspheme the God of gods. He’ll succeed till the time of wrath is over because what’s been decreed will happen. 37He won’t show any regard for the gods of his ancestors, for any god women favor, or for any other god. He’ll magnify himself above them all. 38Instead, he’ll honor the god of fortresses, a god his ancestors never knew. He’ll honor him with gold, silver, costly gems, and costly gifts. 39He’ll attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god, and greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He’ll make them rulers over many people and parcel out land among them as their reward.	Dan 11:36-39

40“Toward the end of Israel’s time, the king of the South will attack him, and the king of the North will storm out against him like a tornado with chariots, cavalry, and a large navy. He’ll invade various lands and overrun them. 41He’ll enter the Glorious Land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and most of Ammon will escape. 42Then he’ll attack still other countries, including Egypt. 43He’ll gain control of Egypt’s precious treasures, its gold and silver, Libyans and Nubians will become his subjects. 44But alarming news will come from the east and north, and he’ll go out with great fury to exterminate many. 45He’ll pitch his royal pavilion between the sea and the beautiful Holy Mountain. Yet he’ll come to his end, and nobody will help him.   	Dan 11:40-45

The Time of the End

12:1“At that time, Michael, the great prince that guards your people, will rise up. There’ll be a distressful time like nothing since nations began. Everyone among your people who are written in the scroll will be rescued. 2Many asleep in their graves will wake up, some to eternal life, some to disgrace and eternal contempt. 3The wise will shine as bright as the sky, including those who lead many to goodness—like the stars forever. 4Close up this message, Daniel, and seal the scroll till the time of the end. People will travel everywhere and spread knowledge.”	Dan 12:1-4

5Then I saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river. 6One asked the man dressed in linen, who was above the river, “How long will it be till those distressful events end?” 7The man raised his hands toward the sky and swore by the One that lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. And as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, those things will come to an end. 8I heard it, but I couldn’t understand it. So I asked, “How will those things end up?”               	Dan 12:5-8

9He said,

“Go on with your life, Daniel. Those things are secret, sealed up till the time of the end. 10Many will purify themselves, make themselves white, and be refined. The wicked won’t understand, but the wise will. 11There will be 1,290 days between the time the daily sacrifice stops and the abomination that makes desolate is set up. 12How fortunate they are who persevere to the end of the 1,335 days! 13Live out the rest of your life. You’ll enter into rest and rise again for your reward at the end of the age.”	 Dan 12:9-13

HOSEA

1:1Messages from the LORD to Hosea Son of Beeri

at the Time of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah,

and Jeroboam Son of Joash/Jehoash, King of Israel

Hosea’s Wife and Children

2When the LORD spoke the first time through Hosea, he said, “Marry a prostitute and have children, because the land is committing flagrant prostitution by abandoning me.” 3So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she had a son. 4The LORD said,

“Name him Jezreel. Soon I’ll punish Jehu’s dynasty for the bloodshed in Jezreel, and put an end to Israel. 5At that time, I’ll break Israel’s military strength in the Valley of ‘Jezreel.’”	Hos 1:1-5

6Then she had a daughter. The LORD told him,

“Name her Lo-ruhamah. I ‘won’t have mercy’ any more on Israel by forgiving them. 7But I will have mercy on Judah and deliver them, but not by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”

8When she’d weaned Lo-ruhamah, she had another son. 9The LORD said, “Name him Lo-ammi. You’re ‘not my people,’ and I’m not your God.

10Yet the number of Israelites

will be like sand by the sea,

that you can’t measure or count.

Where I said, ‘You’re not my people,’

I’ll say, ‘You’re children of the living God.’

11Then Judah and Israel will unite

and appoint one leader.

They’ll return from the exile together

because the day of Jezreel [sowing] will be great.” 	Hos 1:6-11

Israel’s Unfaithfulness Punished

2:1“In that day, you will call your brothers ‘Ammi’ [my people]

and your sisters ‘Ruhamah’ [the ones loved].’

2But for now, bring charges against your mother Israel

because she’s not my wife

and I’m not her husband.

Let her put away her prostitution,

the adultery from between her breasts.

3Otherwise, I’ll strip her naked

and expose her like the day she was born.

I’ll make her like a wilderness, like a desert;

she’ll die of thirst.

4I won’t have mercy on her children;

they’re children from prostitution.		Hos 2:1-4

5Their mother was a prostitute;

it was a shame the way she acted.

She said, ‘I’ll go after my lovers

that gave me bread and water,

wool and linen, olive oil and drink.’

6So I’ll plant thornbushes along the sides of her road

and build a wall across her path

so she can’t get to where she wants to go.

7She’ll chase after her lovers, but not catch them;

she’ll look for them, but not find them.

So she’ll say, ‘I’ll go back to my first husband,

because it was better for me then than now!’

8She doesn’t know I was the one

that gave her grain, new wine, and olive oil;

and lavished on her silver and gold—

which she used for Baal.		Hos 2:5-8

9So I’ll take back my grain at harvest time

and my new wine when it’s due.

I’ll take away the wool and linen

I gave her to cover her nakedness.

10I’ll uncover her lewdness

in front of her lovers,

and nobody will rescue her from me.

11I’ll put an end to her gaiety,

her festivals, new moons, Sabbaths,

and festive assemblies.

12I’ll destroy her grapevines and fig trees

that she claimed were

the pay her lovers gave her.

I’ll make them a thicket

where only wild animals can eat.

13I’ll punish her for the times when she was

offering sacrifices to the images of Baal,

adorning herself with earrings and jewelry,

following her lovers,

and forgetting about me,” 	the LORD says.	 Hos 2:9-13

The LORD’s Mercy on Israel

14“So I’ll win her back,

bring her into the desert,

and speak graciously to her.

15I’ll give her vineyards there

and the Valley of Achor as a gateway to hope.

She’ll sing there like she did when she was young,

when she first came up from Egypt.

16She’ll call me ‘Ishi’ [my husband], not ‘Baali’ [my lord].

17I’ll take the many names of Baal out of her mouth;

she won’t mention them anymore.		Hos 2:14-17

18I’ll make a treaty for her with the animals in the field,

the birds in the sky, and what crawls on the ground.

I’ll banish bow, sword, and war from the land

so she can lie down in safety.

19I’ll engage her to me permanently

in goodness, justice, and 20faithfulness.

Then she’ll know the LORD.

21At that time, I’ll answer the sky

that pleads for rain,

that will answer the earth,

22that will answer the grain, new wine, and olive oil

that will answer, ‘God has sown’ [Jezreel].

23I’ll ‘sow’ her for myself in the land

and have mercy on her that hadn’t received mercy.

I’ll say to those who weren’t my people,

‘You’re my people [Ammi]!’

and they’ll say, ‘You’re my God [Elohai]!’”		Hos 2:18-23

Hosea’s Wife Redeemed

3:1Then the LORD told me, “Go love your wife again even though she’s an adulteress—like I love Israel though it turns to other gods and loves raisin cakes.” 2So I bought her for 6 oz 15 shekels of silver and 5 bushels a lethek of barley. 3I told her, “You’ll have to stay with me a long time. You won’t carry on prostitution or belong to another man. I’ll be that way with you too.” 4That’s because the people in Israel will go a long time without king or prince, sacrifice or sacred pillar, ephod or household idols. 5Then they’ll come back and rely on the LORD their God and David their king. They’ll come cringing to the LORD and to his goodness in the end.    	 Hos 3:1-5

The LORD Accuses Israel

4:1Israel, listen to the LORD’s message;

he’s filing charges against you:

“There’s no faithfulness, kindness,

or awareness of God there.

2There’s swearing, deception, murder, stealing, and adultery;

they use violence, so there’s murder after murder.

3So the land is in mourning.

Everybody that lives in it is wasting away,

along with the animals in the field

and the birds in the sky;

even the fish are disappearing.”		Hos 4:1-3

4“But don’t anybody point a finger at somebody else;

I’m suing you priests.

5You’ll stumble in the daytime;

prophets will stumble with you at night;

I’ll destroy your mother Israel.

6My people are getting destroyed because they don’t know me.

Since you priests have refused to know me,

I’ll refuse to acknowledge you as my priests.

Since you’ve forgotten about my Law,

I’ll forget about your children.

7The more priests there are, the more they sin against me;

I’ll turn their honor into shame. 				Hos 4:4-7

8“They feed on my people’s sin

because their sacrifices for it

mean more food for the priests!

9It will be, like people like priest;

I’ll punish them for their ways,

repay them for their deeds.

10They’ll eat, but not have enough;

they’ll carry on prostitution, but won’t gain anything by it,

because they’ve stopped listening to the LORD.

11Prostitution, wine, and new wine

have robbed my people of understanding.		Hos 4:8-11

12“My people consult their wooden idols;

their fortunetellers toss sticks to give them oracles.

A spirit of prostitution has led them astray;

they’ve carried on prostitution by leaving their God.

13They offer sacrifices to idols on mountaintops

and burn incense on hills

under oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees,

because they make pleasant shade.

That’s why your daughters become prostitutes

and your brides commit adultery.

14I won’t punish their daughters when they carry on prostitution

or their brides when they commit adultery,

because you men visit prostitutes

and offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes;

so you foolish people will be ruined. 			Hos 4:12-14

15“Though you carry on prostitution, Israel,

don’t draw Judah into your guilt.

Don’t go to Gilgal or up to Beth-aven [Bethel];

don’t swear, ‘As sure as the LORD lives!’

16Israel is like a stubborn heifer;

so how can the LORD feed it like a lamb in the pasture?

17Leave Ephraim alone

because she carries on idolatry.

18When their rulers are done drinking,

they go visit prostitutes;

they have no shame whatsoever.

19The wind will carry them off;

their altars will bring them disgrace.		Hos 4:15-19

Judgment Against Israel’s Leaders

5:1“Hear this, priests!

Pay attention, Israel!

Listen, family of the king!

Your idolatry at Mizpah has set a trap

and cast a net on Tabor.

2You rebels have gone deep in slaughter,

but I’ll punish you all for it.

3I know what you’re doing, Ephraim;

you can’t hide from me, Israel.

Ephraim, you’ve left me like a prostitute;

Israel, you’ve defiled yourself.

4Your deeds keep you from coming back to me.

You’re totally a prostitute;

you don’t know the LORD.		Hos 5:1-4

5“Israel’s arrogance testifies against him;

Israel and Ephraim stumble under the weight of their guilt;

Judah stumbles with them.

6They’ll go with their flocks and herds

to seek the LORD, but they won’t find him;

he’s withdrawn from them.

7They’ve dealt deviously with the LORD

because they’ve borne illegitimate children.

Now the new moon will devour them along with their fields.

Hos 5:5-7

8“Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah;

blow the bugle in Ramah.

Sound an alarm at Beth-aven:

cringe, Benjamin!

9Ephraim will become a pile of rubble when he’s rebuked;

that’s for certain.

10Judah’s officials are like people that remove landmarks;

I’ll pour out my anger on them like a waterfall.

11Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed in condemnation,

because he was determined to follow vanity.

12So I’ll be like a moth in Ephraim,

like rot in Judah.

13“When Ephraim saw his sickness

and Judah saw his wound,

Ephraim went to Assyria;

he sent for King Jareb.

But he can’t heal you

or cure you from your wound.

14I’ll be like a lion to Ephraim,

like a young lion to Judah.

I’ll tear them to pieces

and take them away;

nobody will rescue them.

15I’ll go back to my place

till they admit their guilt and turn to me;

when trouble comes,

they’ll earnestly rely on me.”				Hos 5:8-15

Israel and Judah Unrepentant

6:1“They’ll say, ‘Let’s return to the LORD.

He has torn us, but he’ll heal us;

he has wounded us, but he’ll bandage us up.

2He’ll revive us in two days

and raise us up the third,

so we can live in his presence.

3So let’s press on to know the LORD.

He’ll respond to us as sure as dawn comes;

he’ll come to us like rain,

like spring rain that waters the ground.’ 		Hos 6:1-3

4“What am I going to do with you, Ephraim,

or with you, Judah?

Your loyalty is like a morning cloud,

like dew that evaporates early.

5I’ve cut both of you up in pieces by the prophets;

I’ve slain you with my words;

the condemnations on you are as inescapable as light.

6I delight in loyalty more than sacrifice,

in knowing me more than in burnt offerings.

7Like Adam you’ve broken covenant

and dealt deceitfully with me.

8“Gilead is a city of sinners,

tracked with bloody footprints.

9Like raiders waiting for victims,

a band of priests commits murder on the way to Shechem

and every shameful crime imaginable.

10I’ve seen a horrible thing in Israel:

Ephraim’s prostitution, Israel’s self-defilement.

11Judah, I’ve appointed a harvest time for you

when I restore my people’s fortunes.		Hos 6:4-11

7:1“When I would heal Israel,

Ephraim’s sin gets uncovered,

Samaria’s evil deeds as well,

because they’re devious.

Thieves go inside;

bandits raid outside.

2They don’t realize

that I remember their sinfulness.

Their deeds are all around them;

they’re right in front of me. 				Hos 7:1-2

3“They entertain the king with their sinfulness,

and the officials laugh at their lies.

4They’re adulterers,

like an oven heated by bakers

that keep the fire going

from the kneading of the dough till it’s risen.

5On our king’s holidays, the officials get sick with the heat of wine,

he joins in with the ones who mock him.

6Their hearts are like an oven

that burns with intrigue.

Their anger smolders all night

and breaks out in the morning like a blazing fire.

7They’re all hot like an oven

and consume their leaders.

They kill their kings;

yet none of them cries out to me for help.		Hos 7:3-7

8“Ephraim mixes in with foreigners;

he’s like a half-baked cake that doesn’t get turned over.

9Worshipping foreign gods is sapping his strength,

but he doesn’t even realize it.

Gray hairs are peppering his head,

but he doesn’t notice it.

10Though Israel’s pride testifies against him,

he doesn’t come back to the LORD his God

or rely on him.

11“So Ephraim has become a silly pigeon

that coos to Egypt and flies to Assyria.

12As he goes, I’ll cast my net over him,

bring him down like a bird from the sky,

and punish him in proportion to his sinfulness. 		Hos 7:8-12

13“Misfortune awaits him

for straying from me!

Destruction is in store for him

for rebelling against me!

I would have redeemed him,

but he slandered me.

14He doesn’t call out to me sincerely,

but wails on his bed.

He gashes himself for grain and new wine,

turning away from me to foreign gods.

Although I trained him and made him strong,

he still plots against me.

16He turns, but not upward;

he’s like a crooked bow;

his officers will die by the sword

because of their insolence toward me.

Egypt will laugh at them.		Hos 7:13-16

Israel Will Reap the Whirlwind

8:1“Put the bugle to your lips!

A vulture is swooping down on the LORD’s Temple

because my people have broken my covenant

and disobeyed my Law.

2Israel pleads with me,

‘We know you; you’re our God!’

3Israel has rejected what’s good;

so his enemies will chase him.

4He’s set up kings, but not by me;

he’s appointed officials, but I didn’t know it.

By making idols out of his silver and gold,

he’s gotten himself destroyed.

5“I’ve rejected your calf, Samaria, and said,

‘My anger burns against you!’

How long will you not be capable of innocence?

6Even that calf originated from Israel!

A workman made it, so it’s not God;

Samaria’s calf will be smashed.				Hos 8:1-6

7“You’ve sown the wind;

you’ll reap the whirlwind.

Your standing grain has no heads;

it won’t yield any grain.

If it did, foreigners would eat it.

8Israel has been swallowed up;

among the nations

he’s like a pot nobody cares about.

9He’s gone up to Assyria

like a wild donkey all alone;

Ephraim has hired lovers.

10Even though he’s hired other nations as allies,

I’ll gather him up for judgment.

He won’t be appointing

his own kings and officials for a while!		Hos 8:7-10

11“Ephraim has multiplied altars to remove sin,

but they’re altars for him to sin with.

12Though I wrote 10,000 laws for him,

he considers them something foreign.

13The people offer the meat of my sacrifices and eat it,

but the LORD doesn’t delight in them.

He’ll remember their iniquity

and punish them for their sins.

They’ll go back to Egypt.

14Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;

Judah has multiplied fortified towns.

But I’ll set their towns afire

and burn their fortresses.” 		Hos 8:11-14

Hosea Announces Israel’s Punishment

9:1Israel, don’t celebrate like other nations;

you’ve carried on prostitution by leaving your God.

You’ve loved prostitutes’ earnings on every threshing floor.

2Threshing floor and winepress won’t feed you;

you won’t have any new wine.

3You won’t remain in the LORD’s land;

you’ll return to Egypt

and eat unclean food in Assyria.

4You won’t be pouring out

liquid offerings of wine to the LORD there;

your sacrifices won’t please him.

Your bread will be unclean like mourners’ bread;

everybody that eats it will be defiled

because it will only be for your hunger;

you can’t bring it to the LORD’s Temple.

5What will you do on stated festival days,

the LORD’s festival days?

6Even if you escape being destroyed by Assyria,

Egypt will round you up,

and Memphis will bury you.

Weeds will take over your silver troves;

thorns will invade your tents.		Hos 9:1-6

7The time for punishment has come;

the time for retribution is here.

Let Israel know that!

Because of how gross your sin is,

how great your hostility is, you say,

“Prophets are fools;

inspired men are crazy.”

8Prophets are watchmen for my God over Ephraim;

but bird catchers’ snares lie on all their paths;

there’s hatred for them in the temple of their God.

9The people have made themselves as depraved

as they were at Gibeah long ago.

He’ll remember their iniquity

and punish their sins.		Hos 9:7-9

10The LORD says,

“At first, finding Israel was like finding grapes in the desert;

I saw their ancestors like the first fruit on a fig tree’s first season.

But they came to Baal-peor

and devoted themselves to their shameful idol;

they became as detestable as the idol they loved.

11Ephraim’s glory will soon fly off like a bird

because there’ll be no conception, no pregnancy, no birth!

12Even if they do raise children,

I’ll take them away till there aren’t any left.

Misfortune awaits them when I leave them!

13Ephraim is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre,

but he’ll bring out his children for slaughter.”

14Give them, LORD—what will I say to give them?

Give them miscarrying wombs and dry breasts!  		Hos 9:10-14

15The LORD says, “Their sins began in Gilgal;

I started to despise them there!

Because of their sinful deeds,

I’ll drive them out of my house!

I won’t love them anymore;

their officials are rebels.

16The people of Ephraim are stricken,

their root has dried up,

they won’t bear any more children.

If they do,

I’ll kill their precious ones at birth.”

17My God will expel them

because they’ve ignored him.

So they’ll wander without progeny among the nations. 	Hos 9:15-17

10:1Israel is a luxurious vine

that grows his own fruit.

The more his fruit,

the more altars he makes;

the better his land,

the better the sacred pillars he sets up.

2He’s been unfaithful;

now he must pay for his guilt.

The LORD is going to tear down his altars

and pull over his sacred pillars.		Hos 10:1-2

3Then they’ll say, “We don’t have a king

because we didn’t respect the LORD;

even if we had one,

what could he do for us?”

4They just talk;

they make treaties they don’t intend to keep,

so condemnations sprout up like noxious weeds

in the ditches in their fields.

5The residents in Samaria will fear

for the calf idol at Beth-aven [Bethel].

Its people will mourn for it;

its idolatrous priests will cry

over its departed beauty.

6The idol itself they will carry off to Assyria

as tribute to their great king;

Ephraim will be disgraced for depending on it.

7Samaria and its king will float away

like driftwood on the ocean tide.

8The high places of Beth-aven, the place of Israel’s sin,

will fall into ruin;

thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars.

Then they’ll call to the mountains, “Cover us!”

and to the hills, “Fall on us!” 			Hos 10:3-8

9The LORD says, “Ever since Gibeah,

they’ve just kept on sinning!

Wasn’t it right for war to break out against them?

10When I so desire,

I’ll attack those sinners;

I’ll gather the nations’ armies against them

to punish them for their extreme guilt.		Hos 10:9-10

11“Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to tread out grain,

and I used to spare her fair neck.

But I’ll put a yoke on Ephraim;

I’ll make Judah plow

and Jacob harrow by himself.

12Sow seeds of goodness;

harvest a crop of lasting love.

Break up your heart’s hardened, fallow ground;

it’s time to look to the LORD

so he’ll come to shower goodness on you.

13“You’ve cultivated sinfulness and harvested injustice;

you’ve eaten the produce of lies

because you’ve trusted in going it on your own

with your big army.

14So the loud noise of war will arise among your people

and destroy your fortresses

the way Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in battle,

and mothers were dashed to pieces with their children.

15That’s what’s going to happen to you, too, Bethel,

because of your extreme sinfulness.

Israel’s king will be killed at dawn.		Hos 10:11-15

The LORD’s Love for Israel

11:1“When Israel was young, I loved him

and called my son out of Egypt.

2The more I called him,

the more he withdrew from me.

He kept sacrificing to images of Baal

and burning incense to idols.

3But I was the One that taught Ephraim to walk,

leading him by the hand;

but he didn’t know I was the One that healed him.

4I led him with the leashes of mercy and bonds of love;

I became like One that eased the bridle from his jaws

and bent over to feed him.		Hos 11:1-4

5“My people won’t go back to Egypt;

Assyria will be their king

because they refused to come back to me.

6The sword will rage against their towns;

their enemies will break through their gate bars

and destroy them for their evil intentions.

7So my people are intent on turning away from me;

though the prophets call them to me,

none of them honors me.					Hos 11:5-7

8“How can I give up on you, Ephraim?

How can I let you go, Israel?

How can I make you like Admah

or treat you like Zeboiim?

My heart shrinks back within me;

my compassion wells up.

9I won’t act on my fierce anger

or destroy Ephraim again,

because I’m divine, not mortal,

the Holy One among you;

I won’t come in anger.

10They’ll follow me;

I’ll roar like a lion,

and my people will come cringing from the west.

11They’ll come fluttering like birds from Egypt,

like pigeons from Assyria;

I’ll settle them in their houses,” the LORD declares.

12“Ephraim surrounds me with lies,

and the House of Israel with deceit.

Judah also rebels against me,

against the Holy One that’s faithful.”		Hos 11:8-12

12:1Ephraim feeds on wind,

and constantly chases after the east wind;

he piles up lies and violence;

he even makes an alliance with Assyria

while he’s carrying olive oil to Egypt to buy help.

The LORD’s Indictment Against Israel and Judah

2Yahveh has a dispute with Judah too;

he’ll punish Jacob

in proportion to his “deceit.”

3In the womb he grabbed his brother’s heel;

when he grew up, he even wrestled with God.

4He wrestled with an angel and prevailed;

he cried and begged his blessing.

He found him at Bethel

and spoke to him there—

5Yahveh God of Hosts,

Yahveh is his name. 		Hos 12:1-5

6So come back to your God,

observe kindness and justice;

depend on him always.

7But he’s become a shrewd businessman with false balances,

who loves to oppress.

8Ephraim has said, “I got rich;

I made myself wealthy.

Nobody caught me being dishonest;

that would have made it illegal!”

9“I’ve been Yahveh your God since Egypt;

I’ll make you live in tents again

as at the Festival of Booths.

10I’ve spoken to the prophets

and given them lots of visions;

I’ve delivered parables through them.”			Hos 12:6-10

11But there’s sinfulness in Gilead,

worthless people.

They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal too;

their altars are like rock piles

along a plowed field.

12Jacob fled to the land of Aram

and kept sheep to get a wife.

13Then Yahveh brought his descendants

out of Egypt by a prophet

and protected them by him.

14But they’ve made Yahveh bitterly angry;

so he’s sentenced them to death

in payment for their disgrace.		Hos 12:11-14

The LORD’s Anger at Israel

13:1When Ephraim spoke, people cringed;

he made himself important in Israel,

but because of Baal he became guilty and died.

2Now his people sin more and more

and make molten images,

idols skillfully formed from silver,

all made by craftsmen.

They say, “Sacrifice to them,

kiss the calf idols!”

3So they’ll be like morning mist,

like dew that dries off soon,

like chaff blown from a threshing floor,

like smoke from a chimney.		Hos 13:1-3

4“Yet I’ve been Yahveh your God since Egypt;

you weren’t to know any God but me

because there is no savior but me.

5I took care of you in the desert,

in a land of drought.

6But when you got to pasture,

fed to the full and satisfied,

you got independent and forgot about me.

7So I’ll be like a lion to you

and lie in wait by the road like a leopard.

8I’ll attack you like a bear robbed of her cubs

and tear your chests open.

I’ll devour you like a lioness

and maul you like a wild animal.		Hos 13:4-8

9“It’s to your destruction, Israel,

that you’re against me, your help.

10Where’s your king

that’s going to save you in all your towns?

Where are the officials you requested,

‘Give me a king and officials’?

11I gave you a king in my anger

and took him away in my wrath.

12“The iniquity of Ephraim has been collected

and stored up for retribution.

13The pains of childbirth have come on him;

he’s not a very smart son;

it’s too late to keep from being born. 			Hos 13:9-13

14“Should I ransom him from Sheol?

Should I redeem him from death?

No, I won’t show him mercy; so

Death, where are your thorns?

Death, where is your sting?

Bring it.

15Though he’s flourishing like a reed,

an east wind will come—

Yahveh’s wind from the desert—

and dry up his fountain;

his spring will go dry.

It will ‘blow away’ every precious article in his treasury.

16Samaria will bear the consequences of his guilt

because he rebelled against his God:

his residents will fall by the sword;

his little ones will be dashed to pieces;

his pregnant women will be ripped open.”		Hos 13:14-16

Healing for the Repentant

14:1Israel, come back to the LORD your God;

you’ve stumbled because you sinned.

2Come back to the LORD

and bring your confession with you.

Say, “Take away our sin;

receive us graciously

so we can offer our praises to you.

3Assyria can’t save us;

neither can our warhorses.

We won’t say ‘our god’ anymore

to something we’ve made;

only from you can we orphans receive mercy.” 		Hos 14:1-3

4The LORD says,

“I’ll heal your apostasy

and love you freely

because my anger will be gone.

5I’ll be like dew to you;

you’ll blossom like a lily.

6Your roots will spread out like the cedars in Lebanon.

7Your people that live in your shade,

will raise grain again,

and blossom like grapevines.

You’ll be as fragrant as Lebanon’s wine.		Hos 14:4-7

8“Ephraim, I don’t have any connection with idols.

I directly am the One that answers your prayers

and takes care of you.

I’m like a green cypress;

your fruit all comes from me.”

9Whoever is wise, understand—

whoever perceives, be aware:

the Lord’s way is the right way;

good people follow it,

but sinners trip over it.		Hos 14:8-9

JOEL

1:1A Message from the LORD to Joel Son of Pethuel

Mourning over a Locust Invasion

2Listen to this, elders;

pay attention, everybody in the land.

Has anything like this ever happened in your lifetime

or your ancestors’ lifetime?

3Tell your descendants about it;

they need to tell their descendants, and so on.

Joel 1:1-3

4What the cutting locusts left

the swarming locusts have eaten.

What the swarming locusts left

the hopping locusts have eaten.

What the hopping locusts left

the stripping locusts have eaten.

5Wake up, you drunks, and cry;

wail, wine drinkers,

for the sweet wine you can’t find anymore.

6A nation has invaded my land,

powerful and without number.

Its teeth are like a lion’s teeth;

it has fangs like a lioness.

7It’s destroyed my grapevines

and ruined my fig trees.

It’s stripped off their bark and thrown it away,

so their branches are bare and white.	Joel 1:4-7

8Wail like a virgin wearing burlap

for her young groom.

9The grain offerings and liquid offerings have stopped

in the LORD’s Temple.

The priests, the LORD’s ministers, mourn.

10The fields are ruined, the land is bare

because the grain has been destroyed,

the new wine has dried up,

the fresh oil has failed.

11Despair, farmers; wail, vinedressers,

for the wheat and barley;

the harvest is ruined.

12The grapevines have shriveled up, the fig trees have withered;

the pomegranate, palm, and apple trees as well.

The fruit trees in the orchard have dried up,

the joy among the people too. 	Joel 1:8-12

A Call to Repentance

13Put on burlap and chant a dirge, priests;

wail, ministers at the altar!

Come, spend the night in burlap, ministers of God,

because the grain offerings and liquid offerings

have stopped in his Temple.

14Consecrate a fast, declare a solemn assembly;

gather the elders and the people to the LORD’s Temple,

and cry out to him.

15Dread the day!

The day of the LORD is upon us,

a day of destruction that’s coming from the Almighty.

16Hasn’t food disappeared in front of us,

and happiness left the Temple?

17Seeds shrivel under the clods;

barns stand empty;

granaries are abandoned

because the crops have failed.	Joel 1:13-17

18The cattle are bawling!

Herds are wandering aimlessly

because there’s no pasture;

flocks of sheep are bleating in misery.

19I’m calling out to you, LORD,

because fire has burned off the open range;

flames have burned up the trees in the fields.

20Even the wild animals pant for you

because the streams have dried up

and fire has scorched the pastures.  		Joel 1:18-20

The Day of the LORD

2:1Blow a bugle in Zion;

sound an alarm on my holy mountain!

Let the people in the land tremble

because the day of the LORD is coming.

It’s near,

2a dark and gloomy day,

a cloudy day with deep blackness.

A numerous, powerful army is spreading out

like shadows in the mountains.

There’s never been anything like them before,

and there won’t be for ages to come.

3Fire consumes ahead of them;

flames burn behind them.

The land is like the Orchard of Eden in front of them,

but desolation lies behind them;

nothing escapes.

4They look like horses;

they run like steeds.

5With rumbling like chariots,

they leap along on the hilltops—

like a crackling flame consuming stubble,

like a powerful army in battle formation.	Joel 2:1-5

6Defenders are in anguish in front of them

with faces turned pale.

7They run like warriors

and scale walls like soldiers;

they march in line

without breaking rank.

8They don’t bump into one another;

each one marches straight ahead.

When they break through the defenses,

they just keep going.

9They rush at the city and

run along its walls;

they climb into houses

through windows like thieves.

10 The ground quakes in front of them,

the sky shakes,

the sun and moon go out,

the stars grow dim.	Joel 2:6-10

11The LORD raises his voice in front of his army;

his camp is large

because he’s strong that carries out his word.

The day of the LORD is terrifying;

who can survive it?

A Call to Repentance

12“Yet even now,” the LORD says,

“come back to me with all your heart,

with fasting, tears, and mourning.

13Tear you hearts, not your clothes.”

Come back to him;

he’s gracious and merciful,

slow to get angry, full of enduring love,

and relents from carrying out destruction.

14Who knows if he’ll relent

and leave behind a blessing for you,

the possibility of offering again

a grain offering and a liquid offering

for the LORD your God.	Joel 2:11-14

15Blow a bugle in Zion,

consecrate a fast,

declare a solemn assembly,

16bring the people together,

sanctify the community,

assemble the elders,

gather the children and nursing infants.

Have the groom come out of his room

and the bride leave her quarters.

17Let the priests, the LORD’s ministers,

weep between the porch and altar.

Let them say, “Spare your people, LORD.

Don’t make your permanent possession a disgrace,

a byword the world over.

Why should they say,

‘Where’s their God?’”	Joel 2:15-17

The Lord Promises Restoration

18Then the LORD will become zealous for his land

and take pity on his people.

19He’ll answer them,

“I’m going to send you grain, new wine, and olive oil;

you’ll be satisfied.

I’ll never again make you a byword the world over.

20I’ll remove the northern threat far from you

and drive him into a parched, desolate land.

I’ll drive his vanguard into the Dead Sea,

his rear guard into the Mediterranean.

The stench from rotting bodies will rise over the land.”

The Lord has done great things! 	Joel 2:18-20

21Don’t be afraid, O land; celebrate and be happy

because the LORD has done great things.

22Don’t be afraid, animals in the field,

because the pastures in the countryside have turned green.

The trees have borne their fruit;

the fig tree and vine have given their full yield.

23So celebrate, people of Zion;

be happy in the LORD your God

because he’s given you the autumn rains to vindicate you.

He has poured down rain for you,

the autumn and spring rains like before.

24The threshing floor will be full of grain;

the vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil.

25 “Then I’ll make up to you for the years

the swarming locusts, crawling locusts,

stripping locusts, and cutting locusts have eaten—

the enormous army I sent at you.

26You’ll have plenty to eat;

praise the LORD your God,

who has dealt with you amazingly;

then you’ll never be disgraced.

27That’s how you’ll know I’m in the land,

that I’m the LORD your God,

and there’s no other.	Joel 2:21-27

The LORD Promises His Spirit

28“After that, I’ll pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people:

sons and daughters will prophesy,

old men will dream dreams,

young men will see visions.

29I’ll even pour out my Spirit

on male and female servants.

30I’ll display wonders in the sky and on the earth:

blood, fire, and columns of smoke.

31The sun will turn dark, and the moon will turn red

before that great, notable day of the LORD.”

32At that time, he’ll save whoever calls on him.

On Mount Zion and in Jerusalem

people will escape like the LORD said;

among the survivors will be the people the LORD calls.

Joel 2:28-32

Judgment Against Enemy Nations

3:1“When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 2I’ll gather the nations to the Valley of Jehoshaphat and condemn them there on behalf of Israel, my permanent possession, my people. They scattered them among the nations, divided up my land, 3cast lots for my people, traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine to get drunk on.

4“What are you to me, Tyre, Sidon, Philistia? You think you’re going to pay me back? If you try, I’ll return it on your head swift and soon. 5You’ve stolen my silver and gold, taken my precious treasures into your temples, 6and sold Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to remove them far away. 7So I’m going to raise them up from where you sold them and pay you back on your own head. 8I’ll sell your sons and daughters to Judah to sell to the Sabeans far away.

I, the LORD, have spoken.”	Joel 3:1-8

9Declare this among the nations:

“Prepare for war; rouse the powerful;

let the fighting men advance and engage.

10Beat your plowshares into swords,

your pruning hooks into spears;

have even the weak say, ‘I’m a soldier now.’

11Come quickly, nations everywhere;

gather there.”

LORD, bring out your soldiers!

12“Let the nations muster to the Valley of Jehoshaphat;

that’s where I’ll pronounce judgment on them all.	 Joel 3:9-12

13Use the sickle; the harvest is ripe.

Come and tread; the winepress is full;

the vats are overflowing with those people’s sinfulness.”

14Thousands upon thousands in the valley of decision!

The day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision!

15The sun and moon will grow dark;

the stars will quit shining.

16The LORD will roar out of Zion;

he’ll thunder from Jerusalem.

Earth and sky will reverberate;

the LORD will be his people’s refuge,

a strong fortress for the sons of Israel.

17Then you’ll know I’m the LORD your God,

who lives on Zion, my holy mountain.

So Jerusalem will be holy;

foreigners will never overrun it again.	Joel 3:13-17

Blessings for God’s People

18“At that time, the mountains will drip with sweet wine;

the hills will flow with milk.

Water will run down the wadis in Judah;

a spring will gush out of the LORD’s Temple

and water the Valley of Shittim.

19Egypt will be a wasteland

and Edom a desert

because of their violence against Judah

and the murder of its innocent people.

20But people will live in Judah forever,

in Jerusalem for all generations.

21I’ll avenge their blood that I haven’t already avenged

and make my home with them in Zion.”	Joel 3:18-21

AMOS

1:1The Message of Amos, Shepherd from Tekoa, That He Saw

at the Time of Uzziah, King of Judah, and Jeroboam Son of Joash, King of Israel,

Two Years Before the Earthquake

2He said,

“The LORD will roar from Zion;

he’ll thunder from Jerusalem.

The shepherds’ pastures will dry up;

the grass on Carmel’s summit will wither away.”

God’s Judgment on Israel’s Neighbors

3The LORD says,

“For three sins of Damascus and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:e said, He said

they threshed the people of Gilead

with sledges that had iron teeth.

4So I’ll send down fire on the house of Hazael,

consume the fortresses of Benhadad,

5break the bars on the gates of Damascus,

eliminate the people in the Valley of Aven

and the one that holds the scepter from Beth-eden.

The people of Syria will go to Kir in exile.” 	Amos 1:1-5

6The LORD says,

“For three sins of Gaza and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

they deported an entire population to Edom.

7So I’ll send down fire on the walls of Gaza

and consume its fortresses.

8I’ll eliminate the people from Ashdod

and the one that holds the scepter in Ashkelon.

I’ll unleash my power on Ekron,

And the remnant of Philistines will perish.” 	Amos 1:6-8

9The LORD says,

“For three sins of Tyre and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

they delivered an entire population to Edom

and broke the treaty between kin.

10So I’ll send down fire on the walls of Tyre

and burn its fortresses.”	Amos 1:9-10

11The LORD says,

“For three sins of Edom and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

they pursued their brothers with a sword

and tossed mercy aside.

In their anger they slashed them again and again;

they kept up their fury without end.

12So I’ll send down fire on Teman

and burn the fortresses in Bozrah.”	Amos 1:11-12

13The LORD says,

“For three sins of the Ammonites and for four,

I won’t hold back their punishment:

they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead

when they extended their borders.

14So I’ll kindle a fire on the walls of Rabbah

and burn its fortresses

amid war cries like a storm.

15Their king will go into exile with his officials.” 	Amos 1:13-15

2:1The LORD says,

“For three sins of Moab and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

they burned the king of Edom’s bones into lime.

2So I’ll burn the fortresses in Kerioth;

Moab will die amid turmoil,

war cries, and bugle blasts.

3I’ll eliminate judges from him

and slay his officials with him.” 	Amos 2:1-3

God’s Judgment on Judah and Israel

4The LORD says,

“For three sins of Judah and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

he rejected the Law of the LORD

and didn’t keep his statutes.

The same lies have led them astray

that their ancestors followed.

5So I’ll send down fire on Judah

and burn the fortresses in Jerusalem.”	Amos 2:4-5

6The LORD says,

“For three sins of Israel and for four,

I won’t hold back its punishment:

they sell the good for money,

the poor for a pair of shoes.

7They walk on the heads of the poor in the dust

and abandon those who are suffering.

A man and his father sleep with the same girl

to profane my holy name.

8They lie down beside every altar

on cloaks taken as pledges.

In God’s Temple they drink the wine

of the people they’ve fined.				Amos 2:6-8

9“Yet I was the One that destroyed the Amorites for you,

though they were as tall as cedars and strong as oaks.

I destroyed their fruit above and their roots below.

10I was the One that brought you up from Egypt,

and led you in the desert for 40 years

to take over the land of the Amorites.

11Then I raised up some of your offspring to be prophets

and some of your young men to be Nazirites.

Isn’t that so, Israel? 	Amos 2:9-11

12“But you made Nazirites drink wine

and told prophets not to prophesy!

13I’ll weigh you down like a wagon

overloaded with bundles,

14The swift won’t be able to flee;

the strong will lose their strength;

the powerful won’t save their lives.

15The archers won’t stand their ground;

the swift won’t escape;

the cavalry won’t save themselves.

16The bravest among the troops

will drop their weapons and run

when that time comes.” 	Amos 2:12-16

Witnesses Summoned Against Israel

3:1Listen to what the LORD says against you, Israel, against the entire family he brought out of Egypt:

2“Of all the families in the world, only you have me;

so I’ll punish you for your sins.

3Can two men walk together unless they’ve agreed on their route?

4Does a lion roar in the woods before it’s made a kill?

Does a young lion growl in his den unless he’s taken something?

5Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if there’s no bait in it?

Does a trap snap shut if nothing trips it?

6If a bugle blows in the city, won’t the people be afraid?

If a catastrophe falls on a city, hasn’t the LORD planned it?

7For certain the LORD God doesn’t do anything

without revealing his secret counsel to his prophets.

8A lion has roared! Who’s not afraid?

The Lord GOD has spoken! Who can refuse to prophesy?”

Amos 3:1-8

9Declare on the fortresses in Ashdod and Egypt:

“Gather in the mountains around Samaria and watch the great turmoil and oppression in it. 10They don’t know how to do what’s right; they store up violence and devastation in their fortresses.”

11So the Lord GOD says,

“An enemy will surround the land,

pull down your fortresses,

and loot your strongholds.

12Like a shepherd snatches from a lion’s mouth

a couple legs or part of an ear,

so I’ll deliver the Israelites living in Samaria

like the corner of a couch and the cover on a bed.

13Listen and testify against Jacob’s house.

14When I punish Israel’s sins, I’ll punish Bethel’s altars too.

I’ll cut off the horns of the altar, and they’ll fall on the ground.

15I’ll strike their winter palaces and summer homes;

stately residences full of ivory will perish;

their mansions will meet their end.” 	Amos 3:9-15

Israel Does Not Learn

4:1Listen to this, you cows of Bashan living in Samaria,

you women that oppress the poor and crush the needy,

that tell their husbands, “Bring the wine so we can get drunk!”

2The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness,

“The time’s coming when they’ll take you away with meat hooks,

the last of you like fish on hooks.

3You’ll leave through the breaches in the walls,

each one straight ahead.

You’ll be thrown out into Harmon/Mt. Hermon.”	Amos 4:1-3

4“Go sacrifice at Bethel and sin;

multiply your disobedience in Gilgal!

Bring your sacrifices every morning,

your tithes every three days.

5Offer a thank offering with yeast in it;

declare freewill offerings and brag about it.

That’s what you like to do, you people in Israel.

6“I brought hunger to all your towns,

clean teeth everywhere you live;

yet you haven’t come back to me. 	Amos 4:4-6

7“I kept it from raining

when it was still three months till harvest.

Then I’d let it rain on one city

and not on another.

One place would get rain;

the place that didn’t, would dry up.

8So two or three towns would stagger to another to get a drink,

but they wouldn’t get enough;

yet you haven’t come back to me.

9“I struck you with blight and mildew,

and laid waste your orchards and vineyards.

The locusts ate your fig trees and olives;

yet you haven’t come back to me.” 	Amos 4:7-9

10“I sent a plague among you like I did in Egypt;

I killed your young men with the sword

along with your captured horses.

I made the stench in your camp fill your nostrils;

yet you haven’t come back to me.

11“I overthrew you like I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah;

your survivors were like charred stakes snatched from the fire;

yet you haven’t come back to me. 	Amos 4:10-11

12“Because I’m going to do this to you, Israel,

prepare to meet your God.”

13The One that builds mountains and creates wind,

reveals to people what he’s thinking,

the One that turns dawn into darkness

and walks on mountaintops—

the LORD God of Hosts.	Amos 4:12-13

A Call to Repentance

5:1Listen to the dirge I’m chanting for you, Israel:

2“She’s fallen;

virgin Israel won’t get up again.

She’s abandoned on the ground;

no one will help get her up.

3The city that goes out 1,000 strong

will have 100 left;

the one that goes out 100 strong

will have 10.”	Amos 5:1-3

4The LORD tells Israel,

“Rely on me so you can live.

5Don’t rely on Bethel or go to Gilgal or Beersheba;

Gilgal is headed for captivity,

and Bethel will cease to exist.

6Rely on me so you can live,

so I don’t break out like fire, House of Joseph,

and burn in Bethel with no one to quench it,

7you that pervert justice into bitter oppression

and toss goodness on the ground.” 	Amos 5:4-7

8The LORD is the One that made Pleiades and Orion,

that changes deep darkness into morning

and darkens day into night,

that calls water out of the ocean

and pours it out on land.

9He’s the One that flashes destruction at the strong

and demolishes their fortresses.	Amos 5:8-9

10They hate the one that reproves in court;

they abhor anyone that speaks with integrity.

11So, since you impose heavy rent on the poor

and exact tribute on their grain,

though you build houses out of well-hewn stone,

you won’t live in them;

though you plant lush vineyards,

you won’t drink their wine.

12I know about your many, serious sins,

you that distress decent people, accept bribes,

and deprive the poor of justice in court.

13In such cases, prudent people keep quiet

because it’s an evil time.	Amos 5:10-13

14Do what’s good so you can live,

so the LORD God of Hosts will be with you

like you said.

15Hate evil, love good;

establish justice in court!

Maybe the LORD God of Hosts

will show grace to the remnant in Joseph.	Amos 5:14-15

16So, the LORD God of Hosts says,

“What wailing there is in all the squares!

What mourning in every street!’

They’re calling on farmers to moan

and professional mourners to lament.

17In all the vineyards there’ll be wailing

because I’ll pass through your midst.”	Amos 5:16-17

The Day of the LORD

18What longing you have for the day of the LORD!

But what good will it do you?

That day will be darkness for you, not light.

19It will be like a man that runs from a lion

and meets a bear;

or goes home, leans his hand on the wall,

and gets bit by a snake.

20Won’t the day of the LORD be darkness instead of light,

gloom without brightness?	Amos 5:18-20

21“I despise your festivals;

I don’t delight in your solemn assemblies.

22Though you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings,

I won’t accept them.

I won’t even look at your peace offerings of grain-fed animals.

23Take away your noisy songs;

I don’t want to listen to your lyres.

24Instead, make justice run down like water

and goodness like a constant-flowing stream.	Amos 5:21-24

25“Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings in the desert for 40 years, Israel? 26Well, you also carried along Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god, images you made for yourselves. 27So I’ll send you into exile beyond Damascus,” the LORD says, whose name is The God of Hosts.

Amos 5:25-27

Woe to the Complacent

6:1“Misfortune awaits those of you at ease in Zion,

who feel secure in Samaria,

you notable leaders of that foremost nation

that the House of Israel comes to.

2Go over to Calneh and look at what happened there;

go from there to Hamath the great city;

then go down to Gath of the Philistines.

Are you better than those kingdoms?

Is their territory bigger than yours?

3Are you trying to push away the time of catastrophe?

You’re only bringing the violence nearer.	Amos 6:1-3

4“Misfortune awaits you that stretch out on ivory beds,

that lounge on your couches,

that eat lambs from the flock

and calves from the stall,

5that sing idle songs to the sound of a lyre

and invent musical instruments like David did,

6that drink wine by the bowlful

and anoint yourselves with the finest oils,

but don’t grieve over Joseph’s demise.

7You’ll be at the front of the exiles;

your partying on couches is over with.”	Amos 6:4-7

8The Lord GOD has sworn by himself,

the LORD God of Hosts has declared:

“I abhor Jacob’s pride;

I detest his fortresses.

So I’ll deliver up to its enemies

this city and everything in it.” 	Amos 6:8

9It will be that, if ten die in one house 10and the relative that comes to dispose of their bodies says, “Is anyone else here?” any survivor may start to swear, “No, . . .” But the relative will interrupt, “Don’t finish your oath. Don’t even mention the LORD.” 	Amos 6:9-10

11The LORD is going to command

to smash big houses to pieces

and crush little ones to bits.

12Do horses run on rocks?

Do people plow the sea with oxen?

Yet you’ve turned justice into poison

and made the fruit of goodness bitter.

13To you that celebrate in Lo-debar

and say, “We’ve taken Karnaim by our own power.”

14the LORD God of Hosts says,

“I’m going to raise up a nation against you, Israel;

“they’ll oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Arabah Valley.”

Amos 6:11-14

A Vision of Locusts

7:1The Lord GOD showed me a vision. He formed a locust swarm after the spring crop sprouted and the king had mowed his share. 2The swarm had finished eating the vegetation, and I said,

“Lord GOD, please pardon!

How will Joseph make it?

He’s too small!”

3The LORD changed his mind.

“It won’t happen.” 	Amos 7:1-3

A Vision of Fire

4The Lord GOD showed me another vision: he had called for fire to punish them. It had burned up the depths of the sea and was beginning to burn up the landscape. 5I said,

“Lord GOD, please stop!

How can Joseph make it?

He’s too small!”

6The LORD changed his mind.

“This won’t happen either.”	Amos 7:4-6

A Vision of a Plumb Line

7He showed me that he was standing by a wall with a plumb line in his hand.

8He said, “What do you see, Amos?”

“A plumb line.”

“I’m about to put a plumb line on my people Israel;

I’m not going to spare them anymore.

9The high places of Isaac will be desolate,

the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste;

I’ll attack Jeroboam’s dynasty with a sword.” 	Amos 7:7-9

Amaziah Accuses Amos of Conspiracy

10Then Amaziah, priest at Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel,

“Amos has plotted against you in Israel. The land can’t endure what he keeps saying: 11‘Jeroboam will die by the sword;

Israel will go into exile.’”

12So Amaziah told Amos, “Get out of here, you seer! Go to Judah and prophesy for food! 13Don’t prophesy at Bethel anymore. It’s a king’s sanctuary and a national place of worship.”

14Amos answered him,

“I wasn’t a prophet or a prophet’s son. I was a shepherd that tended fig trees. 15But the LORD took me from following flocks and told me to prophesy to his people. 16Listen to what he says. You tell me not to prophesy against Israel or preach against Isaac. 17So the LORD says,

‘Your wife will be a prostitute in the city,

your children will fall by the sword,

your property will be parceled up,

and you’ll die in an unclean land.

Israel will go into exile.’”   	Amos 7:10-17

A Vision of Ripe Fruit

8:1The Lord GOD showed me a basket of ripe fruit.

2“What do you see, Amos?”

“A basket of ripe fruit.”

“My people Israel are also ripe—for punishment. I won’t spare them any longer. 3The singing at the palace will turn into wailing. There’ll be lots of corpses silently thrown out everywhere.”

4Listen to this, you that run over the needy and trample on the humble, 5saying,

“When’s the new moon going to be over

so we can buy grain?

When will the Sabbath be past

so we can open the wheat market—

make the bushel smaller, the shekel heavier,

and cheat with dishonest scales;

6so we can buy the helpless for money

and the poor for a pair of shoes,

and sell the chaff with the wheat?”	Amos 8:1-6

7The LORD has sworn by Jacob’s arrogance,

“I’ll never forget what they’ve done.

8“Because of it, won’t the land quake

and everybody in it mourn?

It will swell up like the Nile,

flood all over, and recede.

9At that time, I’ll make the sun go down at noon

and make the earth dark in broad daylight.

10I’ll turn your festivals into mourning

and your singing into funeral chants.

I’ll put burlap around everybody’s waist

and make every head bald,

like the mourning for an only son;

the end will be a bitter day.”	Amos 8:7-10

11The Lord GOD says.

“The time’s coming when

I’ll send a famine on the land,

not a famine of bread and water,

but a famine of hearing from the LORD.

12People will stagger from sea to sea,

from north to east,

here to there,

looking for a message from the LORD,

but not finding any.

13At that time, beautiful virgins

and strong young men will faint from thirst.

14The ones that swear by the guilt of Samaria,

who say, ‘As your god lives, Dan,’

‘As the way to Beersheba lives’—

will fall and never get up.”		Amos 8:11-14

A Vision of Locusts

9:1I saw the LORD standing by the altar. He said,

“Strike the capitals till the thresholds shake;

shatter them on the people’s heads.

What’s left, I’ll slay with the sword;

no fugitive will get away or refugee escape.

2Though they dig down to Sheol,

I’ll bring them up.

Though they fly up to the sky,

I’ll bring them down.

3Though they hide on top of Carmel,

I’ll look for them and banish them.

Though they hide on the floor of the sea,

I’ll tell a sea serpent to bite them.

4Even if their enemies take them into exile,

I’ll command a sword to slay them.

I’m determined to oppose them.”	Amos 9:1-4

5The Lord Yahveh of Hosts—

who touches the land

and turns it into lava that makes the people mourn,

and the ground floods like the Nile and goes down again;

6the One who builds upper rooms that reach into the sky

and lays their foundations on the earth,

who draws up water from the sea

and pours it out as rain on the land—

his name is Yahveh.		Amos 9:5-6

7“Aren’t you like Nubia to me, Israel?

Haven’t I brought Israel up from Egypt,

the Philistines from Crete,

the Syrians from Kir?

8I keep my eye on sinful kingdoms and destroy them;

but I won’t completely destroy the House of Jacob.

9I’ll give the command

to shake the House of Jacob among all nations

like grain in a sieve,

but not a kernel will fall on the ground.

10All the sinners among my people will die by the sword

who say, ‘Catastrophe won’t overtake us.’

A Promise of Restoration

11At that time, I’ll rebuild David’s fallen shelter

and fix the breaches in its walls.

I’ll raise it up from its ruins

and restore it like it was in the old days,

12so they can possess what’s left of Edom

and all the nations that wear my name.”  	Amos 9:7-12

13The LORD says,

“The time’s coming,

when reaping will last till plowing

and grape treading will go on till sowing time,

when new wine will drip from the mountains

and flow from the hills.

14I’ll return my people Israel from captivity.

They’ll rebuild the ruined towns and live in them,

plant vineyards and drink their wine,

plant gardens and eat their produce.

15I’ll plant them in their own country;

they won’t be uprooted again from the land

I’ve given them.”	Amos 9:13-15

OBADIAH

1The Vision of Obadiah

Edom’s Judgment Foretold

The Lord GOD says this about Edom;

we’ve heard the report;

an ambassador has gone out to the nations to say:

“To arms, attack Edom.”

2“I’ll make you a minor player among the nations

and utterly despised.

3Your arrogance has deceived you,

you that live high in caves

and tell yourselves that nobody can bring you down.

4Though you’ve built high like an eagle

and put your nest among the stars,

I’ll bring you down. 	Obad 1-4

5“If thieves came to you at night—

what disaster awaits you!—

wouldn’t they steal only till they had enough?

If grape pickers came,

wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?

6But how you’ll be pillaged, Esau,

and your hidden treasures found!

7Your allies will drive you out of your borders;

the people at peace with you

will turn on you and overpower you;

the ones you eat with

will set up an ambush for you.

(You won’t suspect it.)

8At that time,” the LORD says, “won’t I destroy

the wise men out of Edom

and those with understanding from Esau’s mountain?

9Your strong troops will be afraid, Teman;

so everybody from Esau’s mountains

will be cut down in the slaughter.	Obad 5-9

Edom’s Violence Against Israel

10“Because of your violence against Jacob your brother,

you’ll be covered with disgrace and permanently eliminated.

11You stood aloof

while foreigners cast lots for Jerusalem

and strangers entered its gates

to carry off its wealth.

You even joined them.

12You shouldn’t have gloated over your brother’s misfortune;

you shouldn’t have celebrated over Judah’s destruction

or boasted about his distress.

13You shouldn’t have entered my people’s gate

at the time of their disaster

or looted their goods during their catastrophe.

14You shouldn’t have stood at the fork in the road

to cut down their refugees

or have betrayed the survivors in their misfortune. 	Obad 10-14

Edom’s Destruction, Israel’s Restoration

15“The LORD’s judgment is coming on all the nations.

What you’ve done to Israel will be done to you;

your dealings will come back on your own head.

16You and those nations will drink the same punishment

you swallowed on my holy mountain.

You’ll all drink till you drown.

17But on Mount Zion some will escape,

and it’ll be holy;

Jacob’s house will return to reclaim its possession.

18Then Jacob’s house will become a fire,

Joseph’s house a flame,

Esau’s house the stubble.

They’ll set him on fire and burn him up;

there’ll be no survivors in Edom.”

The LORD has said it. Obad 15-18

19Then my people in the Negev will take over Esau’s mountains;

the ones in the western foothills will occupy the Philistine plain.

They’ll take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria;

The people of Benjamin will occupy Gilead.

20Exiles from Israel

will replace the Phoenicians as far north as Zarephath;

the captives from Jerusalem that are in Sepharad [north]

will resettle their towns in the Negev [south].

21All those who were rescuedLXX will go up to Mount Zion

and extend its dominion over Esau’s mountains.

The kingdom will belong to the LORD.	Obad 19-21

JONAH

Jonah’s Flight from the LORD

1:1The LORD told Jonah son of Amittai, 2“Go to Nineveh, that big city, and shout against it; I’ve seen how sinful they are.” 3But Jonah ran away. 3He went down to Joppa, found a ship to Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded.

4The LORD hurled a gale on the sea, and it was about to break up the ship. 5The sailors were scared, and every man cried out to his god. They threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Jonah had gone below and fallen sound asleep. 6The captain came and said, “How come you’re sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Maybe he’ll be concerned about us enough to keep us from dying.” 7They said to one another, “Let’s cast lots to find out who caused this catastrophe to hit us.” They cast lots, and it fell on Jonah. 8“Tell us, now! Why has this catastrophe fallen on us? What’s your job? What’s your country? Who are your people?”     	Jon 1:1-8

9“I’m a Hebrew; I fear the LORD God of heaven that made the land and sea.”

10They were really afraid, “How could you do that?” (They knew he was running from the LORD; he’d told them.) 11“What should we do to you to stop the sea from raging?” It kept getting worse.

12“Throw me into the sea. I know it’s my fault this severe storm has come on you.”

13But they rowed hard, trying to get back to shore, but they couldn’t. The sea was getting even rougher. 14So they called on the LORD, “We earnestly pray, LORD, not to let us die over this man’s sin. Don’t hold us guilty for throwing him to his death. You’re doing what you wanted.” 15They picked Jonah up and threw him overboard, and the sea stopped raging. 16They feared the LORD greatly and offered sacrifice to him and made vows. 	Jon 1:9-16

Jonah’s Prayer

17The LORD had a big fish swallow Jonah, and he was in its stomach three days and nights.

2:1Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the fish’s stomach,

2“I called to you in my distress,

and you answered me;

I cried out for help from the belly of Sheol,

and you heard me.

3You threw me into the deep,

into the heart of the sea;

the current swirled over me;

your waves and breakers overwhelmed me.

4So I said, ‘I’ve been driven away from you,

but I’ll still look toward your holy Temple.’  	Jon 1:17-2:4

5Water closed in over me;

the great deep surrounded me;

seaweed wrapped around my head.

6I sank down to the base of the mountains;

the earth imprisoned me forever,

but you brought me up from the Pit,

LORD my God.

7As my life was fading away,

I remembered you

and prayed to you in your holy Temple.

8Those who pay respects to pointless idols

forfeit your faithfulness,

9but I’ll sacrifice to you with thanksgiving.

I’ll do what I’ve vowed;

salvation comes from you.’”

10Then the LORD had the fish cough Jonah up onto the shore.  	Jon 2:5-10

Jonah Preaches at Nineveh

3:1The LORD told Jonah again, 2“Go to Nineveh, the big city, and deliver what I tell you.” 3So he went. It was a big city, a three-days’ walk-through. 4He went through it one day’s walk and shouted, “God is going to overthrow Nineveh in 40 days.” 5The people believed him. They called for a fast and put on burlap from least to greatest.

6When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he got off his throne, laid his robe aside, covered himself with burlap, and sat on ashes. 7He issued a proclamation:

“In Nineveh by decree of the king and his nobles: Don’t anybody—animal, herd, or flock—eat anything or drink water. 8People and animals have to wear burlap. Call on God earnestly so everyone will turn from sinfulness and violence. 9Who knows, maybe God will relent from his fierce anger and not destroy us.

10When God saw they’d repented, he relented from doing what he’d threatened.	Jon 3:1-10

Jonah’s Anger over the LORD’s Mercy

4:1That really made Jonah mad. 2He told the LORD,

“That’s exactly what I said back home and why I tried to run away to Tarshish. I knew you’re a gracious, merciful God, slow to get angry and full of enduring love, and relent from bringing catastrophe. 3So take my life; I’d be better off dead.”

4The LORD asked, “What right do you have to be mad?”	Jon 4:1-4

5Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made a lean-to and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. 6The LORD God had a plant grow up to shade him and give him relief. He was glad to see it. 7But at dawn the next day, God had a worm attack the plant, and it withered. 8When the sun came up, God had a scorching east wind blow and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head till he became faint and begged to die, “I’d be better off dead.”   	Jon 4:5-8

9Then God asked, “What right do you have to be mad about a plant?!”

“I’ve got reason to be mad enough to die.”

10“You’re concerned about a plant you didn’t plant or make grow, that came up overnight and died overnight. 11Shouldn’t I be concerned about Nineveh, a big city with more than 120,000 people that don’t know left from right—as well as lots of animals?”            	Jon 4:9-11

MICAH

1:1A Message from the LORD to Micah from Moresheth

at the Time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, Kings of Judah.

What He Saw About Samaria and Jerusalem

Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem

2Listen, every nation;

listen, world and everybody in it.

Let the Lord GOD testify against you from his holy Temple.

3He’s coming down from his place

to walk on the mountaintops.

4The mountains will mash down under his feet

and cascade into the valleys—

like wax in a fire or

water rushing on a slope.	Mic 1:1-4

5That’s because Jacob rebelled

and Israel sinned.

Where’s Jacob’s rebellion?

Isn’t it in Samaria?

Where’s Judah’s main high place?

Isn’t it in Jerusalem?

6I’ll make Samaria a pile of ruins in the countryside,

a place to plant vineyards.

I’ll drag the stones of its walls down to the valley

and expose its foundations.

7I’ll smash its idols,

and burn everything in it.

I’ll destroy its images

because they came from a prostitute’s pay;

that’s all they’ll be.	Mic 1:5-7

8Because of this, I’ll mourn and wail,

and walk around barefoot and naked.

I’ll howl like a jackal

and moan like an owl.

9My people’s wound is too deep to heal;

it’s penetrated into Judah

all the way up to Jerusalem’s gates.

10Don’t “tell” it in Gath;

don’t weep at all;

roll in the “dust” at Beth-leaphrah.

11Just move on into captivity

naked and embarrassed, residents of Shaphir;

the people in Zaaman don’t dare “come outside” its wall;

there’s mourning in Beth-ezel

because its people have no back up. 	Mic 1:8-11

12Those living in Maroth grow weak waiting for relief,

because “bitter” calamity from the LORD

is reaching the gates of Jerusalem.

13Harness a “team of horses” to a chariot and flee,

people in Lachish, where Zion’s sin came from,

where Israel’s rebellious acts spread from into Judah.

14Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;

the houses in Achzib have “deceived” the kings in Israel.

15I’ll bring a “conqueror” on you, people of Mareshah;

Israel’s leaders will flee to the cave of Adullam.

16Shave off your hair in despair for the children you delight in;

make yourself as bald as an eagle

because they’re going into exile.	Mic 1:12-16

Judgment Against Wealthy Oppressors

2:1Misfortune awaits those who devise sin,

who lie awake plotting schemes in bed!

In the morning they do them

because they can.

2They covet fields and seize them;

they desire horses and take them.

They rob people

and confiscate the property they’ve inherited.

3So the LORD says,

“I’m devising a catastrophe for this family;

you won’t get your necks out of the noose.

You won’t keep carrying on arrogantly;

it’ll be a terrible time for you.

4Your enemies will taunt you with a proverb

and wail a bitter dirge in mockery,

‘We’re ruined!

God is reapportioning our things.

He’s taking them away from us

and giving our fields to apostates!’

5So you won’t have anyone stretching out a surveying line

for you by lot in the LORD’s assembly.	Mic 2:1-5

6“‘Don’t preach about such things,’ they say;

‘disgrace won’t catch up with us.’

7Are you really saying such a thing, House of Jacob?

Isn’t the LORD’s Spirit patient?

Does he do such things?

Don’t his words do good

for those who do right?

8My people rise up against my people;

they strip robes off the peaceful,

off of people that go along innocently

with no thought of fighting.

9They evict my people’s women from their pleasant homes

and forever strip away from their children

the splendor I would give them.

10Get up and get out of here!

this is no longer a place to rest;

there’s sinfulness here

that brings painful destruction.

11If a liar full of hot air tells you

he’ll preach about the fun of wine and alcohol,

he’ll certainly get a hearing from you!	Mic 2:6-11

12“I’ll assemble you, Jacob, remnant of Israel,

and put you together like sheep in a fold;

like a flock in its pasture,

you’ll be a noisy crowd in your land.

13The One that opens the gate will lead you out;

you’ll break out of exile through it.

Your King will go out ahead of you,

the LORD at the lead.” 	Mic 2:12-13

Judgment Against Israel’s Leaders

3:1I said,

“Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel.

Aren’t you supposed to know what’s good,

2you that hate good and love evil,

who skin my people alive,

pull the meat off their bones,

3eat their flesh,

break up their bones in pieces,

and chop them up for the pot

like meat in a kettle?”

4You’ll call out to the LORD,

but he won’t answer you;

he’ll turn away from you

because of all your sins.	Mic 3:1-4

5The LORD says this about you prophets

that mislead my people:

“When you have something to eat,

you prophesy peace;

But you declare holy war against anyone

that doesn’t feed you.

6Consequently, you’ll have nights without visions,

darkness without fortunetelling.

The sun will set on you prophets;

the day will get dark over you.

7You seers will be put to shame;

you fortunetellers will be disgraced.

You’ll have to cover your mouths in humiliation

because I won’t answer you.”

8But I’m filled with power—

with the Spirit of the LORD—

with justice and courage

to declare to Jacob his transgression,

to Israel his sin.	Mic 3:5-8

9Listen, leaders of Jacob, rulers of Israel,

who abhor justice and twist the truth,

10who build Zion with bloodshed

and Jerusalem with violence.

11You leaders render verdicts for a bribe;

you priests teach for hire;

you prophets tell fortunes for money.

Yet you want to rely on the LORD and say,

“The LORD’s with us, right?

Catastrophe won’t happen to us.”

12So, because of you,

they’ll plow Zion like a field;

Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins;

the Temple mount will be a full-grown forest. 	Mic 3:9-12

The Mountain of the LORD

4:1In the last days,

the mountain the LORD’s Temple’s on

will be the tallest mountain.

It will loom above the hills,

and the people from many nations will stream to it.

2They’ll say,

“Let’s go up to the LORD’s mountain,

to the Temple of Jacob’s God,

so he can teach us his ways,

and we can follow in his paths.”

The Law will go out from Zion,

the LORD’s message from Jerusalem.

3He’ll mediate between many nations

and settle disputes between powerful countries far away.

They’ll hammer their swords into plowshares

and their spears into pruning hooks.

Nation won’t attack nation

or train for war anymore.

4Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree,

and nobody will make them afraid,

the LORD has said so.	Mic 4:1-4

5The nations conduct themselves

in the name of their gods;

we will follow the LORD our God forever.

Israel’s Future Rescue from Exile

6“At that time,” the LORD says,								“I’ll assemble the lame

and gather the exiles that I’ve oppressed.

7I’ll make the lame a remnant

and the exiles a powerful nation.

I’ll reign over them on Mount Zion permanently.

8Your former dominion will revert to you,

tower of the flock, hill of Zion, kingdom of Jerusalem.	Mic 4:5-8

9“Now why are you crying out?

Don’t you have a king?

Has your advisor perished

and agony seized you as in childbirth?

10Writhe and groan, inhabitant of Zion,

like a woman in labor,

because you’ll leave this city

to live in the open country,

and go to Babylon.

But I’ll rescue you

and redeem you from your enemies there.

11Now many nations have gathered against you, saying,

‘Let’s desecrate it;

let’s take pride in destroying Zion.’

12But they don’t know what I’m thinking

or understand my purpose,

because I’m going to gather them up

like bundles for a threshing floor.

13Get up and thresh, Zion.

I’ll give you iron horns and bronze hoofs

so you can pulverize many nations

and the wealth of their unjust gain you can devote to me,

the Lord of the whole world.	Mic 4:9-13

A Promised Ruler from Bethlehem

5:1“Muster your troops, Jerusalem;

your enemies are laying siege against you;

they’ll hit Israel’s leader in the face with a rod.

2But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,

though you’re small among Judah’s clans,

you’ll have a ruler come out of you on my behalf in Israel.

His origins are from long ago, from ancient times.”

3Israel will be abandoned

till the one that’s in labor has the child;

then the rest of his relatives

will come back from exile.

4He’ll stand up and shepherd his flock

with the power and majesty of the LORD his God;

they’ll be able to remain secure

because at that time he’ll be great everywhere.

5He’ll give us peace.	Mic 5:1-5a

When the Assyrians invade our land

and overrun fortresses,

we’ll fight back

with seven shepherds, eight princes leading us.

6They’ll shepherd Assyria with the sword,

the land of Nimrod with swords drawn.

A Remnant to Be Delivered

The LORD will deliver us from them

when they attack our land

and try to tramp all over our territory.

7Then the remnant of Jacob left in the land

will live among many nations

like dew from the LORD,

like showers on grass

that mortals can’t restrain,

that no one can delay. 	Mic 5:5b-7

8The remnant left in Jacob

will live among many nations

like a young lion in a flock of sheep.

He mauls and mangles as he goes;

no one can stop him.

9He’ll raise his hand against his enemies

and wipe them out.

10“At that time,” the LORD says,

“I’ll get rid of your horses

and destroy your chariots.

11I’ll demolish your towns

and tear down your defenses.

12I’ll abolish sorcery;

you won’t have fortunetellers anymore.

13I’ll get rid of your carved images and sacred pillars

so you won’t worship what you’ve made.

14I’ll pull up your Asherah poles

and destroy your pagan cities.

15I’ll carry out angry revenge

on nations that refuse to obey.”	Mic 5:8-15

The LORD’s Case Against Israel

6:1Listen to what the LORD says:

“Present to the mountains your case against me;

let the hills hear your complaint.”

2But then listen, mountains, to the LORD’s complaint,

you enduring foundations of the world.

He has a suit against his people;

he’ll bring charges against Israel.

3“What have I done to you, my people?

How have I wearied you? Answer me.

4I brought you out of Egypt

and ransomed you from slavery.

I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you,

5My people, remember now

the curse that Balak, king of Moab, proposed,

the blessing that Balaam son of Beor answered with,

the laws that led you from Shittim to Gilgal,

so you could learn about my faithfulness.” 	Mic 6:1-5

6What should I bring to the LORD?

What should I bow with before God on high?

Should I come to him with burnt offerings

and yearling calves?

7Does the LORD delight in thousands of rams,

in 10,000 rivers of olive oil?

Am I to present my firstborn for my transgression,

the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8No, he’s told you what’s good:

what does the LORD require from you

but to do good, love kindness,

and walk humbly with him?	Mic 6:6-8

Israel’s Guilt and Punishment

9The LORD will call out to the city—

it’s wise to respect him—

“Listen, tribe and city council.

10Can I overlook the wealth gained from cheating

that’s in sinners’ houses

and the short measure that’s accursed?

11Can I acquit a businessman that uses dishonest scales

and a bag of false weights?

12The rich in the city extort;

its residents lie and deceive.	Mic 6:9-12

13So I’ll send diseases to strike you down,

and bring you to ruin for your sins.

14You’ll eat, but you won’t be satisfied;

there’ll be hunger among you.

You’ll store up for safe keeping,

but I’ll deliver most of it to the sword.

15You’ll plant, but not harvest;

you’ll tread olives, but not anoint yourself with the oil;

you’ll tread grapes, but not drink the wine.

16You’ve followed the statutes of sinful Omri

and the example of Ahab;

you’ve taken their advice.

So I’ll deliver you to destruction

and your people to ridicule;

you’ll endure the nations’ scorn.”	Mic 6:13-16

Israel’s Misery Turned to Hope

7:1Misfortune is waiting for me!

I feel like people that pick fruit and gather grapes

but have no clusters to eat

or first-ripe figs to satisfy their hunger.

2Godly people have disappeared;

there aren’t any good ones left.

They all premeditate murder;

each hunts the other with a net.

3Both hands do evil well,

officials and judges both demand bribes,

influential people vie for preferential treatment;

together they weave injustice.	Mic 7:1-3

4The best of them are like briars;

the most godly are like a thorn hedge.

They can post a watchman,

but their punishment will still come;

their confusion is at hand.

5Don’t trust your neighbor,

don’t confide in a friend,

be careful what you tell your wife.

6Son treats father with contempt;

daughter defies mother,

daughter-in-law defies mother-in-law;

people have enemies in their own families.	Mic 7:4-6

7But I will look to the LORD;

I’ll wait for God, who keeps me safe.

He’ll listen to me.

8Don’t gloat over me, adversary.

Though I fall, I’ll get up;

though I live in the dark, the LORD’s my light.	Mic 7:7-8

9I’ll bear the LORD’s indignation

because admittedly I’ve sinned against him;

then he’ll give me justice against my enemy.

He’ll bring me out to the light,

and I’ll be able to see his goodness.

10As a result, my enemy will see it too

and be put to shame who said,

“Where’s the LORD your God?”

I’ll watch while he’s tramped on

like dirt on a road.

11It’ll be a time, Israel, for rebuilding your walls

and extending your boundaries,

12a day when people come to you

from Assyria and the cities of Egypt—

from Egypt to the Euphrates,

from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.

13But first the land will become desolate

because of what its people have done.	Mic 7:9-13

14Shepherd your people with your staff,

your flock that lives alone in a woods

surrounded by productive fields.

Let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead

like they did in the old days.

15“I’ll show you amazing miracles

like I did when you came out of Egypt.”

16Nations will see them

and be embarrassed at their own weakness.

They’ll put their hand over their mouth in awe,

and their ears will pop.

17They’ll lick dust like a snake,

like a reptile in the dirt.

They’ll come cringing out of their fortresses

and turn to the LORD our God.	Mic 7:14-17

The LORD’s Compassion for Israel

18What God is like you, that pardons sin

and passes over the rebellious acts

the remnant of his permanent possession has done?

19You’ll show us mercy again,

tread our iniquities underfoot,

throw our sins in the sea.

20You’ll show covenant faithfulness to Jacob,

enduring love to Abraham

like you swore to our ancestors so long ago.	Mic 7:18-20

NAHUM

1:1The Oracle of Nahum

The Book of the Vision of Nahum

The LORD’s Anger Against Nineveh

2The LORD is an exclusive God

that avenges with anger.

He carries out vengeance on his adversaries;

he stores up anger for his enemies.

3He doesn’t get mad quick,

but he does exert his power;

he doesn’t let the guilty go free.

He displays his power in storms and tornadoes;

clouds are dust beneath his feet.	Nah 1:1-3

4At his command seas and rivers dry up,

Bashan and Carmel wither,

Lebanon’s blossoms wilt.

5In his presence, mountains quake and hills melt;

earth trembles and its people perish.			Nah 1:4-5

6Who can withstand his indignation?

Who can endure his furious anger?

He pours out wrath like fire

and cracks rocks in pieces.

7The LORD is good, a fortress in times of trouble;

he knows who takes refuge in him.

8But with an overwhelming flood,

he brings his opponents to a complete end

and chases his enemies into the dark.	Nah 1:6-8

9Whatever you’re plotting against the LORD

he’ll put an end to;

he doesn’t need to take revenge twice.

10His enemies, like tangled thornbushes and staggering people,

he’ll completely burn up like stubble.

11Who is this counselor of yours

that plots against the LORD with bad advice?

12This is what the LORD says,

“Though strong and numerous,

the Assyrians will perish and disappear.

Though I’ve let them punish you before,

I won’t let them do it again.

13I’ll break their yoke off your neck

and tear their shackles off your feet.”	Nah 1:9-13

14The LORD has issued an edict about you, Assyria:

“No offspring will carry on your name;

I’ll remove idol and image

from the temples of your gods.

I’ll get your grave ready

because you’re contemptible.” 	Nah 1:14

15Over the mountains, a messenger is coming with good news,

someone that’s announcing peace!

Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows;

those wicked invaders will never attack you again.

I’ll completely destroy them.	Nah 1:15

Nineveh to Fall

2:1Attackers are advancing to crush you, Nineveh.

Man the ramparts, guard the road,

muster your forces, get ready.

2The LORD is going to restore majesty to Jacob,

splendor to Israel;

because plunderers have stripped it

and cut the branches off its grapevines.	Nah 2:1-2

3The shields of the valiant flash red;

the soldiers wear scarlet uniforms;

the chariots glitter like steel

as they muster into formation;

they rattle their cypress spears.

4The chariots rush madly down the streets

and race wildly around the squares.

They shine like torches,

dashing here and there like lightning.

5The king orders his officers;

they scramble around in their haste

and hurry to the wall to set up defenses.

6But their enemy tears open the gates of the river

to undermine the palace.

7They strip it and loot it.

Its young women moan like pigeons

and beat their chests.	Nah 2:3-7

8Nineveh is like a leaking reservoir.

“Stop! Stop! deserting residents!”

but none of them even look back.

9Plunder the silver!

Plunder the gold!

Treasure without limit,

wealth of all kinds!

10IThe city is desolate and in ruins!

Hearts melt and knees knock!

Loins throb in pain; faces turn pale!			Nah 2:8-10

11Where’s that lion’s den now,

that feeding place for young lions,

where the lion brought its prey,

where its cubs stayed unthreatened,

12where it tore off enough for its cubs

and strangled prey for its lionesses?

It filled its lair with prey, with mutilated meat.

13The LORD of Hosts says,

“I’m your enemy.

I’ll burn your chariots in smoke,

kill your young lions with a sword,

and leave you with no nations to prey on.

Your ambassadors won’t be bringing reports anymore.”

Nah 2:11-13

Woe to Nineveh

3:1Misfortune awaits bloody Nineveh,

filled with lies and pillage

and plunder without limit.

2Do you hear the crack of whips, rattling wheels,

galloping horses, rushing chariots!?

3Do you see cavalry charging,

swords flashing, spears gleaming,

many slain, piles of corpses,

countless bodies,

and people stumbling over them!?

4That’s all because of your continual prostitution,

that charming mistress of sorceries;

you sell nations by your prostitution,

countries by your sorceries.

5“I’m your enemy,” the LORD of Hosts says;

“I’ll pull your skirts up over your heads,

and show the nations your nakedness,

the kingdoms your disgrace.

6I’ll throw filth on you,

make you disgusting,

make a spectacle out of you!

7Everybody that sees you will back away and say,

‘Nineveh lies in ruins!

Who’s going to grieve over her?’

Where will her comforters come from?”	Nah 3:1-7

8Are you any better than Thebes

that sat by the Nile

with water all around it,

with the river as its wall and rampart?

9Nubia was its strength,

Egypt too, with no limit;

Put and the Libyans allied with it.

10Yet Thebes was carried into captivity.

Its little ones were dashed to pieces

at the head of every street;

they cast lots for its honorable men

and tied up its leaders in chains. 			Nah 3:8-10

11You’ll get drunk too, Nineveh, go into a stupor,

and look for refuge from your enemy.

12Your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe fruit;

if you shake them, their figs fall into your mouth.

13Your troops are women!

Your gates stand wide open for your enemies;

fires consume your bars.	Nah 3:11-13

14Draw water for your siege!

Strengthen your fortifications!

Get in the clay pits to tread mortar!

Put it in brick molds!

15But fire will burn you up;

the sword will cut you down

and eat you up like locusts.

Though you have multiplied like crawling locusts

and propagated like grasshoppers,

16though your traders have come to outnumber the stars—

nevertheless, like crawling locusts

your enemy will strip your land and fly away.

17Though your guards are like grasshoppers

and your marshals resemble locust swarms

settling in stone walls on a cold day,

when the sun comes up, they fly away,

nobody knows where. 				Nah 3:14-17

18Your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria;

your nobles lie dead on the ground.

Your people have scattered to the mountains;

and there’s nobody to round them up.

19There’s no relief for your injury;

your wound won’t heal.

Everybody that hears about your destruction

claps their hands.

Who hasn’t come under your endless cruelty?	Nah 3:18-19

HABAKKUK

1:1The Oracle That Habakkuk the Prophet Saw

Habakkuk’s Complaint

2How long, LORD, will I call out for help,

and you won’t listen?

I cry out, “Violence!”

but you don’t protect me.

3Why do you make me watch wickedness?

Destruction and violence go on right in front of me;

fighting and arguing keep getting worse and worse.

4The courts ignore the Law,

so they don’t render justice;

sinners are in the majority,

so they pervert justice. 	Hab 1:1-4

5The LORD’s first answer:

“Look around at the nations

and be astounded.

I’m doing something in your own day

you wouldn’t believe if somebody told you.

6I’m arousing the Babylonians,

that fierce, impetuous people

that marches across the region

to seize places to live that aren’t theirs.

7They’re dreaded and feared;

they’re a law unto themselves

and make their own rules

8Their horses are faster than cheetahs,

more vicious than wolves at dusk.

Their cavalry comes charging from far away

and swoops down like eagles to devour their prey.

9They come bent on violence;

their hordes surge forward like a desert wind

and sweep captives away like sand.

10They scoff at kings and ridicule rulers;

they laugh at fortresses

and pile up ramparts to besiege them.

11They rush through like the wind and move on;

they’re guilty men whose power is their god.”	Hab 1:5-11

Habakkuk’s Second Complaint

12Aren’t you from everlasting,

LORD, my God, my Holy One?

Surely you won’t let us die.

You, LORD, have appointed the Babylonians to judge us;

you, Rock, have sent them to punish us.

13You’re too pure to approve of evil;

you can’t countenance wickedness.

Why do you tolerate treacherous people?

Why are you silent when sinners swallow up

people better than themselves?	Hab 1:12-13

14They treat us like fish in the sea,

like creatures with no rulers.

15Sinful people fish us out with hooks

and scoop us up with nets.

They catch us in their seines;

they’re happy and celebrate.

16So they sacrifice to their seines

and burn incense to their fishing nets,

because they make large catches with them

and have lots to eat.

17Will they empty their nets then

and keep on killing nations without mercy?	Hab 1:14-17

2:1I’ll stand at my post and watch;

I’ll station myself on a watchtower

to see how he’ll answer my complaint.

The LORD’s Second Answer

2The LORD’s second answer:

“Write down this vision, etch it on tablets

so the messenger can run with it

3The vision is still for a future time;

it speeds toward the goal and won’t fail.

Though it seems slow, wait for it;

it will certainly come in due time.	Hab 2:1-3

4“Arrogant people aren’t righteous,

but the righteous will have life by his trust in me.

5Besides, wine betrays the arrogant, so they don’t last.

Their greed increases like the grave;

like death, they’re never satisfied.

They gather the whole world to themselves

and use everybody. 				Hab 2:4-5

6“Won’t people taunt them and say in mockery,

‘Misfortune awaits you that accumulate what’s not yours

and make yourselves rich by extortion

—for how long, though?

7Won’t your creditors suddenly decide

to call in their loans?

You’ll become their plunder.

8Since you’ve looted many nations,

other nations will loot you

for the blood of men and women that you shed,

for your violence to towns and their people.’

Hab 2:6-8

9“Misfortune awaits whoever uses dishonest gain

to build a prominent house up high,

like a nest beyond harm’s reach.

10You’ve plotted shamelessly to build that house

by ruining lots of people’s lives;

you end up sinning against yourself.

11The very stones cry out against you from the wall,

and the beams in the ceiling echo the complaint.	Hab 2:9-11

12“Misfortune awaits whoever builds a city with murder

and establishes a town by violence!

13Isn’t it from the LORD of Hosts

that people labor only to have it burn up

and nations wear themselves out for nothing?

14The knowledge of the LORD’s glory

will cover the earth like water fills the ocean.	Hab 2:12-14

15“Misfortune awaits you that make other people drink

your venom to get them drunk

so you can stare at their disgrace!

16You’ll be disgraced, not honored;

you’ll drink and expose your own disgrace.

The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you;

complete disgrace will cover up your honor.

17The violence you did to Lebanon will overwhelm you;

the devastation of its animals will terrify you

because of the murder and violence

you did to the land, its towns, and their people.

Hab 2:15-17

18“What good is an idol after its maker carves it,

or an image, which represents a lie?

Its maker puts his faith in what he’s made

when the idol he’s made can’t even talk.

19Misfortune awaits whoever says to a piece of wood, ‘Wake up!’

or to a speechless rock, ‘Get up and help us!’

That’s your teacher!?

It’s overlaid with gold and silver,

but it can’t breathe.

20But the LORD is in his holy Temple;

let the whole earth be silent in his presence.”	Hab 2:18-20

3:1A Prayer of Habakkuk

Set to Shigionoth

2 LORD, I’ve heard about you and stand in awe.

Revive your work in our time

and show what you can do;

in your anger remember mercy.	Hab 3:1-2

3God is coming from Teman,

the Holy One from Mount Paran.

His brilliance covers the sky;

his praise fills the earth.

4His brightness shines like sunshine;

lightning bolts flash from his hand

where his power lies hidden.

5Disease goes ahead of him;

plague follows him.

6He stops and looks the world over;

the nations see him and tremble.

He beats down the everlasting mountains

and levels the ancient hills.

His ways of working have existed from eternity.

7I can see the tents in Nubia in distress;

the tent curtains in Midian are shaking in fear.	Hab 3:3-7

8Did you rage against the rivers?

Was your anger against the streams?

Was it against the sea

that you drove your steeds and victory chariots?

9No. You took the cover off your bow

and put your arrows to the string.

You washed out canyons in the ground.

10The mountains watched you and shook

as the torrent flooded past;

The roaring deep cried out in surrender

and lifted its hands in submission.

11The sun and moon stood still;

they retreated at the flash of your arrows

and the radiance of your spear. 			Hab 3:8-11

12In your fury you marched across the world;

in your anger you trampled nations.

13You headed out to save your people,

to rescue your anointed ones.

You crushed the heads of the wicked

and laid them open from neck to thigh.

14You thrust through the leaders of their troops

with their own spears.

They’d stormed in to scatter us,

celebrating as if running over the poor unchecked.

15But with your horses you tramped down the sea of soldiers,

that surging mighty flood.	Hab 3:12-15

16I heard it and my body trembled;

my lips quivered at the sound.

My knees buckled;

I froze, unable to move;

I’ll wait in silence for distress

to descend on our invaders.

17Though the fir tree hasn’t budded,

and there’re no grapes on the vine,

and the fields aren’t growing any food,

though the flock has scattered from the fold,

and there are no cattle in the stalls,

18I’ll still rejoice in the LORD

and delight in the salvation he’ll bring me.

19The Lord GOD is my strength;

he’s made my feet like deer’s feet

and enables me to walk surefooted on high places.

(For the choir director accompanied by my stringed instruments)	Hab 3:16-19

ZEPHANIAH

1:1A Message from the LORD to Zephaniah Son of Cushi

(Son of Gedaliah Son of Amariah) Son of Hezekiah

at the Time of Josiah Son of Amon, King of Judah

The Coming Judgment on Judah

2“I’ll remove everything

from the earth,” the LORD says,

3“people and animals,

birds in the sky,

fish in the sea.

I’ll destroy sinful people.

4“I’ll reach out against Judah

and those who live in Jerusalem.

I’ll remove the remnant of Baal from this place

and the idolatrous priests,

5the ones that bow down on housetops to the host in the sky,

that swear to the LORD and swear by Milcom too,

6the ones that quit following the LORD,

that haven’t sought him or inquired from him.” 	Zeph 1:1-6

The Near Day of the LORD

7Be silent in front of the Lord GOD!

His day is near;

he’s prepared a sacrifice

and consecrated his guests.

8“On the day of my sacrifice,

I’ll punish the officials, the king’s sons in Judah,

everyone that dresses in foreign clothes,

9that breaks into houses,

and fills their masters’ homes with violence and deceit.

10On that day,” the LORD says,

“there’ll be cries from the Fish Gate,

wails from the Second Quarter,

loud crashes from the hills.	Zeph 1:7-10

11Wail, people in the marketplace,

because your merchants will be wiped out;

every tradesman that weighs out silver will be gone.

12I’ll search Jerusalem with lanterns

and punish people that are complacent about their sin,

who tell themselves

that the LORD won’t do anything to them good or bad.

13Their wealth will become plunder,

and their houses demolished.

They’ll build houses, but not live in them;

they’ll plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.”	Zeph 1:11-13

14That great day of the LORD is near and coming fast,

a bitter day: even soldiers will cry out bitterly,

15a day of anger,

a day of distress and anguish,

destruction and desolation,

a day of darkness and gloom,

clouds and dense blackness,

16a day of bugle blasts and battle cries

against fortified towns and high battle towers. 	Zeph 1:14-16

17He’ll bring such a distress on you

that you’ll stumble around like you’re blind,

because you’ve sinned against him.

Your blood will pour out and become like dust,

and your flesh will be like manure on the ground.

18Your silver and gold won’t save you

at the time of the LORD’s wrath;

he’ll consume the whole region with his burning anger

and make a complete, terrifying end

for people living in the land. 	Zeph 1:17-18

A Call for Repentance

2:1Get together,

go ahead, assemble, shameless nation,

2before the decree takes effect—

before that day of repentance passes by like chaff—

before the LORD’s burning anger comes down on you.

3Look to him,

you humble in the land

who’ve followed his commands.

Aspire to goodness and humility;

maybe the LORD will protect you when his anger comes. Zeph 2:1-3

Judgment Against Philistia

4Gaza will be abandoned;

Ashkelon, desolate.

Ashdod will be driven out at midday;

Ekron, uprooted.

5Misfortune awaits people along the coast,

nation of Cherethites!

The LORD’s message speaks against you,

Canaan, land of the Philistines;

I’ll destroy you till there’s no one left.

6The seacoast will be open range

with camps for shepherds and folds for flocks.

7It will serve as pasture

for the remnant from Judah.

In the evening they’ll lie down in the houses in Ashkelon,

because the LORD will take care of them

and restore their fortune.        				Zeph 2:4-7

Judgment Against Moab and Ammon

8“I’ve heard Moab taunting my people and Ammon insulting them;

they’ve become arrogant about my people’s territory.

9“So, as I live,” the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel says,

“Moab will be like Sodom,

the Ammonites like Gomorrah—

a place full of nettles and salt pits,

a permanent wasteland.

The remnant of my people will plunder them;

the remainder of my nation will take their land.”	Zeph 2:8-9

10That’s what they’ll get for their arrogance because they’ve taunted the people of the LORD of Hosts. 11He’ll terrify them and starve all the gods everywhere. Nations the world over will bow to him, each in their own land.

Judgment Against Nubia and Assyria

12“I’ll slay the Nubians with my sword,” says the LORD says.

13“I’ll reach out to the north to destroy Assyria

and make Nineveh a ruins, arid like a desert.

14Herds of wild animals will lie down in it;

buzzards and desert owls will roost on its columns.

Birds will chirp in its vacant windows;

rubble will block its doorways;

its cedar paneling will be exposed to the elements—

15the jubilant city that lived securely

and said to itself, ‘Nobody compares with me.’

What a wasteland it will become,

a haven for wild animals!

Anyone that goes by will gasp

and gesture in contempt.”	Zeph 2:10-15

The Future of Jerusalem

3:1Misfortune awaits the rebellious, defiled, tyrannical city, Jerusalem,

2that wouldn’t take advice or accept instruction,

that didn’t trust in the LORD or come near to its God.

3Its officials are roaring lions;

its judges are ravening wolves at dusk

that leave nothing over till morning.

4Its prophets are reckless, devious men;

its priests profane the sanctuary and violate the Law.

5The LORD is good within it;

he still doesn’t do anything unjust.

Every morning he hands down justice without fail,

but they’re never ashamed of their unjust verdicts.	Zeph 3:1-5

6“I’ve destroyed nations;

their towers lie in ruins.

I’ve made their streets deserted;

no one goes by there anymore.

Their towns have been laid waste;

nobody lives in them.

7I said, ‘Surely, they’ll respect me now

and accept my instruction

so their homes won’t get destroyed

along with everything else I’d appointed for them.’

But they were eager to corrupt everything they did.	Zeph 3:6-7

8“So wait for me to attack my prey,” the LORD says.

I’ve decided to gather nations and kingdoms,

to pour out my indignation on them, my burning anger;

I’ll consume them with fiery zeal.

9Then I’ll purify the people’s lips

so they can call on me

and serve me together.

10From beyond the rivers in Nubia,

those who worship me—

descendants of my scattered people—

will bring me offerings.

11At that time, you won’t need to be ashamed

of all the things you did when you rebelled against me;

I’ll have removed arrogant, celebrating people from you

so you’ll never again be haughty on my holy mountain.

12But among you I’ll leave humble, common people

who will take refuge in me.

13The ones remaining in Israel will do no wrong,

tell no lies,

or have deceit among them;

They’ll graze and bed down in safety;

nobody will make them afraid.”	Zeph 3:8-13

14Shout for joy, Jerusalem!

Cry out in triumph, Israel!

Celebrate with all your heart.

15The LORD has canceled your condemnation

and cleared away your foes.

The King of Israel is among you;

you need not dread disaster anymore.	Zeph 3:14-15

16At that time, he’ll tell Jerusalem,

“Don’t be afraid, Zion;

don’t let your hands get weak.”

17The LORD your God is among you

as a victorious soldier.

I’ll celebrate over you

and renew my love for you;

I’ll celebrate over you with happy songs

18like on festival days.

“I’ll remove disaster from you, Zion;

you won’t be ashamed of being in exile.

19At that time, I’ll deal with your oppressors,

save the lame, gather the outcast,

and turn their shame into praise and renown

the world over.

20Then I’ll bring you home,

gather you together,

and give you renown among the nations

when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,”

the LORD says.	Zeph 3:16-20

HAGGAI

1:1The First Day, Sixth Month, Second Year of King Darius

A Message from the LORD by the Prophet Haggai

for Zerubbabel Son of Shealtiel, Governor of Judah,

and for Joshua Son of Jehozadak, the High Priest,

God’s Call to Rebuild the Temple

2“The LORD says, ‘These people are saying this is no time to be rebuilding the LORD’s Temple.’”

3A message came by Haggai, 4“Is this a time for you to be living in your paneled houses while my Temple lies in ruins?”

5“Think about how things are going for you!

6You sow a lot, but reap a little;

you eat, but not enough to satisfy;

you drink, but not enough to quench your thirst;

you put on clothes, but you’re not warm;

you put your pay in pouches with holes in them.”  	    Hag 1:1-6

7“Think about what you’re doing!

8“Go up into the mountains to get lumber; rebuild the Temple so I can be pleased with it and honored by it. 9You look for a good crop, but it comes in poor. When you haul it in, I blow it away. Why? Because my Temple is lying in ruins while your interest lies in your own houses. 10So the sky hasn’t dropped dew, and the ground hasn’t produced crops. 11I called for a drought on the fields and hills: the grain, new wine, and olive oil—on what the ground grows; on you, your livestock, and your efforts.”

Obedience to God’s Call

12So Zerubbabel, Joshua/Jeshua, and the remnant obeyed Haggai because the LORD had sent him, and the people respected the LORD. 13Then Haggai said by God’s commission, “‘I’m with you,’ the LORD says.” 14So the LORD stirred up Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant to begin work on the Temple 15the twenty-fourth day, sixth month, second year of Darius.

Hag 1:7-15

2:1The Twenty-First Day, Seventh Month

A Message from the LORD by Haggai

The New Temple’s Lesser Beauty

2“Ask Zerubbabel, Joshua/Jeshua the high priest, and the remnant, 3‘How many of you saw this Temple in its former beauty? How does it look to you now? Doesn’t it seem like nothing in comparison? 4But resolve to work because I’m with you. 5Like I promised when you came out of Egypt, my Spirit’s among you so you needn’t be afraid!’

6“Soon I’m going to shake earth and sky one more time, ocean and dry land, 7as well as the nations. Pilgrims will bring wealth from every country to fill this Temple with beauty. 8Silver and gold belong to me. 9This Temple’s beauty will be greater than the former, and there’ll be peace here.”    	Hag 2:1-9

10The Twenty-Fourth Day, Ninth Month, Second Year of Darius

A Message from the LORD to Haggai

Blessings for a Defiled People

11“Ask the priests for a ruling: 12‘if someone carries consecrated meat folded up in his cloak and that fold touches bread, cooked food, wine, olive oil, and the like, does the other food become consecrated?’”

“No.”

13“If somebody that’s ceremonially unclean from a corpse, touches any of these, will they become unclean?”

“Yes.”

14Then Haggai said,

“That’s the way it is with this nation. Everything you do and everything you offer is unclean. 15Think about what was happening before you began to place one stone on another in the LORD’s Temple: 16f you went to a grain pile to get 20 measures, there’d only be 10 left; if you went to a wine vat to draw 50 measures, there’d only be 20 left. 17You and everything you did, I struck with blasting wind, mildew, and hail; but you didn’t come back to me. 18-19But notice this: The seed is still in the granary; the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not started to bear—but from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month on, when you’ve begun laying the foundation for the Temple—I’ll be blessing you.”   	Hag 2:10-19

20 The Same Day: Twenty-Fourth Day of the Month

A Second Message from the LORD to Haggai

Zerubbabel as the LORD’s Signet Ring

21“Tell Zerubbabel, ‘I’m going to shake earth and sky, 22overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, destroy powerful nations, defeat chariots and riders; every horse and rider will fall by the sword. 23Then I’ll make you my signet ring because I’ve chosen you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel.’

I, the LORD of hosts, have spoken.”

Hag 2:20-23

ZECHARIAH

1:1The Eighth Month, Second Year of Darius

A Message from the LORD to the Prophet Zechariah Son of Berechiah Son of Iddo

A Call to Return to the LORD

2“I was angry with your ancestors. 3So tell the people, ‘The LORD of Hosts says, “Come back to me so I can come back to you. 4Don’t be like your ancestors that former prophets told to come back from their sinful ways and deeds, but they didn’t pay any attention. 5Where are those ancestors? Prophets don’t live forever, 6but my message commanded through them did come to bear on your ancestors. As a result, they repented and said, ‘The LORD of Hosts has dealt with us the way he intended, according to our ways and deeds.’”’”

Zech 1:1-6

7The Twenty-Fourth Day, Eleventh Month (Shebat), Second Year of Darius

A Message from the LORD to Zechariah

A Man Among the Murtle Trees

8During the night I saw a man on a chestnut horse among some myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were chestnut, sorrel, and white horses and their riders. 9I said, “Sir, what do those horses mean?”

The angel said, “I’ll show you.”

10The man on the horse among the myrtle trees said, “The LORD has sent them to patrol the earth.”

11They answered the angel of the LORD, who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We’ve patrolled the earth. It’s peaceful and quiet.”

12The angel asked, “LORD of Hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and the towns in Judah that you’ve been angry with these 70 years?”

13The LORD answered him with gracious, reassuring words.

14So the angel told me,

“Declare that the LORD of Hosts says, ‘I’m jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 15but I’m angry with the nations that are at ease. While I was a little angry, they made the disaster worse. 16So I’ll come back to Jerusalem with mercy. My Temple will be rebuilt there, and a measuring line will be stretched out over it for reconstructing it.’”

17“Also say, ‘My towns will overflow with prosperity again. I’ll comfort Zion again and choose Jerusalem once more.’”	Zech 1:7-17

Four Horns and Four Blacksmiths

18Then I looked up and saw four horns. 19I asked the angel what they represented.

“The horns of the nations that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”

20Then the LORD showed me four blacksmiths.

21I asked what they were coming to do.

“The four horns scattered Judah and humbled it. But these blacksmiths have come to hammer down and destroy the nations that lifted up their horns to scatter the people of Judah.”     	                Zech 1:18-21

A Man with a Measuring Line

2:1Then I saw a man holding a measuring line, and 2asked him where he was going.

“To measure how wide and long Jerusalem is.”

3The angel that was talking to me was leaving, and another angel met him 4and said,

“Run and tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be lived in like open country because of the number of people and livestock that’s in it. 5I’ll be a fire wall around it and the glory in it.

6“Flee from up north where I’ve scattered you to the four winds.  7Zion! Escape, you exiles in Babylon.’

8“‘It’s for glory that he has sent me against the nations that plundered you, because whoever touches you will be poking themselves in the eye. 9I’ll raise my fist over them so their slaves will plunder them. You’ll know the LORD of Hosts has sent me.

10“Sing and be happy, Zion, because I’m coming to live among you. 11Many nations will join the LORD then and become my people. I’ll live among you, and you’ll know the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you. 12He’ll own Judah as his portion in the holy land and choose Jerusalem again.’”

13Be silent in his presence, all you nations; he has risen up to take action from the holy place where he lives.       	Zech 2:1-13

The Cleansing of Joshua the High Priest

3:1Then he showed me Joshua/Jeshua the high priest standing in front of the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing to his right to accuse him. 2The LORD told Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! I who chose Jerusalem reject your accusations! Isn’t this man a brand snatched out of the fire?”

3Joshua’s clothes were dirty, 4so the angel told the ones standing there, “Change his dirty clothes.” “I’ve taken your sinfulness off so I can dress you up with festive robes.”

5I said, “Have them put a clean turban on him too.” So they dressed him up while the angel of the LORD stood by.	Zech 3:1-5

6The angel charged Joshua,

7“The LORD of Hosts says, ‘If you follow me and do your service, you’ll have charge of my Temple and courts. I’ll let you have free access along with the ones that are standing here. 8Listen, Joshua, you and your friends sitting in front of you are symbols, because I’m going to bring in my servant the Branch. 9Look at the stone I’ve put in front of Joshua, a single stone with seven facets. I’ll engrave an inscription on it and remove the sinfulness of the land in one day. 10At that time, each one of you will invite your friend to sit under your vine and fig tree.’” 	Zech 3:6-10

A Lampstand and Two Olive Trees

4:1The angel came back and brought me to as if I’d been asleep. 2He asked me what I saw.

“A gold lampstand with its bowl of oil on top, as well as its seven lamps with one spout apiece. 3I see an olive tree on each side of it. 4What do they mean, Sir?”

5“Don’t you know?”

“No.”

6“This is what the LORD tells Zerubbabel, ‘Not by force, not by power, but by my Spirit. 7Not even a big mountain will be able to get in your way. You’ll set the cap stone for the Temple amid shouts of “God bless it!! God bless it!”’”	Zech 4:1-7

8A Message from the LORD to Me

9“Zerubbabel has laid the foundation for the Temple, and he’ll finish it. Then you’ll know the LORD of Hosts is the One that sent me to youpl. 10Whoever has been disappointed during the time of small beginnings will be happy when they see Zerubbabel holding a plumb line. These seven lamps represent the LORD’s eyes that scan back and forth over the world.”

11I asked, “What do the two olive trees beside the lampstand represent? 12What do the two olive branches represent beside the two gold tubes that drain out the golden oil?”

13“You don’t know?”

“No, Sir.”

14“They represent the two anointed ones that stand beside the Lord of the whole world.”

Zech 4:8-14

A Flying Scroll

5:1Then I looked up and saw a flying scroll.

2He said, “What do you see?”

“A flying scroll, 15 by 30ft.”

3He told me,

“It contains the words of the curse that’s over the whole world. Everyone that steals will be erased from one side. Everyone that swears falsely will be erased from the other. 4The LORD of Hosts will send the curse out to the thief’s house and to the house of the one that swears falsely by his name. The curse will remain there all night till it consumes its timbers and stones.’” 	Zech 5:1-4

A Woman in a Basket

5The angel came forward and said, “Look at what’s coming.”

6I said, “What is it?”

“A basket ephah for measuring grain. It’s filled with the sins of everybody in the land 7[a lead cover was lifted off of it], and that’s a woman sitting inside it 8named Wickedness!” He shoved her down into the ephah and put the lead lid back on it. 9I saw two women flying toward us with wings like a stork. They took the ephah up in the air.

10I asked the angel where they were taking it.

11“To Shinar to build a temple for it. When it’s ready, they’ll set the ephah there on its own pedestal.”	Zech 5:5-11

Four Chariots

6:1I looked again and saw four chariots coming out from between two bronze mountains. 2Chestnut horses were pulling the first chariot, black horses the second, 3white horses the third, and powerful dappled-gray horses the fourth.

4I asked the angel, “What are they, Sir?”

5“They’re the four spirits of heaven going out from the Lord of the whole world. 6One chariot is going north with the black horses; after them the white horses are going west. The dappled-gray horses are going south. 7Those powerful horses went out, chomping at the bit to patrol the world.”

He said, “Go on and patrol it.” So they did.

8Then he shouted to me, “Look, the ones going north have appeased my anger there.”

Zech 6:1-8

9A Message from the LORD to Me

The Crowning of Joshua

10“Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring an offering of silver and gold from the exiles in Babylon. The same day, go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah to meet them. 11Make a crown out of the silver and gold, and put it on Joshua/Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 12Tell him, ‘The LORD of Hosts says a man named Branch will “branch out” from where he is and build the Temple, 13bear the honor, and rule from his throne. He’ll also be a priest on his throne, and his combined roles will work together.’ 14The crown will serve as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah in the LORD’s Temple. 15People from a long way off will come to rebuild the Temple.”

When these things come about, they’ll assure you that the LORD of Hosts has sent me. They will all happen if you faithfully obey him. 	 Zech 6:9-15

7:1The Fourth Day, Ninth Month (Chislev), Fourth Year of King Darius

A Message from the LORD to Zechariah

A Call for Justice and Mercy, Not Fasting

2The people in Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to ask for the LORD’s blessing. 3They spoke to the priests in the LORD’s Temple and to the prophets,

“Should we keep mourning and fasting in the fifth month like we’ve done all these years?”

4A Message from the LORD to Me

5“Tell the priests and people in the land, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months those 70 years, were you really fasting for me? 6And now when you eat and drink, aren’t you eating and drinking for yourselves? 7Isn’t that the same message the LORD delivered by the former prophets to the people in Jerusalem when it and its towns were prospering, and people were living in the Negev and western foothills?’”	Zech 7:1-7

8A Message from the LORD to Zechariah

9“The LORD of Hosts says, ‘Judge fairly, practice kindness and mercy with each other. 10Don’t oppress widows and orphans, foreigners or poor people. Don’t plot against one another.’ 11But your ancestors refused to pay attention, turned a stubborn shoulder, and covered their ears. 12They hardened their hearts like flint so they couldn’t hear the Law and what Yahveh had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. That’s why he was so angry with them. 13Just as he called and they wouldn’t listen, so they called and he wouldn’t listen. 14With a tornado he scattered them throughout foreign nations. The land they left lay so desolate nobody traveled through it. They’d turned their pleasant land into a wasteland.”	Zech 7:8-14

8:1A Message from the LORD

Promised Blessings for Jerusalem

2“The LORD of Hosts says, ‘I’m jealous for Zion. 3I’ll come back to live in Jerusalem, and it’ll be called The City of Truth. My mountain will be called The Holy Mount. 4Old men and women will sit in its streets again with staffs in hand because they’re old. 5Boys and girls will play in the streets. 6If that sounds incredible to the remnant that’s left, does that make it incredible for me?  7I’m going to save my people from lands east and west 8and bring them back to live here. They’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God, faithful and just.’  	Zech 8:1-8

9“Be strong, you that are listening to this message from the prophets who spoke when the foundation of my Temple was being laid so it could be completely rebuilt. 10Before then there weren’t any jobs. Because criminals were everywhere, travelers weren’t safe; everybody was working against everybody else. 11But I won’t treat the remnant like that now. 12Their descendants will have peace, the grapevines will bear fruit, the ground will grow produce, the sky will drop dew. The remnant will inherit those things. 13Just as you were a curse among the nations, Judah and Israel, so I’ll save you to become a blessing. Don’t be afraid; be strong.

14“Just as I planned to punish you when your ancestors were so offensive to me and I didn’t hold back, 15so now I intend to treat Jerusalem and Judah well. Don’t be afraid! 16To have peace around you, tell the truth and judge honestly. 17Don’t make plots or commit perjury. I despise things like that.” 	Zech 8:9-17

18A Message from the LORD to Me

19“The LORD of Hosts says, ‘The fasts in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will be a joy for Judah; so love honesty and peace. 20People from cities all around will attend. 21One city will go to another one and say, “Let’s travel together to look up to the LORD and ask for his blessing.”

“All right.”

22So, many nations and powerful countries will look up to me in Jerusalem and ask for my blessing. 23Ten men from different languages will clutch one Jew’s cloak and ask, “Can we go along? We’ve heard that God is with you.”’”

Zech 8:18-23

9:1A Message from the LORD Against the Land of Hadrach [Aram]

The message from the LORD is against Damascus—for the eyes of all people, including the tribes of Israel, are on the LORD—

2against Hamath, which borders it,

and against Tyre and Sidon, though they’re so very wise.

3Tyre built a fortress,

piled up silver like dust

and gold like dirt on the streets.

4The LORD will confiscate its possessions,

throw its wealth into the sea,

and burn it down.

5Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.

Gaza will writhe in anguish;

Ekron, too, because it’s lost hope;

Gaza won’t have a king;

Ashkelon will be empty.

6Ashdod will house a mongrel race;

I’ll destroy the Philistines’ pride.

7I’ll remove the blood from their mouths

and the disgusting things from between their teeth.

They’ll be a remnant for our God,

like a clan in Judah;

Ekron will be like Jebusites.	Zech 9:1-7

8I’ll camp around my Temple to protect it

so armies can’t walk all over my people;

oppressors won’t run over them anymore

because I’m watching.

Zion’s Coming King

9Celebrate, Zion!

Shout, Jerusalem!

Your king is coming to you,

just and able to save,

humble and riding on a donkey,

on a colt, a donkey’s foal.

10I’ll get rid of chariots in Ephraim,

warhorses in Jerusalem,

and the bow used in battle.

I’ll offer peace to the nations

and rule from sea to sea,

from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.	Zech 9:8-10

11Because of my covenant with you, sealed with blood,

I’ve freed your prisoners from the dry cistern.

12Come back to the fortress, all you prisoners that still have hope;

I promise to restore you double today.

13I’ll bend Judah like my bow;

Ephraim will be my arrow.

I’ll stir up Zion against Greece

and wield you like a sword.

14The LORD will appear above them;

his arrows will shoot like lightning.

He’ll blow the bugle

and march in the windstorm from the south.	Zech 9:11-14

15The LORD of Hosts will defend his people;

they’ll trample the stone slingers.

They’ll drink their bloodlxx and be boisterous as with wine,

filled like a sacrificial basin,

drenched like the horns on the altar.

16The LORD their God will save them then

like a flock of his sheep,

like jewels in a crown,

sparkling in his land.

17How nice things will be!

Grain will make the young men thrive;

new wine will make the maidens flourish.	Zech 9:15-17

The LORD Will Restore His People

10:1Ask the LORD for showers in the spring;

the One that forms the storm clouds

will give each farmer crops in his field.

2Household gods speak nonsense;

fortunetellers see false dreams

and give empty consolation.

So people wander in danger like lost sheep

because they don’t have a shepherd.

3“My anger flares at the shepherds;

I’ll punish the male goats,

because I care about my flock, the House of Judah;

I’ll make them like my majestic steed in battle.

4The cornerstone will come from Judah,

the tent peg, the bow in battle, and every ruler.

5Together they’ll become great warriors

and walk all over their enemies like dirt on a road;

they’ll fight because the LORD will be on their side;

they’ll outfight enemies that ride horses.

6He’ll strengthen Judah and save Joseph,

and bring them back.

7Ephraim will become a powerful man

and be happy as if from wine.

His children will see it and be happy too,

and celebrate in the LORD.	Zech 10:1-7

8I’ll whistle for them to gather

because I’ve redeemed them;

there’ll be as many of them as before.

9Though I scattered them among the nations,

they’ll remember me in far countries,

survive with their children,

and return.

10I’ll bring them back from Egypt and Assyria

and settle them in Gilead and Lebanon

till they take up the whole area.

11I’ll escort them through the distressing Red Sea

and hold back its waves;

I’ll completely dry up the Nile,

crush Assyria’s pride,

and end Egypt’s rule.

12I’ll make my people strong,

and they’ll follow me.” 	Zech 10:8-12

11:1Open your doors, Lebanon,

so fire can consume your cedar forests.

2Wail, cypress trees, for the fallen cedars;

the stately trees have burned up.

Wail, oaks of Bashan;

the thick woodland has been cut down.

3The shepherds wail

because their good pasture’s gone.

The young lions roar

because the jungle by the Jordan is decimated. 	Zech 11:1-3

Good and Bad Shepherds

4The LORD my God says,

“Pasture the flock that’s doomed to slaughter. 5The buyers butcher them without remorse. The sellers say, ‘Praise the LORD, I’m rich!’ Their own shepherds don’t care about them! 6I won’t have mercy on people like that. I’ll let them fall into each other’s hands and the hands of their king. They’ll ruin the land, and I won’t protect it.” 	Zech 11:4-6

7So I began pasturing the flock that was doomed to slaughter by the ones that trafficked in sheep. I took two staffs; I called one Favor and the other Unity, and I tended the flock with them. 8I fired three worthless shepherds in one month.

I also lost patience with the sheep, and they lost interest in me. 9I told them,

“I won’t pasture you anymore.

What’s to die will die;

what’s to be destroyed will be destroyed.

The rest will eat one another.”

10The staff I called Favor I cut in pieces to demonstrate that I was breaking the covenant I’d made with all the nations. 11That day, the ones that trafficked in sheep realized the LORD was acting out a message through me. 12I told them, “If you want, pay me; if not, keep it!” So they weighed out 12 oz 30 shekels of silver to pay me. 13The LORD told me, “Throw them to the potter, that grand value they put on me!” So I threw them to the potter in the LORD’s Temple. 14Then I cut in pieces the staff I called Unity to demonstrate that I was breaking the alliance between Judah and Israel.       	Zech 11:7-14

15The LORD told me,

“Again, dress up like a worthless shepherd. 16I’m going to show the land a picture of a shepherd that won’t take care of the dying, look for the strays, heal the injured, or feed the healthy. He’ll eat the healthy ones and tear off their hoofs.

17“Misfortune awaits the worthless shepherd

that deserts the flock!

A sword will cut his arm

and poke out his right eye!

His arm will wither,

and his right eye will go blind.”	Zech 11:15-17

12:1A Message from the LORD About Israel

Future Destruction of Jerusalem’s Enemies

This is what the LORD says who stretched out the sky, laid earth’s foundation, and formed the human spirit:

2“I’m going to make Jerusalem a cup that makes every nation stagger who lays siege to Jerusalem and Judah. 3I’ll make Jerusalem a heavy rock; any nation that tries to pick it up will rupture itself. When nations surround it, 4I’ll make their horses bolt and their riders panic, but I’ll watch over Judah as I strike those enemies’ horses blind. 5The clans in Judah will realize that the residents of Jerusalem have strong protection from the LORD of Hosts their God.’ 	Zech 12:1-5

6“At that time, I’ll make the clans in Judah like a fire pot in a woodpile, a torch among bundles of grain. They’ll consume the nations around them while Jerusalem stays safe. 7The LORD will save the people in Judah first so David’s royal line and Jerusalem won’t have greater glory than the rest of Judah. 8The weakest among the people in Jerusalem will be as strong as David, and his descendants will lead them out like God, like the angel of the LORD. 9I’ll destroy any nation that attacks Jerusalem.	Zech 12:6-9

The One They Have Pierced

10“I’ll pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on David’s family and the people in Jerusalem so they’ll look at me that they’ve speared. They’ll mourn for me like people mourn for an only son or a firstborn son. 11There’ll be extreme mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning for Hadad-rimmon on the Plain of Megiddo. 12Each clan in Israel will mourn by itself, husbands and wives separately: the clans of Nathan, 13Levi, the Shimeites, and 14the rest.  	Zech 12:10-14

The Cleansing Fountain

13:1“Then a fountain will spring up for David’s house and the people in Jerusalem, a fountain for cleansing sin and impurity. 2I’ll get rid of the idols in Israel; they’ll fade from memory. I’ll remove false prophets and unclean spirits. 3If anybody still tries to make up their own prophecy, their own parents will say, ‘You’ve lied in the LORD’s name!’ and they’ll run them through. 4People will be averse to claiming they’ve had visions; they won’t put on a prophet’s hairy robe to create impressions. 5They’ll say, ‘I’m not a prophet; I plow ground because a man sold me as a slave when I was a kid.’ 6If somebody asks him, ‘Where did those scars come from around your wrists?’ he’ll say, ‘From wounds at “a friend’s” house!’    	Zech 13:1-6

The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered

7Wake up, sword, against my shepherd,

my associate;

strike the shepherd,

scatter the sheep,

and turn against the lambs.

8In the whole land, two parts will perish,

but the third will survive;

9I’ll bring that third part through the fire,

refine them like silver,

purify them like gold.

They’ll call on me, and I’ll answer.

I’ll say, ‘They’re my people’;

they’ll say, ‘The LORD’s our God.’”	 Zech 13:7-9

The LORD Will Rule the World

14:1The LORD will bring a time when nations will plunder you right in front of you. 2He’ll gather them against Jerusalem and capture it. The houses will be looted and the women raped; half the people will be exiled and the rest abandoned among the ruins.

3But then the LORD will go out and fight them. 4His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem. The mountain will split apart east to west, half moving north and half moving south with a wide valley between. 5You’ll escape by that valley, which will reach as far as Azal. You’ll flee like you did from the earthquake when Uzziah reigned in Judah. Then the LORD my God will come with his holy ones! 6There won’t be any cold or frost, 7a unique day known only to the LORD, without day or night; there’ll be light in the evening. 8At that time, water will pour out of Jerusalem year around, half to the Dead Sea and half to the Mediterranean.

9The LORD will become king of the whole world, the only one. 10The land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will become a large plain. But Jerusalem will rise on its site from Benjamin’s Gate to the First Gate to the Corner Gate, from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. 11People will live in Jerusalem safely because its curse will be gone.	 Zech 14:1-11

12The LORD will use a plague to strike the nations that attacked Jerusalem. Their flesh will rot while they’re standing; their eyes will decay in their sockets; their tongues will mold in their mouths. 13The LORD will throw them into a panic, and they’ll attack one another in hand-to-hand combat. 14Judah will fight at Jerusalem and gather wealth from surrounding nations—lots of gold, silver, and clothing. 15There’ll also be a plague on the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and cattle in those enemies’ camps.

16Any nation that attacked Jerusalem and survived the plague, will go up every year to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, and celebrate the Festival of Booths. 17-18It won’t rain for any family in Egypt or elsewhere who won’t go up to that celebration. [19] 20Even the bells on their horses will bear the inscription “Holy to the LORD.” Cooking pots in his Temple will be as sacred as bowls beside the altar. 21Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be sacred to him, so everybody that sacrifices can boil meat in them from the sacrifices. There won’t be any Canaanites anymore in the Temple of the LORD of Hosts.	Zech 14:12-21

MALACHI

1:1An Oracle from the LORD to Israel Through Malachi

Jacob Loved More Than Esau

2The LORD says, “I’ve loved you.”

But you ask, “What do you mean ‘loved us’?”

“Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother? Yet I’ve loved Jacob 3and set Esau aside, made his hill country desolate, and left his inheritance for desert jackals.”

4Esau’s descendants claim, “We’ve been beaten down, but we’ll come back and rebuild the ruins.”

But the LORD of Hosts says, “They may rebuild, but I’ll tear it down again. People will call them The Evil Country, The Nation the LORD Is Angry with Forever.”

5You’ll see this and say, “May the LORD be honored beyond Israel’s boundaries!”

Blemished Sacrifices

6The LORD says to priests that despise him, “A son honors his father, and a servant respects his master. Then if I’m a father, where’s my honor? If I’m a master, where’s my respect?”

“But you ask, ‘Dishonored you? How?’

7“You present defiled sacrifices on my altar.”

“But you ask, ‘Defiled sacrifices, how?’”

“By disrespecting my altar. 8When you offer the blind, lame, and sick, isn’t that disrespect? Why not offer something like that to your governor? Would he be happy with you? Would he accept you?”	 Mal 1:1-8

9“Will you ask me to bless you and be gracious to you? With offerings like that, why would I be gracious to anybody? 10If only there’d be one among you that would shut the Temple doors so you wouldn’t light fire on my altar for nothing! I’m not happy with you, and I won’t accept your offerings. 11From sunrise to sunset, I intend to be honored as great the world over, wherever there’s incense and pure grain offerings.

12“But you profane me by saying, ‘It won’t hurt anything to defile the LORD’s table; the sacrifices for it are no big deal. 13They’re so tiresome!’

“You blow it off and bring what you stole, something lame or sick, so you can say you brought an offering! 14A curse on the cheat that vows a male from his flock but sacrifices a blemished one. What is this?! I’m a great King to be respected the world over!”	 Mal 1:9-14

Warning to Priests

2:1“Priests, I’m talking to you. 2If you don’t get serious about honoring me, I’ll put a curse on you and even curse the blessings you receive. Actually, I already have, because you’re not taking me seriously. 3I’ll bring misfortune on your descendants and spatter your faces with the offal from your feasts. I’ll throw you out with it. 4You’ll find out that I’m the One that sent this commandment so my covenant with Levi can continue. 5My covenant with him gives life and peace. I gave it to him so he’d show me reverence, and he did 6and gave true instruction. He followed me in peace and goodness, and turned people back from sin. 7A priest should preserve knowledge, and people should look to him for instruction because he’s a messenger from the LORD of Hosts. 8But you’ve gone off-road and made people stumble with your instruction; you’ve corrupted my covenant with Levi. 9So people despise you because you show favoritism in how you execute the Law.”   	Mal 2:1-9

Judah Profaned the Covenant

10“Don’t we all have the same Father? Hasn’t the same God created us? Why are we unfaithful to one another and violate our ancestors’ covenant? 11Judah has been unfaithful and created an abomination in Israel and Jerusalem. He’s profaned the sanctuary the LORD loves and married the daughter of a foreign god. 12May the LORD cut off from Jacob anyone who does that and then tries to present him an offering.

13“Another thing you do is cover the LORD’s altar with tears, weeping, and groaning because he doesn’t accept your offerings anymore.”

14“You ask, ‘Why?’

“Because he’s seen how unfaithful you’ve been to the wife you’ve had from your youth though she’s your partner, your wife by covenant. 15Nobody does that who has even an ounce of the spirit and wants godly offspring; so pay attention to your spirit so you won’t be unfaithful to her. 16I despise divorce and the one that tries to cover up his adultery with cruelty by divorcing his wife.”

A Day of Judgment

17“You’ve worn the LORD out with your talk.

“How?”

“By saying, ‘People that sin are as good in his sight as anybody else; he delights in them’; or ‘Where’s there a just God?’”         	 Mal 2:10-17

3:1“I’m going to send my messenger to fix the road ahead of me. Then the LORD you’re looking for will suddenly come to his Temple, the messenger of the covenant you delight in. 2But who can endure it when he comes? Who can withstand his appearing? He’ll be like a refiner’s fire and a fuller’s soap. 3He’ll sit like a refiner that smelts and purifies dross from silver. He’ll purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver so they can present acceptable offerings. 4Then the offerings in Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to me like before.

5“Then I’ll put you on trial and eagerly testify against sorcerers, adulterers, people that swear falsely, cheat wage earners, abuse widows and orphans; are prejudiced against foreigners, and don’t respect me. 	Mal 3:1-5

Robbing God

6“I don’t change. That’s why I haven’t consumed you yet, Jacob. 7From the time of your ancestors, you’ve repeatedly turned away from my statutes. Come back to me, and I’ll come back to you.”

“What do you mean ‘come back’?’”

8“Will a mortal steal from God? Yet you’re stealing from me!

“Stealing from you?”

“Tithes and offerings. 9You’re accursed because the whole nation is stealing from me! 10Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse so there’ll be enough food for my Temple staff. Test me in that and see if I don’t open the sky and pour out blessing on you till there’s no more need. 11I’ll drive away diseases and locust plagues for you so they won’t ruin your produce and your grapevines won’t drop their grapes before they’re ripe. 12Other nations will say you’re fortunate to have such a delightful land.” 	Mal 3:6-12

13“You say arrogant things about me,” the LORD says.

“Like what?”

14“Like, ‘There’s no point in serving God. What good’s it do to keep his charges or mourn in front of him when we fail to do so? 15We may as well consider proud people fortunate: not only do they prosper; but when they make trial of God, they get away with it!’”

16Then the LORD heard people talking to one another who did respect and honor him. He recorded their names 17and said, “They’ll be mine when I render judgment on who is my special possession. I’ll have mercy on them like a man has on a reliable son. 18I’ll distinguish the good ones that serve me and from the bad ones that won’t.      	Mal 3:13-18

The Day of the LORD

4:1“The time’s coming when the arrogant people you admire will be like stubble that burns up in a furnace—root, stem, and all. 2But for you that respect me, goodness will rise up like the sun with healing in its wings. You’ll break out, jump around for joy, and run all over like calves let out of a stall. 3At the time I’m planning for, you’ll stomp on sinners like ashes under your feet.

4“Remember the Law of Moses my servant, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him at Horeb/Sinai for you. 5I’ll send you Elijah the prophet before that awesome day comes. 6He’ll turn fathers’ hearts back to their children and children’s hearts back to their fathers, so I won’t put a curse on the land.”

Mal 4:1-6
