HAGGAI

Conversational Yahveh Covenant

1:1The First Day, Sixth Month, Second Year of King Darius

A Message from Yahveh to the Prophet Haggai

for Zerubbabel Ben-Shealtiel, Governor of Judah,

and for Joshua Ben-Jehozadak, the High Priest,

God’s Call to Rebuild the Temple

2“Yahveh says, ‘These people are saying this is no time to be rebuilding Yahveh’s Temple.’”

3A message came by Haggai, 4“Is this a time for you to be living in your paneled houses while my Temple lies in ruins?”

5“Think about how things are going for you!

6You sow a lot, but reap a little;

you eat, but not enough to satisfy;

you drink, but not enough to quench your thirst;

you put on clothes, but you’re not warm;

you put your pay in pouches with holes in them.” 	Hag 1:1-6

7“Think about what you’re doing!

8Go up into the mountains to get lumber; rebuild the Temple so I can be pleased with it and honored by it. 9You look for a good crop, but it comes in poor. When you haul it in, I blow it away. Why? Because my Temple is lying in ruins while your interest lies in your own houses. 10So the sky hasn’t dropped dew, and the ground hasn’t produced crops. 11I called for a drought on the fields and hills: the grain, new wine, and olive oil—on what the ground grows; on you, your livestock, and your efforts.”

Obedience to God’s Call

12So Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant obeyed Haggai, because Yahveh had sent him, and the people respected Yahveh. 13Then Haggai said by God’s commission, “’I’m with you,’ Yahveh says.” 14So Yahveh stirred up Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant to begin work on the Temple 15the twenty-fourth day, sixth month, second year of Darius. 	   Hag 1:7-15

2:1The Twenty-First Day, Seventh Month

A Message from Yahveh to Haggai

The New Temple’s Lesser Beauty

2“Ask Zerubbabel, Joshua/Jeshua the high priest, and the remnant, 3‘How many of you saw this Temple in its former beauty? How does it look to you now? Doesn’t it seem like nothing in comparison? 4But resolve to work because I’m with you. 5Like I promised when you came out of Egypt, my Spirit’s among you so you needn’t be afraid!’

6Soon I’m going to shake the earth and sky one more time, ocean and dry land 7as well as the nations. Pilgrims will bring wealth from every country to fill this Temple with beauty. 8Silver and gold belong to me. 9This Temple’s beauty will be greater than the former, and there’ll be peace here.’”                       Hag 2:1-0

10The Twenty-Fourth Day, Ninth Month, Second Year of Darius

A Message from Yahveh to Haggai

Blessings for a Defiled People

11“Ask the priests for a ruling: 12if someone carries consecrated meat folded up in his cloak and that fold touches bread, cooked food, wine, olive oil, and the like, does the other food become consecrated?’”

“No.”

13“If somebody that’s ceremonially unclean from a corpse, touches any of these, will they become unclean?”

“Yes.”

14Then Haggai said,

“That’s the way it is with this nation. Everything you do and everything you offer is unclean. 15Think about what was happening before you began to place one stone on another in Yahveh’s Temple: 16if you went to a grain pile to get 20 measures, there’d only be 10 left. If you went to a wine vat to draw 50 measures, there’d only be 20 left. 17You and everything you did, I struck with blasting wind, mildew, and hail; but you didn’t come back to me. 18-19But notice this: The seed is still in the granary; the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not started to bear—but from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month on, when you’ve begun laying the foundation for the Temple—I’ll be blessing you.”       					        Hag 2:10-19

20The Same Day: Twenty-Fourth Day of the Month

A Second Message from Yahveh to Haggai

Zerubbabel as the LORD’s Signet Ring

21“Tell Zerubbabel, ‘I’m going to shake earth and sky, 22overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, destroy powerful nations, defeat chariots and riders; every horse and rider will fall by the sword. 23Then I’ll make you my signet ring because I’ve chosen you, Zerubbabel Ben-Shealtiel.’

I, Yahveh of hosts, have spoken.”

Hag 2:20-23
