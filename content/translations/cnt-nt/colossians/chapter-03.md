## Colossians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So since you've resurrected with Christ, strive for things above, where Christ sits on God's right hand. 2Fix your attention on things above, not things on earth. 3You've died, and your life is hidden away with Christ in God. 4When Christ, your life, appears, you'll appear with him in glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So put to death your earthly members, which foster immorality, uncleanness, passion, sinful desires, and greed, which amounts to idolatry. 6Because of things like that, God's displeasure comes [on disobedient people]ms. 7At one time you lived that way too. 8Now set it aside: anger, rage, hateful feelings, slander, filthy talk. 9Don't lie to one other, because you've taken off the old self and its behaviors, 10and put on the new self that's made new unto knowing the One who created that new self in his image. 11In that image there's no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian; slave or free; Christ includes us all and is in us all.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, as God's chosen people, holy and loved, dress in compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience. 13Bear with one another; be gracious to each other. If you have a complaint against someone, be gracious to them like the Lord was to you. 14Above all, dress in love, the perfect bond for holding youpl together. 15Let the peace that comes from Christ prevail in your hearts—peace is what he called you to in one body—and be grateful. 16Let Christ's word live in you richly. Teach and encourage each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 17Whatever you do or say, do it in the name of the Lord Jesus and be thankful to God the Father through him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Wives defer to your husbands in a way that's appropriate in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Husbands, love your wives; don't be harsh toward them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Children, obey your parents because that pleases the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Dads, don't make your children resentful, so they won't get discouraged.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Servants, obey your physical masters. Don't try to create impressions to please them, but obey sincerely, fearing the Lord. 23Whatever you're doing, do it voluntarily as to the Lord rather than to other people. 24You know the Lord will reward you, so serve him. 25The ones that do unjustly will get paid back impartially for what they've done.</span>
