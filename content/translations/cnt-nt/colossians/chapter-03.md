## Colossians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>So since you’ve resurrected with Christ, strive for things above, where Christ sits on God’s right <em>hand</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Fix your attention on things above, not things on earth. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’ve died, and your life is hidden away with Christ in God. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Christ, your life, appears, you’ll appear with him in glory.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 3:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>So put to death <em>your</em> earthly members, <em>which foster</em> immorality, uncleanness, passion, sinful desires, and greed, which amounts to idolatry. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Because of things like that, God’s displeasure comes [on disobedient people]<sup>ms</sup>. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>At one time you lived that way too. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Now set it aside: anger, rage, hateful feelings, slander, filthy talk. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Don’t lie to one other, because you’ve taken off the old self and its behaviors, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>and put on the new <em>self</em> that’s made new unto knowing the One who created that new self in his image. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>In that image there’s no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian; slave or free; Christ <em>includes</em> <em>us</em> all and <em>is</em> in <em>us</em> all.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 3:5-11</p>

### Emphasizing the Major Virtues


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>So, as God’s chosen people, holy and loved, dress in compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Bear with one another; be gracious to each other. If you have a complaint against someone, be gracious to them like the Lord was to you. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Above all, <em>dress in</em> love, the perfect bond for holding you<sup>pl</sup> together. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Let the peace that comes from Christ prevail in your hearts—peace is what he called you to in one body—and be grateful. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Let Christ’s word live in you richly. Teach and encourage each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing to God with gratitude in your hearts. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Whatever you do or say, <em>do</em> it in the name of the Lord Jesus and be thankful to God the Father through him.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 3:12-17</p>

### Family Virtues


<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Wives defer to <em>your</em> husbands in a way that’s appropriate in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Husbands, love <em>your</em> wives; don’t be harsh toward them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Children, obey <em>your</em> parents because that pleases the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Dads, don’t make your children resentful, so they won’t get discouraged.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Servants, obey <em>your</em> physical masters. Don’t try to create impressions to please them, but <em>obey</em> sincerely, fearing the Lord. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Whatever you’re doing, do it voluntarily as to the Lord rather than to other people. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>You know the Lord will reward you, so serve him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>The ones that do unjustly will get paid back impartially for what they’ve done.</span>
