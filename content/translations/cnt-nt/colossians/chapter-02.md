## Colossians Chapter 2

### :5 	Urging Continued Faithfulness

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I want you to know how much I am striving for you, for the ones in Laodicea, and for whoever has never met me. 2I urge you to bond together in love and to gain the valuable confidence that comes from knowing and understanding God's revealed mystery: Christ. 3All the hidden treasures of knowledge and wisdom lie in him. 4I say that so nobody will lead you astray with persuasive arguments. 5Though I'm absent in body, I'm present in spirit, happy to see your orderly living and steadfast faith in Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 1:24-2</p>

### :5 Urging Continued Faithfulness


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, keep on living in him. 7Be rooted and built up in him, firm in faith, like you were taught. 8Make sure nobody takes you captive with empty philosophy that deceives, after human traditions, according to the world's underlying assumptions rather than after Christ. 9He fully constitutes deity bodily. 10In him you have everything you need; he's the head of all rule and authority. 11In him you were also 'circumcised' without hands. It's not a circumcision that removes flesh from the body; it's Christ's 'circumcision.' 12You were buried with him in baptism, and raised with him by faith in God, who raised him from the dead. 13You were 'dead' in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, but he 'made you alive' with him and pardoned your sins. 14He canceled the certificate of debt made up of regulations that worked against us, took it out of the way, and nailed it to his cross. 15He disarmed rulers and authorities and displayed them openly for what they were by overcoming them in the cross and resurrection. Concerns Irrelevant for Christians</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So don't let anybody judge you about food, drink, or participating in festivals, new moons, or Sabbaths. 17They're just shadows of realities to come; but the body belongs to Christ. 18And don't let anybody cheat you by promoting pious self-denial and angel worship—taking a stand on insights they claim to have, proud for no reason in their nature-dominated thinking—19instead of holding onto the Head. From him the whole body, held up and held together by ligaments and tendons, grows in a way that God brings about.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> If with Christ you've died to the world's underlying assumptions, why subject yourselves to rules and regulations as if you're living in the world—21things like, "Don't use, don't taste, don't touch"? 22Such human rules and regulations deal with things that wear out from use. 23They look wise with their self-imposed piety, self-denial, and severity to the body; but they don't help manage the physical body.
