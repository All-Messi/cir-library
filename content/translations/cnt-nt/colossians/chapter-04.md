## Colossians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Masters, be just and fair with your servants. Remember, you have a Master too—in heaven.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 3:18-4</p>

### :1 General Virtues


<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Pray for us, too, that God will open a door for us to speak the revealed mystery: Christ. I’m in prison because of that message. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Pray</em> that I’ll make that message public like I should. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Live wisely toward outsiders and make good use of <em>every</em> chance <em>you get to</em><em> </em><em>influence them</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Always speak graciously with salt so you’ll know how to answer each person.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 4:2-6</p>

### Extensive Greetings


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Tychicus, our dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you about my situation. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>That’s why I’ve sent him so he can comfort you. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I’ve also sent Onesimus, faithful and dear brother, who’s one of you. They’ll tell you about things here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, along with Mark, Barnabas’ cousin (Welcome him if he comes.), <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and Jesus, called Justus—men from the Circumcision. <em>At present </em>they’re the only co-workers I have. They’ve been an encouragement to me.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Col 4:7-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Epaphras, <em>who’s</em> one of you, greets you. He strives for you in prayers that you’ll stand complete and confident in God’s will. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I can vouch for his deep concern for you and the ones in Laodicea and Hierapolis. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Luke, the dearly loved doctor, and Demas send their regards. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Hello to the Christians in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When you’ve read <em>this</em> letter, have it read in the church in Laodicea; and you read my <em>letter</em> to Laodicea. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Tell Archippus to concentrate on fulfilling the ministry he’s received in the Lord.<em>    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I, Paul, sign this greeting with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace <em>be</em> with you.<strong>                                                                                </strong> <strong></span>
