## Colossians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Masters, be just and fair with your servants. Remember, you have a Master too—in heaven.      	      Col 3:18-4:1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving. 3Pray for us, too, that God will open a door for us to speak the revealed mystery: Christ. I'm in prison because of that message. 4Pray that I'll make that message public like I should. 5Live wisely toward outsiders and make good use of every chance you get to influence them. 6Always speak graciously with salt so you'll know how to answer each person.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Tychicus, our dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you about my situation. 8That's why I've sent him so he can comfort you. 9I've also sent Onesimus, faithful and dear brother, who's one of you. They'll tell you about things here.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, along with Mark, Barnabas' cousin (Welcome him if he comes.), 11and Jesus, called Justus—men from the Circumcision. At present they're the only co-workers I have. They've been an encouragement to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Epaphras, who's one of you, greets you. He strives for you in prayers that you'll stand complete and confident in God's will. 13I can vouch for his deep concern for you and the ones in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 14Luke, the dearly loved doctor, and Demas send their regards. 15Hello to the Christians in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house. 16When you've read this letter, have it read in the church in Laodicea; and you read my letter to Laodicea. 17Tell Archippus to concentrate on fulfilling the ministry he's received in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I, Paul, sign this greeting with my own hand. Remember my bonds.</span>
