## Colossians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God's will, and brother Timothy 2to the saints in Colossae and faithful disciples in Christ. Grace and peace from God our Father.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> We thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and always pray for you. 4We've heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for the saints 5because of the hope that's stored up for you in heaven. That hope you heard about in the true gospel message 6that's in you like it is in the whole world. It's been growing and producing fruit everywhere like it has among you since you heard it and came to know the truth about God's grace. 7You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant. He's Christ's faithful minister for you, 8and he's made your love in the Spirit clear to us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> That's why, from the time we heard it, we kept praying that you'd be fully aware of his will in the wisdom and understanding of spiritual things. 10That way you'll live worthy of the Lord in your desire to please him; you'll grow in every good deed and bear fruit because you know him. 11In proportion to his glorious power, he'll greatly enable you to endure with joy, 12and you'll thank him for qualifying you to share in the inheritance of the saints who live in light. 13He has delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his dear Son. 14We have redemption in his Son, the forgiveness of sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He's the image of the invisible God,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He was before everything,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He's the head of the body, the church.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The Father saw fit to put everything under his responsibility</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> At one time you were enemies in mind and deed. 22Now he has reconciled you in his physical body through death to bring you into his presence holy, blameless, without fault. 23That's the case if you stay in the faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope you heard about in the good news that's been presented in all creation under the sky. I've become a minister of it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> I feel good about my hardships for you; I'm completing in my flesh what I can add to Christ'sMessiah's sufferings for his body the church. 25I became a minister of the church as a stewardship God gave me for you, to fully make known his message. 26That message was not revealed to past generations, but he has revealed it now to his saints. 27He wanted to show them the value of this glorious mystery among the Gentiles: Christ among youpl, the hope for glory. 28We present him, and instruct and warn everybody as wisely as we can so we can present each person complete in Christ. 29That's why I strive in proportion to his power at work in me.</span>
