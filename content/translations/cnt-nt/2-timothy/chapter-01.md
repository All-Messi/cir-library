### Stirring up Timothy’s Gift


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>As I remember you in my prayers day and night, I thank my ancestors’ God that I serve with a good conscience. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I really want to see you again because I’ve been remembering your tears. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>I remember your sincere faith, <em>a faith</em> your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice had first. I’m sure it’s been in you, too, ever since. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>That’s why I’m reminding you to stir up the spiritual gift you have from the laying on of my hands. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>God hasn’t given us a timid mentality, but power, love, and self-discipline. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So don’t be ashamed of the Lord’s mystery or of me his prisoner; suffer with me for the good news as God gives you strength. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He has saved us and called us with a holy calling. What we can do ourselves doesn’t define <em>that calling</em>. His purpose and grace define it, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The coming of our Savior Christ Jesus now has revealed that purpose and grace. He destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>He’s appointed me as a preacher, apostle, and teacher <em>of that good news</em>. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>That’s why I’m suffering what <em>I am</em>. But I’m not ashamed; I know who I’ve trusted, and I’m confident that he can keep what I entrusted to him till that day. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Hold onto the sound form of the message you’ve heard from me about the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>By the Holy Spirit who lives in us, keep what he’s entrusted <em>to you.</em><em>	 </em></span>

### Paul Abandoned in Rome


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Be aware that everybody in Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus. He has cheered me up so many times and hasn’t been ashamed of my chains. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When he got to Rome, he went all out to find me. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>May the Lord show him mercy on <em>judgment </em>day. <u>You</u> know very well how much he ministered in Ephesus.</span>
