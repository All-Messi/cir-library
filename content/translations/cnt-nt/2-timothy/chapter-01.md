## 2 Timothy Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God's will in regard to the life he promised in Christ Jesus, 2to Timothy, my dear son. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> As I remember you in my prayers day and night, I thank my ancestors' God that I serve with a good conscience. 4I really want to see you again because I've been remembering your tears. 5I remember your sincere faith, a faith your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice had first. I'm sure it's been in you, too, ever since. 6That's why I'm reminding you to stir up the spiritual gift you have from the laying on of my hands. 7God hasn't given us a timid mentality, but power, love, and self-discipline. 8So don't be ashamed of the Lord's mystery or of me his prisoner; suffer with me for the good news as God gives you strength. 9He has saved us and called us with a holy calling. What we can do ourselves doesn't define that calling. His purpose and grace define it, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began. 10The coming of our Savior Christ Jesus now has revealed that purpose and grace. He destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news. 11He's appointed me as a preacher, apostle, and teacher of that good news. 12That's why I'm suffering what I am. But I'm not ashamed; I know who I've trusted, and I'm confident that he can keep what I entrusted to him till that day. 13Hold onto the sound form of the message you've heard from me about the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 14By the Holy Spirit who lives in us, keep what he's entrusted to you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Be aware that everybody in Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus. He has cheered me up so many times and hasn't been ashamed of my chains. 17When he got to Rome, he went all out to find me. 18May the Lord show him mercy on judgment day. You know very well how much he ministered in Ephesus.</span>
