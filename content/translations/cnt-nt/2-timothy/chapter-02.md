## 2 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, my son, you be strong in the grace that Christ Jesus gives. 2What you've heard from me among many witnesses entrust to faithful men that can teach others. 3Endure hardship with me like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4A soldier doesn't get mixed up in the affairs of daily life while he's a soldier. That way he can please his recruiter. 5An athlete doesn't win the garland unless he competes by the rules. 6A laboring farmer should be first to share in his crops. 7Think about what I'm saying; the Lord will help you understand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David according to the gospel I preach, 9that I endure hardship for—even to the point of being in chains like a criminal. But God's word is not in chains. 10So I endure everything for the ones he has chosen so they can obtain the salvation that Christ Jesus gives with endless glory. 11Here's a reliable saying:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If we endure, we'll reign with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> If we're not faithful, he'll stay faithful</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Remind the saints of that, and solemnly charge them in front of God not to argue about words. That doesn't accomplish anything, and it ruins people that listen to it. 15Be diligent about presenting yourself to God as a worker that's not ashamed, who correctly interprets the truth that's in the message. 16Avoid worldly, foolish talk; it'll lead to more ungodliness 17and eat away like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that; 18they've wandered off from the truth and say the resurrection has already happened. They're overturning the faith of some. 19But, God's foundation stands firm with this seal: "The LORD knows who's his" [Num 16:5]; and "Everybody that commits themselves to the LORD must quit sinning" [Num 16:26]. 20A big house has gold and silver containers, but wood and clay ones too. 21If people keep themselves clean from foolish worldly ideas, they'll serve as containers for the Householder's honorable uses—set aside for good uses. 22Run away from youthful desires and run after goodness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart. 23Stay away from foolish, ignorant speculation, because you know it produces conflict. 24The Lord's servant must not quarrel; he must be kind toward everyone, able to teach, not reacting when he's wronged. 25He needs to correct gently those who oppose the truth, because God may allow them to change to knowing the truth 26and to come to their senses out of the devil's trap, who's held them captive under his will.</span>
