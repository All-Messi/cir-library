## 2 Timothy Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, my son, <u>you</u> be strong in the grace that Christ Jesus <em>gives</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>What you’ve heard from me among many witnesses entrust to faithful men that can teach others. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Endure hardship with <em>me</em> like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>A soldier doesn’t get mixed up in the affairs of daily life while he’s a soldier. That way he can please his recruiter. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>An athlete doesn’t win the garland unless he competes by the rules. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A laboring farmer should be first to share in his crops. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Think about what I’m saying; the Lord will help you understand.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Tim 2:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David according to the gospel I preach, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>that I endure hardship for—even to the point of being in chains like a criminal. But God’s word is not in chains. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So I endure everything for the ones he has chosen so they can obtain the salvation that Christ Jesus gives with endless glory. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Here’s a reliable saying: <em>“If we’ve suffered with him, we’ll live with him.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>   </em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> we endure, we’ll reign with him.</em> <em>	</em><em>	If we </em><em>deny</em><em> him, he’ll deny us.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> we’re not faithful, he’ll stay faithful</em> <em>	because he can’t deny himself.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>2 Tim 2:8-13</strong> <strong>Stay</strong><strong>ing on </strong><strong>Course</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Remind <em>the saints</em> of that, and solemnly charge <em>them</em> in front of God not to argue about words. That doesn’t accomplish anything, and it ruins people that listen to it. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Be diligent about presenting yourself to God as a worker that’s not ashamed, who correctly interprets the truth that’s in the message. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Avoid worldly, foolish talk; it’ll lead to more ungodliness <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>and eat away like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>they’ve wandered off from the truth and say the resurrection has already happened. They’re overturning the faith of some. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>But, God’s foundation stands firm with this seal: <strong>“The </strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong> knows who’s his</strong><strong>”</strong> <strong>[Num</strong><strong> 16:5]</strong>; and <em>“Everybody that </em><em>commits themselves to the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> must </em><em>quit</em><em> </em><em>sinning</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Num</strong><strong> 16:26]</strong>. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>A big house has gold and silver containers, but wood and clay ones too. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>If people keep themselves clean <em>from foolish worldly ideas</em>, they’ll serve as containers for the Householder’s honorable uses—set aside for good uses. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Run away from youthful desires and run after goodness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Stay away from foolish, ignorant speculation, because you know it produces conflict. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel; he must be kind toward everyone, able to teach, not reacting when he’s wronged. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> needs to</em> correct gently those who oppose <em>the truth</em>, because God may allow them to change to <em>knowing</em> the truth <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>and to come to their senses out of the devil’s trap, who’s held them captive under his will. <strong>2 Tim 2:14-26</strong> <strong>Future Apostasy</strong></span>
