## 2 Timothy Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be aware that difficult times will come later on. 2People will be selfish, money-loving, proud and arrogant, slanderous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3without natural affection, heartless, slanderous gossips, without self-control, vicious, not loving what's good, 4treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure more than God. 5They'll have the trappings of religion but deny its power. Avoid people like that. 6They're the kind that sneak into families and seduce morally weak women that are weighed down with sins and lured on by various desires, 7whomas are always learning but never able to find the truth. 8Those who oppose the truth are like Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses. They're corrupt in mind; they're rejected as far as the faith is concerned. 9They won't get anywhere because their foolishness will be obvious to everybody just like the foolishness of those men was.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But you have followed my teaching, manner of living, faith, endurance, love, perseverance, 11persecutions, and sufferings like what happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I bore up under such persecutions, and the Lord delivered me from them. 12Everybody that wants to live godly in Christ Jesus will face persecution. 13Evil people and imposters will get worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14But you stick with what you've learned and become confident about it; you know where you learned it. 15From the time you were a baby, you knew the holy scriptures, which can make you wise about salvation by trust in Christ Jesus. 16All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, refuting error, correcting faults, and training in goodness. 17That's how God's servant can be qualified and equipped for every good thing he needs to do.</span>
