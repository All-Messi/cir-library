## 2 Timothy Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Be aware that difficult times will come later on. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>People will be selfish, money-loving, proud and arrogant, slanderous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>without natural affection, heartless, slanderous gossips, without self-control, vicious, not loving what’s good, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure more than God. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They’ll have the trappings of religion but deny its power. Avoid people like that. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They’re the kind that sneak into families and seduce morally weak women that are weighed down with sins and<em> </em>lured on by various desires, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>who</em><em><sup>mas</sup></em><em> are</em> always learning but never able to find the truth. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Those who oppose the truth are like Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses. They’re corrupt in mind; they’re rejected as far as the faith is concerned. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They won’t get anywhere because their foolishness will be obvious to everybody just like the foolishness of those <em>men</em> was<em>.</em></span>

### Expecting Persecution


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> But <u>you</u> have followed my teaching, manner of living, faith, endurance, love, perseverance, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>persecutions, and sufferings like what happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I bore up under such persecutions, and the Lord delivered me from them. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Everybody that wants to live godly in Christ Jesus will face persecution. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Evil people and imposters will get worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But <u>you</u> stick with what you’ve learned and become confident about it; you know where you learned it. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>From the time you were a baby, you knew the holy scriptures, which can make you wise about salvation by trust in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>All scripture <em>is</em> breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, refuting error, correcting faults, and training in goodness. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>That’s how God’s servant can be qualified and equipped for every good thing he needs to do.</span>
