## 2 Timothy Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I solemnly charge you in front of God and Christ Jesus—who will judge the living and the dead—and by his appearing and kingdom: 2proclaim the message. Be ready in normal or unusual times. Refute, reprimand, encourage patiently with teaching. 3The time will come when people won't pay attention to sound teaching. They'll draw teachers to themselves that reinforce their own desires and say what they want to hear. 4They'll wander off from the true message and turn to myths. 5You be self-controlled, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm already being poured out like a drink offering. The time for me to depart. 7I've fought a good fight, I've finished the course, I've kept the faith. 8From now on, a crown for righteousness waits for me. The Lord, the just Judge, will give it to me that day, and not just to me, but to everybody that has loved his coming.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Do your best to get here soon. 10Demas has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica—he loved the present age. Crescens went to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia. 11Luke's the only one here. Pick up Mark and bring him with you; I can use him for ministry. 12I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 13When you come, bring the coat I left in Troas with Carpus, and get the scrolls, especially the parchments. 14Alexander, the precious-metal worker, did me a lot of harm. The Lord will repay him accordingly. 15You be careful around him, too, because he really opposed our message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> At my first hearing, nobody came to my defense. May the Lord not hold it against them. 17But, the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so I could fully deliver the proclamation for the Gentiles to hear. He delivered me out of the lion's mouth. 18He'll deliver me from every evil deed and save me into his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forevermore. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus. 20Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus sick. 21Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the believers send their greetings. 22The Lord be with your spirit.</span>
