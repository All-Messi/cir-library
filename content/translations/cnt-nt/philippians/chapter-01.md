## Philippians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus, to the saints in Philippi and <em>their</em> bishops and deacons. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 1:1-2</p>

### Prayer for the Philippians


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> I’m grateful for the memories I have of you. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>I gladly mention you in my prayers <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>because of your fellowship in the gospel since day one. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I’m confident that the good work God began in you he’ll keep perfecting till Christ comes. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>It’s right for me to regard you that way because in my imprisonment and defense of the gospel, you’ve shared your grace with me. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>God is witness, I long for you with the affections Jesus has. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I pray that your love will keep growing along with knowledge and insight <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>so you’ll approve what’s excellent, be sincere, and keep your conscience clear till Christ comes. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>That way the fruit that comes from goodness will fill you, <em>the fruit</em> that comes through Jesus Christ to God’s glory and praise.</span>

### Progress Despite Limiting Circumstances


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I want you to know that what’s happened to me has turned out to promote the good news. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>My imprisonment has become well-known throughout the Praetorian Guard and elsewhere. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>More believers have trusted in the Lord and because of my imprisonment have dared to speak the message more boldly. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Some people are preaching Christ out of spite and strife; others out of good will. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Some do it out of love because they know I’m set to defend the good news. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>The others present him out of rivalry, not sincerely. They think they can stir up trouble for me in <em>my </em>imprisonment. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>What then? Whether in pretense or truth, Christ is getting presented and I’m glad. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I know it’ll lead to my release through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>That fits with my deep desire and hope that I’ll never be shamed, but hold Christ in high honor in my body whether by life or death—as always, so now. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>For me, to live <em>is</em> Christ, to die <em>is</em> better. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But if living means productive work, I don’t know what to choose. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>I’m torn between wanting to leave and be with Christ (better for me) <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and <em>wanting to</em> stay (more necessary for you). <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>I’m convinced I’ll stay and stand with you for your progress and joy in the faith, <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>so the pride you have in Christ Jesus will increase in connection with me when I can be with you again.<strong>           </strong><strong></span>

### Living in a Way Fit for Christ


<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Make sure you conduct yourselves in a way that’s appropriate for the good news about Christ. Then, whether I can come to see you or not, I can hear that you’re standing firm in one spirit with one mind, that you’re striving together by trusting in the good news, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>and that you’re not alarmed by your opponents. Their opposition is evidence for their destruction and your salvation—a situation that comes from God. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>For the sake of Christ, you’ve had the opportunity to believe in him and suffer for him. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>You’re facing the same struggle you saw me face and hear that I’m facing now.</span>
