## Philippians Chapter 4

### :1 	Keeping a Positive Outlook

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, fellow Christians loved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord. Keeping a Positive Outlook</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I urge Euodia and Syntyche to work in harmony in the Lord. 3Yes, and I ask you, loyal yoke fellow, help them. They struggled together with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Always bepl happy in the Lord; I'll say it again, be happy. 5Let everybody see yourpl gentle spirit. The Lord is near. 6Don't worry, but in prayer and supplication make your requests to God accompanied by gratitude. 7God's peace, which goes beyond understanding, will keep watch over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> So think about what's true, honorable, just, pure, worth praising, morally excellent. 9Practice what you've learned and received, what you've heard and seen in me; and the God who brings peace will be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> I was so glad when you showed your concern for me once again. For a long time, you didn't have a chance to demonstrate it. 11I'm not saying that because I've been in need. I've learned to be content in any circumstance, 12humble or otherwise. In any and all things, I've learned the secret of how to be full or hungry, to have a lot or to lack. 13I can do everything by the One who enables me. 14But you've done well to share in my difficulties. Appreciation for Philippians' Support</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> You Philippians know that back when I'd presented the good news to you and left Macedonia, you were the only church that supported me financially. 16Even in Thessalonica time and again you sent gifts to help with my expenses. 17I'm not looking for the gift, but for the balance that's building up in your account. 18I have everything I need and more. Epaphroditus brought me what you sent, a sweet aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God. 19And in Christ Jesus, my God will take care of your needs out of his wealth in glory. 20To our God and Father be glory forevermore. Amen. Greetings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The Christians that are with me send their regards. 22All the saints say hello, notably the ones in Caesar's household.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</span>
