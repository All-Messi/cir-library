## Philippians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, if there’s any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any fellowship with the Spirit, any affection and compassion, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>fill me with happiness. That way you’ll have the same attitude, love, purpose, and unity of spirit. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t do anything selfish out of empty conceit, but in humility consider each other more important than yourself. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Don’t just look at your own interests, but at the interests of other people too. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Take the attitude Christ Jesus took.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Although he was in the form of deity, he didn’t consider being equal to God something to hang onto.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He emptied himself, and took the place of a servant. In the form of a man,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>he humbled himself to the point of dying, even dying on a cross.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So God lifted him up above all others</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>so every knee in heaven, on earth, and under the earth would kneel to him;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>and every tongue would acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord— to the glory of God the Father.</span>

### Being Lights in the World


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, as you’ve always followed my instructions—whether I’m around or not, work out <em>the implications of</em> your salvation with fear and trembling. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>God is at work in you to will and do what he delights in. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Do everything without grumbling or arguing <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>so you’ll be God’s blameless, innocent, well-behaved children. You’re living in a crooked, perverse time, where you shine like lights in the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Hold onto the life-giving message so when Christ comes, I can take satisfaction in you because I didn’t labor for nothing. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Even if I get poured out like a drink offering on the altar in service to your faith, I’ll rejoice and rejoice with you. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>You’ll<sup>p</sup> rejoice too along with me. <strong>Phil 2:12-18</strong> <strong>Timothy’s Coming</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I hope to send Timothy to lift my spirits by finding out how you’re doing. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>I don’t have anybody like-minded who will sincerely concern himself with your welfare. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>Other</em><em> people</em> tend to look after their own concerns more than Christ’s. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But you know how valuable he has proved to be, how he has served with me in the good news like a child with his father. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>So I hope to send him as soon as I see how my situation <em>here </em>turns out. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>I’m confident in the Lord that <u>I</u> can come soon as well.</span>

### News About Epaproditus


<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I’ve also needed to send Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your messenger to my need. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He’s been longing to see you; he’s been anxious because you heard he was sick. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He <u>was</u> sick—to the point of death, but God had mercy on him—and on me so I wouldn’t have grief on top of grief. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>More earnestly, then, I’ve sent him so when you see him, you can be happy, and I won’t feel so sad. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Welcome him in the Lord with joy; hold men like him in high regard. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>He nearly died because of his work for Christ, risking his life to finish your service to me.</span>
