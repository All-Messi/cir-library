## Philippians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, if there's any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any fellowship with the Spirit, any affection and compassion, 2fill me with happiness. That way you'll have the same attitude, love, purpose, and unity of spirit. 3Don't do anything selfish out of empty conceit, but in humility consider each other more important than yourself. 4Don't just look at your own interests, but at the interests of other people too. 5Take the attitude Christ Jesus took.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Although he was in the form of deity,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He emptied himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> So God lifted him up above all others</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> So, as you've always followed my instructions—whether I'm around or not, work out the implications of your salvation with fear and trembling. 13God is at work in you to will and do what he delights in. 14Do everything without grumbling or arguing 15so you'll be God's blameless, innocent, well-behaved children. You're living in a crooked, perverse time, where you shine like lights in the world.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Hold onto the life-giving message so when Christ comes, I can take satisfaction in you because I didn't labor for nothing. 17Even if I get poured out like a drink offering on the altar in service to your faith, I'll rejoice and rejoice with you. 18You'llp rejoice too along with me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> I hope to send Timothy to lift my spirits by finding out how you're doing. 20I don't have anybody like-minded who will sincerely concern himself with your welfare. 21Other people tend to look after their own concerns more than Christ's. 22But you know how valuable he has proved to be, how he has served with me in the good news like a child with his father. 23So I hope to send him as soon as I see how my situation here turns out. 24I'm confident in the Lord that I can come soon as well.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> I've also needed to send Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your messenger to my need. 26He's been longing to see you; he's been anxious because you heard he was sick. 27He was sick—to the point of death, but God had mercy on him—and on me so I wouldn't have grief on top of grief. 28More earnestly, then, I've sent him so when you see him, you can be happy, and I won't feel so sad. 29Welcome him in the Lord with joy; hold men like him in high regard. 30He nearly died because of his work for Christ, risking his life to finish your service to me.</span>
