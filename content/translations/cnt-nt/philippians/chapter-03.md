## Philippians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>So, family <em>of Christ</em>, be happy in the Lord. Writing things like these is not hard for me to do, and it reinforces you. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Watch out for dogs, evil doers, the ‘false Circumcision.’ <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><u>We</u> are the ‘Circumcision,’ who serve by God’s spirit, who take pride in Christ Jesus, who don’t put confidence in what’s physical. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If anybody <u>could</u> put confidence in that, I sure <em>could</em>: <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> was</em> circumcised on the eighth day,<em> </em>from the nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, the truest of Hebrews. As to the Law, <em>I was </em>a Pharisee. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>As to zeal, <em>I </em>persecuted the church. As to legal goodness, <em>I was </em>blameless. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>But</em><sup>ms</sup> what were gains to me I consider losses for Christ. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Everything’s a loss compared to knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I lost everything on account of him and considered it rubbish so I could gain him. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I don’t have a goodness of my own—from keeping the Law; <em>I have</em> a goodness <em>that comes</em> from trusting Christ, a goodness that God gives conditioned on trust. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> want</em> to know him, the power his resurrection has, and fellowship with his sufferings. <em>I want to live in </em>conformity with his death <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>so I can attain resurrection from the dead, whatever it takes.<strong>    </strong></span>

### Pressing on Toward Perfection


<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I urge Euodia and Syntyche to work in harmony in the Lord. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Yes, and I ask you, loyal yoke fellow, help them. They struggled together with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names <em>are</em> in the Book of Life.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Always be<sup>pl</sup> happy in the Lord; I’ll say <em>it</em> again, be happy. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Let everybody see your<sup>pl </sup>gentle <em>spirit</em>. The Lord <em>is</em> near. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Don’t worry, but in prayer and supplication make your requests to God accompanied by gratitude. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>God’s peace, which goes beyond understanding, will keep watch over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So think about what’s true, honorable, just, pure, worth praising, morally excellent. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Practice what you’ve learned and received, <em>what you’ve </em>heard and seen in me; and the God who brings peace will be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>I was so glad when you showed your concern for me once again. For a long time, you didn’t have a chance to demonstrate it. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>I’m not saying that because I’ve been in need. I’ve learned to be content in any circumstance, <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>humble or otherwise. In any and all things, I’ve learned the secret of how to be full or hungry, to have a lot or to lack. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I can do everything by the One who enables me. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But you’ve done well to share in my difficulties.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 4:2-14</p>

### Appreciation for Philippians’ Support


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>I’m not already perfect, but I press on toward what Christ laid hold of me for. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>I don’t consider myself to have achieved it; but forgetting what’s behind and reaching out for what’s ahead, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I press on toward the goal, the prize that comes from God’s upward call in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>As many as are perfect should take that attitude. If in anything you have a different attitude, God will make it clear for you. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>However, let’s keep conducting ourselves at the level we’ve reached.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 3:12-16</p>

### Following Paul’s Example


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>You Philippians know that back when I’d presented the good news to you and left Macedonia, you were the only church that supported me financially. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Even in Thessalonica time and again you sent <em>gifts</em> to help with my expenses. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I’m not looking for the gift, but for the balance that’s building up in your account. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I have everything I need and more. Epaphroditus brought me what you sent, a sweet aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>And in Christ Jesus, my God will take care of your needs out of his wealth in glory. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>To our God and Father <em>be</em><em> </em>glory forevermore. Amen.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Phil 4:15-20</p>

### Greetings


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>Imitate me and watch the ones that follow our example. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Many live as enemies of the cross, as I used to say and tell you now, weeping. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Their end is destruction, their God is their stomach, their honor is their shame, their minds are on earthly things. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Our citizenship lies in heaven, from where we wait for our Savior to come. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He’ll transform our humble bodies to be like his glorious body. <em>He’ll do that</em> by using the power he used to subject everything to himself. <strong>4</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>So, fellow Christians loved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

### :1 Keeping a Positive Outlook


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The Christians that are with me send their regards. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>All the saints say hello, notably the ones in Caesar’s household.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with your spirit.</span>
