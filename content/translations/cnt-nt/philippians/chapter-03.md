## Philippians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, family of Christ, be happy in the Lord. Writing things like these is not hard for me to do, and it reinforces you. 2Watch out for dogs, evil doers, the 'false Circumcision.' 3We are the 'Circumcision,' who serve by God's spirit, who take pride in Christ Jesus, who don't put confidence in what's physical. 4If anybody could put confidence in that, I sure could: 5I was circumcised on the eighth day, from the nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, the truest of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee. 6As to zeal, I persecuted the church. As to legal goodness, I was blameless. 7Butms what were gains to me I consider losses for Christ. 8Everything's a loss compared to knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I lost everything on account of him and considered it rubbish so I could gain him. 9I don't have a goodness of my own—from keeping the Law; I have a goodness that comes from trusting Christ, a goodness that God gives conditioned on trust. 10I want to know him, the power his resurrection has, and fellowship with his sufferings. I want to live in conformity with his death 11so I can attain resurrection from the dead, whatever it takes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I'm not already perfect, but I press on toward what Christ laid hold of me for. 13I don't consider myself to have achieved it; but forgetting what's behind and reaching out for what's ahead, 14I press on toward the goal, the prize that comes from God's upward call in Christ Jesus. 15As many as are perfect should take that attitude. If in anything you have a different attitude, God will make it clear for you. 16However, let's keep conducting ourselves at the level we've reached.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Imitate me and watch the ones that follow our example. 18Many live as enemies of the cross, as I used to say and tell you now, weeping. 19Their end is destruction, their God is their stomach, their honor is their shame, their minds are on earthly things. 20Our citizenship lies in heaven, from where we wait for our Savior to come. 21He'll transform our humble bodies to be like his glorious body. He'll do that by using the power he used to subject everything to himself.</span>
