## Hebrews Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Faith is confidence about what <em>we</em> hope for, certainty about what <em>we</em> can’t see. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By faith people of old received testimony.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>By faith we understand that God spoke the universe into existence, so what we see didn’t come from something previous.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. Through it he received testimony that he was good. (God testified in response to his gifts.) Through it he’s still speaking though he’s dead.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 11:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>By faith Enoch didn’t die. <strong>“</strong><strong><em>God took him up, and he </em></strong><strong>simply</strong><strong><em> wasn’t there</em></strong><strong><em>” </em></strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 5:24]</strong><em>.</em> Before God took him up, <em>the ancient writings</em> say “<em>he pleased God”</em><em> </em>[<strong>Gen 5:22-</strong><strong>24;</strong> Sir 44:16; Enoch 70:1-4; Wis 4:10].  <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Without faith a person can’t please God. Whoever comes to him has to believe he exists and rewards people who look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> By faith Noah built an ark that saved his family. God had warned him about things he couldn’t see yet, and he paid attention to the warning. By faith he condemned <em>his</em> world and inherited the results of the goodness that comes from faith.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 11:5-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>By faith Abraham obeyed when God called him, and went out to a place he’d inherit later. He went without knowing where he was going. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>By faith he lived as a foreigner in a land God had promised him. He lived there as a nomad in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He did it because he was looking for a city that had foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> By faith Sarah, too, though she couldn’t have children, God enabled to conceive even after child-bearing years. She did so because she had faith in the One that promised. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So, from one <em>man</em> that was as good as dead, there descended as many as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 11:8-12</p>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> These all died in faith without receiving the promises. They saw them a long way off and greeted them from afar. They regarded themselves as foreigners and temporary residents on earth. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>People that say things like that show they’re looking for a homeland. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>If they were looking to where they’d come from, they could’ve gone back. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>But they longed for a better, heavenly homeland. So God’s not ashamed of being their God, as he showed by preparing a city for them.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 11:13-16</p>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>By faith Abraham, when God put him to the test, <em>went ahead and </em>offered up Isaac. <em>The man</em> that was so happy to receive the promises offered up the only <em>son</em> he had. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He was the one God told, <strong><em>“Your </em></strong><strong><em>lineage</em></strong><strong><em> will descend through Isaac”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 21:12]</strong>.<em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He figured that God could even raise Isaac from the dead; in a way, that’s what happened.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau even about future things.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>By faith Joseph, when he was about to die, remembered the <em>future </em>exodus of Israel’s descendants and gave instructions about his bones.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months. They saw he was a handsome little boy and weren’t afraid of Pharaoh’s decree.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> By faith Moses, when he grew up, refused to be considered the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>He chose to suffer mistreatment with God’s people rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a while. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>He considered the disgrace of Christ more valuable than the wealth of Egypt because he was looking on ahead to the later reward. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>By faith he left Egypt, not afraid of Pharaoh’s anger, and endured as if he saw the One that’s invisible. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>By faith he kept the Passover and the smearing of blood <em>on the doorposts </em>so the one that destroyed the firstborn wouldn’t touch them. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>By faith he crossed the Red Sea as on dry ground. When the Egyptians tried it, they drowned.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after the Israelites circled them for seven days.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> By faith Rahab the harlot didn’t perish with the disobedient because she welcomed the spies in peace.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 11:30-31</p>

### Extreme Faithfulness


<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> What more can I say? There’s not enough time to talk about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David and Samuel, and the prophets. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>By faith they conquered kingdoms, did good things, received promises, shut the mouths of lions, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>extinguished the power of fire, escaped the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, drove out armies of foreigners. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some<sup>mas</sup> were beaten to death, rather than accept deliverance so they could gain a better resurrection. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>Others received public torture and scourging, <em>were put in </em>chains and imprisoned. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They were stoned, sawn in two, murdered with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, oppressed, abused; <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>wandering in deserts and mountains, <em>hiding in </em>caves and holes in the ground. The world didn’t deserve them. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>They all received testimony through their faith, but they didn’t receive the promise. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>God provided something better for us so that <em>what they anticipated</em> wasn’t completed till we received it.<strong> </strong><strong></span>
