## Hebrews Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Long ago God spoke to our ancestors by prophets in many parts and different ways. 2In these last days he has spoken to us in a Son. He made the universe through him and made him heir of everything. 3He's the radiance of God's glory, the exact image of his nature, and upholds everything by his powerful word. When he'd made purification for sins, he sat down on the right side of the Majesty on high, 4and became as much better than angels as he inherited a better name than they have.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> To what angel did God ever say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When he brings the Firstborn into the world, he says, "All God's angels are to worship him" [Deut 32:43 LXX].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He says in regard to angels,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But he says to the Son,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> You've loved goodness and hated lawlessness,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> They'll perish, but you'll remain;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> What angel did he ever tell,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Aren't they ministering spirits that he sends to help the heirs of salvation?</span>
