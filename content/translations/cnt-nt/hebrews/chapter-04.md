## Hebrews Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Let’s be alert so none of us<em> </em>even looks like we’re coming short of a promise he left behind about <em>“going into his rest.”</em> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We’ve had good news presented to us just like they did. But what they heard didn’t do them any good because they didn’t combine hearing with believing. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><u>We</u> who believe <u>do</u> go into rest like he said, <strong><em>“As I swore in my anger,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	‘</em></strong><strong><em><u>They</u></em></strong><strong><em> are </em></strong><strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong><strong><em> going into my rest!</em></strong><strong><em>’”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</span>

### ] He finished his work when he founded the world. 4In one text it says of the seventh day, “On the seventh day God rested from his work” [Gen 2:2];


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>and in this place, <strong><em>“They’re not going to go into my rest!</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 95:11]</strong><strong><em>	</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>Since there’s still a rest for some to enter, and <em>since </em>the ones that received good news before didn’t enter <em>it</em> because they disbelieved, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>he established another day, <em>“Today.”</em><strong> </strong>He said at David’s time much later like he’d said before, <strong><em>“Today, if you hear him</em></strong><strong><em> speaking </em></strong>to you<strong><em>,</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>don’t harden your hearts</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>If Joshua had given them rest, <em>God</em> wouldn’t be talking after that about another day. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So there’s still a rest for God’s people. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Whoever rests from his work has rested like God did. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Let’s be diligent then about going into that rest so none of us fall after the same kind of disobedience.  <strong> </strong> <strong>God’s </strong><strong>Living </strong><strong>Word</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>God’s word is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It cuts through to the separation of soul and spirit, and bones and marrow; it judges a person’s inner thoughts and intentions. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Nothing created is hidden from him; everything is naked and laid bare to the eyes of one we’re dealing with.</span>

### Our Great High Priest


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We have a great high priest that’s passed through the sky, Jesus the Son of God. So let’s hold onto what we’re committed to. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He’s a high priest that can sympathize with our weaknesses because he has faced every temptation we have, but without sinning. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So let’s boldly draw near to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace when we need it.</span>
