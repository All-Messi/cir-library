## Hebrews Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let's be alert so none of us even looks like we're coming short of a promise he left behind about "going into his rest." 2We've had good news presented to us just like they did. But what they heard didn't do them any good because they didn't combine hearing with believing. 3We who believe do go into rest like he said, He finished his work when he founded the world. 4In one text it says of the seventh day,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Since there's still a rest for some to enter, and since the ones that received good news before didn't enter it because they disbelieved, 7he established another day, "Today." He said at David's time much later like he'd said before,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> If Joshua had given them rest, God wouldn't be talking after that about another day. 9So there's still a rest for God's people. 10Whoever rests from his work has rested like God did. 11Let's be diligent then about going into that rest so none of us fall after the same kind of disobedience.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> God's word is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It cuts through to the separation of soul and spirit, and bones and marrow; it judges a person's inner thoughts and intentions. 13Nothing created is hidden from him; everything is naked and laid bare to the eyes of one we're dealing with.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> We have a great high priest that's passed through the sky, Jesus the Son of God. So let's hold onto what we're committed to. 15He's a high priest that can sympathize with our weaknesses because he has faced every temptation we have, but without sinning. 16So let's boldly draw near to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace when we need it.</span>
