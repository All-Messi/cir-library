## Hebrews Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>So we need to pay close attention to what we’ve heard so we never drift away from it. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>What God said through angels stood firm, and every sin received the punishment it deserved. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>So how will we get off if we neglect such a great salvation? After the Lord spoke it, the ones that heard it confirmed it to us. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>God testified alongside them with signs, wonders, and various miracles and gifts that the Holy Spirit dispensed as he saw fit.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 2:1-4</p>

### Mankind as Caretaker of Creation


<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>It wasn’t to angels that God subjected the future world we’re talking about. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In a certain place one has testified, <strong><em>“W</em></strong><strong><em>hat are people that you remember them </em></strong><strong><em>or visit </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em>m?</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><strong><em>Y</em></strong><strong><em>ou made </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em>m lower than angels</em></strong><strong><em> for a little while,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	crowned </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em>m with glory and honor, </em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>     </em></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><strong><em>and put everything under their authority</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 8:5-7 LXX</strong><strong>]</strong><strong>.</strong> “Putting everything under their authority” means God didn’t leave anything that wasn’t under them, but we don’t see that yet. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We do see Jesus, however, <em>“made lower than angels for a little while</em>,<em>”</em> so by God’s grace he could taste death for every<em>one</em>. Now we see him “crowned with glory and honor” because he suffered death.</span>

### The Son’s Incarnation


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Everything is through him and for him. It was appropriate, then, in bringing many children to glory, that he make perfect the Author of their salvation with suffering. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Both the sanctifier and the sanctified have the same <em>nature</em>. That means he’s not ashamed to call them <em>“siblings.”</em> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong><strong><em>“I</em></strong><strong><em>’ll present you to my siblings</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong><em> sing your praises in the congregation”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 22:22]</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Again, <strong><em>“I’ll trust him”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 8:17 LXX]</strong><strong>, </strong> <strong><em>“ . . . </em></strong><strong><em>I and the children God gave me</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 8:18]</strong><strong>.   </strong><strong>	 </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 2:10-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Since <em>“the children”</em> exist in flesh and blood, he took on flesh and blood so that by dying he could take the power of death away from the one that has it—the devil. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>That way</em> he could free people that the fear of death had enslaved as long as they were alive. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>It’s clear he’s not <em>here </em>to help angels, but <em>to help</em> Abraham’s descendants. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So he needed to be like people in every respect so he could become a merciful, faithful high priest in things that have to do with God and could atone for people’s sins. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Since he faced temptation in what he suffered, he can help those who face temptation.</span>
