## Hebrews Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So we need to pay close attention to what we've heard so we never drift away from it. 2What God said through angels stood firm, and every sin received the punishment it deserved. 3So how will we get off if we neglect such a great salvation? After the Lord spoke it, the ones that heard it confirmed it to us. 4God testified alongside them with signs, wonders, and various miracles and gifts that the Holy Spirit dispensed as he saw fit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> It wasn't to angels that God subjected the future world we're talking about. 6In a certain place one has testified,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You made them lower than angels for a little while, 8and put everything under their authority" [Ps 8:5-7 LXX]. "Putting everything under their authority" means God didn't leave anything that wasn't under them, but we don't see that yet. 9We do see Jesus, however, "made lower than angels for a little while," so by God's grace he could taste death for everyone. Now we see him "crowned with glory and honor" because he suffered death.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Everything is through him and for him. It was appropriate, then, in bringing many children to glory, that he make perfect the Author of their salvation with suffering. 11Both the sanctifier and the sanctified have the same nature. That means he's not ashamed to call them "siblings."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Again, "I'll trust him" [Is 8:17 LXX],</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Since "the children" exist in flesh and blood, he took on flesh and blood so that by dying he could take the power of death away from the one that has it—the devil. 15That way he could free people that the fear of death had enslaved as long as they were alive. 16It's clear he's not here to help angels, but to help Abraham's descendants. 17So he needed to be like people in every respect so he could become a merciful, faithful high priest in things that have to do with God and could atone for people's sins. 18Since he faced temptation in what he suffered, he can help those who face temptation.</span>
