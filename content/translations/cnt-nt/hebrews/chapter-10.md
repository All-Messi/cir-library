## Hebrews Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Law has a shadow of good things to come, not the very things themselves; so, by the same sacrifices every year, it can never make the ones perfect that are drawing near. 2Otherwise, wouldn't those sacrifices have ceased to be offered? The worshipers wouldn't feel like sinners anymore because they would've been cleansed once and for all. 3But every year the sacrifices remind people that they're still sinners. 4The blood of bulls and goats can't take away sins.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> So when he comes into the world, he says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> You didn't delight in whole burnt offerings</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Then I said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> When he says above, "You didn't want or delight in sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins," which are offered according to the Law, 9then he says, "I've come to do your will." He takes away the first to establish the second. 10By that will, the one-time offering of Christ's "body" has made us holy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Every day, priests stand ministering and offering the same sacrifices over and over that can never take away sins. 12But he offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down on the right hand of God, 13and is waiting till his enemies become his "footstool." 14By one offering, he permanently perfected the ones he sanctified.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Holy Spirit also testifies. After he said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Where there's forgiveness for sins, there's no more sacrificing for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So we have confidence about entering the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus. 20We go in by the new and living way that he has opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh. 21We have a great priest over God's house; 22so let's draw near with a true heart in full assurance that comes from trust. Let's draw near with hearts sprinkled from a guilty conscience and bodies washed with pure water. 23Let's hold onto our hope confidently without wavering; we can trust the One that promised. 24Let's think carefully how we can encourage one another to love and good works. 25Let's not quit going to church like some do; let's encourage one another, especially as we see "the time" coming close. 26If we keep on sinning deliberately after we know the truth, there's no more sacrifice to be offered. 27There's a fearful dread of judgment and the furious fire that will consume God's opponents. 28Anybody that disregards the Law of Moses, dies without mercy at the testimony from two or three witnesses. 29How much more severe punishment do you suppose people deserve who trample the Son of God under their feet, regard as unclean the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and insult the Spirit of grace? 30We know who said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> It's a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> Remember the earlier days when you first saw the light and suffered such hardships. 33You were publicly shamed with insults and difficulties and shared with other people that were abused that way. 34You sympathized with people in prison and accepted it joyfully when authorities confiscated your possessions, because you knew you had a better possession that lasts. 35So don't lose confidence; an important payment is coming. 36You need to hang in there so, once you've done God's will, you'll obtain the promise,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> We aren't among those who "give up" and get destroyed; we have "faith" to the preserving of our "life."</span>
