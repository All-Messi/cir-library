## Hebrews Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So let's get past the basics about Christ and press on to maturity. Let's not lay again a foundation about repentance from dead works, and about faith toward God, 2teaching about baptizings, laying on hands, resurrection, eternal judgment. 3We'll get past the basics, God willing. 4You can't renew people to repentance that have once seen the light, tasted the heavenly gift, partaken of the Holy Spirit, 5tasted God's good word and the powers of the age to come—6and then fall away. They crucify to themselves God's Son all over again and hold him up to public disgrace. 7God blesses the ground that soaks up frequent rains and produces crops farmers can use. 8If it grows thorns and briars, it's worthless and close to being accursed. It ends up getting burned off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But we're convinced that in matters of salvation you're better than that, despite what we're saying. 10God is just and remembers your work and love in his name when you ministered to the saints—and still do. 11We want each of you to keep showing that same diligence, which will endure in the end to a firm hope. 12That way you won't get sluggish. By faith and endurance, you'll be imitating people that obtain promises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When God made his promise to Abraham, he didn't have anything greater to swear by; so "he swore by himself [Gen 22:16], 14I'll certainly bless you and multiply you" [Gen 22:17]. 15After Abraham had waited a long time, he did receive the promise. 16People swear by something greater and settle every dispute with an oath to confirm it. 17That's what God did when he wanted to show more certainly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable his plan was: he guaranteed it with an oath. 18By two unchangeable things, then (God can't lie), we can have great confidence who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope we headed for. 19That hope anchors our soul; it's a hope that's certain and reliable. It leads inside the curtain, 20where Jesus went as a forerunner for us when he became "a high priest after the order of Melchizedek."</span>
