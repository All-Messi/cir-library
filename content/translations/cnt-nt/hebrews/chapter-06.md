## Hebrews Chapter 6

### Getting Beyond the Basics

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So let’s get past the basics about Christ and press on to maturity. Let’s not lay again a foundation about repentance from dead works, and <em>about</em> faith toward God, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>teaching about baptizings, laying on hands, resurrection, eternal judgment. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We’ll get past the basics, God willing. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>You can’t renew people to repentance that have once seen the light, tasted the heavenly gift, partaken of the Holy Spirit, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>tasted God’s good word and the powers of the age to come—<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>and then fall away. They crucify to themselves God’s Son all over again and hold him up to public disgrace. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>God blesses the ground that soaks up frequent rains and produces crops farmers can use. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If it grows thorns and briars, it’s worthless and close to being accursed. It ends up getting burned off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But we’re convinced that in matters of salvation you’re better than that, despite what we’re saying. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>God is just and remembers your work and love in his name when you ministered to the saints—and still do. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>We want each of you to keep showing that same diligence, which will endure in the end to a firm hope. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>That way you won’t get sluggish. By faith and endurance, you’ll be imitating people that obtain promises.</span>

### God’s Oath to Abraham


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When God made his promise to Abraham, he didn’t have anything greater to swear by; so <strong><em>“he swore by himself</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 22:16]</strong><em>,</em><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><strong><em>I’</em></strong><strong><em>ll certainly bless you and multiply</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>you</em><strong><em>” </em></strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 22:17]</strong>. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>After Abraham had waited a long time, he did receive the promise. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>People swear by something greater and settle every dispute with an oath to confirm it. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>That’s what God did when he wanted to show more certainly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable his plan was: he guaranteed <em>it</em> with an oath. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>By two unchangeable things, then (God can’t lie), we can have great confidence who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope we headed for. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>That hope anchors our soul; it’s a hope that’s certain and reliable. It leads inside the curtain, <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>where Jesus went as a forerunner for us when he became <em>“a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.”</em></span>
