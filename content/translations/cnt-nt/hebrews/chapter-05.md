## Hebrews Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Every high priest is appointed for people from among people to deal with things that relate to God, and to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He’s somebody that can deal gently with the ignorant and erring because he has weaknesses too. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>On that account he’s obligated to offer <em>sacrifices</em> for his own sins as well as the people’s. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>And, nobody takes the honor to himself; he’s called by God like Aaron was.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 5:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>In the same way, Christ didn’t exalt himself to become a high priest, but the One that said, <strong><em>“You’re my Son;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>I’ve begotten you today</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 2:7]</strong>,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>says in another <em>place</em>, <strong><em>“You’re a priest forever</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em><u>after the order of Melchizedek</u></em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 110:4]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When he was in the flesh, he offered up prayers and pleas, with tears and audible crying to the One that could save him from death, and God heard him because of his godly fear. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>As a Son, he learned obedience by what he suffered. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Once <em>he became </em>perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for everyone that obeys him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>God designated him <em>“a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.”</em></span>

### Priest After the Order of Melchizedek


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> We have a lot to say about Melchizedek that’s difficult to explain because you’re hard of hearing. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>By now, you should be teachers, but you still need somebody to teach you the basics of God’s message. You need milk instead of solid food. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>People that keep drinking milk don’t get accustomed to the message about goodness; they’re infants. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Solid food is for grownups that have trained their faculties to discriminate between good and bad.</span>
