## Hebrews Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> That Melchizedek—king of Salem, priest of God Most High—met Abraham when he came back from killing the kings and blessed him. 2Abraham separated off to him a tenth of everything [Gen 14:17-20]. First, by translation, "Melchizedek" was "king of righteousness," and then "king of Salem," meaning "king of peace." 3Without record of father, mother, genealogy, birth, or death—like God's Son—he remains a priest for all time.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Look how great the man was that Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils of war. 5In the Law the Levites that receive the priesthood have a commandment to receive a tenth from the people, that is, from their kin though they've descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy wasn't from them received a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one that had the promises. 7Without argument, the greater blesses the lesser. 8Here men that die receive a tenth, but there one received it who is pictured as alive. 9So to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who receives a tenth, paid a tenth. 10He was in his ancestor's loins when Melchizedek met him. 11If perfection could come through the Levitical priesthood (by which the people received the Law), why would there be another priest "after the order of Melchizedek"? 12Changing the priesthood requires changing the Law, 13because the One these things speak about belonged to different tribe; nobody from that tribe ever served at the altar. 14It's clear that our Lord descended from Judah; Moses never said anything about priests from that tribe. 15It's even clearer if another priest arises like Melchizedek, 16who has become a priest, not by law based on physical requirement, but by power based on indestructible life. 17Scripture testifies,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> That statement annuls the preceding commandment because it was weak and unprofitable—19the Law didn't make anything perfect—and brings in a better hope by which we can draw near to God. 20-21Furthermore, Christ's priesthood came in with an oath. The Levites became priests without an oath, but he became a priest with an oath from the One that said to him,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> By that much Jesus also guaranteed a better covenant. 23There were lots of former priests because death prevented them from continuing. 24He holds his priesthood without successors because he remains forever. 25So he can save "forever" the ones that draw near to God through him. He's always alive to intercede for them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> That's the kind of high priest we need—holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, higher than the sky. 27Unlike those high priests, he didn't need to make an offering every day first for his own sins and then for the people's. He made an offering once and for all when he offered himself. 28The Law appoints men high priests that have weakness, but the oath that came after the Law appointed forever a perfected Son.</span>
