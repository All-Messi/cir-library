## Hebrews Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, holy "children" that take part in the heavenly calling, pay close attention to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of what we profess. 2He was faithful to the One that appointed him just like Moses was in his house. 3But Jesus has been considered worthy of more honor than Moses—as much more as a house builder has more honor than the house. 4Somebody builds every house; God has built everything. 5Moses was faithful as a servant in his house to testify about things that would be spoken later; 6ChristMessiah was faithful as a Son over his house. We are that house if we stay confident and take pride in our hope.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> So, like the Holy Spirit says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> As I swore in my anger,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Be careful so there won't be an evil, disbelieving "heart" in any of you, and you fall away from the living God. 13Encourage one another every day as long as it's "Today" so sin's deception doesn't "harden" you. 14You've become partakers of Christ if you hold firm to the end the assurance you had at the first—15while he says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Who "rebelled" against him when they "heard"? Wasn't it everybody that Moses brought out of Egypt? 17Who was he "angry" with for "40 years"? Wasn't it the ones who sinned and their corpses fell in the "desert"? 18Who'd he "swear" wouldn't "go into his rest" but the ones that disbelieved? 19We can see that they couldn't go in because they disbelieved.</span>
