## Hebrews Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Love the believers. 2Be hospitable to strangers. (Some have entertained angels without knowing it.)  3Remember prisoners as if you're in prison with them, and those abused as if you're in their bodies. 4With everybody, keep marriage honorable and the bed undefiled; God will judge fornicators and adulterers. 5Be free from the love of money and be content with what you have. He said it himself,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So we can confidently say,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Remember your leaders, who spoke God's message to you. Look at the way their lives turned out and imitate their faith. 8Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Don't get drawn off course by strange teachings. It's good to feel secure because of grace rather than food. Observing regulations about food doesn't benefit the ones that observe them. 10We have an altar that the ones who serve the tabernacle don't have a right to eat from. 11The high priest takes into the Holy Place the blood of animals as a sacrifice for sin; the bodies of those animals get burned outside the camp. 12Jesus also suffered outside the gate to sanctify the people through his own blood. 13Let's go out to him—outside the camp—and bear his disgrace. 14We don't have an eternal city here, but we anticipate the one that's coming. 15Through him let's offer up to God a sacrifice of continuous praise, that is, what we say in acknowledging him. 16Don't neglect doing good and sharing; God delights in sacrifices like that.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Obey your leaders; defer to them. They watch over your souls so they can enjoy giving account. (Doing so with sighing wouldn't benefit you.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Pray for us. We have a clear conscience; we want to conduct ourselves well in everything we do. 19I urge you to do that all the more so I can get back to you sooner. 20-21May the God that brings peace, that resurrected the Great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you by the blood of the eternal covenant to do his will in everything that's good. Through Jesus Christ, may he accomplish in you what delights him. Glory to him forever[more]ms! Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> I encourage you to listen to this brief encouragement. 23Be aware that our brother Timothy is free now. If he comes soon, I'll see you with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Greet your leaders and all the saints. The ones from Italy greet you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Grace be with you all.</span>
