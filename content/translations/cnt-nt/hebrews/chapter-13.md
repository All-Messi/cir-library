## Hebrews Chapter **13**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Love the believers. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Be hospitable to strangers. (Some have entertained angels without knowing it.)  <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Remember prisoners as if you’re in prison with them, and those abused as if you’re in <em>their</em> bodies. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>With everybody, keep marriage honorable and the bed undefiled; God will judge fornicators and adulterers. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Be free from the love of money and be content with what you have. He said it himself, <strong><em>“I’ll n</em></strong><strong><em>ever abandon you</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 31:6]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>So we can confidently say, <strong><em>“The </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>’s my helper;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	I won’t be afraid.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	What</em></strong><strong><em> are people </em></strong><strong><em>going to do to me?”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:6]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Remember your leaders, who spoke God’s message to you. Look at the way their lives turned out and imitate their faith. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 13:1-8</p>

### Resisting Distractions


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup>Don’t get drawn off course by strange teachings. It’s good to feel secure because of grace rather than food. Observing regulations about food doesn’t benefit the ones that observe them. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>We have an altar that the ones who serve the tabernacle don’t have a right to eat from. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The high priest takes into the Holy Place the blood of animals <em>as a sacrifice</em> for sin; the bodies of those animals get burned outside the camp. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Jesus also suffered outside the gate to sanctify the people through his own blood. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Let’s go out to him—outside the camp—and bear his disgrace. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We don’t have an eternal city here, but we anticipate the one that’s coming. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Through him let’s offer up to God a sacrifice of continuous praise, that is, what we say in acknowledging him. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t neglect doing good and sharing; God delights in sacrifices like that.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 13:9-16</p>

### Assisting the Leaders


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Obey your leaders; defer to them. They watch over your souls so they can enjoy giving account. (Doing so with sighing wouldn’t benefit you.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Pray for us. We have a clear conscience; we want to conduct ourselves well in everything we do. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I urge <em>you</em> to do that all the more so I can get back to you sooner. <strong>Doxology</strong> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><strong><sup>-21</sup></strong>May the God that brings peace, that resurrected the Great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you by the blood of the eternal covenant to do his will in everything that’s good. Through Jesus Christ, may he accomplish in you what delights him. Glory<em> </em>to him forever[more]<sup>ms</sup>! Amen. <strong>Closing Exhortation and Greeting</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I encourage you to listen to <em>this</em> brief encouragement. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Be aware that our brother Timothy is free now. If he comes soon, I’ll see you with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Greet your leaders and all the saints. The ones from Italy greet you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup>Grace <em>be</em> with you all.</span>
