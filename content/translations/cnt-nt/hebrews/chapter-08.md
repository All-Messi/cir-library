## Hebrews Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Here's the point: we have the kind of high priest that sat down on the right hand of the majestic throne in heaven. 2He ministers in the sanctuary, the real tabernacle the LORD pitched, not man. 3Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; so he needed to offer something too. 4On earth, he wouldn't be a priest at all since there are those who offer gifts according to the Law and serve a copy and shadow of heavenly things. 5God warned Moses when he was getting ready to put up the tabernacle, "Be sure you make everything like the design I showed you on the mountain" [Ex 25:40]. 6Christ received a ministry that's as much better as the covenant he's mediating is better, because God enacted it on better promises.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> If the first covenant hadn't had faults, God wouldn't have planned to put a second covenant in place. He's finding fault with the first 8when he says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> It won't be like the covenant I made with their ancestors</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> This is the kind of covenant I'll make with Israel later:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Nobody will be teaching his fellow citizen and friend,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he said "new," he made the first old. What's getting old is about to pass away.</span>
