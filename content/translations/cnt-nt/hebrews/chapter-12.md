## Hebrews Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, surrounded by such a crowd of witnesses to us, let's lay aside everything that weighs us down and the sin that so easily holds us back. Let's press on in the race that's in front of us, 2as we look ahead to Jesus the forerunner and finisher of our faith. For the joy in front of him, he endured the cross, overlooked the disgrace, and sat down on the right side of God's throne. 3Keep in mind the One that endured such verbal hostility from sinners so you don't get discouraged.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You haven't shed your blood yet in straining against sin. 5You've forgotten the encouragement that reasons with you like children,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The LORD disciplines the ones he loves</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Endure to gain discipline because God's treating you like children. What child doesn't a father discipline? 8If you're not receiving discipline, you're not children; you're illegitimate offspring. 9Besides, we respected our physical fathers who disciplined us; won't we respect our spiritual Father more and live? 10They did what they thought was appropriate; he does it for our benefit so we'll be holy like him. 11Discipline always seems harsh at the time; but later it pays back the peaceful results of right living. 12So strengthen the limp hands and weak knees, 13and make straight paths for your feet so what's lame won't veer off but get corrected.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> With everybody, strive for peace and the holiness you need to have to see the Lord. 15Make sure none of you come short of God's grace. Don't let some root of bitterness sprout up and cause trouble and end up defiling other people. 16Don't be immoral or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal. 17As you know, afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was refused. He didn't find any change of heart in his father though with tears he tried diligently to get it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You haven't come to a mountain you can touch or one blazing with fire. You haven't come to darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, 19to a trumpet blast or the sound of words the Israelites begged not to hear. 20They couldn't deal with the severe demand,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The spectacle was so terrifying, Moses said, "I'm so afraid I'm shaking" [Deut 9:19]. 22But, you've come to Mount Zion,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Make sure you don't ignore who's talking to you. If they didn't escape who ignored the One that warned them on earth, you certainly won't escape if you turn away from the One who has warned you from heaven. 26His voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, 27"One more time" means taking away what can be shaken—this creation—so what can't be shaken will be all that's left. 28Since you're receiving a kingdom that can't be shaken, be grateful. In gratitude serve God in an acceptable way with reverence and awe; 29he's a consuming fire.</span>
