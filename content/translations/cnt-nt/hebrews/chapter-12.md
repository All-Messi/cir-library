## Hebrews Chapter 12

### Renewed Zeal from Faithful Examples

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, surrounded by such a crowd of witnesses to us, let’s lay aside everything that weighs us down and the sin that so easily holds us back. Let’s press on in the race that’s in front of us, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>as we look ahead to Jesus the forerunner and finisher of our faith. For the joy in front of him, he endured the cross, overlooked the disgrace, and sat down on the right side of God’s throne. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Keep in mind the One that endured such verbal hostility from sinners so you don’t get discouraged.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 12:1-3</p>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> You haven’t shed your blood yet in straining against sin. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>You’ve forgotten the encouragement that reasons with you like children, 	<strong><em>“My </em></strong><strong><em>child, don’t take lightly the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>’s discipline</em></strong> 	<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	or give up when he scolds you.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> <strong><em>The </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> disciplines the one</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em> he loves</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and punishes</em></strong><strong><em> every child he receives</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Pro</strong><strong> 3:11-12]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Endure to gain discipline because God’s treating you like children. What child doesn’t a father discipline? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If you’re not receiving discipline, you’re not children; you’re illegitimate offspring. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Besides, we respected our physical fathers who disciplined us; won’t we respect our spiritual Father more and live? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They did what they thought was appropriate; he does it for our benefit so we’ll be holy like him.<sup> </sup><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Discipline always seems harsh at the time; but later it pays back the peaceful results of right living. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So strengthen the limp hands and weak knees, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>and make straight paths for your feet so what’s lame won’t veer off but get corrected.</span>

### Getting Serious About Holy Living


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> With everybody, strive for peace and the holiness you need to have to see the Lord. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Make sure none <em>of you</em> come short of God’s grace. Don’t let some root of bitterness sprout up and cause trouble and end up defiling other people. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Don’t be immoral or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>As you know, afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was refused. He didn’t find any change of heart <em>in his father</em> though with tears he tried diligently to get it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 12:14-17</p>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> You haven’t come to <em>a mountain</em> you can touch or one blazing with fire. You haven’t come to darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>to a trumpet blast or the sound of words <em>the Israelites</em> begged not to hear. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>They couldn’t deal with the severe demand, <strong><em>“If even an animal</em></strong><strong><em> touches the mountain, stone it</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 19:12-13]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The spectacle was so terrifying, Moses said, <strong><em>“I’m so afraid</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>I’m shaking</em><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 9:19]</strong>. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But, you’ve come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem and countless thousands of angels, to the assembly <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven; to God, the judge of all; to the spirits of good people made perfect;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant; and to the sprinkling of blood that speaks better than Abel’s.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Heb 12:18-24</p>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Make sure you don’t ignore who’s talking to you. If <u>they</u> didn’t escape who ignored the One that warned them on earth, <u>you</u> certainly won’t escape if you turn away from the One <em>who has warned you</em> from heaven. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>His voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, 	<strong><em>“One more time I won’t</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>just </em></strong><strong><em>shake</em></strong><strong><em> the earth</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><em>but</em><strong><em> the sky</em></strong><em> too</em><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Hag</strong><strong> 2:6]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> <em>“One more time”</em> means taking away what can be shaken—this creation—so what can’t be shaken will be all that’s left. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Since you’re receiving a kingdom that can’t be shaken, be grateful. In gratitude serve God in an acceptable way with reverence and awe; <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>he’s a consuming fire.</span>
