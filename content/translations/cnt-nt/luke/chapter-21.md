## Luke Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>He looked up and saw wealthy people putting contributions in the Treasury <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and a poor widow putting in two leptons*. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I</em><em>’m</em><em> tell</em><em>ing you, that</em><em> poor widow put in more than anybody.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> </em><em>contributed</em><em> from their abundance, but she put in </em><em>everything</em><em> </em><em>she had to live</em><em> on.</em><em>”</em></span>

### The Olivet Discourse


<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Some were talking about the Temple, because it was decorated with beautiful stones and memorial gifts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>He said, <em>“The time’s coming</em><em> when </em><em>what</em><em> you see here won’t be left stone on stone.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“Rabbi, when’s that going to </em><em>happen?</em><em> </em><em>What will show it’s about to happen?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Make sure nobody </em><em>misleads</em><em> you.</em><em> </em><em>Many </em><em>men </em><em>will come, saying, ‘I’m the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>,’ and, ‘</em><em>It’s</em><em> time.’</em><em> </em><em>Don’t </em><em>follow</em><em> them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>When you hear about wars and </em><em>rebellions</em><em>, don’t be terrified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>Nation will attack nation</em><em>;</em><em> kingdom will attack kingdom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>There will be </em><em>severe earthquakes,</em><em> famines</em><em>,</em><em> and plagues in many places</em><em>—</em><em>dreadful events, and great signs </em><em>from</em><em> </em><em>the sky</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>	</em></span>

### 12“But before all that, they’ll persecute you and arrest you. They’ll deliver you to synagogues and jails and take you in front of kings and governors because of me. 13Those times will provide opportunities to speak for me. 14Be determined not to prepare your defense ahead of time. 15I’ll give you what to say and wisdom that none of your opponents can argue with. 16Even parents, relatives, and friends will betray you and execute some of you. 17People will hate you because of me. 18Yet not a hair of your head will perish. 19You’ll gain your souls by standing firm. 20“When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you’ll know its destruction is coming. 21People in Judaea need to flee to the hill country, people in the city need to leave, people in the countryside must not go into the city. 22This will bep a time of revenge to fulfill scripture. 23Woe to the women that are pregnant or nursing then; there’ll be great distress in the land and God’s displeasure on this people. 24They’ll fall by the sword and go captive into foreign countries. Gentiles will trample Jerusalem underfoot till the times of the Gentiles are over. 25“There’ll be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and turmoil among nations in despair at the roaring of the sea. 26People will faint from fear and foreboding over what’s coming on the world, because the powers in the sky will be shaken. 27People will see ‘the Son of Man coming on a cloud’ [Dan 7:13] with great power and glory. 28When these things start to happen, look up; your deliverance is on its way. 	Lk 21:12-28 29“Look at a fig tree—or any tree. 30As soon as it begins to sprout leaves, you can tell summer’s coming. 31The same way when you see these things, you’ll know God’s kingdom is on its way. 32That will take place in this generation. 33Earth and sky will pass away, but what I say won’t pass away. 34“Be careful that pleasures, drunkenness, life’s worries don’t make you insensitive, and that day comes on you unexpectedly 35like a trap. It’ll come on everybody on earth. 36Be alert all the time. Pray so you’ll be strong enough to get away from everything that’s coming and to stand in front of the Son of Man.”


<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>Jesus was spending the days teaching in the Temple and the nights on the hill called <em>T</em><em>he Mount</em> of Olives. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>The people would come early to listen to him in the Temple.</span>
