## Luke Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> On a Sabbath, when he went into the house of a ruling Pharisee to eat, the leaders were watching him closely. 2In front of him was a man with extreme swelling. 3Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on a Sabbath?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> They didn't say anything. He took hold of him and healed him and let him go. 5He said, "If a son or ox falls into a well, wouldn't you pullf him out right away on a Sabbath day?" 6They couldn't answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When he noticed how they were vying for the prominent places at the table, he started telling the guests a parable. 8"When somebody invites you to a wedding banquet, don't recline at table in a place of honor. Someone more distinguished than you may have been invited. 9The one that invited you both will say to yousg, 'Let this gentleman have your place.' Then you'll head for the last place embarrassed. 10Instead, when you're invited, go recline in the last place so when the one that invited you comes, he'll say, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then the others reclining at table will respect you. 11Everybody that exalts himself will be humbled, and the one that humbles himself will be exalted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He went on to say to his host, "When yousg have a luncheon or dinner, don't call your friends, brothers, relatives, and wealthy neighbors. They can invite you in return. 13Invite poor, disabled, lame, and blind people. You'll be blessed; they can't repay you. 14You'll get repaid when the righteous resurrect."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When one of those reclining at the table heard that, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one that eats bread in God's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus said to him, "A man prepared a banquet and invited a lot of people. 17When the time for the banquet came, he sent a servant to tell them to come; everything was ready. 18But they started making excuses. 'I need to go see a field I bought. Please excuse me.' 21"When the servant came back, he told his master. The homeowner was mad, 'Hurry out into the streets and alleys in town and bring in the poor, disabled, blind, and lame.' 23"'Go out into the country lanes and paths and urge them to come in so my house will be full. 24None of the people I invited will taste my banquet."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Large crowds were traveling with him. He turned and told them, 26"Nobody that comes to me can be my disciple unless he loves me more than his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters—even his own life. 27Whoever doesn't carry his own cross and follow me, can't be my disciple. 28Which of you that wants to build a tower, doesn't sit down first and figure out what it'll cost, to see if you have enough money to finish it? 29Otherwise, when you've laid the foundation and can't finish it, people will make fun of you, 30'This fellow started to build and couldn't finish.' 31"What king engages another king in battle without sitting down first to figure out if with 10,000 he can meet one with 20,000? 32If he can't, while the other is still a long way off, he'll send ambassadors to ask for terms of peace. 33In the same way, none of you can be my disciple unless you give up everything you own. 34"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, what can make it salty? 35It's useless for the ground or manure pile. People throw it out. Whoever has ears, listen!"</span>
