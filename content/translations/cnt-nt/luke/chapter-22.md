### Judas’ Plot to Betray Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Satan got into Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He went to talk to the chief priests and soldiers about delivering Jesus to them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They were elated and offered him money. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He agreed and started looking for a chance to turn him over away from a crowd.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 22:3-6</p>

### Preparation for the Passover Meal


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lamb needed to be sacrificed. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus sent Peter and John, <em>“Go get the Passover ready </em><em>for us</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When the time came, he and his disciples reclined at table. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I’ve really wanted to eat this Passover with </em><em>you before I suffer;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I won’</em><em>t be eating </em>this meal<em> till </em>its meaning<em> is </em><em>fulfilled in </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, <em>“Take this and di</em><em>stribute</em><em> it among you</em><em>rselves</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>This is the last time I’ll drink the fruit of the vine </em><em>till </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>comes.”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He took a loaf, gave thanks, and passed it around to them, <em>“This is my body that’s given for you.</em><em> </em><em>Do this in my memory.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In the same way, he took the cup after they ate, “<em>This cup that’s poured out for you</em><em> is the new covenant in my blood.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But the hand of my betrayer is </em><em>with me </em><em>on the table.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>go the way it’s been </em><em>pre-</em><em>determined, but woe to the </em><em>one</em><em> that betrays </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They tried to figure out with each other which of them would do such a thing.</span>

### -23 Another Argument About Rank


<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> An argument arose about which of them would have the highest rank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He said, <em>“Gentile kings lord it over the</em><em>ir people;</em><em> the ones </em><em>that wield authority they call</em><em> benefactors.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>You’re not to be like that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The greatest among you needs to be like the youngest and the leader like a servant.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Who has higher rank</em><em>, someone re</em><em>clining at table or a waiter? </em><em>Isn’t it the one at</em><em> the</em><em> table?</em><em> </em><em>But I’m </em><em>here</em><em> like a </em><em>waiter.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>You’ve </em><em>stayed</em><em> with me in my </em><em>difficulties</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>I’m</em><em> passing the kingdom on to you </em><em>like the Father passed it on to me </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>so you ca</em><em>n eat at my table in my kingdom</em><em> and sit on thrones</em><em>,</em><em> judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</em><em>     </em><em>	</em><strong>Lk 22:2</strong><strong>4-30</strong> <strong>The Disciples Warned</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Peter said, <em>“Lord, I’m ready to go to prison and to </em><em>die</em><em> with you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He said, <em>“When I sent you out with no money bag, knapsack, or shoes, you didn’t lack anything, did you?”</em> <em>“No.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He left and went to the Mount of Olives as he often did, and his disciples went with him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>When he got to where he was going, he said, <em>“Pray so you won’t be tempted.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He went away about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>“Father, if you’re willing, take this cup away from me.</em><em> </em><em>Yet not my will but yours be done.”</em> [[<strong><sup>43</sup></strong>An angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>In agony he prayed more intensely. His sweat became like drops of blood dripping on the ground.]]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He got up and went back and found the disciples sleeping from grief. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why are you sleeping?</em><em> </em><em>Get up and pray so you won’t be tempted.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>  </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Lk 22:39-46</strong> <strong>The Arrest</strong></span>
