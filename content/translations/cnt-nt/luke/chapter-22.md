### Preparation for the Passover Meal


<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lamb needed to be sacrificed. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus sent Peter and John, <em>“Go get the Passover ready </em><em>for us</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em> <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“Where </em><em>should we </em><em>do that?”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“On the way in</em><em>to</em><em> the city, </em><em>you’ll meet a man</em><em> carrying a clay pot of water.</em><em> </em><em>Follow him in</em><em>to</em><em> the house he enters </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>and say to the owner, ‘The Rabbi says,</em> <em>“Where’s the guest room </em><em>where </em><em>I can eat the Passover with my disciples?”’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He’ll show you a big upstairs room furnished.</em><em> </em><em>Get things ready there.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They went and found it like he’d said and got things ready.<strong> </strong><strong>        </strong> <strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>When the time came, he and his disciples reclined at table. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I’ve really wanted to eat this Passover with </em><em>you before I suffer;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I won’</em><em>t be eating </em>this meal<em> till </em>its meaning<em> is </em><em>fulfilled in </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, <em>“Take this and di</em><em>stribute</em><em> it among you</em><em>rselves</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>This is the last time I’ll drink the fruit of the vine </em><em>till </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>comes.”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He took a loaf, gave thanks, and passed it around to them, <em>“This is my body that’s given for you.</em><em> </em><em>Do this in my memory.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>In the same way, he took the cup after they ate, “<em>This cup that’s poured out for you</em><em> is the new covenant in my blood.</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>But the hand of my betrayer is </em><em>with me </em><em>on the table.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>go the way it’s been </em><em>pre-</em><em>determined, but woe to the </em><em>one</em><em> that betrays </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>They tried to figure out with each other which of them would do such a thing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>He went away about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed, <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>“Father, if you’re willing, take this cup away from me.</em><em> </em><em>Yet not my will but yours be done.”</em> [[<strong><sup>43</sup></strong>An angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>In agony he prayed more intensely.

### The Arrest


<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup>While he was still talking, a crowd came with Judas in front. He came up to Jesus to kiss him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“Judas, you’re betraying </em><em>me</em><em> with a kiss?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup>When the ones around him saw what was about to happen, they said, <em>“Lord, should we </em><em>attack</em><em> with a sword</em><em>!</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>One of them struck a servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup>Jesus responded, <em>“Back off!”</em> He touched the servant’s ear and healed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup>He said to the chief priests, soldiers, and elders<em>, “You’</em><em>r</em><em>e com</em><em>ing</em><em> </em><em>out </em>here <em>with swords and clubs as if you’re capturing </em><em>an insurgent</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>I was with you in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple every day, and </em><em>you didn’t lay a hand on me—but . . .</em><em> this is your</em><em> time—</em><em>the power of darkness.”</em><em>	</em><strong> L</strong><strong>k 22:47-53</strong> <strong>The Trial Before Caiaphas;</strong> <strong>Peter’s Denials; Condemnation by the Sanhedrin</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup>They arrested him and led him <em>away </em>to the high priest’s residence. Peter followed at a distance. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>After they started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting with them. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>A servant girl saw him sitting <em>there</em>, facing the light. She looked at him closely, <em>“This</em><em> fellow </em><em>was with him too.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>He denied it,<em> “I don’t know him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup>A little later someone else saw him, <em>“You </em><em><u>are too</u></em><em> one of them</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> Peter said, <em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, I am not.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup>About an hour later, another man started insisting, <em>“This man </em><em><u>was too</u></em><em> with him.</em><em> </em><em>He’s a Galilean.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v60"><sup><strong>60</strong></sup>Peter said, <em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</em><em> </em> While he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>The Lord turned and looked at him, and he remembered what Jesus had said, <em>“Before a rooster</em><em> </em><em>crows </em><em>in the morning</em><em>, you’ll deny three times</em><em> that you </em>even <em>know me</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>62</sup></strong>He went out and broke down sobbing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><sup><strong>63</strong></sup>The men that held Jesus in custody were making fun of him, <strong><sup>64</sup></strong>blindfolding him, slapping him, and asking, <em>“</em><em>Say</em><em>! Who slapped you?”</em> <strong><sup>65</sup></strong>They were saying lots of other insulting things to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v66"><sup><strong>66</strong></sup>When it got daylight, the people’s council of elders, chief priests, and scribes convened and brought him into their Court, <strong><sup>67</sup></strong>asking, <em>“Are you the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Tell us.”</em> <em>“If I tell you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>, you won’t believe me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>68</sup></strong><em>If I ask a question; you won’t answer me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>69</sup></strong><em>From now on, </em><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>the Son of Man will</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>sit</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>in a position of power at God’s right hand</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 110:1]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><sup><strong>70</strong></sup>They all said,<em> “</em><em>So a</em><em>re you </em><em>God’s</em><em> </em><em>‘</em><em>Son</em><em>’</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><sup><strong>71</strong></sup>They said, <em>“Wh</em><em>at</em><em> do we need witn</em><em>esses for? We’ve heard him say it ourselves</em><em>.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>    </strong> <strong><sup>	  </sup></strong></span>
