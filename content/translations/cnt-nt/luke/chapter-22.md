## Luke Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The Festival of Unleavened Bread (called Passover) was coming up. 2The chief priests and scribes were looking for some way to destroy him because they were afraid of the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Satan got into Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. 4He went to talk to the chief priests and soldiers about delivering Jesus to them. 5They were elated and offered him money. 6He agreed and started looking for a chance to turn him over away from a crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lamb needed to be sacrificed. 8Jesus sent Peter and John, "Go get the Passover ready for us." 10"On the way into the city, you'll meet a man carrying a clay pot of water. Follow him into the house he enters 11and say to the owner, 'The Rabbi says, "Where's the guest room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?"' 12He'll show you a big upstairs room furnished. Get things ready there." 13They went and found it like he'd said and got things ready.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When the time came, he and his disciples reclined at table. 15He said, "I've really wanted to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 16I won't be eating this meal till its meaning is fulfilled in God's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and distribute it among yourselves. 18This is the last time I'll drink the fruit of the vine till God's kingdom comes." 19He took a loaf, gave thanks, and passed it around to them, "This is my body that's given for you. Do this in my memory." 20In the same way, he took the cup after they ate, "This cup that's poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. 21But the hand of my betrayer is with me on the table. 22I'll go the way it's been pre-determined, but woe to the one that betrays me." 23They tried to figure out with each other which of them would do such a thing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> An argument arose about which of them would have the highest rank.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> He said, "Gentile kings lord it over their people; the ones that wield authority they call benefactors. 26You're not to be like that. The greatest among you needs to be like the youngest and the leader like a servant. 27Who has higher rank, someone reclining at table or a waiter? Isn't it the one at the table? But I'm here like a waiter. 28You've stayed with me in my difficulties. 29I'm passing the kingdom on to you like the Father passed it on to me 30so you can eat at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 31"Simon, Satan asked to sift youpl all like wheat, 32but I prayed that yoursg faith wouldn't fail. When you get stable again, stabilize your brothers."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Peter said, "Lord, I'm ready to go to prison and to die with you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus said, "I'm telling you, Peter, before a rooster crows in the morning, you'll deny three times that you even know me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> He said, "When I sent you out with no money bag, knapsack, or shoes, you didn't lack anything, did you?" 36"But now, if you have a money bag, take it—and a knapsack too. If you don't have a sword, sell your coat and buy one. 37I have to fulfill what this scripture says about me: 'They considered me a criminal' [Is 53:12]. What refers to me will happen."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He left and went to the Mount of Olives as he often did, and his disciples went with him. 40When he got to where he was going, he said, "Pray so you won't be tempted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He went away about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, 42"Father, if you're willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done." [[43An angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him. 44In agony he prayed more intensely. His sweat became like drops of blood dripping on the ground.]]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He got up and went back and found the disciples sleeping from grief. 46He said, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray so you won't be tempted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> While he was still talking, a crowd came with Judas in front. He came up to Jesus to kiss him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> Jesus said, "Judas, you're betraying me with a kiss?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> When the ones around him saw what was about to happen, they said, "Lord, should we attack with a sword!?" 50One of them struck a servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 51Jesus responded, "Back off!" He touched the servant's ear and healed him. 52He said to the chief priests, soldiers, and elders, "You're coming out here with swords and clubs as if you're capturing an insurgent? 53I was with you in the Temple every day, and you didn't lay a hand on me—but . . . this is your time—the power of darkness." 54They arrested him and led him away to the high priest's residence. Peter followed at a distance. 55After they started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting with them. 56A servant girl saw him sitting there, facing the light. She looked at him closely, "This fellow was with him too." 57He denied it, "I don't know him." 58A little later someone else saw him, "You are too one of them." 59About an hour later, another man started insisting, "This man was too with him. He's a Galilean." 60Peter said, "Sir, I don't know what you're talking about." While he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 61The Lord turned and looked at him, and he remembered what Jesus had said, "Before a rooster crows in the morning, you'll deny three times that you even know me." 62He went out and broke down sobbing. 63The men that held Jesus in custody were making fun of him, 64blindfolding him, slapping him, and asking, "Say! Who slapped you?" 65They were saying lots of other insulting things to him. 66When it got daylight, the people's council of elders, chief priests, and scribes convened and brought him into their Court, 67asking, "Are you the Messiah? Tell us." "If I tell youpl, you won't believe me. 68If I ask a question; you won't answer me. 69From now on, "the Son of Man will sit in a position of power at God's right hand" [Ps 110:1]. 70They all said, "So are you God's 'Son'?" 71They said, "What do we need witnesses for? We've heard him say it ourselves."</span>
