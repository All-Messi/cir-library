## Luke Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>At that time, some people told <em>Jesus</em> about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Do you think tho</em><em>se Galileans were </em><em>more</em><em> sinful</em><em> than other</em><em> Galileans because they suffered th</em><em>is</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>No, but unless you repent, you’ll </em><em>die</em><em> too.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>D</em><em>o you </em><em>think </em><em>the </em><em>18</em><em> </em><em>that </em><em>the tower of Siloam fell on and killed were the most sinful people in Jerusalem?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>No, but unless you repent, you’ll </em><em>die</em><em> too.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He told this parable, <em>“A man had planted a fig tree in his vineyard.</em><em> </em><em>He </em><em>went</em><em> looking for fruit on it, but didn’t find any.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>He told the vineyard keeper, ‘</em><em>T</em><em>his fig tree</em><em> hasn’t borne any fruit f</em><em>or three years</em><em>. Chop</em><em> it down.</em><em> </em><em>Why’s it taking up space?’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He was teaching in a synagogue one Sabbath, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>and a woman there had a spirit that for 18 years made her bent double, and she couldn’t straighten up. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When Jesus saw her, he called out, <em>“Dear woman, </em><em>your deformity</em><em>’s gone</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>He laid hands on her, and at once she straightened up and praised God. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>The synagogue ruler got angry because Jesus healed her on a Sabbath. He told the crowd, <em>“There are </em><em>six</em><em> days </em><em>for</em><em> work</em><em>ing</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Come on those </em><em>days to be healed, not on a Sabbath</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The Lord answered him, <em>“</em>You<em> foolish people</em><em>, don’t you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> untie your ox or donkey </em><em>and</em><em> lead </em><em>it out to water on a Sabbath</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Wasn</em><em>’t it appropriate on a Sabbath</em><em> to untie this da</em><em>ughter of Abraham that Satan had</em><em> tied up for</em><em>18</em><em> years?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>His critics were disgraced, and the whole crowd was excited about the outstanding things he was doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>So he said, <em>“What’s God’s kingdom like? </em><em>What can I compare it to?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>It’s like a mustard seed a </em><em>fellow planted</em><em> in his garden.</em><em> </em><em>It became a tree, and birds nested in its branches.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He was teaching from one town and village to another, working his way toward Jerusalem. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Somebody said, <em>“Lord, are few people saved?”</em> He said to them,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>At that time, some Pharisees came up to Jesus, <em>“</em><em>You need to g</em><em>et out of here!</em><em> </em><em>Herod wants to kill you!”</em></span>
