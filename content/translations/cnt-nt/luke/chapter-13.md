## Luke Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time, some people told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2He said, "Do you think those Galileans were more sinful than other Galileans because they suffered this? 3No, but unless you repent, you'll die too. 4Do you think the 18 that the tower of Siloam fell on and killed were the most sinful people in Jerusalem? 5No, but unless you repent, you'll die too."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He told this parable, "A man had planted a fig tree in his vineyard. He went looking for fruit on it, but didn't find any. 7He told the vineyard keeper, 'This fig tree hasn't borne any fruit for three years. Chop it down. Why's it taking up space?' 8"He answered, 'Sir, leave it this year too, till I can dig around it and manure it. 9If it has fruit on it next year, okay. If not, chopf it down.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> He was teaching in a synagogue one Sabbath, 11and a woman there had a spirit that for 18 years made her bent double, and she couldn't straighten up. 12When Jesus saw her, he called out, "Dear woman, your deformity's gone." 13He laid hands on her, and at once she straightened up and praised God. 14The synagogue ruler got angry because Jesus healed her on a Sabbath. He told the crowd, "There are six days for working. Come on those days to be healed, not on a Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Lord answered him, "You foolish people, don't youpl untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to water on a Sabbath? 16Wasn't it appropriate on a Sabbath to untie this daughter of Abraham that Satan had tied up for18 years?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> His critics were disgraced, and the whole crowd was excited about the outstanding things he was doing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> So he said, "What's God's kingdom like? What can I compare it to? 19It's like a mustard seed a fellow planted in his garden. It became a tree, and birds nested in its branches." 20"What's God's kingdom like? 21It's like yeast a woman put in three pecks of meal till it made the whole batch rise."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He was teaching from one town and village to another, working his way toward Jerusalem. 23Somebody said, "Lord, are few people saved?" 24"Makepl every effort to go in through the narrow door. Many of you will try to go in but can't. 25Once the homeowner gets up and shuts the door, you'll stand outside and knock, 'Let us in.' He'll answer, 'I don't know where you're from.' 26You'll say, 'We ate with you, and you taught in our streets.' 27He'll tell you straight off, 'I don't know where you're from. Get away from here, you bad people.' 28There'll be crying and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets in Gods' kingdom and yourselves excluded. 29People will come from every direction and sit down in his kingdom. 30The last will be first and the first last."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> At that time, some Pharisees came up to Jesus, "You need to get out of here! Herod wants to kill you!" 32"Tell that old fox, 'I'll healp and cast out demons today and tomorrow, and finish my work on the third day.' 33But today, tomorrow, and the next day I do need to travel; it's not thinkable that a prophet would perish anywhere but in Jerusalem! 34"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that kills the prophets and stones the messengers that have been sent to you! How many times I've wanted to gather your inhabitants like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn't want to. 35I'm leaving your house [abandoned]ms. You won't see me till you say, 'Blessed be the One that's coming in the name of the LORD'" [Ps 118:26].</span>
