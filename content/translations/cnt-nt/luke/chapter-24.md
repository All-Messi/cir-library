## Luke Chapter **24**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>But early in the morning on the first day of the week, <em>the women</em> went to the tomb, carrying the spices they’d prepared. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>but when they went in, didn’t find the body of the Lord Jesus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>While they were wondering what happened, two men stood by them in dazzling clothes. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The women were scared and lowered their faces toward the ground. The men said, <em>“Why look for the living </em><em>among</em><em> the dead?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’s not here</em><em>; he</em><em> resurrected.</em><em> </em><em>Remember how he told you </em><em>back</em><em> in Galilee </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>that </em><em>he had to be betrayed </em><em>to sinners</em><em>, be </em><em>crucified, and </em><em>resurrect</em><em> the third day.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>They remembered what he’d said, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>and left the tomb to tell the eleven and the rest. (<strong><sup>10</sup></strong>They were Mary the Magdalene, Joanna, Mary mother of James, and others.) They told the apostles, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>but it seemed to them like idle talk. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>But Peter ran to the tomb, stooped down, and saw only the linen wrappings. He went back puzzled.</span>

### 1-12 Appearance to Two  on the Way to Emmaus


<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>That same day <em>Jesus</em> appeared to two disciples as they were making their way to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>They were talking about what all had happened. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Meanwhile, Jesus caught up with them, <strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>but they didn’t recognize him<sup>lit</sup>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He said, <em>“What were you talking about while</em><em> you walk</em><em>ed</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>One named Cleopas said, <em>“Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem that doesn’t know what happened there lately?”</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>“What?”</em> <em>“About Jesus </em><em>the Nazarene</em><em>, a prophet powerful in </em><em>wor</em><em>d and </em><em>dee</em><em>d </em><em>in the presence of</em><em> God and all the people.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>The chief priests and our rulers delivered him over to the death sentence and had him crucified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>We were hoping he was the One that would </em><em>free</em><em> Is</em><em>rael. It’</em><em>s been </em><em>three</em><em> days since </em><em>that</em><em> happened, </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> some women from o</em><em>ur number astounded us. They’</em><em>d arrived at the tomb early this morning</em><em>. </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>hen they didn’t find his body, they came</em><em> and said they’</em><em>d seen angels </em><em>who claimed</em><em> he was alive.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Some </em><em>that were </em><em>with us went to the tomb and found it </em><em>like</em><em> </em><em>they’</em><em>d said, but they didn’t see him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“Foolish </em><em>men,</em><em> </em><em>hesitant</em><em> to believe ev</em><em>erything the prophets have said.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>Didn’t the Messiah need to suffer tho</em><em>se things and enter his glory?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained the scriptures that referred to himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When they got close to home, he acted like he was going on, <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>but they urged him to stay with them,<em> “I</em><em>t’s </em><em>getting late;</em><em> the day’s </em><em>almost over.”</em>  So he went in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>While he was reclining at table, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They recognized him, and he disappeared. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They said to each other, <em>“Didn’t </em><em>we feel an eerie</em><em> </em><em>sensation</em><em> while he </em><em>was talking to us on the road and</em><em> </em><em>explaining</em><em> the scriptures?”</em> <em>	</em></span>

### Report by the Two


<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>33</sup></strong>They got up and went right back to Jerusalem and found the eleven with some others, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>who told <em>the</em><em>m</em> that the Lord really <u>di</u><u>d</u> resurrect and had appeared to Simon. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>In turn, <u>they</u> recounted what happened on the road and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.</span>

### Appearance to the Ten with Further Commission


<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While they were talking about it, Jesus himself stood among them, <em>“</em><em>Hello</em>.” <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They were startled and scared; they thought they were seeing a ghost. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong><em>“Why are you </em><em>at a loss,</em><em> wondering what’s </em><em>happening</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>Look at</em><em> my hands and my feet; it’s really me.</em><em> </em><em>Touch me</em><em>. </em><em>A spirit</em><em> doesn’t have flesh and bones like</em><em> you can see I have.”</em><em> </em>[<strong><sup>40</sup></strong>]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>They couldn’t believe it, they were so happy. <em>“Do you have any</em><em>thing here to eat</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They gave him a piece of baked fish, <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>and he took it and ate it in front of them.		   e said, “Why are you upset <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>“This is what I told you w</em><em>hen I was still with you: I needed to fulfill </em><em>everything </em><em>the scripture says </em><em>about me </em><em>in the L</em><em>aw of Moses, the </em><em>P</em><em>rophets, and the Psalms</em><em>: [</em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>]</em> <strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>the </em><em>Messiah</em><em> would suffer and </em><em>resurrect</em><em> the third day, </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>and </em><em>in his name repentance for forgiveness would be </em><em>presented</em><em> in every </em><em>country</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Beginning </em><em>in</em><em> Jerusalem, </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>you’ll testify</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>these </em><em>thing</em><em>s.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>I’ll send</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> </em><em>on you what the Father promised, b</em><em>ut stay</em><em> </em><em>in the city till </em><em>I clothe you with power from on high.”   </em><em>	</em></span>
