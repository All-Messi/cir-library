## Luke Chapter 24

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But early in the morning on the first day of the week, the women went to the tomb, carrying the spices they'd prepared. 2They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3but when they went in, didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4While they were wondering what happened, two men stood by them in dazzling clothes. 5The women were scared and lowered their faces toward the ground. The men said, "Why look for the living among the dead? 6He's not here; he resurrected. Remember how he told you back in Galilee 7that he had to be betrayed to sinners, be crucified, and resurrect the third day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They remembered what he'd said, 9and left the tomb to tell the eleven and the rest. (10They were Mary the Magdalene, Joanna, Mary mother of James, and others.) They told the apostles, 11but it seemed to them like idle talk. 12But Peter ran to the tomb, stooped down, and saw only the linen wrappings. He went back puzzled.	Lk 24: 1-12</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> That same day Jesus appeared to two disciples as they were making their way to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14They were talking about what all had happened. 15Meanwhile, Jesus caught up with them, 16but they didn't recognize himlit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said, "What were you talking about while you walked?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> One named Cleopas said, "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem that doesn't know what happened there lately?" "About Jesus the Nazarene, a prophet powerful in word and deed in the presence of God and all the people. 20The chief priests and our rulers delivered him over to the death sentence and had him crucified. 21We were hoping he was the One that would free Israel. It's been three days since that happened, 22but some women from our number astounded us. They'd arrived at the tomb early this morning. 23When they didn't find his body, they came and said they'd seen angels who claimed he was alive. 24Some that were with us went to the tomb and found it like they'd said, but they didn't see him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Jesus said, "Foolish men, hesitant to believe everything the prophets have said. 26Didn't the Messiah need to suffer those things and enter his glory?" 27Beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained the scriptures that referred to himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When they got close to home, he acted like he was going on, 29but they urged him to stay with them, "It's getting late; the day's almost over."  So he went in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> While he was reclining at table, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them. 31They recognized him, and he disappeared. 32They said to each other, "Didn't we feel an eerie sensation while he was talking to us on the road and explaining the scriptures?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> They got up and went right back to Jerusalem and found the eleven with some others, 34who told them that the Lord really did resurrect and had appeared to Simon. 35In turn, they recounted what happened on the road and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> While they were talking about it, Jesus himself stood among them, "Hello." 37They were startled and scared; they thought they were seeing a ghost. 38"Why are you at a loss, wondering what's happening? 39Look at my hands and my feet; it's really me. Touch me. A spirit doesn't have flesh and bones like you can see I have." [40]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> They couldn't believe it, they were so happy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> They gave him a piece of baked fish, 43and he took it and ate it in front of them.		   e said, "Why are you upset 44"This is what I told you when I was still with you: I needed to fulfill everything the scripture says about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms: [45] 46the Messiah would suffer and resurrect the third day, 47and in his name repentance for forgiveness would be presented in every country. Beginning in Jerusalem, 48you'll testify to these things. 49I'll sendp on you what the Father promised, but stay in the city till I clothe you with power from on high."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> He led them out to Bethany, raised his hands, and blessed them. 51While he was blessing them, he was carried up into the sky. 52They [worshiped him and]ms returned to Jerusalem elated, 53and were continually in the Temple, praising God.</span>
