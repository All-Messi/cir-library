## Luke Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus was passing along between grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples were picking off heads, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the seeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some Pharisees said, <em>“Why are you doing what’s against the</em><em> Law on Sabbath</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“</em><em>You’ve read, haven’t you, what David and the ones</em><em> with him did when they were </em><em>famished</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He went in</em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> house and took the consecrated loaves, ate them, and gave them to </em><em>the ones that were with him. They’re</em><em> against the </em><em>L</em><em>aw for anybody but priests to </em><em>eat</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Person takes precedence over Sabbath.”    </em><strong>Lk 6:1-5</strong><em>  </em> <strong>Healing a Man with a </strong><strong>Paralyzed</strong><strong> Hand</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and taught, and a man with a paralyzed right hand was there. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The scribes and Pharisees were watching to see if he’d heal on a Sabbath so they could have something to accuse him of.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He knew what they were thinking and said to the man, <em>“Stand up where people can see you.”</em><em> </em>He stood up.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> At that time he went up on a mountain to spend the night praying. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At daylight, he called his disciples and chose twelve that he named apostles: <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Simon, he named Peter; his brother Andrew; James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon called Zelotes, Judas son of James, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. <strong>Lk 6:12-16</strong> <strong>Sermon on </strong><strong>a Level Place (cp Mt 5-7)</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. There was a big crowd of disciples and a throng of people from Jerusalem, all over Judaea, and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They’d come to listen to him and be healed from illness and unclean spirits that were harassing them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>P</em><em>eople in the </em>crowd would try to touch him because power would go out from him and heal them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He looked up at his disciples and said, <em>“You that are poor are fortunate;</em> <em>	</em><em>you have God’s kingdom</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> <em>You </em><em>that are hungry now are fortunate;</em> <em>	</em><em>you’</em><em>ll be filled.</em> <em>You that </em><em>mourn now are fortunate;</em> <em>you will</em><em> laugh.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>You’re </em><em>fortunate</em><em> when people hate you, shun you, insult you, reject you as bad because of the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Be happy</em><em> in times</em><em> like that. J</em><em>ump up and down for joy because you have a great reward in heaven.</em><em> </em><em>Their </em><em>ancestors used to treat </em><em>the prophets</em><em> the same way</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But woe to you rich</em><em> people;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you have your comfort.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Woe to you that eat</em><em> well </em><em>now;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>you’</em><em>ll be hungry.</em> <em>	Woe to you that laugh now;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you’</em><em>ll grieve and cry.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> <em>Woe </em>to you <em>when everybody </em><em>says good things about </em><em>you.</em><em> </em><em>Your </em><em>ancestors</em><em> used to do the same thing</em><em>s about</em><em> false prophets.</em><em>	</em><strong>Lk 6:17-26</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He gave an illustration<em>.</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>B</em><em>lind </em><em>people</em><em> don’t lead blind </em><em>people</em><em>, do </em><em>they</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Wouldn’t they </em><em>all</em><em> fall in the ditch?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>tudent</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>are</em><em> not </em><em>better off than</em><em> </em><em>their</em><em> teacher, but </em><em>everybody that finished their education</em><em> will be like </em><em>their</em><em> teacher.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Why look at a speck of sawdust in </em><em>somebody else’s</em><em> eye, and not notice the log in your own?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>How can you say to </em><em>somebody</em><em>, ‘Let me get th</em><em>at</em><em> speck of sawdust out of your eye,’ when you </em><em>don’t see the log in yours?</em><em> Foolish people</em><em>, get the log out of </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em><u>own</u></em><em> </em><em>eye first; then you can see </em><em>how</em><em> to get the speck out of </em><em>the other’s </em><em>eye.</em></span>
