## Luke Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus was passing along between grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples were picking off heads, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the seeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> Some Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what's against the Law on Sabbath?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus answered, "You've read, haven't you, what David and the ones with him did when they were famished? 4He went into God's house and took the consecrated loaves, ate them, and gave them to the ones that were with him. They're against the Law for anybody but priests to eat. 5Person takes precedence over Sabbath."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and taught, and a man with a paralyzed right hand was there. 7The scribes and Pharisees were watching to see if he'd heal on a Sabbath so they could have something to accuse him of.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> He knew what they were thinking and said to the man, "Stand up where people can see you." He stood up. 9"I ask youpl, is it lawful to do good on a Sabbath or to do bad, to save life or destroy it?" 10He looked around at them and told him to hold out his hand. He held it out, and it was restored. 11But they were angry and deliberated about what they could do to Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> At that time he went up on a mountain to spend the night praying. 13At daylight, he called his disciples and chose twelve that he named apostles: 14Simon, he named Peter; his brother Andrew; James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 15Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon called Zelotes, Judas son of James, 16and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. There was a big crowd of disciples and a throng of people from Jerusalem, all over Judaea, and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon. 18They'd come to listen to him and be healed from illness and unclean spirits that were harassing them. 19People in the crowd would try to touch him because power would go out from him and heal them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He looked up at his disciples and said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You that are hungry now are fortunate;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> You're fortunate when people hate you, shun you, insult you, reject you as bad because of the Son of Man. 23Be happy in times like that. Jump up and down for joy because you have a great reward in heaven. Their ancestors used to treat the prophets the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> But woe to you rich people;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Woe to you that eat well now;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Woe to you when everybody says good things about you. Your ancestors used to do the same things about false prophets. 27"I'm telling you, love your enemies. Treat them well that hate you. 28Bless the ones that curse you. Pray for those who mistreat you. 29To the one that slaps you on the cheek offer the other one. From the one that takes your coat, don't withhold your shirt. 30Give to anybody that asks you; don't demand back what someone steals from you. 31Treat people the way you want them to treat you. 32If you love people that love you, what's special about that? Even sinners love people that love them. 33If you do good to people that do good to you, what's special about that? Even sinners do that. 34If you lend to the ones you expect to repay it, what's special about that? Even sinners lend to sinners they expect will repay it. 35On the contrary, love your enemies. Do good to them and lend to them, and don't expect that they will repay it. You'll be greatly rewarded, and you'll be like the Most High, because he's gracious to ungracious people. 36Have compassion like your Father does. 37"Don't criticize, and you won't be criticized. Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Pardon and you'll be pardoned. 38Give and people will give to you good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The measure you measure with, you'll be measured by."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He gave an illustration. "Blind people don't lead blind people, do they? Wouldn't they all fall in the ditch? 40Students are not better off than their teacher, but everybody that finished their education will be like their teacher. 41Why look at a speck of sawdust in somebody else's eye, and not notice the log in your own? 42How can you say to somebody, 'Let me get that speck of sawdust out of your eye,' when you don't see the log in yours? Foolish people, get the log out of your own eye first; then you can see how to get the speck out of the other's eye. 43"A good tree doesn't bear bad fruit, and a bad tree doesn't bear good fruit. 44That's what being a good or bad tree means—its fruit is good or bad. People don't gather figs from thorns or grapes from briars. 45Good people bring good things out of the good treasure in their hearts; bad people bring bad things out of their bad treasure. People's mouths say what overflows from their hearts. 46"Why call me 'Lord' and not do what I tell you? 47I'll tell you what people are like whot listen to what I say and do it. 48They're like a man that was building a house: he dug down and set the foundation on bedrock. When a flood came, the creek rushed against that house and couldn't budge it because he'd built it right. 49People that listen and don't do it are like a fellow that built his house on dirt with no foundation. The creek rushed against it, and it collapsed—a total loss."</span>
