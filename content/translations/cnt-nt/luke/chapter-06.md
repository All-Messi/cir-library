## Luke Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus was passing along between grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples were picking off heads, rubbing them in their hands, and eating the seeds.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some Pharisees said, <em>“Why are you doing what’s against the</em><em> Law on Sabbath</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“</em><em>You’ve read, haven’t you, what David and the ones</em><em> with him did when they were </em><em>famished</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>He went in</em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>God’s</em><em> house and took the consecrated loaves, ate them, and gave them to </em><em>the ones that were with him. They’re</em><em> against the </em><em>L</em><em>aw for anybody but priests to </em><em>eat</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Person takes precedence over Sabbath.”    </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 6:1-5</p>

### Healing a Man with a Paralyzed Hand


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and taught, and a man with a paralyzed right hand was there. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The scribes and Pharisees were watching to see if he’d heal on a Sabbath so they could have something to accuse him of.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He knew what they were thinking and said to the man, <em>“Stand up where people can see you.”</em><em> </em>He stood up. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>“I ask you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em>, </em><em>is it lawful to do good on a Sabbath</em><em> or to do </em><em>bad</em><em>, to save life or destroy it?”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He looked around at them and told him to hold out his hand. He held it out, and it was restored. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>But they were angry and deliberated about what they could do to Jesus.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 6:6-11</p>

### Calling the Twelve Apostles


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup>At that time he went up on a mountain to spend the night praying. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>At daylight, he called his disciples and chose twelve that he named apostles: <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Simon, he named Peter; his brother Andrew; James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon called Zelotes, Judas son of James, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 6:12-16</p>

### Sermon on a Level Place (cp Mt 5-7)


<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. There was a big crowd of disciples and a throng of people from Jerusalem, all over Judaea, and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>They’d come to listen to him and be healed from illness and unclean spirits that were harassing them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>P</em><em>eople in the </em>crowd would try to touch him because power would go out from him and heal them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He looked up at his disciples and said, <em>“You that are poor are fortunate;</em> <em>	</em><em>you have God’s kingdom</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup><em>You </em><em>that are hungry now are fortunate;</em> <em>	</em><em>you’</em><em>ll be filled.</em> <em>You that </em><em>mourn now are fortunate;</em> <em>you will</em><em> laugh.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup><em>You’re </em><em>fortunate</em><em> when people hate you, shun you, insult you, reject you as bad because of the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Be happy</em><em> in times</em><em> like that. J</em><em>ump up and down for joy because you have a great reward in heaven.</em><em> </em><em>Their </em><em>ancestors used to treat </em><em>the prophets</em><em> the same way</em><em>.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>But woe to you rich</em><em> people;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you have your comfort.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Woe to you that eat</em><em> well </em><em>now;</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>you’</em><em>ll be hungry.</em> <em>	Woe to you that laugh now;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you’</em><em>ll grieve and cry.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup><em>Woe </em>to you <em>when everybody </em><em>says good things about </em><em>you.</em><em> </em><em>Your </em><em>ancestors</em><em> used to do the same thing</em><em>s about</em><em> false prophets.</em><em>	</em></span>

### 27“I’m telling you, love your enemies. Treat them well that hate you. 28Bless the ones that curse you. Pray for those who mistreat you. 29To the one that slaps you on the cheek offer the other one. From the one that takes your coat, don’t withhold your shirt. 30Give to anybody that asks you; don’t demand back what someone steals from you. 31Treat people the way you want them to treat you. 32If you love people that love you, what’s special about that? Even sinners love people that love them. 33If you do good to people that do good to you, what’s special about that? Even sinners do that. 34If you lend to the ones you expect to repay it, what’s special about that? Even sinners lend to sinners they expect will repay it. 35On the contrary, love your enemies. Do good to them and lend to them, and don’t expect that they will repay it. You’ll be greatly rewarded, and you’ll be like the Most High, because he’s gracious to ungracious people. 36Have compassion like your Father does. 37“Don’t criticize, and you won’t be criticized. Don’t condemn, and you won’t be condemned. Pardon and you’ll be pardoned. 38Give and people will give to you good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The measure you measure with, you’ll be measured by.” 	Lk 6:27-38


<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>He gave an illustration<em>.</em><em> </em> <em>“</em><em>B</em><em>lind </em><em>people</em><em> don’t lead blind </em><em>people</em><em>, do </em><em>they</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>Wouldn’t they </em><em>all</em><em> fall in the ditch?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>tudent</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>are</em><em> not </em><em>better off than</em><em> </em><em>their</em><em> teacher, but </em><em>everybody that finished their education</em><em> will be like </em><em>their</em><em> teacher.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Why look at a speck of sawdust in </em><em>somebody else’s</em><em> eye, and not notice the log in your own?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>How can you say to </em><em>somebody</em><em>, ‘Let me get th</em><em>at</em><em> speck of sawdust out of your eye,’ when you </em><em>don’t see the log in yours?</em><em> Foolish people</em><em>, get the log out of </em><em>your</em><em> </em><em><u>own</u></em><em> </em><em>eye first; then you can see </em><em>how</em><em> to get the speck out of </em><em>the other’s </em><em>eye.</em> <strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>“A good tree doesn’t bear bad fruit, and a bad tree doesn’t bear </em><em><u>good</u></em><em> fruit.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>That’s what being a good or bad</em><em> tree means—it</em><em>s fruit is good or bad.</em><em> </em><em>People don’t gather figs from thorns or grapes from briars.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>Good people </em><em>bring good th</em><em>ings out of the good treasure in</em><em> </em><em>their</em><em> heart</em><em>s</em><em>; bad </em><em>people</em><em> bring bad things out of </em><em>their</em><em> bad treasure. </em><em>People’s</em><em> mouth</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>say</em><em> </em><em>what</em><em> overflow</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>from</em><em> </em><em>their</em><em> heart</em><em>s</em><em>.</em> <strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>“Why call me ‘Lord</em><em>’ and not do what I tell you?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>tell</em><em> you what </em><em>people are</em><em> like </em><em>who</em><em>t listen to what I say and do it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>They’re</em><em> like a man that was building a house:</em><em> </em><em>he dug down and set the foundation on bedrock.</em><em> </em><em>When a flood came, the </em><em>creek</em><em> </em><em>rushed against that house and couldn’t</em><em> budge it because </em><em>he’d</em><em> built </em><em>it </em><em>right.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>49</sup></strong><em>People </em><em>that </em><em>listen</em><em> and don’t do </em>it <em>are</em><em> like a </em><em>fellow</em><em> that</em><em> built his house on dirt with no</em><em> foundation.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>creek</em><em> </em><em>rushed</em><em> against it</em><em>,</em><em> and it </em><em>collapsed—</em><em>a total loss.”</em><em>	</em></span>
