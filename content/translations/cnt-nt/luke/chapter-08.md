## Luke Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Soon afterward he started traveling from one town and village to another, announcing the coming of God's kingdom. The Twelve were with him 2as well as some women he healed from illnesses and evil spirits: Mary, called the Magdalene, that seven demons had come out of; 3Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod's business manager; Susanna, and quite a few that were contributing to them out of their own resources.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> When a large crowd was gathering and people from various towns were traveling to him, he told a parable. 5"A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some seeds fell along the path; people walked on them, and birds ate them. 6Some fell on rocky ground; they sprouted but shriveled up because they didn't have enough moisture. 7Some fell among thorns; the thorns grew up with them and choked them out. 8Others fell on good ground, grew up, and produced 100 times as much sown. Whoever has ears, listen!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> His disciples asked him what the parable meant. 10He said, "You can come to know the unrevealed things about God's kingdom, but to the rest I'm delivering the message in parables so 11"This is what the parable means. The seed is God's message.  12The seeds along the road represent people that hear the message. Then the devil comes and takes the message away from their hearts so they won't believe and be saved. 13The seeds on rocky ground represent people that are happy to accept the message, but they don't have root. They believe for a while, but in trying times they fall away. 14The seeds falling among the thorns represent people that hear the message; but the cares, wealth, and pleasures of life choke them out, and they don't produce anything. 15But the seeds in the good ground represent those who hear the word with a good and honest heart and produce by staying with it. 16"Nobody lights a lamp and hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed. They put it on a stand so people that come in can see it. 17Everything hidden will become known; everything secret will come to light. 18"Be careful how you listen: whoever has will receive more, and whoever doesn't have will lose what they seem to have."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> His mother and brothers came but couldn't get to him because of the crowd. 20People relayed to him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside the crowd, wanting to see you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He responded, "My mother and brothers are people that hear God's message and do it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> One day he and his disciples got in a boat, and he said, "Let's go to the other side of the lake," and they launched. 23While they were sailing, he went to sleep. A windstorm swept down on the lake, and they were taking on water and in danger of sinking. 24They went and woke him up, "Master, we're going to die!" He got up and rebuked the wind and crashing waves. The wind stopped, and the lake grew calm. 25"Where's your faith?" They were afraid and amazed, and said to one another, "Who is this that even the wind and waves obey?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. 27When Jesus got out of the boat, a fellow from the town met him. For a long time, the man had been demon-possessed, naked, and homeless, living among the tombs. 28When he saw Jesus, he cried out and ran to him and screamed. "What is this, Jesus, you Son of God Most High? Please don't torment me!" 29(Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out. It had seized him many times. He'd be bound under guard with chains and shackles; but he'd break the bonds, and the demon would drive him into uninhabited places.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> Jesus asked him, "What's your name?" "Legion," because lots of demons had gone into him. 31They started begging him not to send them away into the abyss.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> A tremendous herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside. The demons appealed to Jesus to let them go into them. He let them. 33When the demons went into the pigs, the herd stampeded down the steep place into the lake and drowned. 34The herdsmen saw it and ran away and reported it in town and in the countryside. 35People came out to see what had happened and came to Jesus. They found the man dressed and in his right mind, sitting by Jesus. They were afraid. 36Witnesses told them how Jesus had delivered the demoniac.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The whole crowd from the area of the Gerasenes asked him to go away, because fear had overwhelmed them. When he got in the boat to go, 38the fellow begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him back, 39"Go home and tell them what great things God has done for you." He went away and told in every city what great things Jesus had done for him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him; they'd been waiting for him. 41Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell down to Jesus, pleading with him to come to his house. 42His only daughter—about twelve—was at the point of death. As Jesus was making his way along, the crowd was pressing in on him. 43A woman that had been hemorrhaging for twelve years and had spent her whole living on doctors 44came up from behind and touched the fringe of his cloak. The hemorrhaging stopped at once.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Jesus said, "Who touched me?" While they were all denying it, Peter said, "Master, the crowd's pressing on you and jostling you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> But Jesus said, "Somebody touched me. I felt power go out from me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> When the woman saw she hadn't escaped notice, she came trembling, fell down to him, and admitted in front of them why she'd touched him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> He said, "Daughter, your faith has saved you. Have a good day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> While he was still talking to her, someone camep from the house of the synagogue ruler, "Your daughter has died. You needn't bother the Rabbi further."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> When Jesus heard it, he responded, "Don't give up hope; just trust me. She'll be okay." 51He went into the house and wouldn't let anybody go with him except Peter, James, and John, and her parents. 52Everybody was crying and wailing over her. 53They laughed at him because they knew she was dead. 54He took her hand and said, "Girl, get up." 55She started breathing again, and stood up instantly. He told them to give her something to eat. 56Her parents were stunned, but he told them not to tell anybody what had happened.</span>
