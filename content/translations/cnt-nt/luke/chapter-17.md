## Luke Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He said to his disciples, "Inevitably offenses will come, but woe to the ones that bring them. 2It'd be better to have a big millstone put around their necks and be thrown into the sea than to make one of these little ones sin. 3Be careful. If your friend sins, reprimand him; if he repents, forgive him. 4If he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back seven times and says, 'I'm sorry,' forgive him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The apostles said to the Lord, "Give us stronger faith."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> He said, "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it'll obey you. 7"Which one of you that has a servant plowing or tending sheep will say when he comes in, 'Sit down and eat'? 8Won't you saysg, 'Change clothes, fix me something to eat, and wait on me till I'm done eating; then you can eat'? 9You don't thank him, do you, for doing what you've told him? 10Youpl too, when you've done what God's told you, say, 'We're not special; we've just done what we were supposed to."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> On the way to Jerusalem, he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. 12As he came into one village, ten lepers met him. They stood a long way off 13and shouted, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they went, they were cleansed. 15When one of them saw he was healed, he came back, loudly praising God, 16and fell on his face to Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> Jesus responded, "Weren't there ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 18Was this foreigner the only one to come back and praise God?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The Pharisees asked when God's kingdom was coming. He answered, "It won't come in a way you can watch. 21People won't say, 'Here,' or 'There,' because God's kingdom is interpersonal."lit</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He told his disciples, "The time's coming when you'll really want to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you won't see it. 23People will tell you, 'Look, there he is'; 'look, here he is.' Don't go anywhere or follow them. 24As lightning flashes from one end of the sky to the other, that's the way the Son of Man will come. 25First, he has to suffer many things and be rejected by people here now. 26"As in Noah's day, it'll be in the Son of Man's day. 27They were eating and marrying till Noah went into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28As in Lot's day, they were eating, buying, selling, planting, building. 29The day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed them all. 30It'll be the same way when the Son of Man comes back. 31At that time, someone on the roof must not go down to get things out of the house. A person in the field must not go back for things at the house. 32Remember Lot's wife. 33Whoever tries to preserve their life will lose it, and whoever loses it will save it. 34That night two will be in one bed; onemas will be taken and the othermas left. 35Two women will be grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other left.
