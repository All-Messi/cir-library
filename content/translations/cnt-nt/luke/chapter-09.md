## Luke Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority to cast out demons and heal sicknesses. 2He sent them out to announce the coming of God's kingdom and to heal the sick. 3"Don't take anything with you—no staff, sack for extra clothes, bread, money, or two shirts apiece. 4Stay in whatever house you enter till you leave the area. 5Whoever doesn't welcome you, go outside of town and shake the dust off your feet as a gesture to them."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> They went out and started traveling around village by village, preaching and healing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Herod [Antipas] the tetraarch heard about what was happening and was puzzled because some were saying John had risen from the dead, 8that Elijah had appeared, that one of the prophets of old had resurrected. 9Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who is this?" And he kept trying to see him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The apostles came back from their mission and reported to Jesus what all they'd done. He took them and withdrew privately near a town called Bethsaida. 11The crowds found out and followed him. He welcomed them, talked to them about God's kingdom, and healed as many as needed it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> As it was getting late, the Twelve came to him, "Dismiss the crowd so they can go to villages around the countryside to find lodging and buy food. Nobody lives around here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He said, "You feed them." They said, "We only have five loaves and two fish—unless we go buy food for all these people." 14There were about 5,000 men. [15] 16He took the five loaves and two fish, and looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them in pieces, and started giving them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. 17They all ate till they were full, and the leftovers filled twelve medium-sized baskets.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When he was praying alone with the disciples, he asked them, "Who are the crowds saying I am?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> They answered, "John the Baptist, Elijah, or a prophet of old that's resurrected."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He told them not to tell people who he was. 22"I need to suffer a lot of things; be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be executed, and resurrected the third day."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He told the crowd, "If you want to follow me, you have to set aside your own interests, pick up your cross every day, and follow me. 24If you want to save your life, you'll lose it; if you lose your life over me, you'll save it. 25What good does it do to get the whole world and lose your self? 26If you're ashamed of me and my message, I'll be ashamed of you when I come in the glory of the Father and the holy angels. 27Some of you standing here will live to see God's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> About eight days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up on a mountain to pray. 29While he was praying, his face changed appearance, and his clothes became brilliant white. 30Two men were talking to him—Moses and Elijah. 31They had a brilliant appearance and talked about his death soon in Jerusalem. 32Peter and the ones with him were really sleepy, but they were fully awake and saw his brilliant appearance and the two men that were standing with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> As they were leaving him, Peter said, "Master, it's good to be here. Let us make three tents—one each for you and Moses and Elijah"—not thinking clearly about what he was saying. 34A cloud came and engulfed them. It scared them as they went into it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> A voice spoke out of it, "This is my chosen Son; listen to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> When it had spoken, Jesus was the only one there, and his disciples kept quiet. At the time they didn't tell anybody what they'd seen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> The next day when they came down from the mountain, a big crowd met him. 38A man from the crowd ran up, "Rabbi, please look at my boy; he's the only son I have. 39A spirit keeps seizing him and suddenly makes him scream. It throws him into convulsions, makes him foam at the mouth, and bruises him. It hardly ever leaves him alone. 40I pleaded with your disciples to cast it out, but they couldn't."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Jesus answered, "You unbelieving, perverse bunch, how long am I going to be here and deal with you? Bring me your boy."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> While he was coming, the demon attacked him and threw him into convulsions. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his dad. 43aThey were all amazed at God's greatness.	      Lk 9:37-43a 43bWhile everybody was astounded at the things Jesus was doing, he told his disciples, 44"Keep this in mind: I'm going to be betrayed." 45They didn't know what to make of it and were afraid to ask him about it.	 Lk 9:43b-45</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> His disciples got into an argument about who would have highest rank. 47Jesus knew about it, so he took a little child and stood him next to him, 48"Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me. The least among you has the highest rank."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> John answered, "Master, we saw a fellow casting out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he's not following with us."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus said, "Don't stoppl him. Whoever is not against us is for us." 51When the time came to go up to Jerusalem, he headed there 52and sent messengers on ahead. They went to a Samaritan village to make arrangements for him, 53but they wouldn't welcome him because he was heading for Jerusalem. 54When the disciples James and John saw it, they said, "Do you want us to call down fire from the sky to consume them?" 55He turned and reprimanded them, 56and they went on to another village. 57As they were going along the road, a man said, "I'll follow you wherever you go." 58Jesus said, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but I don't have anywhere to rest." 59He said to another man, "Come with me." 60He told him, "Let the dead bury their dead. You go and announce the coming of God's kingdom." 61Another fellow said, "I'll go with you; let me go say goodbye to the ones in my house." 62Jesus told him, "Nobody that takes hold of a plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom."</span>
