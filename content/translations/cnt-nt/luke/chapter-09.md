## Luke Chapter **9**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority to cast out demons and heal sicknesses. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He sent them out to announce <em>the coming of </em>God’s kingdom and to heal the sick. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“Don’t take anything </em><em>with you</em><em>—no staff, sack for extra clothes, bread, money, or two shirts</em><em> apiece</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Stay in whatever house you </em><em>enter </em><em>till you leave the area.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Whoever does</em><em>n’t welcome you, go outside of</em><em> town and shake the dust off your feet as a </em><em>gesture</em><em> to them.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>They went out and started traveling around village by village, preaching and healing.<strong> </strong><strong>  </strong> <strong>	   </strong></span>

### Herod’s Conscience; Confusing John the Baptist and Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Herod <em>[Antipas] </em>the tetraarch heard about what was happening and was puzzled because some were saying John had risen from the dead, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>that Elijah had appeared, that one of the prophets of old had resurrected. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Herod said, <em>“I beheaded John.</em><em> </em><em>Who is this?”</em> And he kept trying to see him.</span>

### Feeding the 5,000


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The apostles came back from their mission and reported to Jesus what all they’d done. He took them and withdrew privately near a town called Bethsaida. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>The crowds found out and followed him. He welcomed them, talked to them about God’s kingdom, and healed as many as needed it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As it was getting late, the Twelve came to him, <em>“</em><em>Dismiss the crowd so they can go </em><em>to villages around the countryside to find lodging and buy </em><em>food</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Nobody lives around here.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He said, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> </em><em>feed them</em><em>.” </em> They said, <em>“We </em><em>only have five loaves and two fish—</em><em>unless we go buy food for all these people.”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>There were</span>

### ,000 men. He said, “Have them sit down in groups of about 50.” [15] 16He took the five loaves and two fish, and looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them in pieces, and started giving them to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. 17They all ate till they were full, and the leftovers filled twelve medium-sized baskets.    	Lk 9:10-17 Peter’s Great Confession


<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When he was praying alone with the disciples, he asked them, <em>“Who are </em><em>the </em><em>crowds saying I am?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>They answered, <em>“John the Baptist</em><em>,</em><em> Elijah,</em><em> or</em><em> </em><em>a </em><em>prophet </em><em>of old that’s</em><em> resurrected.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>“Who do </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> say I am?”</em> Peter answered, <em>“God’s </em><em>Messiah</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>He told them not to tell people who he was.</span>

### The First Distinct Prediction of Messiah’s Death 22“I need to suffer a lot of things; be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be executed, and resurrected the third day.”


<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He told the crowd, <em>“</em><em>If you</em><em> want to follow me</em><em>, you</em><em> </em><em>have</em><em> to set </em><em>aside your</em><em> own interests, pick up </em><em>your</em><em> cross every day, and follow me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>If you want to save your life, you’ll lose it; if you lose your life over me, you’ll save it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>What good does it do to g</em><em>et</em><em> the whole world and lose </em><em>your self</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If you’re </em><em>ashamed of me and my message</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>I’ll</em><em> be ashamed of </em><em>you </em><em>when </em><em>I</em><em> come in the glory of the Father and </em><em>the</em><em> holy angels.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Some </em><em>of you </em><em>standing here </em><em>will live to</em><em> see </em><em>God’s kingdom</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><em>	 </em></span>

### The Transfiguration


<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>About eight days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up on a mountain to pray. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>While he was praying, his face changed appearance, and his clothes became brilliant white. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>Two men were talking to him—Moses and Elijah. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>They had a brilliant appearance and talked about his death soon in Jerusalem. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>Peter and the ones with him were really sleepy, but they were fully awake and saw his brilliant appearance and the two men that were standing with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>As they were leaving him, Peter said, <em>“Master, it’s good to be</em><em> here. Let us make three tents—</em><em>on</em><em>e each for you and Moses and Elijah”—</em>not thinking clearly about what he was saying. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>A cloud came and engulfed them. It scared them as they went into it.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup>A voice spoke out of it,<em> “This is my chosen Son; listen to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>When it had spoken, Jesus was the only one there, and his disciples kept quiet. At the time they didn’t tell anybody what they’d seen.</span>

### Healing a Demoniac Boy


<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The next day when they came down from the mountain, a big crowd met him. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>A man from the crowd ran up, <em>“Rabbi, please look at my boy; he’s the only son I have.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>39</sup></strong><em>A spirit </em><em>keeps </em><em>seiz</em><em>ing</em><em> him and </em><em>suddenly</em><em> </em><em>makes him</em><em> scream.</em><em> </em><em>It </em><em>throws</em><em> him </em><em>into convulsions,</em><em> makes him foam at the mouth</em><em>,</em><em> and bruises him.</em><em> </em><em>It </em><em>hardly ever</em><em> leaves him</em><em> alone</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>I </em><em>pleaded with </em><em>your disciples to cast it out, but they couldn’t.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“</em>You <em>unbelieving,</em><em> perverse bunch, how long am I going to be </em><em>here </em><em>an</em><em>d</em><em> deal with you?</em><em> </em><em>Bring </em><em>me </em><em>your </em><em>boy</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>While he was coming, the demon attacked him and threw him into convulsions. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his dad. <strong><sup>43a</sup></strong>They were all amazed at God’s greatness.</span>

### a Third Prediction of His Death


<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>b</sup></strong>While everybody was astounded at the things Jesus was doing, he told his disciples, <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>“Keep this in mind: I’m </em><em>going to be betrayed.”</em> <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>They didn’t know what to make of it and were afraid to ask him about it.	 <strong>Lk</strong><strong> </strong><strong>9:43b-45</strong> <strong>Discussion About Rank</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup>His disciples got into an argument about who would have highest rank. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>Jesus knew about it, so he took a little child and stood him next to him, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong><em>“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the One that sent me.</em><em> </em><em>The least among you </em><em>has the highest rank</em><em>.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“Don’t </em><em>stop</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> him.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever is not against us is for us.”</em></span>

They went to a Samaritan village to make arrangements for him, <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>but they wouldn’t welcome him because he was heading for Jerusalem. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>When the disciples James and John saw it, they said, <em>“</em><em>D</em><em>o you want us to </em><em>call</em><em> down fire from the sky </em><em>to</em><em> consume them?”</em> <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>He turned and reprimanded them, <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>and they went on to another village.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v58"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>don’t have anywhere</em><em> to </em><em>rest</em><em>.”</em></span>
