## Luke Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> At that time Caesar Augustus issued a decree to take a census of the Roman Empire. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>That was the first census, when Quirinius was governing Syria. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Everyone went to his ancestral city to register. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Joseph went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judaea, to Bethlehem, David’s city because he’d descended from David. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He went up to register with Mary, who was engaged to him and pregnant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While they were there, she came due <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and had her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there wasn’t any room for them in the inn.</span>

### The Angels and the Shepherds


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Nearby, shepherds were watching sheep outdoors at night. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>An angel of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> stood beside them, and the brightness of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> shined around them. They were really afraid. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The angel said, <em>“You d</em><em>on’t </em><em>need to </em><em>be afraid; I</em><em> have</em><em> good news </em><em>for you </em><em>that will </em><em>make everybody happy</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> Savior was born today</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>n David</em><em>’s city</em><em>:</em><em> the Messiah</em><em> the Lord.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ll find a baby wrapped in cloths</em><em>,</em><em> lying in</em><em> a</em><em> manger.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> All of a sudden, a vast host of angels in the sky joined the angel, praising God:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“</em><em>Glory to God in the highest,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	 </em><em>and peace on earth</em><em> among people</em><em> </em><em>he favors</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> When the angels went back to heaven, the shepherds said, <em>“Let’s</em><em> go to Bethle</em><em>hem and see what the L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s told us</em><em> about.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They hurried away and found Mary and Joseph and the baby that was lying in a manger. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When they’d seen him, they told everybody what the angel had said about him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>What the shepherds were saying amazed them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Mary treasured all that up in her heart. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for everything they’d seen and heard, which was just like the angel said.</span>

### Jesus’ Circumcision, Naming,  	and Presentation in the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> When eight days had passed for circumcising him, they named him Jesus, like the angel had directed before Mary became pregnant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When the time was up for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they went up to Jerusalem to present him to the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> —<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>like the Law of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> says, <strong><em>“Set aside to the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>very male firstborn”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 13:2, 12, 15]</strong><strong><em>—</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> and to offer the sacrifice the Law called for: <strong><em>“a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Lev</strong><strong> 12:8]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> A man in Jerusalem named Simeon, a good, devout man, was looking forward to Israel’s liberation. The Holy Spirit was on him and <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>told him that he’d see the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em>’s Messiah before he died. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The Spirit led him into the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to custom, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>he took him in his arms and blessed God:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> <em>“Now, Master, </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>can leave satisfied</em> <em>like you said. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> <em>I’</em><em>ve seen </em><em>the salvation</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> <em>you</em><em>’ve</em><em> prepared </em><em>for all nations</em><em>,</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> <em>a light for revelation to Gentiles</em><em> </em> <em>and for the </em><em>honor</em><em> of your people Israel.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He amazed<em> J</em><em>oseph and Mary </em>with what he was saying. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He blessed them and told Mary, <em>“This child </em><em>is destined to cause</em><em> the rise and fall of many in Israel and</em><em> to be a controversial</em><em> sign</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> sword will </em><em>pierce your own </em><em>heart too</em><em>; lots of</em><em> </em><em>people will show what they’re really like</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> There was Hannah as well, a prophetess, daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher. She was quite elderly, married for seven years <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>and then a widow to age 84. She never left the Temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer day and night. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>She came up and thanked God and talked about <em>the </em><em>child</em> to everyone that was anticipating Jerusalem’s liberation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> When Mary and Joseph had finished what the Law required, they went back home. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>The child grew and became strong and increased in wisdom. God’s grace was on him.</span>

### The Youth of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> Every year his parents would go up to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>When he was twelve, they went up to the festival as usual. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>After it was over, they headed back; but the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it; <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>they thought he was in the caravan. They traveled for a day and started looking for him among relatives and acquaintances. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>When they didn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Three days later they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking them questions. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>Everybody that heard him was surprised at his understanding and answers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> When <em>his parents </em>saw him, they were astonished. His mother said, <em>“Son, why have you done this to us?</em><em> </em><em>Your father and I have been looking </em><em>all over </em><em>for you, worried sick.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> He said, <em>“Why were you loo</em><em>king all over for me? Wouldn’t you know I’d </em><em>be in my Father’s house?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> They didn’t get what he meant.</span>
