## Luke Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>At that time Caesar Augustus issued a decree to take a census of the Roman Empire. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>That was the first census, when Quirinius was governing Syria. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Everyone went to his ancestral city to register. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Joseph went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judaea, to Bethlehem, David’s city because he’d descended from David. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>He went up to register with Mary, who was engaged to him and pregnant. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While they were there, she came due <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>and had her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there wasn’t any room for them in the inn.</span>

### The Angels and the Shepherds


<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Nearby, shepherds were watching sheep outdoors at night. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>An angel of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> stood beside them, and the brightness of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> shined around them. They were really afraid. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The angel said, <em>“You d</em><em>on’t </em><em>need to </em><em>be afraid; I</em><em> have</em><em> good news </em><em>for you </em><em>that will </em><em>make everybody happy</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> Savior was born today</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>n David</em><em>’s city</em><em>:</em><em> the Messiah</em><em> the Lord.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>Y</em><em>ou’ll find a baby wrapped in cloths</em><em>,</em><em> lying in</em><em> a</em><em> manger.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>All of a sudden, a vast host of angels in the sky joined the angel, praising God: <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Glory to God in the highest,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	 </em><em>and peace on earth</em><em> among people</em><em> </em><em>he favors</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>When the angels went back to heaven, the shepherds said, <em>“Let’s</em><em> go to Bethle</em><em>hem and see what the L</em><em>ORD</em><em>’s told us</em><em> about.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They hurried away and found Mary and Joseph and the baby that was lying in a manger. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When they’d seen him, they told everybody what the angel had said about him. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>What the shepherds were saying amazed them. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Mary treasured all that up in her heart. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for everything they’d seen and heard, which was just like the angel said.</span>

### Jesus’ Circumcision, Naming,  and Presentation in the Temple


<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When eight days had passed for circumcising him, they named him Jesus, like the angel had directed before Mary became pregnant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup>When the time was up for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they went up to Jerusalem to present him to the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> —<strong><sup>23</sup></strong>like the Law of the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em> says, <strong><em>“Set aside to the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>very male firstborn”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 13:2, 12, 15]</strong><strong><em>—</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>and to offer the sacrifice the Law called for: <strong><em>“a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Lev</strong><strong> 12:8]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>A man in Jerusalem named Simeon, a good, devout man, was looking forward to Israel’s liberation. The Holy Spirit was on him and <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>told him that he’d see the <em>L</em><em>ORD</em>’s Messiah before he died. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>The Spirit led him into the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to custom, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>he took him in his arms and blessed God: <strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>“Now, Master, </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>can leave satisfied</em> <em>like you said. </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup><em>I’</em><em>ve seen </em><em>the salvation</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup><em>you</em><em>’ve</em><em> prepared </em><em>for all nations</em><em>,</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup><em>a light for revelation to Gentiles</em><em> </em> <em>and for the </em><em>honor</em><em> of your people Israel.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup>He amazed<em> J</em><em>oseph and Mary </em>with what he was saying. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>He blessed them and told Mary, <em>“This child </em><em>is destined to cause</em><em> the rise and fall of many in Israel and</em><em> to be a controversial</em><em> sign</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> sword will </em><em>pierce your own </em><em>heart too</em><em>; lots of</em><em> </em><em>people will show what they’re really like</em><em>.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>There was Hannah as well, a prophetess, daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher. She was quite elderly, married for seven years <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>and then a widow to</span>
<p class="section-ref">age 84</p>

### . She never left the Temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer day and night. 38She came up and thanked God and talked about the child to everyone that was anticipating Jerusalem’s liberation.


<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When Mary and Joseph had finished what the Law required, they went back home. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>The child grew and became strong and increased in wisdom. God’s grace was on him.</span>

### The Youth of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Every year his parents would go up to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival. <strong><sup>42</sup></strong>When he was twelve, they went up to the festival as usual. <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>After it was over, they headed back; but the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it; <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>they thought he was in the caravan. They traveled for a day and started looking for him among relatives and acquaintances. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>When they didn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>Three days later they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening and asking them questions. <strong><sup>47</sup></strong>Everybody that heard him was surprised at his understanding and answers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup>When <em>his parents </em>saw him, they were astonished. His mother said, <em>“Son, why have you done this to us?</em><em> </em><em>Your father and I have been looking </em><em>all over </em><em>for you, worried sick.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Why were you loo</em><em>king all over for me? Wouldn’t you know I’d </em><em>be in my Father’s house?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They didn’t get what he meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup>He went down with them to Nazareth and was subject to them. His mother treasured all that up in her heart. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>Jesus kept growing in wisdom and stature, in favor with God and people.</span>
