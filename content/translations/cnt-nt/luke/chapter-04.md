## Luke Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><sup> </sup>Jesus went away from the Jordan filled with the Holy Spirit. The Spirit was leading him to the desert <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>while the devil tempted him during 40 days. He didn’t eat anything during that time. Afterwards, he was hungry,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> and the devil said, <em>“If you’re </em><em>God’s</em><em> Son, tell this stone to become </em><em>a loaf of </em><em>bread.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“S</em><em>cripture says, </em> <strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>People aren’t to live by bread alone</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em> <strong>[Deut </strong><strong>8:3]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>The devil</em> took him up to show him the kingdoms of the world in an instant, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“I’ll give you all this authori</em><em>ty and their splendor. I</em><em>t’s been given to me, and I can give it to whoever I want</em><em> to</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>If you</em><em> bow down </em><em>to </em><em>me, it’ll all be yours.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“S</em><em>cripture says, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>Worship the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> your God, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and </em></strong><em>only</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>serve him</em></strong><strong><em>’”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 6:13]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>The devil</em> took him to Jerusalem and stood him on the pinnacle of the Temple, <em>“If you’re  God’s</em><em> Son, throw yourself down.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>S</em><em>cripture says, </em> <strong><em>‘He’ll </em></strong><strong><em>tell his angels to guard you</em></strong><strong><em>’ </em></strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 91:11]</strong>;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><em>and</em><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>‘They’ll catch</em></strong><strong><em> you </em></strong> <strong><em>so you</em></strong><strong><em>’ll never trip on a rock</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 91:12]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“It says, </em> <strong><em>‘Don’t </em></strong><strong><em>tempt the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> your God</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>”</em><strong> [</strong><strong>Deut</strong><strong> 6:16].</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When the devil finished tempting him, he left till another chance would come.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Lk 4:1-13</strong> <strong>Introduc</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> the Galilean Ministry</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about him spread all over the region. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He was teaching in their synagogues, and everybody was praising him. <strong>	Lk 4</strong><strong>:14-15</strong> <strong>The First Rejection at Nazareth</strong><strong> </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He went to Nazareth, where he grew up. He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath as usual and stood up to read. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>They handed him a scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled it to where it says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><strong><em>to announce the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>’s acceptable time”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 61:1-2; 58:6]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everybody in the synagogue gave him their full attention. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>He began, <em>“Today </em><em>you can hear </em><em>this scr</em><em>ipture being</em><em> fulfilled.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They started whispering about him, amazed at the gracious way he was speaking. <em>“Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He said, <em>“No doubt you’ll use this saying against me, ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’</em><em> ‘Do here w</em><em>hat we heard </em><em>you did </em><em>in Capernaum.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>I tell you, </em><em>a</em><em> prophet is </em><em>not </em><em>welcome in his hometown.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>There were l</em><em>ots of widows in Israel at the time of Elijah, when it </em><em>ha</em><em>dn’t rain for </em><em>3½</em><em> years, and a severe famine dragged on.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>But </em><em>the </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> didn’t send </em><em>Elijah to any of them but to a widow in Zarephath</em><em>,</em><em> up around Sidon.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>There were l</em><em>ots of lepers in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were cleansed </em><em>except</em><em> Naaman the Syrian.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Everybody in the synagogue just lost it. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They jumped up and threw him out of town. They hustled him to the brow of the hill the town was built on, to throw him over the cliff. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But he passed through the mob and left.</span>

### Teaching and Miracles in Capernaum


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and was teaching them every Sabbath. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>They were impressed because he delivered his message with authority.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A man in the synagogue with an unclean demon shouted, <strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>“Ah, what is this</em><em>, Jesus, you Nazarene?</em><em> </em><em>Did you come to destro</em><em>y us? I know who you are: God’s Holy One!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus ordered him to be<em> </em>quiet and come out of him<em>.</em> The demon convulsed him right in front of them and came out without harming him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Everybody was astounded, <em>“What </em><em><u>is</u></em><em> this?</em><em> </em><em>With authority and power</em><em>,</em><em> he gives orders to unc</em><em>lean spirits, and they come out!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong>The news about him went out everywhere in the surrounding countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He left the synagogue and went to Simon <em>Peter’s</em> house. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus about her. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>He stood over her and ordered the fever to leave. She got up right away and started waiting on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> As the sun was going down, they brought him people with several kinds of illness. He laid hands on each one and healed them. <strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Demons were coming out of many, crying out, <em>“You’re </em><em>God’s</em><em> Son</em>.” He wouldn’t let them keep talking because they knew he was the Messiah. <strong>Lk 4:31-41</strong> <strong>The First General Tour of Galilee</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> At daybreak the next morning, Jesus went out away from people, and the crowd was looking for him. When they found him, they tried to keep him from leaving, <strong><sup>43</sup></strong>but he said, <em>“I need to pre</em><em>sent</em><em> </em><em>God’s kingdom </em><em>in other towns </em><em>too;</em><em> that’s why I was sent.”</em> <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>He continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea [Galilee<sup>ms</sup>].</span>
