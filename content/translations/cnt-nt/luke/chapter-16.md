## Luke Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He also told his disciples, "A rich man had a property manager that was reportedly wasting the rich man's holdings. 2He called him in, 'What's this I hear about you? Give me your record books for your work; you can't continue being manager.' 3The fellow thought to himself, 'What am I going to do? My boss is firing me. I'm not strong enough for hard work; I'm ashamed to beg. 4I know what I'll do, so when I've been let go, people will welcome me into their homes.' 5"He called in each debtor and said to the first, 'How much do you owe my employer?' 8"The employer had to admire the conniving fellow. The children of this world are smarter among their own kind than the children of light are. 9Make friends with your material wealth so when it runs out, they'll welcome you into permanent shelters.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> A person that's reliable in little things will be reliable in big ones. Someone that's unreliable in little things will be unreliable in big ones. 11So if you're not reliable with what has nothing to do with being good, who'll trust you with true wealth?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> If you're not reliable with other people's things, who's going to give you your own?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> No one can serve two masters. You'll disregard one and care about the other. You can't serve God and wealth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> The Pharisees, who loved money, heard these things and started laughing at him. 15He told them, "You try to make yourselves look good to other people, but God knows your hearts. What people prize, God detests. 16The Law and the Prophets were operating until John came. Since then, the coming of God's kingdom is being presented, and people keep trying to get into it by force. 17But it's easier for earth and sky to pass away than for one serif* of the Law to fail."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Everybody that divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery." 19"A rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, celebrated every day in splendor. 20A poor man named Lazarus had been brought regularly to his gate. The man was covered with sores, 21and he wanted to eat what fell from the rich man's table. The dogs even came and licked his sores. 22"The poor man died, and angels carried him away into Abraham's arms. The rich man died, too, and was buried. 23In hell he looked up in torment and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his arms. 24"He called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue; I'm in agony in this flame.' 25"Abraham said, 'Son, remember, you received your good things in life, and Lazarus received bad things. Now he's comforted here, and you're in torment. 26Besides, a wide chasm lies between us and youpl, so people can't cross over from one place to the other.' 27"'Then send him to my father's house—28I have five brothers—to warn them so they won't come to this place of torment.' 30"'No, Father Abraham, if somebody goes to them from the dead, they'll repent.' 31"Abraham told him, 'If they won't listen to Moses and the Prophets, they won't be convinced even if somebody rises from the dead.'"</span>
