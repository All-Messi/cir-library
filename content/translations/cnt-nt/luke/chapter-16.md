<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He also told his disciples, <em>“A rich man had a property manager </em><em>that</em><em> was reported</em><em>ly</em><em> wasting the </em>rich <em>man’s holdings.</em><strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>He called him in, ‘</em><em>What’s this I hear about you?</em><em> Give me your record books for</em><em> your work;</em><em> you can’t continue being manager.’ </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>fellow</em><em> thought to himself, ‘What am I going to do?</em><em> </em><em>My boss is firing me.</em><em> </em><em>I’m not strong enough for hard work; I’m ashamed to beg.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em><u>I</u></em><em> know what I’ll do, so when I’ve been </em><em>let go</em><em>, people will welcome me into their homes.’</em><em> </em> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>“He called in each </em><em>debtor and said to the first, ‘</em><em>How much do you owe my employer?’</em> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“‘</em><em>800</em><em> gallons of olive oil.’</em> <em>	“‘Take your bill, sit down quick and</em><em> write “400</em><em>.”’</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>“‘How much do </em><em><u>you</u></em><em><sup>sg </sup></em><em>owe?’</em> <em>	“‘</em><em>1,000</em><em> bushels of wheat.’</em> <em>	“‘Take your bill and write, “</em><em>800</em><em>.”’</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>“The employer </em><em>had to admire</em><em> the conniving </em><em>fellow</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>The </em><em>children</em><em> of this </em><em>world</em><em> are smarter among their own kind than the </em><em>children</em><em> of light are.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>Make friends with your</em><em> </em><em>material </em><em>wealth so when it runs out, </em><em>they’ll</em><em> welcome you into permanent shelters.</em><em> </em></span>

### The Law and God’s Kingdom


<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard these things and started laughing at him. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>He told them, <em>“You </em><em>try to make yourselves look good</em><em> to other people, but God knows your hearts.</em><em> </em><em>What people prize</em><em>,</em><em> God detests.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>The L</em><em>aw and the </em><em>P</em><em>rophets</em><em> were </em><em>operat</em><em>ing</em><em> until John</em><em> came</em><em>.</em><em> Since then</em><em>, </em>the coming of<em> God’s kingdom </em><em>is being </em><em>presented, and people keep</em><em> trying to get in</em><em>to</em><em> it by force.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>But it’s easier for earth and sky to pass away than for one </em><em>serif*</em><em> of the </em><em>L</em><em>aw to fail.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup><em>Every</em><em>body that divorces his wife and marries </em><em>someone else</em><em> commits adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</em><em>”</em></span>

### Parable About the Rich Man and Lazarus  19“A rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, celebrated every day in splendor. 20A poor man named Lazarus had been brought regularly to his gate. The man was covered with sores, 21and he wanted to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. The dogs even came and licked his sores.  22“The poor man died, and angels carried him away into Abraham’s arms. The rich man died, too, and was buried. 23In hell he looked up in torment and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his arms.  24“He called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue; I’m in agony in this flame.’ 25“Abraham said, ‘Son, remember, you received your good things in life, and Lazarus received bad things. Now he’s comforted here, and you’re in torment. 26Besides, a wide chasm lies between us and youpl, so people can’t cross over from one place to the other.’ 27“‘Then send him to my father’s house—28I have five brothers—to warn them so they won’t come to this place of torment.’  29“Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. They can listen to them.’ 30“‘No, Father Abraham, if somebody goes to them from the dead, they’ll repent.’ 31“Abraham told him, ‘If they won’t listen to Moses and the Prophets, they won’t be convinced even if somebody rises from the dead.’”	Lk 16:19-31 Comments on Offences and Faith
