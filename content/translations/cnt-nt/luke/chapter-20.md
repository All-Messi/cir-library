## Luke Chapter 20

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> One day he was teaching the people in the Temple and delivering good news. The chief priests, scribes, and elders confronted him: 2"What right do you have to do this? Who gave you that right?" 3"I'll ask you something too. Tell me, 4Was John's baptism from heaven or humans?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They talked it over, 6"If we say, 'From heaven,' he'll say, 'Why didn't you believe him?' If we say, 'From humans,' the people will stone us; they're convinced John was a prophet." 7They said they didn't know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus said, "I won't tell you either what right I have to do what I'm doing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He started telling the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to tenants, and went on an extended trip. 10At harvest time he sent the tenants a servant to receive the fruit from the vineyard. But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed. 11"He proceeded to send another servant. They beat him up, too, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away with nothing. 12He sent a third. They wounded him and threw him out. 13The owner said, 'What am I going to do? I'll send my dear son. Maybe they'll respect him.' 14When the tenants saw him, they started talking among themselves, 'That's the heir. Let's kill him so the vineyard will belong to us.' 15They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What's the owner going to do to them? 16He'll come and destroy them and give the vineyard to other tenants."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He looked at them and said, "What then does this scripture mean,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Everybody that falls on that rock will get bruised. Whoever it falls on will get crushed."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The scribes and chief priests were ready to seize him right then, but they were afraid of the people. They knew he'd told that parable on them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> They kept a close eye on him and sent spies pretending to be honest men so they could latch onto something he said. That way they could turn him over to the governor's authority.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> They asked him, "Rabbi, we know you're straightforward when you teach. It doesn't matter who you're talking to; you teach the way of God correctly. 22Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He saw through their deception, 24"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have on it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> They couldn't make anything out of what he said in front of his audience. They were dumbfounded by his answer and didn't say anything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Some Sadducees—who deny there's resurrection—came and asked him, 28"Rabbi, Moses wrote to us, 'If a brother dies and has a wife but no children, his brother is to marry his wife and raise up offspring to his brother' [Deut 25:5; Gen 38:8]. 29There were seven brothers, and the first married a wife and died childless. 30The second and 31third through the seventh married her and died and didn't leave any children. 32Last of all, the woman died too. 33Whose wife will she be in the resurrection? They all had her as a wife."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus said, "People in this age get married. 35The ones considered worthy of receiving that age and the resurrection of the dead don't get married. 36They can't die anymore either, they're like angels. They're like God and participate in the resurrection. 37"But, that the dead are raised, even Moses showed when he said in the 'bush passage,' 'I'm the LORD, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's God' [Ex 3:6, 15-16]. 38He's not a God of the dead, but of the living; everybody is alive to him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Some scribes responded, "Rabbi, that was a good answer." 40After that, nobody tried to trip him up with loaded questions.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> He said to them, "How do they say the Messiah is David's son? 42He says himself in the Book of Psalms,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> Right in front of everybody, he told the crowd and his disciples, 46"Watch out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces, chief seats in the synagogues, places of honor at banquets. 47They confiscate widows' houses and offer long prayers for show. They'll get a more severe condemnation."</span>
