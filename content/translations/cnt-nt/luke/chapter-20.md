## Luke Chapter **20**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>One day he was teaching the people in the Temple and delivering good news. The chief priests, scribes, and elders confronted him: <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“W</em><em>hat right </em><em>do </em><em>you</em><em> have to do this? </em><em>Who gave you that right?”</em> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>“I’ll ask you something too.</em><em> </em><em>Tell me, </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>W</em><em>as John’s baptism from heaven or </em><em>humans</em><em>?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They talked it over, <strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“If we </em><em>say, ‘From heaven,’ he’ll say, ‘</em><em>Why didn’t you believe him?’</em><em> </em><em>If we say, ‘From </em><em>humans</em><em>,’ the people w</em><em>ill stone us;</em><em> they</em><em>’re</em><em> convinced John was a prophet.”</em> <strong><em><sup>7</sup></em></strong>They said they didn’t know.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“I won’t t</em><em>ell you either what right I have</em><em> to do </em><em>what I’m doing</em><em>.”</em></span>

### The Parable About a Vineyard


<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He started telling the people this parable: <em>“A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to tenants, and went on </em><em>an extended </em><em>trip.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>At harvest time he sent the tenants a servant </em><em>to receive </em><em>the </em><em>fruit from</em><em> the vineyard.</em><em> </em><em>But the tenants beat him up and sent him away empty-handed.</em> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>“He proceeded to send another servant.</em><em> </em><em>They beat him up</em><em>,</em><em> too</em><em>,</em><em> and treated him shamefully, and sent him away with nothing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>He sent a third.</em><em> </em><em>They wounded him and threw him out. </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>The owner said, ‘What am I going to do?</em><em> </em><em>I’ll </em><em>send my </em><em>dear</em><em> son.</em><em> </em><em>Maybe they’ll respect him.</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>When the tenants saw him, th</em><em>ey started talking among themselves, ‘</em><em>Th</em><em>at’</em><em>s the heir.</em><em> </em><em>Let’s kill him so the vineyard will belong to us.</em><em>’ </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</em><em> </em><em>What</em><em>’s</em><em> the owner </em><em>going to </em><em>do to them?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>He’ll come and destroy them and give the vineyard to other tenants.”</em><em>	</em> The <em>audience</em> said, <em>“Surely not!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He looked at them and said, <em>“What then </em><em>doe</em><em>s </em><em>this scripture mean</em><em>, </em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘The stone the builders rejected</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>has become the cornerstone’</em></strong> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:22]</strong>?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup><em>Everybody that falls on that rock will get bruised.</em><em> </em><em>Whoever it falls on will get crushed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>The scribes and chief priests were ready to seize him right then, but they were afraid of the people. They knew he’d told that parable on them.</span>

### The Question About Tribute to Caesar


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>They kept a close eye on him and sent spies pretending to be honest men so they could latch onto something he said. That way they could turn him over to the governor’s authority.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>They asked him, <em>“Rabbi, we know you’re </em><em>straightforward when you teach. It doesn’t matter </em><em>who you’re talking to</em><em>; you</em><em> teach the way of God correctly.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He saw through their deception, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“Show me a denarius.</em><em> </em><em>Whose image and </em><em>in</em><em>scription</em><em> does it have</em><em> on it?”</em> <em>“Caesar’s.”</em><em>	</em> <strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>“Then </em><em>p</em><em>ay Caesar</em><em> what you owe </em><em>Caesar and </em><em>pay </em><em>God</em><em> what you owe </em><em>God.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>They couldn’t make anything out of what he said in front of his audience. They were dumbfounded by his answer and didn’t say anything.</span>

### The Question About the Resurrection


<span class="verse" id="v27"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Some Sadducees—who deny there’s resurrection—came and asked him, <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>“Rabbi, Moses wrote to us, </em><strong><em>‘If a brother dies </em></strong><em>and has a wife</em><strong><em> but no children, his brother is to marry his wife and ra</em></strong><strong><em>ise up offspring to his brother</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Deut 2</p>

### 5:5; Gen 38:8]. 29There were seven brothers, and the first married a wife and died childless. 30The second and 31third through the seventh married her and died and didn’t leave any children. 32Last of all, the woman died too. 33Whose wife will she be in the resurrection? They all had her as a wife.”


<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>People in this age</em><em> </em><em>get married</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>The ones</em><em> considered worthy of receiving that age and the resurrection of the dead don’t </em><em>get married</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>They </em><em>can’t die anymore either</em><em>,</em><em> they’re like angels.</em><em> </em><em>They’re </em><em>like</em><em> God and </em><em>participate</em><em> </em><em>in </em><em>the resurrection.</em> <em>	</em><strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“But, that the dead are raised, </em><em>even </em><em>Moses showed when he said in the </em><em>‘</em><em>bush passage,</em><em>’</em><em> </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong>I’m<em> t</em><em>he </em><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</em></strong><strong><em>’s God’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</span>
<p class="section-ref">Ex 3:6</p>

### , 15-16]. 38He’s not a God of the dead, but of the living; everybody is alive to him.”


<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup>Some scribes responded, <em>“Rabbi,</em><em> that was a good answer</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>After that, nobody tried to trip him up with <em>loaded </em>questions.</span>

### The Question About the Son of David


<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He said to them, <em>“How do they say the </em><em>Messiah</em><em> is </em><em>David’s son</em><em>?</em> <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>He says himself in the Book of Psalms,</em> <strong><em>‘The </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> said to my Lord,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	“Sit </em></strong><strong><em>at</em></strong><strong><em> my right hand</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><strong><em>till I make your enemies your footstool”’</em></strong><em>”</em> <strong>[</strong><strong>Ps</strong><strong> 110:1]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup><em>If David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can</em><em> he </em><em>be </em><em>his son?”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Denouncing the Scribes and Pharisees


<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>Right in front of everybody, he told the crowd and his disciples, <strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>“Watch out for the scribes. They</em><em> like to walk around in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces, chief seats in the synagogu</em><em>es, places of honor at banquets.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>They</em><em> </em><em>confiscate</em><em> widows’ houses and offer long prayers</em><em> for show</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll get </em><em>a more severe condemnation.”</em><em>	</em></span>
