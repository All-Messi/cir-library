## Luke Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>He was praying in a place. When he finished, one of his disciples said, “<em>T</em><em>each us </em><em>how </em><em>to pray like John </em><em>used to teach</em><em> his disciples.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said,<em> </em> <em>“When you pray, say,</em> <em>‘Father, you</em><em> are holy.</em> <em>	</em><em>We want y</em><em>our kingdom </em><em>to </em><em>come.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> <em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>Give us our </em><em>food </em><em>each day.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>	</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>Forgive us of our sins</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>because </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> </em><em>forgive everybody that</em><em>’s in debt to</em><em> us.</em> <em>Don’t let us get led into </em><em>temptation.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He was casting a demon out that made a man mute. When he’d cast it out, the man could speak, and the crowd was surprised. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Some of them said, <em>“He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.”</em> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Others, trying to test him, were looking for him to give them a sign out of the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He knew what they were thinking, <em>“</em><em>An</em><em>y kingdom </em><em>falls that’s at cross purposes with</em><em> itself.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>If Satan </em><em>is at cross purposes with</em><em> himself, how will his kingdom stand—because you’re saying</em><em> I cast out demons by Beelzebub? </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>If I</em><em>’m</em><em> cast</em><em>ing</em><em> out demons by Beelzebub, who </em><em>do</em><em> your</em><em> student</em><em>s cast them out by?</em><em> T</em><em>hey’ll be your judges.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> While he was talking, a woman in the crowd shouted, <em>“Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts you nursed.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> But <u>he</u> said, “<em>More important, blessed are people</em><em> that hear God’s </em><em>message</em><em> and keep it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> As the crowds were growing, he said<em>, </em> <em>“This is a wicked </em><em>time. People are looking for a sign, but they’re not going to </em><em>get </em><em>one</em><em> </em><em>other than</em><em> the sign of Jonah.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>As </em><em>he</em><em> was a sign to the Ninevites, so the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> will be to </em><em>people of today</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>The queen of the south will stand up in the</em><em> judgment with people of today and condemn them. S</em><em>he came from the ends of the earth to hear </em><em>Solomon’s</em><em> wisdom, and something greater than Solomon is here.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with</em><em> people today and condemn them. T</em><em>hey repented </em><em>when</em><em> Jonah</em><em> preached to them</em><em>, and something greater than Jonah is here.</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he’d finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him. He went in and directly reclined at table. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that Jesus hadn’t ceremonially washed his hands before the meal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> The Lord said to him<em>, </em> <em>“Y</em><em>ou Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you’re </em><em>filled with</em><em> </em><em>theft</em><em> and wickedness.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>You foolish people, didn’t the One that made the outside make the inside too?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>G</em><em>ive the internal things over to charity, and everything will be clean to you.</em><em> </em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> A lawyer spoke up<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Rabbi, when you say things like that, you insult us too.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Jesus said, <em>“Woe to you lawyers as well!</em><em> </em><em>You load people down with </em><em>hard-to-carry</em><em> burdens, but </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> don’t touch them with one of your fingers.</em></span>
