## Luke Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Meantime, the thousands in the crowd <em>that had been following him </em>were so packed together they were stepping on each other. Jesus started saying to his disciples first, <em>“Watch out for the </em><em>yeast from</em><em> the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>Everything covered up will be </em><em>uncovere</em><em>d; everything hidden will be </em><em>discovered</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>What you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> say in the dark will be heard in the light</em><em>; </em><em>what you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> whisper in the storerooms will be </em><em>shouted from</em><em> the housetops.</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Friends, don’t be afraid of people that can</em><em> kill the body and that’s all they can do.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>I’ll show you who to be afraid of:</em><em> </em><em>the One </em><em>with the right to kill you and throw you into hell</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Yes, </em><em>be afraid of</em><em> </em><em><u>him</u></em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>Don’t 5 sparrows</span>

### assarions? And God doesn’t forget about a one of them. 7The very hairs on your head are numbered. Don’t be afraid; you’re worth more than lots of sparrows.	 8“Everyone that acknowledges me to other people, I’ll acknowledge to God’s angels. 9Whoever denies who I am in front of other people I’ll deny in front of God’s angels. 10Everyone that slanders me can be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit won’t be forgiven.  11“When they take you in front of synagogues, rulers, and authorities, don’t worry about what to say to defend yourselves. 12The Holy Spirit will teach you at the time what to say.”  	Lk 12:1-12 The Parable About the Rich Fool


<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A fellow in the crowd said, <em>“Rabbi, tell my brother to s</em><em>plit</em><em> the inheritance with me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, who appointed me </em><em>to act as a </em><em>judge</em><em> or arbitor</em><em> </em><em>in</em><em> you</em><em>r</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>affairs</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“Guard against every </em><em>kind</em><em> of greed</em><em>;</em><em> even in abundance a person’s life doesn’t consist of what he owns.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>He told the crowd a parable, <em>“A rich man’s </em><em>ground</em><em> produced a bumper crop.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>He deliberated</em><em> w</em><em>hat to do</em><em> because he didn’t</em><em> ha</em><em>ve enough room to put up his crop. </em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><em>He said, ‘This is what I’ll do: </em><em>I’ll t</em><em>ear</em><em> down my</em><em> barns and build bigger ones</em><em> </em><em>so I can </em><em>store all my grain and good things.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’ll </em><em>tell</em><em> myself, </em><em>“</em><em>You have </em><em>a lot of</em><em> good things for years to come.</em><em> </em><em>Rest, eat, drink, celebrate.</em><em>”’ </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>God said, ‘You fool</em><em>ish man</em><em>!</em><em> Tonight they’ll demand your life;</em><em> who will these things belong to</em><em> then</em><em>?’ </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>That’s </em><em>how it is with people that store</em><em> up for </em><em>themselves</em><em> and </em><em>aren’t</em><em> rich toward God.”</em><em>	 </em></span>

### Encouragement to Trust God


<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said to his disciples, <em>“So don’t worry about </em><em>your life what you’re going to eat</em><em> or</em><em> for your body what you’re going to</em><em> wear.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Life is more than food, and </em><em>the body </em><em>is more </em><em>than</em><em> </em><em>clothes</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>Think about </em><em>black birds; they don’t sow or reap</em><em>;</em><em> they don’t have a storeroom or barn.</em><em> </em><em>God feeds them.</em><em> </em><em>You</em><em>’re worth a lot more than birds! </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Which of you by worrying can add </em><em>18 inches</em><em> to </em><em>your</em><em> height?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If you can’t do </em><em>such a</em><em> small thing, why worry about the rest?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>Consider</em><em> how lilies grow; they don’t </em><em>work hard</em><em> or spin, but even Solomon</em><em> in all his splendor wasn’t dressed</em><em> like one of them. </em><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>If God </em><em>“dresses”</em><em> </em><em>the plants in the field that</em><em> way—here today</em><em>, burned tomorrow—</em><em>how much more will he </em><em>dress</em><em> you, people with little faith.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>Don’t </em><em>concentrate on what you</em><em>’re going</em><em> </em><em>to </em><em>eat, and don’t worry.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>Material things a</em><em>re what </em><em>Gentiles desire</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Your Father knows you need them.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>Seek </em><em>out </em><em>his kingdom, and </em><em>material things will </em><em>come along with it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>You d</em><em>on’t </em><em>need to be afraid, little flock. Y</em><em>our Father </em><em>delights in giving</em><em> you the kingdom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>Sell what you own and give it to charity.</em><em> </em><em>Make money bags that don’t wear out, never-ending </em><em>wealth </em><em>in heaven, where thieves don’t </em><em>steal</em><em> and moths don’t ruin.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>Your heart will be where your wealth is</em><em>.</em></span>

### Watchfulness: Parable About the Waiting Servants 35“Be dressed and ready with your lamps lit 36like servants waiting for their master to come back from a wedding so they can open the door when he knocks. 37Blessed are the servants their master finds watching. He’ll put on servant’s clothes, have them recline at table, and wait on them. 38If he comes in the second watch or even the third and finds them ready, they’re blessed. 39Be sure of this: if the homeowner had known what time the thief would come, he wouldn’t have let him break into his house. 40You be ready because the Son of Man will come when you don’t expect him.”


<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>41</sup></strong>Peter said, <em>“Are you telling </em><em><u>us</u></em><em> that</em><em> parable or everybody?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>He said, <em>“Who’s a wise,</em><em> reliable property manager that </em><em>his</em><em> </em><em>master</em><em> puts in charge of </em><em>providing meals </em><em>at the right time?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>Blessed is the servant that his </em><em>master</em><em> finds doing his job when he comes.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>He’ll put him in charge of everything he owns.</em><em>	 </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 12:</p>

### 35-44 45“If that servant says to himself, ‘It’ll be a long time before my master gets back’; and he starts beating on the other servants, men and women, eating and getting drunk, 46the master will come on a day he doesn’t expect him at a time he doesn’t know, he’ll flog him severely, and assign him the fate of disbelievers. 47“The servant that knew his master’s will and wasn’t ready or didn’t act accordingly will get many lashes. 48The one that didn’t know and committed things that deserve lashes will get few lashes. A lot will be expected of everybody that receives a lot. People ask more from somebody they’ve entrusted with more. 		 	Lk 12:45-48 	49“I came to set the earth on fire, and I wish it was already lit! 50I have a baptism to be baptized with, and I’m under duress till it’s done. 51Do you think my coming will bring peace on earth? No, it’ll bring division. 52From now on five members of a family will team up three against two and two against three:


<span class="verse" id="v53"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>f</em><em>ather </em><em>against</em><em> son</em><em>;</em><em> son </em><em>against</em><em> father;</em> <em>	mother </em><em>against</em><em> daughter</em><em>;</em><em> daughter </em><em>against</em><em> mother;</em> <em>	mother-in-law </em><em>against</em><em> daughter-in-law</em><em>;</em><em> </em> <em>daughter-in-law </em><em>against</em><em> mother-in-law.”</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v54"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He told the crowd as well,<em> </em> <em>“When you see </em><em>cloud</em><em>s</em><em> coming up in the west, right away you say, ‘A storm’s coming,’ and </em><em>you’re right</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>55</sup></strong><em>When you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It’s going to get hot,’ and it </em><em>does</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>56</sup></strong><em>You foolish people, you can read</em><em> earth and sky; why </em><em>don’t you know how to</em><em> read the </em><em>signs of the</em><em> time</em><em>s</em><em>?</em> <strong><sup>57</sup></strong><em>“Why </em><em>ca</em><em>n’t you figure out what’s right on your own?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>58</sup></strong><em>While you’re </em><em>on the way to court </em><em>with your opponent, </em><em>do your best</em><em> to settle matters so </em><em>he does</em><em>n’t drag you </em><em>in front of</em><em> the judge, the judge </em><em>turn</em><em> you </em><em>over </em><em>to the </em><em>officer of the court</em><em>, and the </em><em>officer</em><em> put you in </em><em>jail</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>59</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> won’t </em><em>get </em><em>out till you pay the last penny.”</em><em>	</em><strong> </strong> <strong><sup>	</sup></strong></span>
