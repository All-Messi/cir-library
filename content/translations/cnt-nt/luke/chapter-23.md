## Luke Chapter **23**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>The whole assembly got up and took him to Pilate. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They started accusing him, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>his man</em><em>’s</em><em> misleading our nation, forbidding people to pay tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be </em>the<em> Messiah</em><em>, a king.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Pilate asked him, <em>“Are you king of the Jews?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, <em>“</em><em>T</em><em>his man</em><em>’s not guilty of anything!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>They kept insisting, <em>“He stirs up the people, teaching everywhere from Galilee to here.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Lk 23:1-5</p>

### Trial Before Herod Antipas


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When Pilate heard that, he asked if he was a Galilean. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>When he found out Jesus was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him on to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at the time. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Herod was glad to see him. He’d wanted to see him for a long time because of what he’d been hearing about him; he’d hoped to see him do a sign. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He asked him lots of questions, but Jesus didn’t answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>The chief priests and scribes were standing <em>there, </em>accusing him aggressively. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>After treating him with contempt and making fun of him, Herod and his soldiers dressed him in a splendid robe and sent him back to Pilate. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Herod and Pilate became friends that day. They’d been at odds with each other.</span>

### The Second Trial Before Pilate


<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Pilate called together the chief priests, rulers, and the people, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>“You brought </em>me<em> </em><em>this </em><em>fellow</em><em> as someone that</em><em>’s</em><em> incit</em><em>ing</em><em> the people to revolt.</em><em> </em><em>I examined him in your presence and didn’t find him guilty of what you claimed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>Herod didn’t either</em><em>;</em><em> he sent him back.</em><em> </em><em>He hasn’t done anything worth executing him for.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I’ll flog him and release him.”</em> [<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>]<sup>ms</sup></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They shouted out together, <em>“Away with him!</em><em> </em><em>Release Barabbas to us</em><em>!</em><em>”</em> (<strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Barabbas had been put in prison for a riot in the city and for murder.) <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Pilate wanted to release Jesus and addressed them again, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>but they kept yelling, <em>“Crucify him!</em><em> </em><em>Crucify him!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>For the third time he said, <em>“What’s he done?</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>have</em><em>n’t </em><em>seen</em><em> anything worth execu</em><em>ting him for. I’ll flog</em><em> him</em><em> and</em><em> release him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>But they kept pressing with loud demands to crucify him, and they were getting the upper hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Pilate decided to give in to them <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>and release the one they were asking for—the one in prison for riot and murder—and sentenced Jesus to death like they wanted.</span>

### The Way to Golgotha


<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>As they were leading him away, they made Simon—a Cyrenian coming in from the countryside—carry the cross in front of Jesus. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>A big crowd followed him, including women that were mourning and crying over him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup>Jesus turned and said, <em>“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me.</em><em> </em><em>Cry for yourselves and your children.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>The t</em><em>ime’s coming when they’ll say t</em><em>he barren</em><em> are fortunate</em><em>,</em><em> the wombs that never bore,</em><em> the breasts that never nursed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>T</em><em>hey’ll say to the mountains, ‘</em><em>Bring an avalanche</em><em> on u</em><em>s,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>If they</em><em>’re</em><em> do</em><em>ing</em><em> thi</em><em>s when the wood’s green, what’</em><em>ll </em><em>they do</em><em> when it’s dry?”</em><em>	</em></span>

[[<strong><sup>34</sup></strong>Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; they don’t know what they’re doing.”]]<sup>ms</sup> They cast lots to divide up his clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The people stood watching. The rulers were making fun of him, <em>“He saved other people</em><em>; let him save himself i</em><em>f he’</em><em>s God’s </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, the Chosen One.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The soldiers mocked him too and offered him some sour wine, <strong><sup>37</sup></strong><em>“If you’</em><em>re K</em><em>ing of the Jews, save yourself.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The inscription above him was, <em>“K</em><em>ing of the Jews.”</em></span>

Y</em><em>ou’re under the sa</em><em>me condemnation! </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>We’re </em><em>getting what we deserve, but he</em><em> hasn’t done anything</em><em> wrong</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He said, <em>“Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou’ll be with me in Paradise</em><em> today</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>44</sup></strong><strong><sup>-45</sup></strong>About noon, it got dark over the whole country</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>A member of the Sanhedrin named Joseph, a good, upright man, <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>hadn’t been in agreement with what they did. He was from Arimathea, a town of the Jews, and was waiting for God’s kingdom. <strong><sup>52</sup></strong>He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>He took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put him in a new rock-hewn tomb. <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>It was getting late on Preparation Day, and Sabbath was about to start. <strong><sup>55</sup></strong>The women that came with him from Galilee followed along and saw where they put the body. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>They went back to fix spices and ointment, and rested on the Sabbath like <em>the Law</em> commanded.</span>
