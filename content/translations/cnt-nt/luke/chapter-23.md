## Luke Chapter 23

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> The whole assembly got up and took him to Pilate. 2They started accusing him, "This man's misleading our nation, forbidding people to pay tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be the Messiah, a king."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Pilate asked him, "Are you king of the Jews?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "This man's not guilty of anything!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> They kept insisting, "He stirs up the people, teaching everywhere from Galilee to here."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When Pilate heard that, he asked if he was a Galilean. 7When he found out Jesus was from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him on to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at the time. 8Herod was glad to see him. He'd wanted to see him for a long time because of what he'd been hearing about him; he'd hoped to see him do a sign. 9He asked him lots of questions, but Jesus didn't answer him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The chief priests and scribes were standing there, accusing him aggressively. 11After treating him with contempt and making fun of him, Herod and his soldiers dressed him in a splendid robe and sent him back to Pilate. 12Herod and Pilate became friends that day. They'd been at odds with each other.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Pilate called together the chief priests, rulers, and the people, 14"You brought me this fellow as someone that's inciting the people to revolt. I examined him in your presence and didn't find him guilty of what you claimed. 15Herod didn't either; he sent him back. He hasn't done anything worth executing him for. 16I'll flog him and release him." [17]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> They shouted out together, "Away with him! Release Barabbas to us!" (19Barabbas had been put in prison for a riot in the city and for murder.) 20Pilate wanted to release Jesus and addressed them again, 21but they kept yelling, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> For the third time he said, "What's he done? I haven't seen anything worth executing him for. I'll flog him and release him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But they kept pressing with loud demands to crucify him, and they were getting the upper hand.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Pilate decided to give in to them 25and release the one they were asking for—the one in prison for riot and murder—and sentenced Jesus to death like they wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> As they were leading him away, they made Simon—a Cyrenian coming in from the countryside—carry the cross in front of Jesus. 27A big crowd followed him, including women that were mourning and crying over him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jesus turned and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't cry for me. Cry for yourselves and your children. 29The time's coming when they'll say the barren are fortunate, the wombs that never bore, the breasts that never nursed. 30They'll say to the mountains, 'Bring an avalanche on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' 31If they're doing this when the wood's green, what'll they do when it's dry?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They took two others to execute with him. 33When they got to a place called The Skull, they crucified him and the two criminals, one on each side of him. [[34Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; they don't know what they're doing."]]ms They cast lots to divide up his clothes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> The people stood watching. The rulers were making fun of him, "He saved other people; let him save himself if he's God's Messiah, the Chosen One."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> The soldiers mocked him too and offered him some sour wine, 37"If you're King of the Jews, save yourself."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> The inscription above him was, "King of the Jews."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> One of those hanged with him lashed out, "Save yourself and us. You're the Messiah, right?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> The other reprimanded him, "Don't you even fear God? You're under the same condemnation! 41We're getting what we deserve, but he hasn't done anything wrong."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> He said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Jesus said, "You'll be with me in Paradise today." 44-45About noon, it got dark over the whole country till 3 o'clock, and the Temple curtain tore in two. 46Jesus shouted, "Father, I'm committing my spirit to you!" [Ps 31:5] and quit breathing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> When the centurion saw what happened, he praised God, "Surely this man was innocent." 48When the crowd that had gathered for this spectacle saw what all happened, they went home beating their chests. 49His acquaintances and the women that came with him from Galilee stood a long way off, watching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> A member of the Sanhedrin named Joseph, a good, upright man, 51hadn't been in agreement with what they did. He was from Arimathea, a town of the Jews, and was waiting for God's kingdom. 52He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. 53He took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put him in a new rock-hewn tomb. 54It was getting late on Preparation Day, and Sabbath was about to start. 55The women that came with him from Galilee followed along and saw where they put the body. 56They went back to fix spices and ointment, and rested on the Sabbath like the Law commanded.</span>
