## Luke Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus was passing through Jericho, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and a wealthy tax collector named Zacchaeus <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>wanted to see what he looked like, but he couldn’t because of the crowd; he was too short. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So he ran ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that Jesus was heading toward. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Jesus got there, he looked up, <em>“</em><em>Zacchaeus, hurry and climb down. </em><em>I need to stay at your </em><em>place</em><em> today.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He hurried and climbed down and welcomed him happily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When people saw it, they started grumbling, <em>“He’s going</em><em> in to be a guest with a sinner!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, <em>“Half of what I own, </em><em>I’m going to give to the poor</em><em>. I</em><em>f I’ve cheated anybody, I’</em><em>ll </em><em>repay it </em><em>four</em><em> times over.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus said <em>this</em> about him, <em>“S</em><em>alvation has come to this house</em><em> today;</em><em> he’s a </em><em>son</em><em> of Abraham too.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> came to seek and save sinners.”</em></span>

### Parable About the Pounds


<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>While he had their attention, he told a parable. Since he was close to Jerusalem, <em>people</em> were supposing God’s kingdom would appear right away:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> After he said that, he took the lead up to Jerusalem.</span>

### The Triumphal Entry


<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When he got close to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called <em>The</em><em> Mount</em> of Olives, he sent two disciples: <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>“Go in the village </em><em>over there. When you go in</em><em>, you’ll find a colt tied that nobody has ever </em><em>ridden</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Untie it and bring it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>If anybody asks</em><em> w</em><em>hy </em><em>you’</em><em>re untying it</em><em>,</em><em> say</em><em> t</em><em>he Lord needs it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They went and found the colt like he said. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>As they were untying it, its owners said, <em>“Why are you untying the colt?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They brought it, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>As he was going along, people started spreading their cloaks on the road. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Near the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples started celebrating. They were loudly praising God for the miracles they’d seen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Some Pharisees in the crowd said, <em>“</em><em>Rabbi, re</em><em>in in</em><em> your disciples.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He answered, <em>“If they</em><em> </em><em>go</em><em> silent, the rocks will</em><em> start</em><em> </em><em>shouting!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> As he got close and saw the city, he cried over it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He went into the Temple and started chasing the merchants out, <strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Scripture says</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘M</em></strong><strong><em>y </em></strong><strong><em>house will be a house for prayer</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 56:7]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong> <em>You’ve made it </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>a den for thieves</em></strong><em>!</em><strong><em>’ </em></strong><strong>[Jer 7:11]</strong><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Every day he taught in the Temple, and the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were looking for some way to destroy him, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>but they couldn’t find one; the people were eagerly listening to him.</span>
