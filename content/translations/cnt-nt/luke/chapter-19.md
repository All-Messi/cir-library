## Luke Chapter 19

### Jesus and Zacchaeus

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus was passing through Jericho, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and a wealthy tax collector named Zacchaeus <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>wanted to see what he looked like, but he couldn’t because of the crowd; he was too short. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>So he ran ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that Jesus was heading toward. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>When Jesus got there, he looked up, <em>“</em><em>Zacchaeus, hurry and climb down. </em><em>I need to stay at your </em><em>place</em><em> today.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He hurried and climbed down and welcomed him happily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When people saw it, they started grumbling, <em>“He’s going</em><em> in to be a guest with a sinner!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, <em>“Half of what I own, </em><em>I’m going to give to the poor</em><em>. I</em><em>f I’ve cheated anybody, I’</em><em>ll </em><em>repay it </em><em>four</em><em> times over.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus said <em>this</em> about him, <em>“S</em><em>alvation has come to this house</em><em> today;</em><em> he’s a </em><em>son</em><em> of Abraham too.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>The </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> came to seek and save sinners.”</em></span>

### Parable About the Pounds


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> While he had their attention, he told a parable. Since he was close to Jerusalem, <em>people</em> were supposing God’s kingdom would appear right away:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> <em>“A nobleman </em><em>was about to go</em><em> to a distant country to receive a kingdom.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>He called ten</em><em> servants and passed out </em><em>ten</em><em> </em><em>minas*</em><em>, ‘Do business with these till I get back.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> <em>“His citizens hated him and sent a delegatio</em><em>n after him, ‘We don’t want him</em><em> to rule us.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>When he got back from receiving the kingdom, he had the servants called that he gave the silver so he coul</em><em>d find out what they’</em><em>d </em><em>earn</em><em>ed.</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> <em>“The first came up, ‘Master</em><em>, your mina has made </em><em>10</em><em> m</em><em>ore</em><em>.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> <em>“‘You did well.</em><em> </em><em>Since you’ve been reliable in a small matter, assume responsibility </em><em>for</em><em> </em><em>ten</em><em> cities.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> <em>“The second came, ‘Your mina </em><em>has made </em><em>five</em><em> </em><em>minas</em><em>.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> <em>“‘Govern</em><em> </em><em>five</em><em> cities.’</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> <em>“</em><em>Another came, ‘Master, here’s</em><em> your mina</em><em>.</em><em> I</em><em>’ve</em><em> kept </em><em>it </em><em>in a handkerchief.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong><em>I was afraid of you</em><em>;</em><em> you’re an exacting man</em><em> that picks</em><em> up what</em><em> you didn’t lay down and reaps</em><em> what you didn’t sow.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> <em>“‘I’ll judge you out of your own mouth, you worthless servant.</em><em> </em><em>You knew, did you, that I’m an exacting man</em><em> that</em><em> pick</em><em>s</em><em> up what I didn’t lay down and reap</em><em>s</em><em> what I didn’t sow?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>Why didn’t you put my silver in the bank?</em><em> </em><em>When I got back, I would’ve collected it plus interest.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> <em>“He </em><em>told</em><em> the bystanders, ‘Take </em><em>his</em><em> mina and give it to the one that has </em><em>ten</em><em>.’</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> <em>“‘Sir, he has ten.’</em><em>  </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> <em>“‘I</em><em>’m</em><em> tell</em><em>ing</em><em> you, everybody that has will </em><em>receive</em><em>, and the one</em><em>s</em><em> that don’t have will </em><em>lose</em><em> even what </em><em>t</em><em>he</em><em>y</em><em> do have.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>But, bring tho</em><em>se enemies that didn’t want </em><em>to be under my rule</em><em> and put them to death in front of me.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> After he said that, he took the lead up to Jerusalem.</span>

### The Triumphal Entry


<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When he got close to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called <em>The</em><em> Mount</em> of Olives, he sent two disciples: <strong><sup>30</sup></strong><em>“Go in the village </em><em>over there. When you go in</em><em>, you’ll find a colt tied that nobody has ever </em><em>ridden</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Untie it and bring it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>If anybody asks</em><em> w</em><em>hy </em><em>you’</em><em>re untying it</em><em>,</em><em> say</em><em> t</em><em>he Lord needs it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They went and found the colt like he said. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>As they were untying it, its owners said, <em>“Why are you untying the colt?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> <em>“The Lord needs it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> They brought it, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it. <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>As he was going along, people started spreading their cloaks on the road. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>Near the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples started celebrating. They were loudly praising God for the miracles they’d seen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> <strong><em>“Blessed </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>the king</em><strong><em> that’s coming</em></strong> 	<em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>in the name of the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:26]</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	Peace in heaven and</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	glory in the </em><em>h</em><em>ighest.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Some Pharisees in the crowd said, <em>“</em><em>Rabbi, re</em><em>in in</em><em> your disciples.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> He answered, <em>“If they</em><em> </em><em>go</em><em> silent, the rocks will</em><em> start</em><em> </em><em>shouting!</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> As he got close and saw the city, he cried over it,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> <em>“If you</em><em> </em><em>only knew today what’s in store for </em><em>the peace you have now</em><em> . . . ; but you can’t see it.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>The time’s coming when your enemies will </em><em>put</em><em> up a siege wall around you and box you in from every direction.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>They’ll le</em><em>vel you to the ground and your residents</em><em> along with you.</em><em> </em><em>They won’t leave one stone on another, because you didn’t know when it was coming.”</span>

### Second Cleansing of the Temple (cp Jn 2:13-22)


<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He went into the Temple and started chasing the merchants out, <strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Scripture says</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘M</em></strong><strong><em>y </em></strong><strong><em>house will be a house for prayer</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 56:7]</strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong> <em>You’ve made it </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>a den for thieves</em></strong><em>!</em><strong><em>’ </em></strong><strong>[Jer 7:11]</strong><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Every day he taught in the Temple, and the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were looking for some way to destroy him, <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>but they couldn’t find one; the people were eagerly listening to him.</span>
