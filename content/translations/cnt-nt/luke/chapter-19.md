## Luke Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus was passing through Jericho, 2and a wealthy tax collector named Zacchaeus 3wanted to see what he looked like, but he couldn't because of the crowd; he was too short. 4So he ran ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that Jesus was heading toward. 5When Jesus got there, he looked up, "Zacchaeus, hurry and climb down. I need to stay at your place today." 6He hurried and climbed down and welcomed him happily.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> When people saw it, they started grumbling, "He's going in to be a guest with a sinner!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, "Half of what I own, I'm going to give to the poor. If I've cheated anybody, I'll repay it four times over."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus said this about him, "Salvation has come to this house today; he's a son of Abraham too. 10The Son of Man came to seek and save sinners."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> While he had their attention, he told a parable. Since he was close to Jerusalem, people were supposing God's kingdom would appear right away: 12"A nobleman was about to go to a distant country to receive a kingdom. 13He called ten servants and passed out ten minas*, 'Do business with these till I get back.' 14"His citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, 'We don't want him to rule us.' 15When he got back from receiving the kingdom, he had the servants called that he gave the silver so he could find out what they'd earned. 17"'You did well. Since you've been reliable in a small matter, assume responsibility for ten cities.' 20"Another came, 'Master, here's your mina. I've kept it in a handkerchief. 21I was afraid of you; you're an exacting man that picks up what you didn't lay down and reaps what you didn't sow.' 22"'I'll judge you out of your own mouth, you worthless servant. You knew, did you, that I'm an exacting man that picks up what I didn't lay down and reaps what I didn't sow? 23Why didn't you put my silver in the bank? When I got back, I would've collected it plus interest.' 26"'I'm telling you, everybody that has will receive, and the ones that don't have will lose even what they do have. 27But, bring those enemies that didn't want to be under my rule and put them to death in front of me.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> After he said that, he took the lead up to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When he got close to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called The Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples: 30"Go in the village over there. When you go in, you'll find a colt tied that nobody has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it. 31If anybody asks why you're untying it, say the Lord needs it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> They went and found the colt like he said. 33As they were untying it, its owners said, "Why are you untying the colt?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> They brought it, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it. 36As he was going along, people started spreading their cloaks on the road. 37Near the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples started celebrating. They were loudly praising God for the miracles they'd seen,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Some Pharisees in the crowd said, "Rabbi, rein in your disciples."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> He answered, "If they go silent, the rocks will start shouting!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> As he got close and saw the city, he cried over it, 42"If you only knew today what's in store for the peace you have now . . . ; but you can't see it. 43The time's coming when your enemies will put up a siege wall around you and box you in from every direction. 44They'll level you to the ground and your residents along with you. They won't leave one stone on another, because you didn't know when it was coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> He went into the Temple and started chasing the merchants out, 46"Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Every day he taught in the Temple, and the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were looking for some way to destroy him, 48but they couldn't find one; the people were eagerly listening to him.</span>
