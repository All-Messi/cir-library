### 13“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would’ve repented long ago in burlap and ashes. 14At the judgment it’ll be more bearable for those cities than for you. 15And you, Capernaum! You won’t be exalted to heaven, will you? You’ll be taken down to hell. 16“Whoever listens to you is listening to me; whoever rejects you is rejecting me; and whoever rejects me is rejecting the One that sent me.”

### came back excited, “Even the demons submit to us in your name!”


<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He said, <em>“I’ve been</em><em> watching Satan fall from heaven like </em><em>a blazing meteor*</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>I’ve </em><em>made</em><em> you </em><em>able</em><em> to step on snakes and scorpions, and </em><em>have </em>authority<em> </em><em>over</em><em> the power </em><em>the enemy</em><em> has</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Nothing will hurt you.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>But</em><em>, don’t get excited as much about the </em><em>spirits </em><em>submitting</em><em> to you </em><em>as about having</em><em> your names recorded in heaven.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Right then he was especially glad, <em>“I praise you, Father, </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> of</em><em> earth</em><em> and sky</em><em>, for </em><em>keeping these things from wise,</em><em> </em><em>smart</em><em> people and revealing them to </em><em>children</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><strong><sup>-23</sup></strong><em>Yes, you delighted in doing that.”</em> He turned to his disciples, <em>“My Father has turned everything over to me, and nobody knows who the Son is but </em><em>him</em><em>, and who </em><em>he</em><em> is but the Son, and whoever the Son wants to reveal him to.”</em> <em>“</em><em>You’re fortunate to see</em><em> what you’re seeing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>P</em><em>rophets and kings have wanted to see </em><em>it and haven’</em><em>t seen i</em><em>t</em><em>.”</em><em> </em><em>	 </em></span>

### 3-24 The Parable About the Good Samaritan


<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>A lawyer stood up to test him, <em>“Rabbi, what </em><em>do I need to</em><em> do to inherit eternal life?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“What</em><em>’s the L</em><em>aw</em><em> say</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>How do you read it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>That’s</em><em> right.</em><em> </em><em>Do that and you’ll </em><em>inherit </em>eternal life<em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But he wanted to justify <em>asking </em>his question, so he said, <em>“Who’s my ‘neighbor’?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Jesus answered, <em>“A man </em><em>going down from Jerusalem to Jericho</em><em> </em><em>was attacked by robbers.</em><em> They stripped him, beat </em><em>him</em><em> up,</em><em> and left him half dead.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>31</sup></strong><em>By chance a priest was going down that road and saw him and went around him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>32</sup></strong><em>A</em><em> Levite came to the place and saw him</em><em> and</em><em> did the same thing.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>33</sup></strong><em>But a Samaritan on business came </em><em>by</em><em> and saw him and felt sorry for him.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>34</sup></strong><em>He went over and</em><em> treated his wounds</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> oil and wine, bandaged them up, put him on his own </em><em>pack </em><em>animal, </em><em>and took</em><em> him to an inn</em><em> to take</em><em> care of him.</em> <strong><sup>35</sup></strong><em>“The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper.</em><em> </em><em>‘Take care of him.</em><em> </em><em>Whatever more you spend I’ll pay you when I get back.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>36</sup></strong><em>Which of the three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man the robbers</em><em> attacked</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The lawyer said, <em>“The one that showed him mercy.”</em> Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>Go</em><em> do </em><em>that</em><em>.”</em></span>

### Jesus with Mary and Martha


<span class="verse" id="v38"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>As they were traveling, he went into a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>She had a sister, Mary, who was sitting in front of Jesus, listening to him. <strong><sup>40</sup></strong>Martha was worried with serving, and came and said, <em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the serving by myself?</em><em> Have</em><em> her help me.”</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“Martha, you’re worried about </em><em>a lot of things</em><em>, </em><strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>but one thing is </em><em>essential</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>Mary has chosen the good part; I’m not going to take it away from her.”</em><strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
