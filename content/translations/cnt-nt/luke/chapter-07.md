## Luke Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After he finished, he went to Capernaum. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A centurion’s valued servant was sick, close to death. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The centurion heard about Jesus and sent elders of the Jews to ask him to come get the servant through it. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they got to Jesus, they urged him earnestly, <em>“He</em><em> </em><em>deserves doing that</em><em> for</em><em> him</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>He loves our nation and built us a synagogue.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Jesus went with them. While they were still a good way from <em>his</em> house, the centurion sent friends<em>, </em> <em>“Sir, don’t bother coming</em><em> </em>under my roof<em>.</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> don’t deserve that</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>I didn’t </em><em>feel</em><em> worthy of coming to you personally.</em><em> </em><em>Just say the word, and </em><em>let </em><em>my servant be healed.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>I’m directed by the authority of superior officers myself with soldiers under me.</em><em> </em><em>I </em><em>tell</em><em> one</em><em> to g</em><em>o, and he goes; another</em><em> to</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>ome, and he comes; a servant</em><em> to d</em><em>o </em><em>something</em><em>, and he does it.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus was impressed and turned around to the crowd, <em>“I haven’t </em><em>seen</em><em> faith </em><em>like that </em><em>even in Israel.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>10</sup></strong>When the ones the centurion had sent got back, they found the servant healed.<strong>	</strong><strong>Lk 7:1-10</strong> <strong>R</strong><strong>esurrecting</strong><strong> the Widow of Nain’s Son</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Soon afterward he went to a village called Nain; his disciples and a large crowd were going with him. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When he got close to the village gate, people were carrying out a widow’s only son, and a sizable crowd from the village was with her. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her, and told her not to cry. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He went and touched the bier, and the pall bearers stopped. He said, <em>“Young man, get up.”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>The dead boy sat up and started talking, and Jesus gave him to his mother. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Fear gripped them, and they praised God<em>:</em><em> </em><em>“A gr</em><em>eat prophet has arisen </em><em>among us;</em> <em>God has visited his people.”</em> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>News about him spread all over Judaea and the surrounding countryside.<strong> </strong><strong>     </strong><strong>	 </strong><strong>Lk 7:11-17</strong> <strong>John’s Question and </strong> <strong>Jesus’ </strong><strong>Comments</strong><strong> on John</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>John’s disciples reported to him what was going on. He called two of them <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>to go ask the Lord, <em>“Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> the O</em><em>ne that’s </em>supposed to <em>come,</em><em> or should we wait for somebody else?”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong>The men went to Jesus and asked him that<em>. </em><strong><sup>21</sup></strong>At the time, Jesus was healing a lot of people from sicknesses, afflictions, and evil spirits, and enabling a number of blind people to see. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He answered them, <em>“Go tell John what you’ve</em><em> see</em><em>n</em><em>:</em><em> blind people</em><em> </em><em>regaining their sight</em><em>, lame </em>people<em> </em><em>walk</em><em>ing</em><em>, lepers</em><em> </em><em>cleansed, deaf </em><em>people </em><em>hear</em><em>ing</em><em>,</em><em> the</em><em> dead </em><em>resurrected, </em><em>poor </em><em>people hearing the </em><em>good news.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>He’</em><em>s blessed </em><em>that</em><em>’s not disappointed in me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>After John’s messengers left, Jesus said to the crowd, <em>“What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed </em><em>blowing in</em><em> the wind?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>What </em><em>did</em><em> you go out to see? </em><em>Someone </em><em>dressed in </em><em>fine</em><em> clothes?</em><em> People</em><em> </em><em>in palaces </em><em>dress in </em><em>fine</em><em> clothes and l</em><em>ive in luxury. </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>What </em><em><u>did</u></em><em> you go out to see?</em><em> </em><em>A prophet?</em><em> Oh y</em><em>es, </em><em>and </em><em>more than a prophet.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>He’</em><em>s the one th</em><em>at</em><em> scripture refers to,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘I’ll send my messenger </em></strong><strong><em>ahead of</em></strong><strong><em> you</em></strong> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>o</em></strong><strong><em> get</em></strong><em> your </em><strong><em>road ready for you</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Mal</strong><strong> 3:1]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When the people and the tax collectors heard that, they acknowledged God’s good expectations, because they’d had John baptize them. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s intentions for them by not having him baptize them.</span>

### In the House of Simon the Pharisee


<span class="verse" id="v36"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. He went into the Pharisee’s house and sat down. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>A woman of ill repute in town learned Jesus was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house. She brought an alabaster cruise of ointment and <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>stood behind him at his feet, crying. She started to wet his feet with her tears, wipe them with her hair, kiss them, and anoint them with the ointment. <strong><sup>39</sup></strong>the Pharisee thought to himself, <em>“If he was a prophet, he’d know what kind of woman is touching him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Jesus responded, <em>“Simon, a question.”</em> <em>	“What is it, Rabbi?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> He turned to the woman and said to Simon, <em>“You see this woman? When I came in your house, you didn’t give me any water for my feet; she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. </em><strong><sup>45</sup></strong><em>You didn’t give me a kiss; she’s been kissing my feet</em><em> </em><em>ever since she got here. </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>You didn’t anoint my head with olive oil; she anointed my feet with perfumed ointment. </em><strong><sup>47</sup></strong><em>So I’ve forgiven her many sins because she loved a lot. The one that’s forgiven little loves little.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He told her, <em>“I’ve forgiven y</em><em>our sins.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The ones reclining at table with him started saying to themselves, <em>“Who is this that forgive</em><em>s sins?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> He told the woman, <em>“Your faith has saved you.</em><em> Have a good day</em><em>.”</em> 	<strong>Lk 7</strong><strong>:36-5</strong><strong>0</strong> <strong>Second Preaching Tour of Galilee</strong></span>
