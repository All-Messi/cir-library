## Luke Chapter 7

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After he finished, he went to Capernaum. 2A centurion's valued servant was sick, close to death. 3The centurion heard about Jesus and sent elders of the Jews to ask him to come get the servant through it. 4When they got to Jesus, they urged him earnestly, "He deserves doing that for him. 5He loves our nation and built us a synagogue." 6Jesus went with them. "Sir, don't bother coming under my roof. I don't deserve that. 7I didn't feel worthy of coming to you personally. Just say the word, and let my servant be healed. 8I'm directed by the authority of superior officers myself with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; another to come, and he comes; a servant to do something, and he does it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus was impressed and turned around to the crowd, "I haven't seen faith like that even in Israel." 10When the ones the centurion had sent got back, they found the servant healed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Soon afterward he went to a village called Nain; his disciples and a large crowd were going with him. 12When he got close to the village gate, people were carrying out a widow's only son, and a sizable crowd from the village was with her. 13When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her, and told her not to cry. 14He went and touched the bier, and the pall bearers stopped. He said, "Young man, get up." 15The dead boy sat up and started talking, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16Fear gripped them, and they praised God: "A great prophet has arisen among us; God has visited his people." 17News about him spread all over Judaea and the surrounding countryside.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> John's disciples reported to him what was going on. He called two of them 19to go ask the Lord, "Are you the One that's supposed to come, or should we wait for somebody else?" 20The men went to Jesus and asked him that. 21At the time, Jesus was healing a lot of people from sicknesses, afflictions, and evil spirits, and enabling a number of blind people to see. 22He answered them, "Go tell John what you've seen: blind people regaining their sight, lame people walking, lepers cleansed, deaf people hearing, the dead resurrected, poor people hearing the good news. 23He's blessed that's not disappointed in me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus said to the crowd, "What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed blowing in the wind? 25What did you go out to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? People in palaces dress in fine clothes and live in luxury. 26What did you go out to see? A prophet? Oh yes, and more than a prophet. 27He's the one that scripture refers to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Nobody that's ever been born is greater than John, but the least in God's kingdom is greater than he is."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> When the people and the tax collectors heard that, they acknowledged God's good expectations, because they'd had John baptize them. 30But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's intentions for them by not having him baptize them. 31"What are people today like? 32They're like kids sitting in a marketplace, calling out one to another:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> John the Baptist came, not eating bread or drinking wine, and you say he's got a demon. 34The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say he's a glutton, a drunk, a pal of tax collectors and sinners. 35Wisdom becomes obvious from what it produces."lit</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> A Pharisee invited Jesus to eat with him. He went into the Pharisee's house and sat down. 37A woman of ill repute in town learned Jesus was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house. She brought an alabaster cruise of ointment and 38stood behind him at his feet, crying. She started to wet his feet with her tears, wipe them with her hair, kiss them, and anoint them with the ointment. 39the Pharisee thought to himself, "If he was a prophet, he'd know what kind of woman is touching him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Jesus responded, "Simon, a question." 41"A money lender had a couple clients that owned him money. One owed 500 denarii; the other owed 50. 42When they couldn't pay him back, he forgave them both. Which one loved him more?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v44"><sup class="verse-num">44</sup> He turned to the woman and said to Simon, "You see this woman? When I came in your house, you didn't give me any water for my feet; she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45You didn't give me a kiss; she's been kissing my feet ever since she got here. 46You didn't anoint my head with olive oil; she anointed my feet with perfumed ointment. 47So I've forgiven her many sins because she loved a lot. The one that's forgiven little loves little."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> He told her, "I've forgiven your sins."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The ones reclining at table with him started saying to themselves, "Who is this that forgives sins?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> He told the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Have a good day."</span>
