## Luke Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> In the fifteenth year of Tiberias Caesar, Pontius Pilate was governing Judaea, Herod was tetraarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetraarch of Iturea and Trachonitis, Lysanius was tetraarch of Abilene, 2Annas and Caiaphas were high priests. That's when a message came from God to John son of Zachariah in the desert. 3He went to the area around the Jordan River and started presenting a baptism of repentance to forgive sins. 4Scripture says in Isaiah the prophet,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Fill every chuck hole.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Everybody will see God's salvation" [Is 40:3-5].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> He was saying to the crowds that were coming out to have him baptize them, "You bunch of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to run from God's wrath that's coming? 8Bear fruit appropriate for repentance and don't even begin to tell yourselves, 'Abraham's our ancestor.' God can raise up descendants of Abraham from these stones. 9An axe is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that doesn't bear good fruit will be chopped down and burned."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The crowds asked him, "What should we do?" 11"If you have two shirts, give one to a person that doesn't have any. If you have food, do the same thing."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Tax collectors came to be baptized, "Rabbi, what should we do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Soldiers asked, "What should we do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> While people were wondering if John might be the Messiah, 16he said, "I'm immersing you in water, but Someone more important is coming, whose sandals I'm not worthy to unstrap. He'll 'immerse' you in the Holy Spirit. 17He'll use his winnowing fork to thoroughly clean up his threshing floor. He'll gather the seed into his granary and burn up the chaff with a fire you can't put out."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He encouraged them about lots of other things and delivered good news to the people.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> When John reprimanded Herod Antipas the tetraarch about Herodias, his half-brother's wife, 20and all the wicked things he'd done, Herod added this on top of them: he locked John up in prison.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> While John had been baptizing the people, Jesus was baptized too. As he was praying, the sky opened up, 22and the Holy Spirit came down on him in bodily form like a dove. A voice came out of the sky, "You're my dearly loved Son that I delight in."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus was about 30 when he began his ministry. He was—as supposed—the son of Joseph, 	son-in-law of Eli,	son of Matthat, 	24son of Levi,	son of Melchi,</span>
