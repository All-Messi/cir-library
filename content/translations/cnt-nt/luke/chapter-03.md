## Luke Chapter 3

### John the Baptist's Ministry

<p class="verse"><sup>1</sup>In the fifteenth year of Tiberias Caesar, Pontius Pilate was governing Judaea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis, Lysanius was tetrarch of Abilene, <sup>2</sup>Annas and Caiaphas were high priests. That's when a message came from God to John son of Zachariah in the desert. <sup>3</sup>He went to the area around the Jordan River and started presenting a baptism of repentance to forgive sins. <sup>4</sup>Scripture says in Isaiah the prophet,</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">
"A voice is crying out in the desert,<br>
'Prepare the LORD's road,<br>
straighten his paths.<br>
<sup>5</sup>Fill every chuck hole.<br>
Level every hill and mound.<br>
Straighten the crooked ways.<br>
Smooth out the rough spots.<br>
<sup>6</sup>Everybody will see God's salvation'" [Is 40:3-5].
</blockquote>

<p class="verse"><sup>7</sup>He was saying to the crowds that were coming out to have him baptize them, "You bunch of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to run from God's wrath that's coming? <sup>8</sup>Bear fruit appropriate for repentance and don't even begin to tell yourselves, 'Abraham's our ancestor.' God can raise up descendants of Abraham from these stones. <sup>9</sup>An axe is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that doesn't bear good fruit will be chopped down and burned."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>10</sup>The crowds asked him, "What should we do?" <sup>11</sup>"If you have two shirts, give one to a person that doesn't have any. If you have food, do the same thing."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>12</sup>Tax collectors came to be baptized, "Rabbi, what should we do?" <sup>13</sup>"Don't collect any more than what you're supposed to."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>14</sup>Soldiers asked, "What should we do?" "Don't extort money from people by force or false charges. Be content with your pay."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>15</sup>While people were wondering if John might be the Messiah, <sup>16</sup>he said, "I'm immersing you in water, but Someone more important is coming, whose sandals I'm not worthy to unstrap. He'll 'immerse' you in the Holy Spirit. <sup>17</sup>He'll use his winnowing fork to thoroughly clean up his threshing floor. He'll gather the seed into his granary and burn up the chaff with a fire you can't put out."</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>18</sup>He encouraged them about lots of other things and delivered good news to the people.</p>

<p class="verse"><sup>19</sup>When John reprimanded Herod Antipas the tetrarch about Herodias, his half-brother's wife, <sup>20</sup>and all the wicked things he'd done, Herod added this on top of them: he locked John up in prison.</p>

### Jesus' Baptism

<p class="verse"><sup>21</sup>While John had been baptizing the people, Jesus was baptized too. As he was praying, the sky opened up, <sup>22</sup>and the Holy Spirit came down on him in bodily form like a dove. A voice came out of the sky, "You're my dearly loved Son that I delight in."</p>
