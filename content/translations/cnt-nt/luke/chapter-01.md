## Luke Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Many have undertaken to put together an account of what's been fulfilled among us. 2Eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the message have handed down accounts of those events to us. 3It seemed appropriate to me, as well, to trace these things from the start and write you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, 4so you can know for certain that your oral instruction was accurate.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> At the time of Herod king of Judaea, there was a priest named Zachariah in the Abijah division; his wife Elizabeth descended from Aaron. 6They both lived upright before God and conducted themselves blamelessly by his commandments. 7Elizabeth couldn't have children, and both were getting old.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Zachariah was carrying out his priestly duties in front of God in the sequence of his division. 9According to the custom of the priestly office, he'd been chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the LORD to offer incense. 10A crowd was praying outside. 11An angel of the LORD appeared to him and stood on the right side of the altar of incense. 12When Zachariah saw him, he froze in fear. 13The angel said, "You don't need to be afraid, Zechariah; God has heard your prayer. Your wife will have a son, and you're to name him 'John.' 14You'llsg be so happy, and lots of people will celebrate his birth. 15He'll be great before the LORD:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> He'll return many Israelites to the LORD their God.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Zechariah said, "How am I going to know that? My wife and I are both old." 19"I'm Gabriel; I stand beside the LORD. He sent me to bring you this good news. 20You won't be able to talk till it happens, because you didn't believe me; but it will come about in due time."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> The people waiting for Zechariah couldn't believe how long he'd been in the sanctuary. 22When he did come out, he couldn't talk. They surmised that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making gestures to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When his term of service was up, he went back home. 24Later, Elizabeth became pregnant and stayed inside for five months, 25"That's how the LORD dealt with me when he looked favorably at me and took away my disgrace at not being able to have children."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> In Elizabeth's sixth month, God sent Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee. 27He went to a virgin named Mary, who was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of David. 28He went inside and said, "Hello, favored one; the LORD's with you." 29It startled her, and she wondered what he meant.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> The angel said, "You don't need to be afraid, Mary. God's pleased with you. 31You'll become pregnant and have a son you're to name 'Jesus.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> He'll be great</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> He'll rule Jacob's descendants forever;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Mary said, "How can that be? I don't have a husband." 35"The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One begotten will be called God's Son. 36Elizabeth your relative is pregnant, too, with a son in her old age. This is the sixth month with her that's been childless. 37God can do anything."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> Mary said, "I'm the LORD's servant; may it be to me like you've said."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judaea, 40and went into Zechariah's house to greet Elizabeth. 41When she heard Mary's greeting, her baby kicked, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit: 42she shouted, "You're a blessed woman, and your baby's blessed too! 43How is it that my Lord's mother comes to me? 44When I heard you say, 'Hello,' I felt the baby kick for joy. 45You're blessed for believing the LORD will keep his promise to you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v46"><sup class="verse-num">46</sup> Mary said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> I'm happy because God my Savior</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> The Mighty One has done great things for me;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> His mercy is for generations upon generations 51He has done mighty things 52He has brought down rulers from thrones 53He has filled the hungry with good things 54He has helped Israel his child 56Mary stayed with her three months and went back home. 57When it came time for Elizabeth to deliver, she had a son. 58Her neighbors and relatives heard that the LORD had shown her such mercy, and they celebrated with her. 59The eighth day they came to circumcise the little boy and started calling him "Zechariah," after his father. 60His mother answered, "No, his name is 'John.'" 61But they said, "None of your relatives are named that." 62They motioned to his father to see what he wanted to name him. 63He asked for a tablet and wrote, "His name is 'John.'" That surprised them. 64Right then, Zechariah began to talk, praising God. 65Their neighbors became respectful, and everybody in the hill country of Judaea was talking about it. 66People that heard what happened took it to heart, "What's this child going to be" (because the LORD was with him)? 67Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: 69He has raised up a horn of salvation for us 72He showed mercy to our ancestors and 76You, child, will be a prophet for the Most High. 78Our God shows tender mercy; 80The child grew up and became strong in spirit. He lived in the open country till his public appearance to Israel.</span>
