## Luke Chapter 18

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> He told a parable to the effect that people should always pray, and not give up. 2"There was a judge in a town who didn't fear God or respect people. 3A widow in that town kept coming to him to defend her against her accuser. 4At first he wouldn't help her, but after a while he said to himself, 'I don't fear God or respect people, 5but this widow keeps hounding me. I'll see that she gets justice so she won't wear me out, coming to me all the time.' 6"Listen to what the unjust judge illustrates. 7Won't God provide justice for his chosen ones that call to him for help day and night, and be patient with them? 8I'm telling you, he'll provide it right away. But, when the Son of Man comes, will he find people with faith on the earth?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> He told this parable to some people that trusted in their own goodness and looked down on everybody else. 10"A Pharisee and a tax collector went up to the Temple to pray. 11The Pharisee stood, praying to himself, 'God, I'm glad I'm not like everybody else—swindlers, unjust, adulterers—or this tax collector. 12I fast twice a week and give a tenth of everything I gain.' 13"The tax collector stood a good way off and wouldn't even look up to heaven, but kept beating his chest, 'God, have mercy on me; I'm such a sinner.' 14I'm telling you, he's the one that went home justified instead of the other one. Everybody that exalts himself will be humbled, but whoever humbles himself will be exalted."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> People were bringing their babies for Jesus to touch. When the disciples saw it, they fussed at them. 16But Jesus invited them, "Let the little kids come over here. People like them are what make up God's kingdom. 17I'm telling you, whoever doesn't welcome God's kingdom like a little kid won't get into it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> An official asked him, "Good Rabbi, what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Jesus said, "Why are you calling me good? Nobody's good but God. 20You know the commandments: 'do not commit adulteryf, murderf, stealf, or lief [Ex 20:13-16]; honor your parents'" [Ex 20:12].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus said, "There is one thing you can do: sell everything you own and distribute it to the poor, and you'll have wealth in heaven; then come with me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> When he heard that, he got really discouraged because he was very wealthy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When Jesus saw him so downcast, he said, "It's hard for wealthy people to get into God's kingdom. 25It's easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> The ones that were listening said, "Who can be saved then?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Jesus said, "Things impossible for people are possible for God."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Peter said, "We've left our homes to follow you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> He said to them, "Everybody that has left behind a home, a wife, brothers, parents, or children for the sake of God's kingdom 30will receive many times more in this age and eternal life in the age to come."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> He took the Twelve aside and told them, "We're going up to Jerusalem to accomplish everything the prophets wrote about me. 32I'll be handed over to the Gentiles, and be made fun of, abused, spit on. 33When they've flogged me, they'll put me to death; but on the third day I'll resurrect." 34None of that made any sense to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Near Jericho a blind man was sitting by the road, begging. 36When he heard a crowd go by, he asked what was happening. 37They told him Jesus the Nazarene was going past.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> He yelled out, "Jesus son of David, have mercy on me!"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> The people out in front told him to quiet down, but he yelled all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> Jesus stopped and told him to come over. When he got there, Jesus asked him, 41"What do you want me to do?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Jesus said, "Receive it. Your faith has delivered you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> Instantly he could see again; and he went with Jesus, praising God. When the people saw it, they praised God too.</span>
