## 1 Peter Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Christ suffered; so arm yourselves with the attitude he took, because suffering purifies from sin. 2You won't be living the rest of your life by human desires, but by God's will. 3You spent enough time following the pattern of life the Gentiles carry on: a lifestyle of sensuality, lust, drunkenness, revelry, drunken parties, disgusting idolatry. 4They're surprised that you don't run with them in that excessive, reckless living; and they slander you for it. 5They'll give account to the One who's set to judge the living and the dead. 6In that connection, the good news was presented even to the dead so they'd be judged like the living who live according to God in the spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The end is close. Be sensible and serious in prayer. 8Especially, have ongoing love toward each other because love covers lots of sins. 9Be hospitable toward each other without grudges. 10Each of you needs to minister your gift to the others as good stewards of the grace God has shown in these different ways. If it's speaking, speak as if God himself is speaking. 11If it's serving, do it wholeheartedly. That way you'll praise God through Christ. Glory and dominion belong to him forevermore. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> Don't be surprised at the fiery trial that's testing you, as if something strange is happening. 13Instead, to the extent that you're sharing Christ's sufferings, be happy so you can be really happy when he appears in his glory. 14If people dishonor you because of him, you're blessed; God's Spirit and honor rest on you. 15Don't suffer as a murderer, thief, evildoer, intruder in other people's business. 16If you suffer as a Christian, don't be ashamed; praise God in that name. 17It's time to judge God's family. If judgment begins with us, what's going to happen to people that disbelieve God's good news? where will godless people come in?" [Pro 11:31 LXX]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> So you that suffer according to God's will, entrust yourselves to the faithful creator by continuing to do what's right.</span>
