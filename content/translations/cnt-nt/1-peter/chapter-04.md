## 1 Peter Chapter **4**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Christ suffered; so arm yourselves with the attitude he took, because suffering purifies from sin. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>You won’t be living the rest of your life by human desires, but by God’s will. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You spent enough time following the pattern of life the Gentiles carry on: a lifestyle of sensuality, lust, drunkenness, revelry, drunken parties, disgusting idolatry. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They’re surprised that you don’t run with them in that excessive, reckless living; and they slander you for it. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They’ll give account to the One who’s set to judge the living and the dead. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In that connection, the good news was presented even to the dead so they’d be judged like the living who live according to God in the spirit.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 4:1-6</p>

### Living with Christ’s Return in Mind


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>The end is close. Be sensible and serious in prayer. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Especially, have ongoing love toward each other because love covers lots of sins. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Be hospitable toward each other without grudges. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Each of you needs to minister your gift to the others as good stewards of the grace God has shown in <em>these</em> different ways. If it’s speaking, speak as if God himself is speaking. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>If it’s serving, do it wholeheartedly. That way you’ll praise God through Christ. Glory and dominion belong to him forevermore. Amen.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 4:7-11</p>

### Nothing Surprising About Suffering


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Don’t be surprised at the fiery trial that’s testing you, as if something strange is happening. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Instead, to the extent that you’re sharing Christ’s sufferings, be happy so you can be really happy when he appears in his glory. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>If people dishonor you because of him, <em>you’re</em> blessed; God’s Spirit and honor rest on you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Don’t suffer as a murderer, thief, evildoer, intruder in other people’s business. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>If you suffer as a Christian, don’t be ashamed; praise God in that name. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>It’s time to judge God’s family. If judgment begins with us, what’s going to happen to people that disbelieve God’s good news? <strong>    </strong><strong><sup>18</sup></strong><strong><em>“If </em></strong><strong><em>good people</em></strong><strong><em> are barely saved, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	where will godless </em></strong><strong><em>people</em></strong><strong><em> come in?”</em></strong> <strong>[Pro </strong><strong>11:31 LXX]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>So you that suffer according to God’s will, entrust yourselves to the faithful creator by continuing to do what’s right.</span>
