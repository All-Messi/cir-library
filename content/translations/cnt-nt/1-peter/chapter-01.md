## 1 Peter Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>, to the Chosen who live as foreigners in the Dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>known by God the Father a long time ago, sanctified by <em>his</em> Spirit, sprinkled with Christ’s blood, and obedient to him. Grace and peace many times over.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 1:1-2</p>

### Gratitude for Heaven Offered


<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Blessed <em>be</em> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy, he gave us a living hope by resurrecting Jesus. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He has reserved for us in heaven an inheritance that doesn’t deteriorate, that can’t be defiled, and won’t fade away. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Trusting his power protects us so we can receive the salvation that’s ready for him to reveal in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup>With that to look forward to, rejoice, even though for a little while now, various trials may be bringing you grief. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Your faith is worth more than gold that perishes. Testing that faith—as if by fire—leads to praising, exalting, and honoring Jesus Christ when he returns. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Though you haven’t seen him, you love him. Because you believe in him, your joy is so great and glorious that you can’t express it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>In the end, your faith will save your souls.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 1:3-9</p>

### The Prophets’ Ministry to Us


<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>Prophets who prophesied about the grace that <em>would come</em> to you searched out this salvation carefully. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They wanted to find out what time or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating about his sufferings and subsequent glories. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They learned that they weren’t ministering these things to themselves, but to you. The Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, has announced those things now through your evangelists—things angels long to look into.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>So think straight and be serious. Put your hope completely in the grace that will come to you when Jesus Christ appears. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Like obedient children, don’t conform to the desires you lived by in your former ignorance; <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>conform yourselves to the Holy One that called you to become holy in everything you do. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Like scripture says, <strong><em>“Be holy because I’m holy</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Lev </strong><strong>11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7]</strong>.  	 <strong>1 Pet</strong><strong> 1:10-16</strong> <strong>Hope Based on Spiritual Things</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>You call him Father who judges impartially each person’s work; so, like foreigners, live out your time here in fear. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>You weren’t redeemed with corruptible things—silver or gold—from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>You were redeemed with the precious blood of the unblemished Lamb. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>Christ was foreknown before the founding of the world but was revealed in the last times. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Through him you’re faithful to God, who resurrected him and glorified him. So, your faith and hope lie in God. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>You’ve cleaned up your lives by obeying the truth in brotherly love; continue to love each other with a pure heart. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>You’ve been born again from incorruptible seed through God’s living, lasting message:<sup>	</sup> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><strong><em>“Flesh is like grass; </em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>its </em></strong><strong><em>beauty</em></strong><strong><em> is like blossoms in the grass.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	The grass </em></strong><strong><em>dries up;</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the </em></strong><strong><em>blossoms fall off;</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup><strong><em>   </em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><strong><em>but </em></strong><strong><em>what the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> says</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>lasts forever</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Is</strong><strong> 40:6-8]</strong>. That’s the message we presented to you.</span>
