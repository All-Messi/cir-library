## 1 Peter Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Peter, apostle of Jesus ChristMessiah, to the Chosen who live as foreigners in the Dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 2known by God the Father a long time ago, sanctified by his Spirit, sprinkled with Christ's blood, and obedient to him. Grace and peace many times over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy, he gave us a living hope by resurrecting Jesus. 4He has reserved for us in heaven an inheritance that doesn't deteriorate, that can't be defiled, and won't fade away. 5Trusting his power protects us so we can receive the salvation that's ready for him to reveal in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> With that to look forward to, rejoice, even though for a little while now, various trials may be bringing you grief. 7Your faith is worth more than gold that perishes. Testing that faith—as if by fire—leads to praising, exalting, and honoring Jesus Christ when he returns. 8Though you haven't seen him, you love him. Because you believe in him, your joy is so great and glorious that you can't express it. 9In the end, your faith will save your souls.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched out this salvation carefully. 11They wanted to find out what time or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating about his sufferings and subsequent glories. 12They learned that they weren't ministering these things to themselves, but to you. The Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, has announced those things now through your evangelists—things angels long to look into.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> So think straight and be serious. Put your hope completely in the grace that will come to you when Jesus Christ appears. 14Like obedient children, don't conform to the desires you lived by in your former ignorance; 15conform yourselves to the Holy One that called you to become holy in everything you do. 16Like scripture says, "Be holy because I'm holy" [Lev 11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> You call him Father who judges impartially each person's work; so, like foreigners, live out your time here in fear. 18You weren't redeemed with corruptible things—silver or gold—from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. 19You were redeemed with the precious blood of the unblemished Lamb. 20Christ was foreknown before the founding of the world but was revealed in the last times. 21Through him you're faithful to God, who resurrected him and glorified him. So, your faith and hope lie in God. 22You've cleaned up your lives by obeying the truth in brotherly love; continue to love each other with a pure heart. 23You've been born again from incorruptible seed through God's living, lasting message:</span>
