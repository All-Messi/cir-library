## 1 Peter Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, get rid of hate, deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, insults. 2Like newborn babies, be hungry for pure spiritual milk so you can grow up to salvation—3if you've tasted how good the Lord is. 4Come to him as to a living stone, rejected by people, but chosen and precious to God. 5Like living stones you're building yourselves up into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood that offers spiritual sacrifices to God through Christ. 6So it stands in scripture,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> To you believers he's precious, but to disbelievers he's</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But you're a chosen race [Is 43:20], a royal priesthood, a holy nation [Ex 19:6], a people that belongs to God. That's so you can present to others the excellence [Is 43:21] of the One that called you out of darkness into his amazing light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I urge you, like foreigners here temporarily, to stay away from physical drives that fight against the soul. 12Keep your lifestyle good among the Gentiles so whatever they'd slander you for, when they observe the good things you do, they'll praise God in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Submit to human institutions for the Lord's sake—14to the king in authority or his governors sent to punish the bad and praise the good. 15God wants you to silence the ignorance of bad people by doing good. 16You're free, but freedom doesn't mean you can do as you please; you're God's servants. 17Respect everybody, love Christ's family, respect God, honor the king.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Servants, defer to your masters with respect, not just the good and considerate ones, but the harsh ones too. 19This pleases God: suffering unjustly and bearing it for conscience sake toward him. 20What's notable about suffering for sin and bearing it? But suffering for doing good and bearing it, pleases him. 21That's what he's called you to. Even Christ suffered; he did it for you and left footprints for you to step in. 22He "didn't sin or deceive" [Is 53:9]. 23When he was insulted, he didn't insult back. When he suffered, he didn't threaten. He turned himself over to the One who judges justly. 24He humbly bore your sins in his body on the cross so you would live right; his wounds healed you. 25You were wandering off like sheep, but you've returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span>
