## 1 Peter Chapter 2

### The Cornerstone

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> <strong> Pet 2:11-17</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> To you believers <em>he’s</em> precious, but to disbelievers <em>he’s</em> 	<strong><em>“a stone the builders rejected</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>that has become the cornerstone</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> [<strong>Ps 118:22]</strong>;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> and 	<strong><em>“a stone they </em></strong><strong><em>trip</em></strong><strong><em> over, </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	a rock that makes them fall</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Is</strong><strong> 8:14]</strong>. They “trip” by disobeying the message—as they were allowed to do.</span>

### Living in Light of Who You Are


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> But you’re <strong>a chosen race</strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is 43:20]</strong><strong>, a royal priesthood, a holy nation</strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 19:6]</strong><strong>, a people that belongs to God. T</strong><strong>hat’s so you can </strong><strong>present</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>to others </em></strong><strong>the excellence </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 43:21]</strong><strong> </strong>of the One that called you out of darkness into his amazing light.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> <em>“You that were</em><em>n’</em><em>t a people</em><em> at one time</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><em>	are now God’s people;</em> <em>	</em><em>	you that he had</em><em>n’</em><em>t </em><em>shown</em><em> mercy </em> <em>	h</em><em>ave now received it</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Hos </strong><strong>2:23</strong><strong>].</strong><strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 2:9-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I urge you, like foreigners here temporarily, to stay away from physical drives that fight against the soul. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Keep your lifestyle good among the Gentiles so whatever they’d slander you for, when they observe the good things you do, they’ll praise God in the end. 	<strong>Societal Virtues</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Submit to human institutions for the Lord’s sake—<strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>to the king in authority or his governors sent to punish the bad and praise the good. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>God wants you to silence the ignorance of bad people by doing good. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>You’re free, but freedom doesn’t mean you can do as you please; you’re God’s servants. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Respect everybody, love Christ’s family, respect God, honor the king.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Servants, defer to your masters with respect, not just the good and considerate ones, but the harsh ones <em>too</em>. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>This pleases God: suffering unjustly and bearing it for conscience sake toward him. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>What’s notable about suffering for sin and bearing it? But suffering for doing good and bearing it, pleases him. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>That’s what he’s called you to. Even Christ suffered; he did it for you and left footprints for you to step in. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He <strong><em>“didn’t sin or deceive</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Is</strong><strong> 53:9]</strong><strong>.</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>23</sup></strong>When he was insulted, he didn’t insult back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten. He turned himself over to the One who judges justly. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>He humbly bore your sins in his body on the cross so you would live right; his wounds healed you. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>You were wandering off like sheep, but you’ve returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span>
