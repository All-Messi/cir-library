## 1 Peter Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elders, I’m a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s sufferings. I share in the glory that’s going to be revealed. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Shepherd God’s flock that’s among you. Provide oversight, not because you have to, but because you want to; not to make money (which is shameful), but out of internal initiative. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Don’t lord it over your charges; set an example for the flock. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When the Chief Shepherd appears, you’ll receive a glorious crown that won’t fade away.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 5:1-4</p>

### Urging Younger People


<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Young men, defer to the elders and dress in humility toward each other because <strong><em>“God resists the proud</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and gives grace to the humble</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Pro </strong><strong>3:34 LXX].</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So “humble” yourselves under God’s strong hand, and he’ll exalt you in due time. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Place your cares on him because he cares about you. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Be serious-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around looking for somebody to devour. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Resist him firmly with faith; you know your fellow believers in the world are experiencing the same sufferings. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>After you’ve suffered a little while, the all-gracious God that has called you into his eternal glory will confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Dominion to him forever! Amen.</span>
<p class="section-ref">1 Pet 5:5-11</p>

### Closing Comments


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I’ve written you a few words by Silvanus <em>my </em>faithful brother, as I consider him. I wanted to encourage you and confirm to you that what you’ve received is in fact God’s grace; stand firm in it. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The elect brotherhood in ‘Babylon’ greets you as does my son Mark. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Greet each other with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you in Christ.</span>
