## 1 Peter Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Elders, I'm a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings. I share in the glory that's going to be revealed. 2Shepherd God's flock that's among you. Provide oversight, not because you have to, but because you want to; not to make money (which is shameful), but out of internal initiative. 3Don't lord it over your charges; set an example for the flock. 4When the Chief Shepherd appears, you'll receive a glorious crown that won't fade away.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Young men, defer to the elders and dress in humility toward each other because and gives grace to the humble" [Pro 3:34 LXX].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So "humble" yourselves under God's strong hand, and he'll exalt you in due time. 7Place your cares on him because he cares about you. 8Be serious-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil is prowling around looking for somebody to devour. 9Resist him firmly with faith; you know your fellow believers in the world are experiencing the same sufferings. 10After you've suffered a little while, the all-gracious God that has called you into his eternal glory will confirm you, strengthen you, and establish you. 11Dominion to him forever! Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I've written you a few words by Silvanus my faithful brother, as I consider him. I wanted to encourage you and confirm to you that what you've received is in fact God's grace; stand firm in it. 13The elect brotherhood in 'Babylon' greets you as does my son Mark. 14Greet each other with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you in Christ.</span>
