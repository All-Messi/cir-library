## 1 Peter Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Wives, defer to your husbands so even if they don’t believe the message, your conduct will win them over aside from it <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>as they watch your innocent, respectful behavior. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>For beauty, don’t rely on external things like elaborately braided hair or the gold or clothes you wear. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Root your beauty in the inner self as in a gentle, quiet spirit; that’s especially precious to God. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>That’s the way holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves in respect for their husbands. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Sarah respected Abraham and called him Sir [lord]. You’re her daughters. if you do good and feel secure in your situation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Husbands, live with your wives with the understanding that they are weaker vessels. Honor them as fellow heirs of the grace of life so you don’t hinder your prayers. <strong>Interpersonal Virtues</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>In conclusion, you need to be like-minded, sympathetic, tenderhearted, humble, with brotherly love. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Don’t return evil for evil or insult for insult; bless instead. You were called for that so you could inherit good fortune: <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Who </em></strong><strong><em>wants to </em></strong><strong><em>live</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a long time </em></strong><strong><em>and </em></strong><strong><em>prosper?</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>Kee</em></strong><strong><em>p </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> tongue from evil </em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> lips from </em></strong><strong><em>lying</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong><strong><em>Quit doing bad </em></strong><strong><em>and do good;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	look for peace and pursue it.</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong><em>The </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> watches over good people</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	and hears</em></strong><strong><em> their prayer</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> <strong><em>	He </em></strong><strong><em>turns</em></strong><strong><em> against </em></strong> <strong><em>people that practice sin</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 34:12-16]</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>    </strong><strong>	</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup>Who’s going to hurt you if you’re eager to do what’s good? <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Even if you suffer for it, you’re well off. Don’t be afraid of people’s evil, or let it get you down. <strong><sup>15-16</sup></strong>Set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts. With gentleness and respect, be ready to answer anybody that asks you about the hope you have. Keep your conscience clear so whatever people slander you about, your good behavior in Christ will discredit them.</span>

### Suffering for Doing Good


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>If God wills, it’s better to suffer for being good than for being bad. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>To bring you to God, Christ also suffered for sin once and for all, the righteous for the unrighteous. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He went in the spirit and preached to the spirits in prison <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>that disobeyed while God patiently waited for Noah to build the ark. In it, water saved a few people—eight. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>That’s like baptism saving you. It doesn’t wash off dirt, but appeals to God for a clear conscience because of Christ’s resurrection. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>He’s ascended to God’s right hand in heaven with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.</span>
