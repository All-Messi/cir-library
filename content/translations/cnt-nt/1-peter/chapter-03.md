## 1 Peter Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Wives, defer to your husbands so even if they don't believe the message, your conduct will win them over aside from it 2as they watch your innocent, respectful behavior. 3For beauty, don't rely on external things like elaborately braided hair or the gold or clothes you wear. 4Root your beauty in the inner self as in a gentle, quiet spirit; that's especially precious to God. 5That's the way holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves in respect for their husbands. 6Sarah respected Abraham and called him Sir [lord]. You're her daughters. if you do good and feel secure in your situation.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Husbands, live with your wives with the understanding that they are weaker vessels. Honor them as fellow heirs of the grace of life so you don't hinder your prayers.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> In conclusion, you need to be like-minded, sympathetic, tenderhearted, humble, with brotherly love. 9Don't return evil for evil or insult for insult; bless instead. You were called for that so you could inherit good fortune:</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Quit doing bad and do good;</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> The LORD watches over good people</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Who's going to hurt you if you're eager to do what's good? 14Even if you suffer for it, you're well off. Don't be afraid of people's evil, or let it get you down. 15-16Set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts. With gentleness and respect, be ready to answer anybody that asks you about the hope you have. Keep your conscience clear so whatever people slander you about, your good behavior in Christ will discredit them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> If God wills, it's better to suffer for being good than for being bad. 18To bring you to God, Christ also suffered for sin once and for all, the righteous for the unrighteous. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. 19He went in the spirit and preached to the spirits in prison 20that disobeyed while God patiently waited for Noah to build the ark. In it, water saved a few people—eight. 21That's like baptism saving you. It doesn't wash off dirt, but appeals to God for a clear conscience because of Christ's resurrection. 22He's ascended to God's right hand in heaven with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.</span>
