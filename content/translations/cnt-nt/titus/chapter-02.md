## Titus Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But you, encourage the kind of living that is appropriate to sound doctrine. 2Older men should be serious-minded, respectable, sensible; sound in faith, love, and endurance. 3The same thing applies to older women. They should be reverent in behavior, not prone to gossip or addicted to wine, but teaching what's good. 4Then they can teach young women to love their husbands and children. 5They should be sensible, pure, devoted to their families, kind, and deferring to their husbands so people won't slander God's message.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In the same way, encourage younger men to be sensible. 7Present yourself as an example of doing good. Demonstrate pure doctrine, respectable conduct, 8and sound speech that people can't criticize. Then critics will be ashamed because they can't find anything bad to say about you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Urge servants to submit to their masters, to be pleasing, not argumentive, 10not stealing, but showing good faith so they can adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God's grace has appeared and offered salvation to everyone. 12His grace instructs us to set aside ungodliness and worldly pleasures and to live wisely, justly, and godly in the present age. 13All the while, we look forward to the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. 14He gave himself to redeem us from lawlessness and to purify a special people for himself, a people with zeal zeal for doing good. 15Speak these things, urge, and reprimand with authority. Don't let anybody disregard you.</span>
