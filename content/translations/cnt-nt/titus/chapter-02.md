## Titus Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> But you, encourage the kind of living that is appropriate to sound doctrine. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Older men should be serious-minded, respectable, sensible; sound in faith, love, and endurance. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>The same thing applies to older women. They should be reverent in behavior, not prone to gossip or addicted to wine, <em>but </em>teaching what’s good. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Then they can teach young women to love their husbands and children. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>They <em>should be</em> sensible, pure, devoted to their families, kind, <em>and</em> deferring to their husbands so people won’t slander God’s message.</span>

### Young Men’s Decorum


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> In the same way, <em>encourage</em> younger men to be sensible. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Present yourself as an example of doing good. <em>Demonstrate</em> pure doctrine, respectable conduct, <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>and sound speech that people can’t criticize. Then critics will be ashamed because they can’t find anything bad to say about you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Tit 2:6-8</p>

### Salvation Offered to Everybody


<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> <em>Urge</em> servants to submit to their masters, to be pleasing, not argumentive, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>not stealing, but showing good faith so they can adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Tit 2:9-10</p>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> God’s grace has appeared and offered salvation to everyone. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>His grace instructs us to set aside ungodliness and worldly pleasures and to live wisely, justly, and godly in the present age. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>All the while, we look forward to the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>He gave himself to redeem us from lawlessness and to purify a special people for himself, <em>a people</em> with zeal zeal for doing good. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Speak these things, urge, and reprimand with authority. Don’t let anybody disregard you.</span>
