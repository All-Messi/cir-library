## Titus Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Remind people to submit to rulers and authorities, to be obedient and ready to do everything that's good. 2Remind them not to insult or get pushy, but to be considerate and gentle toward everybody. 3At one time we were foolish too, disobedient, deceived, addicted to various lusts and pleasures. We spent our lives in evil and envy, hated and hating one another. 4But, "the kindness of God our Savior appeared along with love for other people. 5We didn't save ourselves by doing good. In mercy he saved us by the washing that regenerates and by the renewal the Holy Spirit gives. 6God poured out his Spirit on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior. 7In grace he justified us so we could inherit the hope for eternal life."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> That's a reliable statement. I want you to emphasize doing these things so the ones that have believed God will concentrate on doing good. Such things are good and profitable. 9But, avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, rivalries, legal disputes; they're pointless and unprofitable. 10After a first and second warning, quit having anything to do with people who cause division. 11They're perverted sinners that have condemned themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When Artemas or Tychycus get to you—that I'm sending—do your best to meet me at Nicopolis. I've decided to spend the winter there. 13Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos get on their way with what they need.  14Have our people learn to practice doing good to meet pressing needs so they'll be productive.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The ones that are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.</span>
