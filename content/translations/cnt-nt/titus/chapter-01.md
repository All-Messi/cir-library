## Titus Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> for the faith God’s chosen <em>people</em> have, and for the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness and <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>hope for eternal life. God our Savior, who doesn’t lie, promised that life before times eternal. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then at an appropriate time, he made the message available by the preaching he entrusted to me according to the commandment of our Savior God. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>To Titus, <em>my</em> loyal son in the faith we share. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Characteristics of Elders


<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> I left you in Crete to arrange what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city like I instructed you. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>A man needs to be above criticism, faithful to his wife, whose children aren’t accused of reckless living or disobedience—<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>because a bishop needs to be above criticism as God’s steward. <em>He must</em> not <em>be</em> stubborn, quick-tempered, addicted to wine, violent, or greedy for dishonest gain. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> needs to be </em>hospitable, loving what’s good, sensible, just, self-controlled. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> </em><em>needs to</em><em> </em>hold on tight to the trustworthy message he was taught. That way he can encourage <em>people</em> in sound doctrine and show the error of the ones that speak falsely.</span>

### Silencing Disorderly People


<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> There are lots of disorderly people, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially from the Circumcision, <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>that need to be silenced. They overthrow whole families by teaching things people don’t need to do, and they do it dishonestly to make money. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>One of their own prophets has said, <em>“Cretans are always liars, </em><em>bad</em><em> animals, lazy gluttons.”</em> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>That’s true; so reprimand them sharply to make them sound in the faith, <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>not caught up in Jewish myths and human rules that distract people from the truth. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Everything’s pure to people that are pure; nothing’s pure to people that are not pure. They’ve defiled their minds and consciences. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>They claim to know God, but they deny <em>it </em>by how they act. They’re detestable, disobedient, and worthless for doing anything good.</span>
