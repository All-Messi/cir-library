## 2 Corinthians Chapter 2

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I was determined not to come again with sadness. 2If I make you feel bad, who's going to make me feel good except the ones I made feel bad? 3I've written this so when I come, I won't be saddened by the ones I need to make me happy. I'm confident that my joy would mean your joy. 4Out of hardship and anxiety, I wrote to you through many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know how much I care about you.  	2 Cor 1:23-2:4</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> If somebody has caused sadness, he hasn't caused it just to me—I'm not exaggerating—but to all of you. 6That discipline by the majority is enough for someone like him. 7Now you need to forgive him and comfort him so grief doesn't overwhelm him. 8So show him how much you care about him. 9That's another reason I've written: to know if you obey in everything. 10If you've forgiven anybody of anything, I have too. What I've forgiven I've forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ 11so Satan can't get the better of us. We know how he works.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When I got to Troas to present the good news about Christ, a door opened up for me in the Lord. 13But I didn't find any peace of mind because I didn't find my brother Titus. So I left and went on over to Macedonia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Thanks to God, who always leads us in victorious procession in Christ, and reveals through us everywhere the sweet aroma that arises from knowing him. 15We're the scent of Christ arising to God among the saved and the perishing. 16To the one we're the stench that leads to death; to the other we're the aroma that leads to life. Who's good enough for that? 17We're not like many that peddle God's message for money. In Christ we speak sincerely from God in his sight.</span>
