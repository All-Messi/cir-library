## 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when around, but bold when away! 2I pray that when I am present, I won't be as bold as I reckon I could confidently be against some who claim that we live according to the flesh. 3We do live in the flesh, but we don't fight according to the flesh. 4Our weapons aren't physical; they're powerful in front of God for destroying strongholds. With them we destroy speculations 5and every stronghold that rises up against knowing God. We make every thought captive to obeying Christ. 6We stand ready to punish every disobedience whenever your obedience is complete.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You look at the outward appearance of things. If anybody thinks they belong to Christ, they need to think about this again: as they belong to Christ, so do we. 8Even if I'm too proud of our authority—which the Lord gave us for building you up, not for tearing you down—I won't let you disregard me. 9I wouldn't want to scare you with my letters! 10"His letters," they say, "are heavy and strong; but his physical presence is weak, and his speech is contemptible." 11They need to realize that what we are in word by letters when absent, we can be in deed when present.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> We don't take it on ourselves to group ourselves and compare ourselves with people that put themselves forward. They measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves; that doesn't make sense. 13We aren't going to take credit for more than we should, only in the area God appointed to us—to go as far as where you are. 14We're not engaging in overreach; our work in the good news about Christ was the first to go as far as where you live. 15We don't take credit for other men's labors. But, we hope that you'll hold us in increasingly higher regard in our area of service, 16so we can preach the good news in places beyond you instead of bragging about what's been accomplished in somebody else's area of service. 17"The one that boasts should boast in the LORD" [Jer 9:24]. 18It's not who commends himself that's approved, but who the LORD commends.</span>
