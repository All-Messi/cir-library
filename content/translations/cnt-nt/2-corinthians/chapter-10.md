## 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

### Paul’s Defense of His Ministry

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—<em>I</em> who <em>am</em> meek when around, but bold when away! <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I pray that when I <u>am</u> present, I won’t be as bold as I reckon I could confidently be against some who claim that we live according to the flesh. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>We do live in the flesh, but we don’t fight according to the flesh. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Our weapons <em>aren’t</em> physical; they’re powerful in front of God for destroying strongholds. <em>With them</em> we destroy speculations <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>and every stronghold that rises up against knowing God. We make every thought captive to obeying Christ. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>We stand ready to punish every disobedience whenever your obedience is complete.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 10:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You look at the outward appearance of things. If anybody thinks they belong to Christ, they need to think about this again: as they belong to Christ, so do we. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Even if I’m too proud of our authority—which the Lord gave us for building you up, not for tearing you down—I won’t let you disregard me. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I wouldn’t want to scare you with my letters! <strong><sup>10</sup></strong><em>“His letters,”</em> they say, <em>“are heavy and strong; but his physical presence is weak, and his speech </em>is<em> contemptible.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>They need to realize that what we are in word by letters when absent, <em>we can be</em> in deed when present.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 10:7-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> We don’t take it on ourselves to group <em>ourselves</em> and compare ourselves with people that put themselves forward. They measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves; that doesn’t make sense. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>We aren’t going to take credit for more than we should, only in the area God appointed to us—to go as far as <em>where you are</em>. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>We’re not engaging in overreach; our work in the good news about Christ was the first to go as far <em>as where you live.</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>We don’t take credit for other men’s labors. But, we hope that you’ll hold us in increasingly higher regard in our area <em>of service</em>, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>so we can preach the good news in places beyond you instead of bragging about what’s been accomplished in somebody else’s area <em>of service</em>. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><strong><em>“The one that </em></strong><strong><em>boasts should boast in the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Jer</strong><strong> 9:24]</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>It’s not who commends himself that’s approved, but who the LORD commends.</span>
