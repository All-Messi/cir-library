## 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? We don't need letters of recommendation to you or from you like some do, do we? 2You're our letter that everybody can know and read, written on our hearts. 3You're an open letter from Christ, served by us, not written with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on human hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> We have so much confidence in God through Christ, 5not because we're adequate to consider anything as our own accomplishment, but adequate because of what comes from God. 6He has made us adequate ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit. The letter deadens; the spirit enlivens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The ministry that brought death—engraved with letters on stone—came with so much glory that the Israelites couldn't look at Moses' face—a fading glory. 8Won't the ministry of the spirit have even more glory? 9If the ministry that brought condemnation had glory, how much more glory does the ministry have that brings goodness. 10What had glory doesn't have any in comparison to what has greater glory. 11What faded away had glory, but what doesn't fade away has a lot more glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> With that kind of hope, let's be bold. 13Let's not be like Moses, who put a veil on so the Israelites wouldn't have to look at what was fading away. 14-15Their minds were insensitive. To this day when they read the Old Covenant, the same veil is there. They don't understand that ChristMessiah removes it. 16When their heart turns to the Lord, the veil disappears. 17Now the Lord is the spirit of the Old Covenant, and where his spirit is, there's freedom. 18When with unveiled face we look at the glory of the Lord in a mirror, the Lord, the spirit, transforms us into that same image from glory to more glory.</span>
