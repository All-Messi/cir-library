## 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? We don’t need letters of recommendation to you or from you like some do, do we? <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><u>You</u>’re our letter that everybody can know and read, written on our hearts. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>You’re an open letter from Christ, served by us, not written with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on human hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We have so much confidence in God through Christ, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not because <u>we’re</u> adequate to consider anything as our own accomplishment, but adequate because of what comes from God. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>He has made us adequate ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit. The letter deadens; the spirit enlivens.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> The ministry that brought death—engraved with letters on stone—came with so much glory that the Israelites couldn’t look at Moses’ face—a fading glory. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Won’t the ministry of the spirit have <em>even </em>more glory? <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>If the ministry that brought condemnation had glory, how much more glory does the ministry have that brings goodness. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>What <em>had</em> glory doesn’t have any in comparison to what <em>has</em> greater glory. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>What faded away had glory, but what doesn’t fade away has a lot more glory.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 3:1-11</p>

### Freedom from Law


<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> With that kind of hope, let’s be bold. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Let’s not be like Moses, who put a veil on so the Israelites wouldn’t have to look at what was fading away. <strong><sup>14-15</sup></strong>Their minds were insensitive. To this day when they read the Old Covenant, the same veil is there. They don’t understand that Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> removes it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>When <em>the</em><em>ir</em><em> heart</em> turns to the Lord, the veil disappears. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Now the Lord <em>is</em> the spirit <em>of the Old Covenant</em>, and where his spirit is, <em>there’s</em> freedom. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>When with unveiled face we look at the glory of the Lord in a mirror, the Lord, the spirit, transforms us into that same image from glory to <em>more</em> glory.</span>
