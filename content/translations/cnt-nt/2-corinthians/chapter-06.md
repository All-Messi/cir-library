## 2 Corinthians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> We're working with him and urging you not to receive God's grace for nothing. 2He says, That "right time" is now; that "time of salvation" is now. 3We try not to offend in anything so people won't find fault with our ministry. 4We try to commend ourselves as ministers in endurance, affliction, hardship, distress, 5beatings, imprisonment, mob violence, labors, sleeplessness, hunger; 6in purity, knowledge, longsuffering, kindness, a holy spirit, genuine love, 7in the message about the truth, the power of God; by the weapons of goodness in the right hand and the left; 8through honor and disrespect, bad report and good; as deceitful but true, 9unknown but well-known, as dying but alive, punished but not put to death; 10as grieved but always rejoicing, as owning nothing but having everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> We've spoken freely to you, Corinthians; we've opened our hearts wide open. 12We're not restraining you; your inward parts are restraining you. 13Open up to us. (I'm talking as if I'm talking to my children.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Don't get unequally yoked to unbelievers. How can goodness team up with lawlessness? What does light have in common with darkness? 15What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What part does a believer have with a disbeliever? 16What agreement is there between God's sanctuary and idols? We're God's living sanctuary—like he said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> So come out from among them</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> I'll be your Father, the LORD Almighty says" [Amos 3:13 LXX; 4:13 LXX].</span>
