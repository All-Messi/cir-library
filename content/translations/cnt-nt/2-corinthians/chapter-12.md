## 2 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Being proud may be appropriate, but it's not profitable. I'll go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 2I know a man in Christ 14 years ago—whether in the body or not, I don't know; God knows. He was caught up to the third heaven—[3]repeat 4to Paradise—and heard things you can't express in words. 5I'll take pride in that man; I won't boast about myself except in my weaknesses. 6If I do boast, I won't be foolish about it; I'll talk about what's real. I don't want anybody to regard me as something more than what they can see for themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Because of the extraordinary greatness of those revelations, God gave me a thorn in the flesh—a messenger from Satan—to discipline me so I wouldn't think too highly of myself. 8I asked the Lord three times to take it away. 9He said, "My grace is sufficient for you; my power reaches its highest expression in weakness." Gladly, then, I'll take pride in my weaknesses so Christ's power can live in me. 10So I delight in weakness, mistreatment, need, persecution, and difficulty for Christ. When I'm weak I'm strong.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> You've made me become foolish. You should've been commending me. In no way have I been inferior to the most prominent apostles, though I'm nothing. 12I worked the signs of an apostle among you in an ongoing way—signs, wonders, and miracles. 13How did I treat you worse than the other churches—unless it was by not making myself a burden to you? Forgive me that wrong! 14I'm ready to come this third time, and I won't be a burden this time either. I want you, not yours. Children don't lay up for parents; it's the other way around. 15I'll gladly spend and be spent for your souls. Do you love me less for loving you more? 16Anyway, I didn't burden you, because I was sneaky; I took you in by being crafty! 17Did I take advantage of you through anybody I've sent you? 18I'm the one that urged Titus and the brother to come. Titus hasn't taken advantage of you, has he? Haven't we both conducted ourselves with the same attitude? Haven't we walked in the same footsteps?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> Do you think I'm saying all this to defend myself? God is witness, I'm saying this in Christ to help you. 20I'm afraid that in some way, when I get there, I won't find you like I want to, and you won't find me that way either. I'm afraid I'll find rivalry, jealousy, anger, dispute, slander, gossip, pride, disturbances. 21I'm afraid my God will humiliate me in front of you, and I'll be sad because people that sinned previously haven't repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality.</span>
