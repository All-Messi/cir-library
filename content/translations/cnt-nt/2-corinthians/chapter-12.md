## 2 Corinthians Chapter **12**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Being proud may be appropriate, but <em>it’s </em>not profitable. I’ll go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I know a man in C</span>
<p class="section-ref">hrist 14</p>

### years ago—whether in the body or not, I don’t know; God knows. He was caught up to the third heaven—[3]repeat 4to Paradise—and heard things you can’t express in words. 5I’ll take pride in that man; I won’t boast about myself except in my weaknesses. 6If I do boast, I won’t be foolish about it; I’ll talk about what’s real. I don’t want anybody to regard me as something more than what they can see for themselves. The Thorn in the Flesh


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Because of the extraordinary greatness of <em>those</em> revelations, God gave me a thorn in the flesh—a messenger from Satan—to discipline me so I wouldn’t think too highly of myself. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I asked the Lord three times to take it away. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He said, <em>“My grace is sufficient for you; my power </em><em>reaches its highest expression</em><em> in weakness.”</em><em> </em>Gladly, then, I’ll take pride in my weaknesses so Christ’s power can live in me. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So I delight in weakness, mistreatment, need, persecution, and difficulty for Christ. When I’m weak I’m strong.</span>

### Concern for Corinth


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>You’ve made me become foolish. You should’ve been commending me. In no way have I been inferior to the most prominent apostles, though I’m nothing. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I worked the signs of an apostle among you in an ongoing way—signs, wonders, and miracles. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>How did I treat you worse than the other churches—unless <em>it was</em> by not making myself a burden to you? Forgive me that wrong! <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I’m ready to come this third time, and I won’t be a burden <em>this time either</em>. I want you, not yours. Children don’t lay up for parents; it’s the other way around. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><u>I’ll</u> gladly spend and be spent for your souls. Do you love me less for loving you more? <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Anyway, I didn’t burden you, because I was sneaky; I took you in by being crafty! <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Did I take advantage of you through anybody I’ve sent you? <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>I’m the one that urged Titus and the brother <em>to come</em>. Titus hasn’t taken advantage of you, has he? Haven’t we both conducted ourselves with the same attitude? <em>Haven’t we walked</em> in the same footsteps?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup>Do you think I’m saying all this to defend myself? God is witness, I’m saying this in Christ to help you. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>I’m afraid that in some way, when I get there, I won’t find you like I want to, and you won’t find me that way either. I’m afraid <em>I’ll find</em> rivalry, jealousy, anger, dispute, slander, gossip, pride, disturbances. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I’m afraid my God will humiliate me in front of you, and I’ll be sad because people that sinned previously haven’t repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality.</span>
