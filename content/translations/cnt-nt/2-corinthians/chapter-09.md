## 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I don't need to write to you about this ministry to the saints. 2I know you're committed to it, and I've told the Macedonians how pleased we are over it—pleased that you in Achaia have been ready since last year. Your zeal has stirred up many of them. 3I've sent the brothers so our pride in you in this matter wouldn't be empty talk and, like I said, so you'd be ready. 4That way, if Macedonians come with me, they'll find you ready, and we won't be embarrassed (much less, you) by this confidence we've expressed about you. 5So I considered it appropriate to urge the brothers to go on to you and prepare ahead of time the blessing you promised before and get it ready as a blessing and not something you'd be doing under pressure.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> Now I tell you, whoever doesn't sow much doesn't reap much, and whoever sows a lot reaps a lot. 7Each person needs to do as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly, or because he has to. God loves a cheerful giver. 8He can make grace overflow for you so you can overflow in every good thing you do. You'll always have everything you need, 9like scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed, and increase the harvest from your goodness. 11In many ways, your generosity will enrich you, and yield thanksgiving to God through us. 12Ministering this service not only supplies what the saints need, it overflows with their great thanksgiving to God. 13By the proof this ministry gives, they'll praise him for your obedience to the good news about Christ that you express by your generous contribution to them and everyone. 14While they pray for you, they'll really want to see you because of the surpassing grace of God that's in you. 15Thank God for his indescribable gift!</span>
