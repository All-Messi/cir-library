## 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> I don’t need to write to you about <em>this</em> ministry to the saints. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I know you’re committed to it, and I’ve told the Macedonians how pleased we are over it—<em>pleased</em> that <em>you in</em> Achaia have been ready since last year. Your zeal has stirred up many of them. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I’ve sent the brothers so our pride in you in this matter wouldn’t be empty talk and, like I said, so you’d be ready. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>That way, if Macedonians come with me, they’ll find you ready, and we won’t be embarrassed (much less, <u>you</u>) by this confidence <em>we’ve expressed about you</em>. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>So I considered it appropriate to urge the brothers to go on to you and prepare ahead of time the blessing you promised before and get it ready as a blessing and not something you’d be doing under pressure.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 9:1-5</p>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Now <em>I tell you</em>, whoever doesn’t sow much doesn’t reap much, and whoever sows a lot reaps a lot. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Each person needs to do as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly, or because he has to. God loves a cheerful giver. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>He can make grace overflow for you so you can overflow in every good thing you do. You’ll always have everything you need, <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>like scripture says, <strong><em>“He has distributed </em></strong><em>to everybody</em><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	he has given to the poor.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	His </em></strong><strong><em>goodness remains forever</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><em> </em><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 112:9]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The One who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed, and increase the harvest from your goodness. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>In many ways,<em> your</em> generosity will enrich you, and yield thanksgiving to God through us. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Ministering this service not only supplies what the saints need, it overflows with their great thanksgiving to God. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>By the proof this ministry gives, they’ll praise him for your obedience to the good news about Christ that you express by your generous contribution to them and everyone. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>While they pray for you, they’ll really want <em>to see</em> you because of the surpassing grace of God that’s in you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Thank God for his indescribable gift!</span>
