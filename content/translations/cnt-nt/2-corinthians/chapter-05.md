## 2 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> We know that if our earthly "housing" perishes, we have one from God not made with hands, eternal in heaven. 2That's what we wait for. [3] 4While we're in this tent, we groan with burdens. We don't want to be "unhoused," but fully housed so life can swallow up what's mortal. 5God has prepared us for that by giving us the Spirit as a pledge.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 4:7-5</p>

### :5 Taking Courage in Christ


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> So we always take courage. We know that while we're at home in the body we're away from the Lord. (7We operate by faith more than by sight.) 8We have courage and prefer to be absent from the body and at home with the Lord. 9So we aim to please him, whether we're at home or away. 10We all have to appear at Christ's judgment seat to receive pay for what we did in the body, good or bad.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> So, fearing the Lord, we persuade people. We're open and obvious to God and, I hope, in your conscience too. 12We're not trying to commend ourselves to you again; we're giving you a chance to take pride in us so you can answer people that take pride in appearances instead of heart. 13Whether we're beside ourselves is for God to decide; whether we have a sound mind is for you to decide. 14Christ's love controls us because we've concluded that since One died for all, all had died. 15He died for all so all the living would stop living for themselves and live for the One that died for them and resurrected. Salvation as Reconciliation</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So from now on, we don't know anybody by what they look like. Even though we've known Christ that way, we don't anymore. 17So if anybody's in Christ, they're a new creation. The old things are gone; they've become new; 18and they've come from God. He has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us a ministry about reconciliation: 19that in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not holding their trespasses against them, and putting in us the message about reconciliation. 20We're ambassadors for Christ, and God is making his appeal to the world through us, "Please, for the sake of Christ, be reconciled to God." 21The One who hadn't sinned God treated as sinful on our behalf so we could become sinless in him. 2 Combating Opposition by Authentic Living</span>
