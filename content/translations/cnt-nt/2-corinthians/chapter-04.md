## 2 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, since we have this ministry, we don’t get discouraged because we’ve received mercy. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>We’ve set aside shameful secrets; we don’t indulge in trickery or pervert God’s message. But by showing what’s true, we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in front of God. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>If our good news is veiled, it’s veiled to people that perish. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The god of this world has blinded the minds of disbelievers so the glorious good news about Christ, the image of God, doesn’t enlighten them. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>We don’t present ourselves; <em>we present</em> Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your servants for his sake. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>God said, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ight will shine </em></strong><strong><em>out of darkness</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 1:3; Is. 9:2]</strong>; he’s the One that will <em>“shine”</em> in our hearts and <em>“enlighten”</em> <em>us</em> with the knowledge of his glory <em>that shines</em> on the face of Jesus Christ.</span>

### Endurance in Conflict


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> We have this treasure in clay jars so <em>it’ll</em> be <em>obvious</em> that<em> the </em>extraordinary power <em>of the </em><em>message</em> does not come from us, but from God. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>In every <em>way</em> we’re afflicted, but not crushed; puzzled, but not in despair; <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>persecuted, but not abandoned; knocked down, but not destroyed, <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>always carrying around in <em>our</em> body the death of Jesus so his life will be obvious in our body as well. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>We who are alive keep getting delivered to death because of Jesus so his life can shine in our mortal flesh. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>So death is at work in us, but life <em>is at work</em> in you. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>We have the same spirit of trust as the scripture says <strong><em>“I believed; so I spoke</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 116:10]</strong>. <u>We</u> <em>“believe”</em> too; so we <em>“speak”</em> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>because we know that the One who raised Jesus up will raise us up with him and present us along with you. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Everything’s for your sake so the grace that has spread out through an increasing number <em>of people</em> will increase the gratitude, to God’s glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So from now on, we don’t know anybody by what they look like. Even though we’ve known Christ that way, we don’t anymore. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So if anybody’s in Christ, they’re a new creation. The old things are gone; they’ve become new; <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>and they’ve come from God. He has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us a ministry about reconciliation: <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>that in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not holding their trespasses against them, and putting in us the message about reconciliation. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>We’re ambassadors for Christ, and God is making his appeal <em>to</em> <em>the world</em> through us, <em>“Please,</em><em> for the sake of Christ,</em><em> be reconciled to God.”</em> <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>The One who hadn’t sinned God treated as sinful on our behalf so we could become sinless in him. <strong>2 Cor 5:16-21</strong> <strong>Combating Opposition by Authentic Living</strong></span>
