## 2 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> So, since we have this ministry, we don't get discouraged because we've received mercy. 2We've set aside shameful secrets; we don't indulge in trickery or pervert God's message. But by showing what's true, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in front of God. 3If our good news is veiled, it's veiled to people that perish. 4The god of this world has blinded the minds of disbelievers so the glorious good news about Christ, the image of God, doesn't enlighten them. 5We don't present ourselves; we present Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your servants for his sake. 6God said, "Light will shine out of darkness" [Gen 1:3; Is. 9:2]; he's the One that will "shine" in our hearts and "enlighten" us with the knowledge of his glory that shines on the face of Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> We have this treasure in clay jars so it'll be obvious that the extraordinary power of the message does not come from us, but from God. 8In every way we're afflicted, but not crushed; puzzled, but not in despair; 9persecuted, but not abandoned; knocked down, but not destroyed, 10always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus so his life will be obvious in our body as well. 11We who are alive keep getting delivered to death because of Jesus so his life can shine in our mortal flesh. 12So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 13We have the same spirit of trust as the scripture says "I believed; so I spoke" [Ps 116:10]. We "believe" too; so we "speak" 14because we know that the One who raised Jesus up will raise us up with him and present us along with you. 15Everything's for your sake so the grace that has spread out through an increasing number of people will increase the gratitude, to God's glory.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> So we don't get discouraged. Though our outer self wears out, our inner self renews daily. 17Our temporary, light hardship produces for us more and more an eternal, weighty glory that's beyond comparison. 18We don't look at what we can see, but what we can't. What we can see is temporary; what we can't see is eternal.</span>
