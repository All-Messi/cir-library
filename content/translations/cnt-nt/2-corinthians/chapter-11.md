## 2 Corinthians Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Just bear with me in a little foolishness. 2I'm jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I married you to one husband and presented you as a pure virgin. 3I'm afraid that somehow, like the snake tricked Eve, he'll lead your minds astray from the simplicity [and purity]ms that's in Christ. 4If anybody comes presenting another Jesus than the One we've presented, or you receive a different spirit than you've received, or a different message than you've received, you pay patient attention to him! 5In no way do I consider myself inferior to the most prominent apostles. 6Even if I'm not skilled in how I speak, I am "skilled" in what I know, and we've made that quite clear to you in everything.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Did I sin by humbling myself so you could be respected? Did I sin by presenting God's good news to you for free? 8I robbed other churches, taking support from them so I could minister to you. 9When I was with you and needed something, I didn't burden you. Brothers came from Macedonia to supply those needs. In every way I've kept from being a burden to you, and I'll continue to do that. 10As Christ's truth is in me, I won't stop taking pride in that approach to ministering anywhere in Achaia. 11Why? Because I don't love you? God knows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> What I'm doing I'll keep doing. I want to take away any chance for the ones who want to be considered like us in what they're proud of. 13People like them are false apostles, deceptive workers that disguise themselves as Christ's apostles. 14That's no wonder; Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light. 15So it's not surprising if his minsters disguise themselves as ministers of goodness. They'll end up rewarded according to what they've done.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Again let me say, don't anybody consider me foolish. But, if you do, receive me as foolish so I can boast a little bit. 17I'm not speaking here as the Lord would have me speak, but foolishly, in confident boasting. 18Since many take pride in the flesh, I will too. 19Since you're smart, you gladly put up with foolish people 20who enslave you, eat you up, take advantage of you, put on airs, slap you in the face! 21I'm speaking disparagingly of myself as if I really have been weak. But, in whatever respect anybody wants to be bold, I'll be bold too. 22Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. 23Are they Christ's ministers? I am more: in more labors, in jail more often, in scourgings more severely, in danger of death many times. 24I received 39 lashes 5 times; 25I was beaten with rods 3 times; I was stoned once; I was shipwrecked 3 times; I've spent a night and a day in the open water. 26I've traveled often in dangers from rivers, robbers, my own countrymen, the Gentiles, in the desert, on the sea, among false believers. 27I've been in labor and hardship, in lots of sleepless nights, hungry and thirsty often, cold and without enough clothes. 28Besides external things, there's daily pressure on me for all the churches. 29Who is weak and I'm not weak? Who falls into sin, and I'm not distressed?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> If I'm going to be proud, I'll be proud of my weaknesses. 31The God and Father of the Lord Jesus—blessed forever—knows I'm not lying. 32In Damascus the ethnarch under King Aretas was guarding the city to capture me, 33and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped.</span>
