## 2 Corinthians Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Just bear with me in a little foolishness. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I’m jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I married you to one husband and presented <em>you as a </em>pure virgin. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I’m afraid that somehow, like the snake tricked Eve, he’ll lead your minds astray from the simplicity [and purity]<sup>ms</sup><sup> </sup>that’s in Christ. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>If anybody comes presenting another Jesus than the One we’ve presented, or you receive a different spirit than you’ve received, or a different message than you’ve received, you pay patient attention to <em>him</em>! <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>In no way do I consider myself inferior to the most prominent apostles. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Even if I’m not skilled in how I speak, I <u>am</u> “<em>skilled</em><em>”</em> in what I know, and <em>we</em>’ve made that quite clear to you in everything.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 11:1-6</p>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Did I sin by humbling myself so you could be respected? Did I sin by presenting God’s good news to you for free? <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I robbed other churches, taking support <em>from them</em> so I could minister to you. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>When I was with you and needed <em>something</em>, I didn’t burden <em>you</em>. Brothers came from Macedonia to supply <em>those needs</em>. In every way I’ve kept from being a burden to you, and I’ll continue to do that. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>As Christ’s truth is in me, I won’t stop taking pride in that approach <em>to ministering</em> anywhere in Achaia. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> What I’m doing I’ll keep doing. <em>I want to</em> take away any chance for the ones who want to be considered like us in what they’re proud of. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>People like them are false apostles, deceptive workers that disguise themselves as Christ’s apostles. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>That’s no wonder; Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So <em>it’s</em> not surprising if his minsters disguise themselves as ministers of goodness. They’ll end up <em>rewarded</em> according to what they’ve done.<strong> </strong><strong></span>

### Recounting Paul’s Sufferings


<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Again let me say, don’t anybody consider me foolish. But, if <em>you do</em>, receive me as foolish so I can boast a little bit. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>I’m not speaking here as the Lord would <em>have me speak</em>, but foolishly, in confident boasting. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Since many take pride in the flesh, I will too. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>Since you’re smart, you gladly put up with foolish people <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>who enslave you, eat you up, take advantage of you, put on airs, slap you in the face! <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I’m speaking disparagingly <em>of myself</em> as if I really <u>have</u> been weak. But, in whatever respect anybody wants to be bold, <u>I’ll</u> be bold too. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Are they Christ’s ministers? I <em>am</em> more: in more labors, in jail more often, in scourgings more severely, in <em>danger of</em> death many times. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>I received 39 lashes 5 times; <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>I was beaten with rods 3 times; I was stoned once; I was shipwrecked 3 times; I’ve spent a night and a day in the open water. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>I’ve</em> traveled often in dangers from rivers, robbers, <em>my</em> own countrymen, the Gentiles, in the desert, on the sea, among false believers. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>I’ve been in labor and hardship, in lots of sleepless nights, hungry and thirsty often, cold and without enough clothes. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Besides external things, <em>there’</em><em>s</em> daily pressure on me for all the churches. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>Who is weak and I’m not weak? Who falls into sin, and I’m not distressed?</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 11:16-29</p>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> If I’m going to be proud, I’ll be proud of my weaknesses. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus—blessed forever—knows I’m not lying. <strong><sup>32</sup></strong>In Damascus the ethnarch under King Aretas was guarding the city to capture me, <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped.</span>
