## 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I want you to know about God's grace that the churches in Macedonia have given. 2During a time of obvious great hardship, in their abundant joy and deep poverty their rich generosity abounded. 3I speak to the fact that by their ability and beyond they gave of their own accord. 4They begged us for the favor of participating in this ministry to the saints, 5not like we expected, but they gave themselves to the Lord first and to us by God's will. 6So we urged Titus that, like he made a beginning earlier, he would complete in you this grace too. 7As you excel in everything—in faith, word, knowledge, diligence, and our love for you—excel in this grace too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> I'm not telling; I'm testing the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the zeal that others have. 9You know the graciousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, he became poor for you so you could become rich from his poverty. 10I'm offering an opinion for your advantage. A year ago you wanted to do this. 11Now according to your ability, finish what you started. 12If people are ready, it's acceptable as they have, not as they don't have. 13The idea is not to make it easy for others and hard on you. It's so there'll be equality. 14Right now your abundance supplies their lack so their abundance can supply your lack, so there'll be equality. 15Like scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Thanks to God, who has put the same earnestness for you in Titus' heart. 17He accepted the appeal and has earnestly gone out to you of his own accord. 18We've sent with him a brother that all the churches praise in the gospel. 19We've chosen him to travel with us in this grace that we're overseeing to the Lord's honor and to show our commitment. 20We're handling the matter this way so nobody can find fault with us in this generous gift. 21We're being careful about what's appropriate in front of the Lord and people. 22We've sent with them our brother that we've often found diligent in many things. He's all the more diligent because of the confidence he has in you. 23Titus is my partner and fellow worker in respect to you, and our brothers are messengers of the churches and Christ's honor. 24So show the churches the proof of your love and the reason we've been so proud of you.</span>
