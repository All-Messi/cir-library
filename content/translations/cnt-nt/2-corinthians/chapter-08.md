## 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Now I want you to know about God’s grace that the churches in Macedonia have given. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>During a time of obvious great hardship, in their abundant joy and deep poverty their rich generosity abounded. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I speak to the fact that by their ability and beyond <em>they gave</em> of their own accord. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>They begged us for the favor of participating in this ministry to the saints, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>not like we expected, but they gave themselves to the Lord first and to us by God’s will. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>So we urged Titus that, like he made a beginning earlier, he would complete in you this grace too. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>As you excel in everything—in faith, word, knowledge, diligence, and our love for you—excel in this grace too.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 8:1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>I’m not telling; I’m testing the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the zeal that others have. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>You know the graciousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, he became poor for you so you could become rich from his poverty. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>I’m offering an opinion for your advantage. A year ago you wanted to do this. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Now according to your ability, finish what you started. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If people are ready, <em>it’s</em> acceptable as they have, not as they don’t have. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The idea is not to make it easy for others and hard on you. It’s so there’ll be equality. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>Right now your abundance supplies their lack so their abundance can supply your lack, so there’ll be equality. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Like scripture says, <strong><em>“The one that gathered </em></strong><strong><em>a lot didn’t have too much;</em></strong> <strong><em>	the one that gathered </em></strong><strong><em>a </em></strong><strong><em>little </em></strong><strong><em>had enough</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ex</strong><strong> 16:18]</strong>.<strong>       </strong><strong>	  </strong><strong>2 Cor 8:8-15</strong> <strong>Titus’ Role in the Collection</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Thanks to God, who has put the same earnestness for you in Titus’ heart. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He accepted the appeal and has earnestly gone out to you of his own accord. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>We’ve sent with him a brother that all the churches praise in the gospel. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>We’ve chosen him to travel with us in this grace that we’re overseeing to the Lord’s honor and <em>to show</em> our commitment. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>We’re handling the matter this way</em> so nobody can find fault with us in this generous gift. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>We’re being careful about what’s appropriate in front of the Lord and people. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>We’ve sent with them our brother that we’ve often found diligent in many things. He’s all the more diligent because of the confidence he has in you. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>Titus <em>is</em> my partner and fellow worker in respect to you, and our brothers <em>are</em> messengers of the churches and Christ’s honor. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>So show the churches the proof of your love and the reason we’ve been so proud of you.</span>
