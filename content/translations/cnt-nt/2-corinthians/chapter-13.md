## 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This will be the third time I'm coming to you. "Establish everything by two or three witnesses" [Deut 19:15]. 2The second time I was there I said this—and I say it again to the ones that sinned previously and to the rest—if I come again, I won't hold back, 3because you're looking for proof that Christ is speaking in me. He's not weak toward you but is strong among you. 4Indeed, he was crucified out of weakness, but lives by God's power. We're weak in him too, but we'll live with him by God's power that's directed at you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Test to see if you're in the faith; examine yourselves! Don't you realize that God's among you—unless you fail the test? 6I hope you'll know we won't fail the test. 7We pray to God that you won't do anything bad, not that we may appear approved, but that you'll do what's good even if we would fail the test. 8We can't do anything against the truth, only for it. 9We are happy to be weak and you to be strong. We pray for this too: your perfection. 10So I'm writing this while absent so when I'm present, I won't have to be severe in using the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Finally, rejoice, strive for perfection, be comforted, live in harmony and peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 12Greet one another with a holy kiss. (13)All the saints greet you. 13(14)The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.   	  2 Cor 13:11-13(14)</span>
