## 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

### Self-Examination Before God

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> This will be the third time I’m coming to you.<strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Establish everything b</em></strong><strong><em>y</em></strong><strong><em> two or three witnesses</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 19:15].</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The second time I was there I said this—and I say it again to the ones that sinned previously and to the rest—if I come again, I won’t hold back, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>because you’re looking for proof that Christ is speaking in me. He’s not weak toward you but is strong among you. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Indeed, he was crucified out of weakness, but lives by God’s power. We’re weak in him too, but we’ll live with him by God’s power <em>that’s </em><em>directed</em> at you.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 13:1-4</p>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Test <em>to see</em> if you’re in the faith; examine yourselves! Don’t you realize that God’s among you—unless you fail the test? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>I hope you’ll know <u>we</u> won’t fail the test. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>We pray to God that you won’t do anything bad, not that <u>we</u> may appear approved, but that <u>you</u><u>’ll</u> do what’s good even if <u>we</u> would fail the test. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>We can’t do anything against the truth, only for it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We are happy to be weak and you to be strong. We pray for this too: your perfection. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So I’m writing this while absent so when I’m present, I won’t have to be severe in using the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 13:5-10</p>

### Final Greetings


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Finally, rejoice, strive for perfection, be comforted, live in harmony and peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Greet one another with a holy kiss. <strong><sup>(</sup></strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><strong><sup>)</sup></strong>All the saints greet you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>(14</sup></strong><strong><sup>)</sup></strong>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit <em>be</em> with you all.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 13:11-13</p>
