## 2 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> Jesus by God’s will, and Timothy <em>our</em> brother, to the church of God in Corinth with the saints everywhere in Achaia. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<p class="section-ref">2 Cor 1:1-2</p>

### God’s Comfort in Sufferings


<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Blessed <em>be</em> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He’s our merciful Father and comforting God. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He comforts us in every hardship so we can comfort other people in any hardship with the comfort he gave us. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>As sufferings for Christ increase in us, our comfort through Christ also increases. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>If we experience hardship, <em>it’s</em> for your comfort and salvation. If we’re comforted, <em>it’s</em> for your comfort to endure the same sufferings we have. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Our hope for you <em>is</em> unmovable because we know that as you share <em>our</em> sufferings, <em>you share our </em>comfort too.<strong> </strong><strong>  </strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Fellow Christians, we want you to know about our hardships in Asia. It was a burden so much beyond our own power to handle that we weren’t sure we’d even live <em>through </em>it. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>We had the death sentence in us so we weren’t trusting in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>He rescued us from a great threat of death, and we’ve put our hope in him to keep rescuing us. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>You worked for us by praying so lots of people could be grateful for the grace we’ve received. <strong>2 Cor 1:3-11</strong> <strong>Paul’s Sincerity</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>When I got to Troas to present the good news about Christ, a door opened up for me in the Lord. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>But</em> I didn’t find any peace of mind because I didn’t find my brother Titus. So I left and went on over to Macedonia.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> In this confidence I was intending at first to come so you could have a second grace. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>I meant to go through you on to Macedonia and back to you, and to have you send me forward to Judaea. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>With this plan I wasn’t being fickle, was I? Do I make fickle plans—<em>“</em>Yes<em>, I will</em><em>”</em>; <em>“</em>No<em>, I won’t</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>As God keeps <u>his</u> word, <u>we</u> don’t tell you, “Yes, <em>I will</em>” and <em>then say</em>,<em> </em>“No,<em> I won’t</em>.” <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>God’s Son, Christ Jesus, the One Silvanus, Timothy, and I presented among you, wasn’t, “Yes, <em>I will</em>”; “No, <em>I won’t</em>.” He’s been “Yes, <em>I will</em>.” <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>However many promises God has made, in Christ is “Yes.” He’s <em>our</em> Amen, to God’s honor. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>In Christ, God has established us, anointed us and you, <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>sealed us, and given us the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts.</span>

### Paul’s Delayed Visit


<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> God’s my witness: it was to spare you that I changed my mind and didn’t come to Corinth. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>We aren’t trying to lord it over your faith; we’re fellow workers for your joy. You stand firm in <em>your own</em> faith. <strong>2</strong><strong><sup>:</sup></strong><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>I was determined not to come again with sadness. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>If I make you feel bad, who’s going to make me feel good except the ones I made feel bad? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>I’ve written this so when I come, I won’t be saddened by the ones I need to make me happy. I’m confident that my joy would mean your joy. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Out of hardship and anxiety, I wrote to you through many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know how much I care about you.</span>
