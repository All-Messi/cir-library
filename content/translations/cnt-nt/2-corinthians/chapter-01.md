## 2 Corinthians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle of ChristMessiah Jesus by God's will, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth with the saints everywhere in Achaia. 2Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He's our merciful Father and comforting God. 4He comforts us in every hardship so we can comfort other people in any hardship with the comfort he gave us. 5As sufferings for Christ increase in us, our comfort through Christ also increases. 6If we experience hardship, it's for your comfort and salvation. If we're comforted, it's for your comfort to endure the same sufferings we have. 7Our hope for you is unmovable because we know that as you share our sufferings, you share our comfort too.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Fellow Christians, we want you to know about our hardships in Asia. It was a burden so much beyond our own power to handle that we weren't sure we'd even live through it. 9We had the death sentence in us so we weren't trusting in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. 10He rescued us from a great threat of death, and we've put our hope in him to keep rescuing us. 11You worked for us by praying so lots of people could be grateful for the grace we've received.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> We're proud of how clear our conscience feels, especially toward you. We've conducted ourselves in godly holiness and sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in divine grace. 13We're writing what you can understand, and I hope you'll understand it completely. 14You understand to some extent how proud we are of you—like you will be of us when the Lord Jesus comes.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> In this confidence I was intending at first to come so you could have a second grace. 16I meant to go through you on to Macedonia and back to you, and to have you send me forward to Judaea. 17With this plan I wasn't being fickle, was I? Do I make fickle plans—"Yes, I will"; "No, I won't." 18As God keeps his word, we don't tell you, "Yes, I will" and then say, "No, I won't." 19God's Son, Christ Jesus, the One Silvanus, Timothy, and I presented among you, wasn't, "Yes, I will"; "No, I won't." He's been "Yes, I will." 20However many promises God has made, in Christ is "Yes." He's our Amen, to God's honor. 21In Christ, God has established us, anointed us and you, 22sealed us, and given us the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> God's my witness: it was to spare you that I changed my mind and didn't come to Corinth. 24We aren't trying to lord it over your faith; we're fellow workers for your joy. You stand firm in your own faith.</span>
