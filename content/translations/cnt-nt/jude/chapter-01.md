## Jude Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jude, servant of Jesus ChristMessiah and brother of James, to the ones called by God the Father, loves and keeps you in Jesus Christ. 2Mercy, peace, and love many times over. Condemnation of False Teachers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Friends, I'm anxious to write to you about the salvation we share. I need to encourage you to keep contending earnestly for the faith once and for all delivered to the saints. 4Ungodly people have sneaked in under false pretenses; long ago they were assigned to that condemnation. They deny Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord and try to pervert God's grace into lustful living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> You know that once and for all, but I want to remind you that after the LORD saved a people out of Egypt, he destroyed the ones that didn't trust him. 6Angels that didn't keep their place he has held under darkness in permanent bonds till the great judgment day. 7Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them lived immorally, going after other flesh. They serve as examples of being subjected to eternal punishment by fire.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jude 1-7</p>

### Describing Some False Teachers


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Yet in like manner such people even fantasize about defiling the flesh, rejecting authority, and railing at angels. 9But when Michael the archangel was arguing with the devil about the body of Moses, he didn't bring railing condemnation; he said, "The LORD reprimand you." 10People like them rail out about what they don't understand, about what they know by instinct like animals that can't reason—and therefore destroy themselves. 11What consequences await them! They've followed Cain's way; they've plunged into Balaam's deception for money; they've perished in Korah's rebellion. 12They're hidden pieces of gravel in your love-feast food; without qualms they carouse among you, shepherding themselves. They're clouds with no moisture, driven around by the wind. They're late autumn trees with no fruit, uprooted, and doubly dead. 13They're wild waves of the sea, foaming up shameful acts. They're stars out of orbit that the gloom of darkness is reserved for.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jude 8-13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them, "The LORD will come with 10,000 holy ones 15to convict sinners of their ungodly deeds and terrible blasphemies against him." 16They grumble, complain, pursue lusts, talk arrogantly, flatter people for gain.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jude 14-16</p>

### Maintaining Faithfulness Despite Competition


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> But dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ 18used to tell you, "In the end mockers will come, chasing after ungodly lusts. 19They'll be divisive, materialistic, unspiritual." 20But you, build yourselves up with your most holy faith and with prayer in the Holy Spirit. 21Keep yourselves in God's love and wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who brings eternal life. 22Have mercy on some that doubt; 23save some by snatching them out of the fire; have mercy on others cautiously, hating even their clothes stained by the flesh. Jude 17-23 Benediction</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Now to him who can keep you from stumbling and stand you blameless in front of his glory with great joy, 25to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory and majesty, dominion and authority before all time, now, and forever. Amen.</span>
