## Jude Chapter **1**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Jude, servant of Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> and brother of James, to the ones called by God the Father, loves and keeps you in Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Mercy, peace, and love many times over.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Friends, I’m anxious to write to you about the salvation we share. I need to encourage you to keep contending earnestly for the faith once and for all delivered to the saints. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Ungodly people have sneaked in under false pretenses; long ago they were assigned to that condemnation. They deny Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord and try to pervert God’s grace into lustful living.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup>You know that once and for all, but I want to remind you that after the LORD saved a people out of Egypt, he destroyed the ones that didn’t trust <em>him</em>. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Angels that didn’t keep their place he has held under darkness in permanent bonds till the great judgment day. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them lived immorally, going after other flesh. They serve as examples of being subjected to eternal punishment by fire.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jude 1-7</p>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup>Yet in like manner such people even fantasize about defiling the flesh, rejecting authority, and railing at angels. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>But when Michael the archangel was arguing with the devil about the body of Moses, he didn’t bring railing condemnation; he said, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> </em><em>reprimand</em><em> you.”</em> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>People like them rail out about what they don’t understand, about what they know by instinct like animals that can’t reason—and therefore destroy themselves. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>What consequences await them! They’ve followed Cain’s way; they’ve plunged into Balaam’s deception for money; they’ve perished in Korah’s rebellion. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>They’re hidden pieces of gravel in your love-feast <em>food</em>; without qualms they carouse among <em>you</em>, shepherding themselves. They’re clouds with no moisture, driven around by the wind. <em>They’re </em>late autumn trees with no fruit, uprooted, and doubly dead. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>They’re</em> wild waves of the sea, foaming up shameful acts. <em>They’re </em>stars out of orbit that the gloom of darkness is reserved for. 	<strong>Jude</strong><strong> 8-13</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup>Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them, <em>“The </em><em>L</em><em>ORD</em><em> will come</span>
<p class="section-ref">with 10</p>

### ,000 holy ones 15to convict sinners of their ungodly deeds and terrible blasphemies against him.” 16They grumble, complain, pursue lusts, talk arrogantly, flatter people for gain. 	Jude 14-16


<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup>But dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>used to tell you, <em>“In the end mockers will come, </em><em>chasing after</em><em> ungodly lusts.</em> <strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>They’ll be divisive, </em><em>materialistic, unspiritual.”</em> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>But <u>you</u>, build yourselves up with your most holy faith and with prayer in the Holy Spirit. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>Keep yourselves in God’s love and wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who brings eternal life. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Have mercy on some that doubt; <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>save some by snatching them out of the fire; have mercy on others cautiously, hating even their clothes stained by the flesh.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jude 17-23</p>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup>Now to him who can keep you from stumbling and stand you blameless in front of his glory with great joy, <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord <em>be</em> glory and majesty, dominion and authority before all time, now, and forever. Amen.</span>
