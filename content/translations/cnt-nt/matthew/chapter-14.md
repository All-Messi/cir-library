## Matthew Chapter 14

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1Herod the tetraarch heard about Jesus 2and told his servants, “That’s John the Baptist, risen from the dead. That’s why he has miraculous powers.” 3Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison over Herodias, his brother Philip’s former wife. 4John kept telling him, “It’s against the Law for you to be living with her.” 5Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people. They considered John a prophet.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> But when Herod’s birthday came, Herodias’ daughter danced at the banquet, and it pleased Herod. 7So he solemnly swore to give her whatever she asked for. 8Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” 9Although the king was grieved, because of the oaths and those reclining at table with him, he commanded it to be given. 10He had John beheaded in the prison. 11They brought his head and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother. 12John’s disciples came and took the corpse and buried it, and went to tell Jesus. 	Mt 14:1-12 Feeding the 5,000</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When he heard the news, he withdrew by boat into open country privately. The crowds heard where he was going and followed him on foot from the towns. 14When he got out, he saw a large crowd and felt sorry for them and healed their sick.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> In the evening his disciples came, “Nobody lives around here, and it’s getting late. Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the villages and buy food.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Jesus said, “They don’t need to leave. Feed them.” 17“We only have five loaves and two fish.” 18“Bring them here.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> He told the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven and blessed them, broke them up for the disciples to give to the crowd. 20Everybody ate their fill, and the disciples picked up twelve medium-sized baskets of leftovers. 21About 5,000 men had eaten—plus women and children.       	 Mt 14:13-21 Jesus Walking on the Water</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> He urged the disciples to get in the boat right way and go on to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. 23When he’d dismissed them, he went up on the hill by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. 24The boat was already a long way from land, and waves were bashing it because the wind was against them. 25About 4 in the morning, he went to them, walking on the lake. 26When they saw him, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they cried out in fear.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> At once Jesus spoke, “It’s me. Don’t be afraid.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Peter responded, “If it’s you, tell me to come to you on the water.” 29“Come on.” Peter got down out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the water. 30But when he saw the strong wind, he got scared and started to sink. He cried out, “Save me!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> At once Jesus reached out and grabbed him, “One with little faith, why did you doubt?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> When they climbed up into the boat, the wind died down. 33The ones in the boat bowed to him, “You really are God’s Son!”	Mt 14:22-33 Miracles at Gennesaret</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When they got across, they landed at Gennesaret. 35The people recognized him and sent out into that whole area for everybody that was sick. 36They pleaded with him just to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. As many as touched him were cured.	Mt 14:34-36 Attack by the Jerusalem Pharisees About Traditions</span>
