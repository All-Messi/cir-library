## Matthew Chapter 11

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus had finished giving his disciples directions, he went off to teach and preach in their towns.    	Mt 10:34-11:1</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> In prison John heard what the Messiah was doing and sent disciples 3to ask him, "Are you the One to come or should we wait for somebody else?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus answered them, "Tell John what you're seeing: 5the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead resurrect, and the poor are hearing the good news. 6He is blessed that's not disappointed in me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> While they were leaving, Jesus started talking to the crowd about John, "What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed waving in the wind? 8What did you go out to see? Somebody dressed in fine clothes? People that wear fine clothes live in palaces. 9What did you go out to see? A prophet? Oh yes, and more than a prophet. 10He's the one scripture refers to,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> I'm telling you, nobody that's ever been born is greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him. 12From his time till now, violent people have been trying to bring in the kingdom of heaven by force. 13All the Prophets and the Law prophesied till John. 14If you're ready to accept it, he is the Elijah that was to come. 15Whoever has ears, listen! 16"What are people like today? They're like kids sitting in a marketplace, calling out to one another,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> John came, not eating or drinking, and people said, 'He's got a demon.' 19The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'A glutton and a drunk, a pal of tax collectors and sinners.' Wisdom is vindicated by what it produces."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> He began to denounce the towns where many of his miracles had happened, because they didn't repent. 21"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would've repented long ago in burlap and ashes. 22On judgment day, it'll be more bearable for them than for you. 23"And you, Capernaum, you won't rise up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to hell. If the miracles that took place in you had happened in Sodom, they'd still be here. 24On judgment day, it'll be more bearable for the area around Sodom than for you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Then Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealing them to the innocent. 26Yes, you delighted in doing it that way." 27"The Father has handed everything over to me, and nobody knows the Son but the Father, and nobody knows the Father but the Son and whoever the Son wants to reveal him to. 28"All of you that labor and carry heavy loads, come to me; you'll get some rest. 29Put my yoke on and learn about me. I'm gentle and humble, and you'll get relief. 30My yoke fits right, and my load is light."</span>
