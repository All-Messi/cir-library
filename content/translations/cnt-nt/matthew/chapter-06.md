## Matthew Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1“Be careful about practicing yourpl goodness in public so people will see you. Otherwise, you won’t have any reward from your Father in heaven. 2“When yousg donate to benevolence, don’t blow a trumpet like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets so people will admire them. They have all the reward they’re going to get. 3When you donate to benevolence, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand’s doing. 4That will keep your benevolence will be private, and your Father who sees private things will reward you. 5“When youpl pray, don’t do like the hypocrites. They like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners so people will see them. I tell youpl, they have all the reward they’re going to get. 6When yousg pray, go to your private room, shut the door, and pray in private. Your Father, who sees private things, will reward you. 	Mt 6:1-6 7“When youpl pray, don’t say things over and over like pagans do. That doesn’t mean anything. They think they’ll be listened to because they say lots of words. 8Don’t do that. Your Father knows what you need before you ask. 9You pray this way, ‘Our Father in heaven, you are holy.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Keep us from facing temptation; deliver us from the evil one, [because the kingdom, power, and glory belong to you forever. Amen.]ms</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> If youpl forgive people, your heavenly Father will forgive you. 15If you don’t, he won’t forgive you. 							          Mt 6:7-15 16“When youpl fast, don’t do like the hypocrites. They neglect their appearance to show people they’re fasting. That’s all the reward they’re going to get. 17When yousg fast, anoint your head and wash your face 18so you won’t be showing people you’re fasting. Your Father who sees secret things will reward you. 19“Don’t save up wealth on earth, where moths and rust ruin things, and thieves break in and steal them. 20Save up wealth in heaven, where moths and rust don’t ruin it, and thieves don’t break in and steal it. 21Your heart will be where your wealth is. 22“The eyes are the body’s lamp. If you have good eyes, your whole body will have light. 23If your eyes are bad, your whole body will be in the dark. If the light that’s in you is darkness, that’s serious darkness! 	Mt 6:16-23 24“Nobody can serve two masters. You’ll disregard one and be loyal to the other. You can’t serve God and money. 25So don’t worry about what you’ll eat or drink or what you’ll wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothes? 26“Look at the birds in the sky. They don’t plant or harvest or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than birds? 27Which one of you, by worrying, can make yourself a foot and a half taller? 28Why worry about clothes? Look how wild flowers grow. They don’t spin or toil, 29but Solomon in all his splendor didn’t dress like one of them. 30If God dresses the plants in the field that way—here today and thrown in an oven tomorrow—won’t he much more dress you, you with little faith? 31“So don’t worry about what you’re going to eat or what you’re going to wear. 32Gentiles strain after things like that. Your heavenly Father knows you need them. 33Strive after his kingdom and his goodness, and they’ll come along with it. 34Don’t worry about tomorrow; it will worry about itself. 	Mt 6:24-34</span>
