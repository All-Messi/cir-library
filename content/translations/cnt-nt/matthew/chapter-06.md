### 7“When youpl pray, don’t say things over and over like pagans do. That doesn’t mean anything. They think they’ll be listened to because they say lots of words. 8Don’t do that. Your Father knows what you need before you ask. 9You pray this way, 		‘Our Father in heaven, 			you are holy.

### 16“When youpl fast, don’t do like the hypocrites. They neglect their appearance to show people they’re fasting. That’s all the reward they’re going to get. 17When yousg fast, anoint your head and wash your face 18so you won’t be showing people you’re fasting. Your Father who sees secret things will reward you. 	19“Don’t save up wealth on earth, where moths and rust ruin things, and thieves break in and steal them. 20Save up wealth in heaven, where moths and rust don’t ruin it, and thieves don’t break in and steal it. 21Your heart will be where your wealth is. 22“The eyes are the body’s lamp. If you have good eyes, your whole body will have light. 23If your eyes are bad, your whole body will be in the dark. If the light that’s in you is darkness, that’s serious darkness! 	Mt 6:16-23 	24“Nobody can serve two masters. You’ll disregard one and be loyal to the other. You can’t serve God and money. 25So don’t worry about what you’ll eat or drink or what you’ll wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothes? 	26“Look at the birds in the sky. They don’t plant or harvest or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than birds? 27Which one of you, by worrying, can make yourself a foot and a half taller? 28Why worry about clothes? Look how wild flowers grow. They don’t spin or toil, 29but Solomon in all his splendor didn’t dress like one of them. 30If God dresses the plants in the field that way—here today and thrown in an oven tomorrow—won’t he much more dress you, you with little faith? 31“So don’t worry about what you’re going to eat or what you’re going to wear. 32Gentiles strain after things like that. Your heavenly Father knows you need them. 33Strive after his kingdom and his goodness, and they’ll come along with it. 34Don’t worry about tomorrow; it will worry about itself. 	Mt 6:24-34
