## Matthew Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil. 2After fasting 40 days, he was hungry, 3and the tempter came, "If you're God's Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> But he answered,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The devil tookp him to the Holy City and stood him on the pinnacle of the Temple, 6"If you're God's Son, throw yourself down. Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus said, "Again scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> The devil tookp him to a tall mountain and showedp him the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, 9"If you kneel down and worship me, I'll give you all this."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus saidp, "Go away, Satan. Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The devil leftp, and angels came to give him support.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee, 13and moved from Nazareth to Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 14That fulfills what Isaiah the prophet said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> From then on, Jesus preached, "Repent; the kingdom of heaven's coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> As he was walking along Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew. They were casting nets into the lake; they were fishermen. 19He toldp them, "Come with me, and I'll have you 'fishing' for people." 20Right away, they left their nets and went with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> He went on from there and saw two more brothers, James and John, sons of Zebedee, in a boat with their father, mending nets; and he called them. 22At once, they left the boat and their father and went with him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He started going all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, delivering the good news about the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and illness among the people. 24The news about him spread all over Syria, and they brought him people that were ill, people distressed with various sicknesses and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and he healed them. 25Big crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judaea, and beyond the Jordan.</span>
