<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When Jesus finished, he told his disciples, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>As</em><em> y</em><em>ou </em><em>know, the Passover is two</em><em> days</em><em> from now. I’ll</em><em> be handed over to be crucified.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup>Meantime the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the courtyard of Caiaphas, the high priest, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>and conspired to arrest Jesus by treachery and put him to death. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>But they said, <em>“Not during the </em><em>festival</em><em>; </em><em>the people will</em><em> riot.”</em></span>

### The Anointing by Mary


<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>a woman approached him with an alabaster cruise of very expensive ointment and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The disciples were indignant, <em>“What’s the point of such waste?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> could’ve sold </em><em>it </em><em>for a lot and </em><em>given </em><em>the money to the poor.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>Jesus was aware of it, <em>“Why are you fussing at her?</em><em> </em><em>She’s done me a good turn.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>always</em><em> have</em><em> poor people around, but you won’t always </em><em>have</em><em><sup>fp</sup></em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> put this ointment on my body to prepare me for </em><em>burial</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> tell you, wherever </em><em>you deliver the</em><em> go</em><em>od news</em><em> in the world, </em><em>tell </em><em>what she did in memory of her.</em><em>	</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>That evening, Jesus was reclining at table with the Twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>While they were eating, he said, <em>“I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They were really distressed and started saying, <em>“It’s not me, is it?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He answered, <em>“It’s the one that has dipped his hand with me in the bowl.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> will go the way </em><em>scripture says</em><em>, but woe to the </em><em>one</em><em> that betrays him.</em><em> </em><em>It would’ve been better if he</em><em> hadn’t </em><em>been born.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Judas, the one that did betray him, said, <em>“It’s not me, is it?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### The Lord’s Supper Instituted


<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>During the meal, Jesus took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, <em>“Take </em>and<em> eat </em>it<em>; </em><em>it’s</em><em> my body.”</em> <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, <em>“All of you, drink out of it;</em> <strong><sup>28</sup></strong><em>it’s</em><em> </em><em>my blood of the covenant that’s shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>29</sup></strong><em>This</em><em> is the last time I’ll be drinking </em><em>this fruit of the vine till I drink it with you in my Father’s kingdom.”</em><em> </em></span>

### The Disciples Warned


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus told<sup>p</sup> them, <em>“</em><em>A</em><em>ll</em><em> of you</em><em> </em><em>will </em><em>desert me tonight.</em><em> Scripture says</em><em>,</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>‘I’ll strike down the shepherd,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd his</em></strong><strong><em> sheep will scatter</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Zech</strong><strong> 13:7]</strong><strong>.</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup><em>After</em><em> I’m resu</em><em>rrected, I’ll go ahead of you </em><em>to Galilee.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Peter responded, <em>“</em>Even <em>i</em><em>f everyone </em><em>else </em><em>deserts you, </em><em>I’ll</em><em> never desert you.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus said, <em>“I tell you, tonight before </em><em>a</em><em> rooster crows, you’ll deny three times</em><em> that you know </em><em>me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Peter said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“Even if I have to die with you, I </em><em>won’t</em><em> deny you.”</em> That’s what all the disciples said.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 26:31-35</p>

### The Agony in the Garden


<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup>Jesus went<sup>p</sup> with them to a place called Gethsemane. <em>“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and became overwhelmed with dread. <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“I’m distressed to death.</em><em> </em><em>Stay here and keep watch with me.” </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>He went on a little way and fell on his face, <em>“My Father, if it’s possible, take this cup away from me; but not what I want, but what you want.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup>He came back<sup>p</sup> and found<sup>p</sup> them sleeping. He said<sup>p</sup> to Peter, <em>“Couldn’t you</em><em><sup>pl</sup></em><em> keep watch one hour?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>41</sup></strong><em>Keep</em><em> watch and pray so you won’t be tempted.</em><em> </em><em>The spirit’s willing, but the flesh is weak.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>A second time he went and prayed, <em>“My Father, if this can’t pass without me drinking it, your will be done.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He came back and found them sleeping again; they couldn’t keep their eyes open. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>He left them again and prayed the same thing a third time. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> back to his disciples, <em>“</em><em>You’re</em><em> </em><em>still </em><em>sleeping and resting?</em><em> </em><em>It’s time; </em><em>I’m about to be </em><em>betrayed</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> </em><em>to sinners.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em> up; let’s go.</em><em> </em><em>The one that’s betraying me is coming.”</em><em>      </em><em>	 </em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 26:36-46</p>

### The Arrest of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>While he was still talking, Judas came with a large contingent armed with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people. <strong><sup>48</sup></strong>The traitor had given them a signal, <em>“The one I kiss</em><em> is him</em><em>; arrest him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>At once he came to Jesus, <em>“H</em><em>ello</em><em>, Rabbi</em>,<em>”</em> and kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>Companion</em><em>, do what you came to do.”</em> They came and grabbed him and arrested him. <strong><sup>51</sup></strong>One of the men with Jesus drew his sword and struck the high priest’s servant and cut his ear off.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v52"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jesus told<sup>p</sup> him<em>, “Put your sword away.</em><em> </em><em>Everybody that picks up a sword dies by a sword.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>53</sup></strong><em>Do</em><em> you suppose I can’t ask my Father </em><em>right now</em><em> for </em><em>over</em><em> </em><em>70,000</em><em> angels?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>54</sup></strong><em>How</em><em> then would </em><em>I fulfill </em><em>the scriptures that things </em><em>need</em><em> to happen this way?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Jesus said to the crowd<em>, “You’ve come out </em>here <em>with swords and clubs to arrest me like an </em><em>insurrectionist</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>I sat teaching in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple every day, and you didn’t arrest me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>56</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> this </em><em>is all </em><em>happen</em><em>ing</em><em> to fulfill </em><em>what the prophets</em><em> </em><em>wrote</em><em>.”</em><em> </em> The disciples ran away.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 26:47-56</p>

### The Trial Before Caiaphas; Peter’s Denials; The Final Condemnation by the Sanhedrin


<span class="verse" id="v57"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>The ones that arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had assembled. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>A long way behind, Peter followed him to the high priest’s courtyard, went inside, and sat down with the officers to see the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v59"><sup><strong>59</strong></sup>The chief priests and the full Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so they could execute him. <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>But they didn’t find it even though a number of false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward, <strong><sup>61</sup></strong><em>“He</em><em> said, ‘I can tear down God’s sanctuary and rebuild it in </em><em>three</em><em> days.’”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The high priest got up and said, <em>“You aren’t going to answer </em><em>the claims</em><em> these men are </em><em>mak</em><em>ing against you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v63"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Jesus didn’t say anything. The high priest said, <em>“I</em><em>’m</em><em> put</em><em>ting</em><em> you under oath:</em><em> </em><em>by the living God, tell us if </em><em>you’re</em><em> the </em><em>Messiah</em><em>, the Son of God.”</em> <strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>“Yes</em><em>.</em><em> Nevertheless,</em><em> I</em><em>’m</em><em> tell</em><em>ing</em><em> you, </em> <em>‘</em><em>Later</em><em> you’ll see </em><strong><em>the Son of Man</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	s</em></strong><strong><em>itting on the right hand of Power</em></strong><strong><em> and</em></strong> <strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>	coming on</em></strong><strong><em> the clouds</em></strong><em>’</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Ps </strong><strong>110:1</strong><strong>;</span>
<p class="section-ref">Dan 7:13</p>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The high priest tore his clothes, <em>“He blasphemed.</em><em> What do we need witnesses for</em><em>?”</em><em> </em><em>You heard the blasphemy.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>66</sup></strong><em>What’s</em><em> your verdict?”</em> <em>“He deserves the death penalty.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 26:</p>

### 57-67


<span class="verse" id="v67"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They spit in his face, punched him, and slapped him, <strong><sup>68</sup></strong><em>“Tell</em><em> us, ‘</em><em>Messiah,’ w</em><em>ho slapped you</em><em>.</em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v69"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up, <em>“You were with Jesus the Galilean too.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v70"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>He denied it in front of them all, <em>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v71"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When he went out to the gateway, another <em>servant </em>girl saw him and said to the ones there, <em>“</em><em>This </em><em>fellow</em><em> was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v72"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>He denied it again—with an oath: <em>“I don’t know </em><em>him</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v73"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>A little while later the ones standing around came up to Peter, <em>“You </em><em><u>are too</u></em><em> one of them. Y</em><em>our accent gives you away.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v74"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He started pronouncing curses and swearing: <em>“I don’t know </em><em>him</em><em>.”</em> Immediately a rooster crowed. <strong><sup>75</sup></strong>Peter remembered, <em>“Before a rooster crows, you’ll deny me three times.”</em><em> </em>He went out and broke down sobbing.</span>
