### The Anointing by Mary


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>a woman approached him with an alabaster cruise of very expensive ointment and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The disciples were indignant, <em>“What’s the point of such waste?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>9</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> could’ve sold </em><em>it </em><em>for a lot and </em><em>given </em><em>the money to the poor.”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus was aware of it, <em>“Why are you fussing at her?</em><em> </em><em>She’s done me a good turn.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>You</em><em> </em><em>always</em><em> have</em><em> poor people around, but you won’t always </em><em>have</em><em><sup>fp</sup></em><em> me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>She</em><em> put this ointment on my body to prepare me for </em><em>burial</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> tell you, wherever </em><em>you deliver the</em><em> go</em><em>od news</em><em> in the world, </em><em>tell </em><em>what she did in memory of her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> A second time he went and prayed, <em>“My Father, if this can’t pass without me drinking it, your will be done.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He came back and found them sleeping again; they couldn’t keep their eyes open. <strong><sup>44</sup></strong>He left them again and prayed the same thing a third time. <strong><sup>45</sup></strong>He came<sup>p</sup> back to his disciples, <em>“</em><em>You’re</em><em> </em><em>still </em><em>sleeping and resting?</em><em> </em><em>It’s time; </em><em>I’m about to be </em><em>betrayed</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> </em><em>to sinners.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>46</sup></strong><em>Get</em><em> up; let’s go.</em><em> </em><em>The one that’s betraying me is coming.”</em><em></span>
