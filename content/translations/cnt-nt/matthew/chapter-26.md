## Matthew Chapter 26

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus finished, he told his disciples, 2"As you know, the Passover is two days from now. I'll be handed over to be crucified."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Meantime the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the courtyard of Caiaphas, the high priest, 4and conspired to arrest Jesus by treachery and put him to death. 5But they said, "Not during the festival; the people will riot."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7a woman approached him with an alabaster cruise of very expensive ointment and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table. 8The disciples were indignant, "What's the point of such waste? 9She could've sold it for a lot and given the money to the poor."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus was aware of it, "Why are you fussing at her? She's done me a good turn. 11You always have poor people around, but you won't always havefp me. 12She put this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial. 13I tell you, wherever you deliver the good news in the world, tell what she did in memory of her.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the high priests, 15"What would you give me to deliver Jesus over to you?" They counted out 30 silver shekels for him. 16From then on, he was looking for a chance to deliver him over to them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> On the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, "Where do you want us to get things ready for the Passover?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> He said, "Go into the city to such and such a man and say, 'The Rabbi says, "My time's getting close. I'll observep the Passover at your place with my disciples."'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The disciples did that and got things ready for observing the Passover meal.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> That evening, Jesus was reclining at table with the Twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> While they were eating, he said, "I tell you, one of you is going to betray me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They were really distressed and started saying, "It's not me, is it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He answered, "It's the one that has dipped his hand with me in the bowl. 24The Son of Man will go the way scripture says, but woe to the one that betrays him. It would've been better if he hadn't been born."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> Judas, the one that did betray him, said, "It's not me, is it?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> During the meal, Jesus took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, "Take and eat it; it's my body." 27He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, "All of you, drink out of it; 28it's my blood of the covenant that's shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29This is the last time I'll be drinking this fruit of the vine till I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> They sang a hymn and went out to The Mount of Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> Jesus toldp them, "All of you will desert me tonight. Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> After I'm resurrected, I'll go ahead of you to Galilee."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Peter responded, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I'll never desert you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> Jesus said, "I tell you, tonight before a rooster crows, you'll deny three times that you know me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v35"><sup class="verse-num">35</sup> Peter saidp, "Even if I have to die with you, I won't deny you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v36"><sup class="verse-num">36</sup> Jesus wentp with them to a place called Gethsemane. "Sit here while I go over there and pray."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v37"><sup class="verse-num">37</sup> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and became overwhelmed with dread. 38He saidp, "I'm distressed to death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> He went on a little way and fell on his face, "My Father, if it's possible, take this cup away from me; but not what I want, but what you want."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v40"><sup class="verse-num">40</sup> He came backp and foundp them sleeping. He saidp to Peter, "Couldn't youpl keep watch one hour? 41Keep watch and pray so you won't be tempted. The spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> A second time he went and prayed, "My Father, if this can't pass without me drinking it, your will be done." 43He came back and found them sleeping again; they couldn't keep their eyes open. 44He left them again and prayed the same thing a third time. 45He camep back to his disciples, "You're still sleeping and resting? It's time; I'm about to be betrayedp to sinners. 46Get up; let's go. The one that's betraying me is coming."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> While he was still talking, Judas came with a large contingent armed with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48The traitor had given them a signal, "The one I kiss is him; arrest him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v49"><sup class="verse-num">49</sup> At once he came to Jesus, "Hello, Rabbi," and kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus said, "Companion, do what you came to do." They came and grabbed him and arrested him. 51One of the men with Jesus drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant and cut his ear off. 52Jesus toldp him, "Put your sword away. Everybody that picks up a sword dies by a sword. 53Do you suppose I can't ask my Father right now for over 70,000 angels? 54How then would I fulfill the scriptures that things need to happen this way?" 55Jesus said to the crowd, "You've come out here with swords and clubs to arrest me like an insurrectionist? I sat teaching in the Temple every day, and you didn't arrest me. 56But this is all happening to fulfill what the prophets wrote." 57The ones that arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had assembled. 58A long way behind, Peter followed him to the high priest's courtyard, went inside, and sat down with the officers to see the end. 59The chief priests and the full Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so they could execute him. 60But they didn't find it even though a number of false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward, 61"He said, 'I can tear down God's sanctuary and rebuild it in three days.'" 62The high priest got up and said, "You aren't going to answer the claims these men are making against you?" 63Jesus didn't say anything. The high priest said, "I'm putting you under oath: by the living God, tell us if you're the Messiah, the Son of God." 65The high priest tore his clothes, "He blasphemed. What do we need witnesses for?" You heard the blasphemy. 66What's your verdict?" 67They spit in his face, punched him, and slapped him, 68"Tell us, 'Messiah,' who slapped you." 69Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up, "You were with Jesus the Galilean too." 70He denied it in front of them all, "I don't know what you're talking about." 71When he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the ones there, "This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene." 72He denied it again—with an oath: "I don't know him." 73A little while later the ones standing around came up to Peter, "You are too one of them. Your accent gives you away." 74He started pronouncing curses and swearing: "I don't know him." Immediately a rooster crowed. 75Peter remembered, "Before a rooster crows, you'll deny me three times." He went out and broke down sobbing.</span>
