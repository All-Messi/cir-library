## Matthew Chapter 9

### Healing a Paralyzed Man

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> They got in the boat and crossed back over to his town. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Some men were trying to bring him a paralyzed man on a stretcher. When he saw their faith, he said to the man, <em>“</em><em>Take heart, son</em><em>; </em><em>I’ve forgiven your sins</em><em>.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Some of the scribes said to themselves, <em>“He’s blaspheming!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Jesus knew what they were thinking, <em>“Why are you thinking </em><em>critical</em><em> things?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong><em>Which</em><em> is easier, to say, ‘</em><em>I’ve forgiven your sins</em><em>’ or ‘Get up and walk</em><em>’</em><em>?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>So</em><em> you can know that the </em><em>Son of Man</em><em> has the right on earth to forgive sins”</em>—he said<sup>p</sup> to the man, <em>“Get up, pick up your </em><em>stretcher</em><em>, and go home.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>He got up and went home. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>When the crowd saw it, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to mortals.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> Jesus went along from there and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Come with</em><em> me.”</em> He got up and went with him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>While he was reclining at table in Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined at table with Jesus and his disciples. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>When the Pharisees saw it, they started saying, <em>“Why i</em><em>s your Rabbi eating with tax collectors and sinners?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> He overheard it, <em>“Health</em><em>y people don’t need a doctor; </em><em>sick ones</em><em> do</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> </em><em>figure out</em><em> what this </em><em>means, </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em> want mercy more than sacrifice</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Hos</strong><strong> 6:6]</strong>.<em> </em><em>I didn’t c</em><em>ome so much to call good people, as </em>to call<em> sinners.”</span>

### Questions About Fasting


<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Then John’s disciples came, <em>“Why do we and the Pharisees fast </em><em>often</em><em>, but your disciples don’t</em><em> fast</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Jesus said, <em>“The groomsmen can’t feel sad </em><em>while</em><em> the groom</em><em> is around, can they? The time’s coming </em><em>when the groom will be taken</em><em> away</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>They’ll fast then.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>Nobody</em><em> puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment.</em><em> </em><em>The new material would pull away from the old garment and make the tear worse.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>People</em><em> don’t put new wine in old wineskins.</em><em> </em><em>The wineskins would burst</em><em> and be ruined</em><em>,</em><em> and the wine would drai</em><em>n out.</em><em> They</em><em> put new wine in new wineskins, and both are preserved.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> A woman with chronic bleeding for 12 years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>She said to herself, <em>“If I</em><em> can</em><em> just touch his </em><em>cloak</em><em>, I’ll be cured.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> Jesus turned and saw her, <em>“It’s okay, daughter, your faith has cured you</em>.” She was cured from then on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus went into the ruler’s house and saw flute players and a crowd making an uproar, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em> can go; the girl’s not dead; she’s </em><em>‘asleep</em><em>.</em><em>’</em><em>”</em> They started to ridicule him. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>When he’d put them out, he went in and took the girl’s hand and raised her up. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>That news <em>about the miracle </em>got out into the whole area.</span>
