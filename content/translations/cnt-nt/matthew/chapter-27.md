### 7-27:2 The Death of Judas


<span class="verse" id="v3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When Judas the traitor saw <em>Jesus</em> was condemned, he regretted it and took the 30 silver shekels back to the chief priests and elders, <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>“I’ve</em><em> sinned.</em><em> </em><em>I betrayed innocent blood.”</em> They said, <em>“What’s that to us?</em><em> </em><em>That’s </em><em><u>your</u></em><em> problem.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He threw the shekels into the sanctuary and went and hanged himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The chief priests took the shekels and said, <em>“It’</em><em>s against the L</em><em>aw to put them in the </em><em>T</em><em>emple Treasury </em><em>since</em><em> they’re blood money.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>They talked it over and decided to use them to buy a potter’s field as a cemetery for foreigners. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>That’s why it’s still called the Field of Blood.* <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>That fulfilled what Jeremiah the prophet said, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em> took </em></strong><strong><em>the 30</em></strong><strong><em> silver shekels,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the </em></strong><strong><em>price</em></strong><strong><em> of the One </em></strong><strong><em>as evaluated by the people of Israel</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>they</em></strong><strong><em><sup>ms</sup></em></strong><strong><em> bought</em></strong><strong><em> a potter’s field,</em></strong> <strong><em>l</em></strong><strong><em>ike the L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em> instructed me</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Zech</strong><strong> </strong><strong>11:12-13; cp Jer</strong><strong> 32:6-9]</strong>.<strong><em>	</em></strong><strong>Mt 27:3-10</strong> <strong>The First and Second Trials </strong> <strong>in Front of</strong><strong> Pilate</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus stood in front of the governor, who asked him, <em>“Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> king of the Jews?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>While the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he didn’t respond.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Pilate said, <em>“You hear </em><em>all the</em><em> things they’re accusing you of, don’t you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He didn’t answer him on a single charge. The governor was really surprised.<strong> </strong> <strong>      </strong><strong>Mt 27:11-14</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>At each <em>Passover </em>Festival the governor had a custom of releasing one prisoner the crowd wanted. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>At the time they were holding a notorious prisoner called [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> Barabbas. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So while they were assembled, Pilate said, <em>“Who do you want me to release to you, [Jesus]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>Barabbas or Jesus</em><em>,</em><em> called</em><em> Messiah</em><em>?”</em> (<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He knew they’d delivered him up out of envy.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, <em>“Don’t </em><em>do anything</em><em> with that </em><em>innocent</em><em> man.</em><em> </em><em>I suffered a </em><em>terrible</em><em> </em><em>nightmare</em><em> </em><em>last night </em><em>because of him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and execute Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Pilate asked them, <em>“Who do you want me to release?”</em> <em>“Barabbas.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Pilate saw he wasn’t getting anywhere, but a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, <em>“I’m innocent of this man’s blood.</em><em> </em><em>This is </em><em><u>your</u></em><em> problem.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The people answered, <em>“His </em><em>blood’s</em><em> on us and our descendants.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then he released Barabbas, had Jesus scourged, and turned him over to be crucified. <strong>Mt 27:15-26</strong> <strong>Torture by the Roman Soldiers</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The governor’s soldiers took him into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>They stripped him and put a scarlet military robe on him. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They twisted together a crown made out of thorns and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, knelt to him, and made fun of him, <em>“Hail, K</em><em>ing of the Jews!”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They spit on him and took the reed and kept beating him over the head with it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 27:27-30</p>

### The Way to Golgotha


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When they got done making fun of him, they took the robe off, put his clothes back on him, and led him off to crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As they were coming out, they found a Cyrenian named Simon and made him carry the cross. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When they got to a place called Golgotha (“Place of the Skull”), <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>they offered him wine mixed with gall; but, after tasting it, he wouldn’t drink it. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>After they crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>and sat down to keep watch. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They put his accusation above his head: <em>“Jesus, K</em><em>ing of the Jews.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>   </em><em>	 </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> They crucified two insurgents with him, on his right and left.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 27:31</p>

### -38 The Death of Jesus


<span class="verse" id="v39"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The ones passing by were ridiculing him, shaking their heads, <strong><sup>40</sup></strong><em>“You</em><em> that tear down the </em><em>sanctuary</em><em> and rebuild it in </em><em>three days, save yourself! </em><em>If you’re </em><em>God’s </em><em>Son, and</em><em> come down from the cross!</em><em>”</em><em>    </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The chief priests as well as the scribes and elders were making fun of him too: <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>“He</em><em> saved other people; he can’t save himself!</em><em> </em><em>He’s king of </em><em>Israel</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>Let him come down from the cross, and we’ll believe </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> has trusted in God; let </em>God<em> rescue him </em><em>now </em><em>if he wants him”—</em>because he said,<em> </em><em>“</em><em>I’m God’s Son.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The insurgents that were crucified with him were denouncing him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>From noon till 3, it got dark over the whole country. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>About 3 p.m., Jesus shouted, <strong>“</strong><strong><em>Eli, Eli, </em></strong><strong><em>l</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong><strong><em>ma</em></strong><strong><em> sabachthani</em></strong> <strong>(</strong><strong><em>My God, my God, why have you deserted me</em></strong><strong>)</strong><strong><em>?”</em></strong> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 22:1]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Some of the ones standing there heard him, <em>“He’s calling for Elijah.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>One of them ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>The rest were saying, <em>“Let’s see if Elijah will </em><em>come</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> to save him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus let out another loud cry and quit breathing.</span>
