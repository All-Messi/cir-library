### The First and Second Trials  in Front of Pilate


<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Jesus stood in front of the governor, who asked him, <em>“Are </em><em><u>you</u></em><em> king of the Jews?”</em> <em>“Yes.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>While the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he didn’t respond.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Pilate said, <em>“You hear </em><em>all the</em><em> things they’re accusing you of, don’t you?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He didn’t answer him on a single charge. The governor was really surprised.<strong> </strong> <strong>      </strong></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 27:11-14</p>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>At each <em>Passover </em>Festival the governor had a custom of releasing one prisoner the crowd wanted. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>At the time they were holding a notorious prisoner called [Jesus]<sup>ms</sup> Barabbas. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>So while they were assembled, Pilate said, <em>“Who do you want me to release to you, [Jesus]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em><sup> </sup></em><em>Barabbas or Jesus</em><em>,</em><em> called</em><em> Messiah</em><em>?”</em> (<strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He knew they’d delivered him up out of envy.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, <em>“Don’t </em><em>do anything</em><em> with that </em><em>innocent</em><em> man.</em><em> </em><em>I suffered a </em><em>terrible</em><em> </em><em>nightmare</em><em> </em><em>last night </em><em>because of him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and execute Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Pilate asked them, <em>“Who do you want me to release?”</em> <em>“Barabbas.”</em> <strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>“What</em><em> do you want me to do with Jesus, called </em><em>Messiah</em><em>?”</em> <em>“Crucify him!”</em> <strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>“Why</em><em>?</em><em> </em><em>What’s he done?”</em> They started shouting louder, <em>“Crucify him!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When Pilate saw he wasn’t getting anywhere, but a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, <em>“I’m innocent of this man’s blood.</em><em> </em><em>This is </em><em><u>your</u></em><em> problem.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>The people answered, <em>“His </em><em>blood’s</em><em> on us and our descendants.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup>Then he released Barabbas, had Jesus scourged, and turned him over to be crucified.</span>

### Torture by the Roman Soldiers


<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup>The governor’s soldiers took him into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>They stripped him and put a scarlet military robe on him. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They twisted together a crown made out of thorns and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, knelt to him, and made fun of him, <em>“Hail, K</em><em>ing of the Jews!”</em> <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>They spit on him and took the reed and kept beating him over the head with it.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 27:27-30</p>

### The Way to Golgotha


<span class="verse" id="v31"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When they got done making fun of him, they took the robe off, put his clothes back on him, and led him off to crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>As they were coming out, they found a Cyrenian named Simon and made him carry the cross. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>When they got to a place called Golgotha (“Place of the Skull”), <strong><sup>3</sup></strong><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>they offered him wine mixed with gall; but, after tasting it, he wouldn’t drink it. <strong><sup>35</sup></strong>After they crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots <strong><sup>36</sup></strong>and sat down to keep watch. <strong><sup>37</sup></strong>They put his accusation above his head: <em>“Jesus, K</em><em>ing of the Jews.”</em><em> </em><em>	</em><em>	</em><em>   </em><em>	 </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup>They crucified two insurgents with him, on his right and left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The chief priests as well as the scribes and elders were making fun of him too: <strong><sup>42</sup></strong><em>“He</em><em> saved other people; he can’t save himself!</em><em> </em><em>He’s king of </em><em>Israel</em><em>!</em><em> </em><em>Let him come down from the cross, and we’ll believe </em><em>it</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>43</sup></strong><em>He</em><em> has trusted in God; let </em>God<em> rescue him </em><em>now </em><em>if he wants him”—</em>because he said,<em> </em><em>“</em><em>I’m God’s Son.”</em><em> </em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong>The insurgents that were crucified with him were denouncing him.</span>

<p class="section-ref">till 3</p>

### , it got dark over the whole country. 46About 3 p.m., Jesus shouted, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (My God, my God, why have you deserted me)?” [Ps 22:1]


<span class="verse" id="v47"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Some of the ones standing there heard him, <em>“He’s calling for Elijah.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong>One of them ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. <strong><sup>49</sup></strong>The rest were saying, <em>“Let’s see if Elijah will </em><em>come</em><em><sup>p</sup></em><em> to save him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup>Jesus let out another loud cry and quit breathing.</span>

### -50 Miracles Accompanying His Death


<span class="verse" id="v51"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The sanctuary curtain tore in two, top to bottom; the ground tremored, and the bedrocks ruptured. (<strong><sup>52</sup></strong>Tombs came open, and the bodies of many saints resurrected. <strong><sup>53</sup></strong>They left their graves after his resurrection and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.) <strong><sup>54</sup></strong>The centurion and the ones on watch with him were scared to death when they saw the earthquake and the other things that were happening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup>Several women were watching from a distance. They’d traveled with Jesus from Galilee to wait on him. <strong><sup>56</sup></strong>Among them were Mary the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup>That evening a wealthy man named Joseph from Arimathea came; he was a disciple of Jesus. <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>He went to Pilate and asked for the body, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <strong><sup>59</sup></strong>He took it and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. <strong><sup>60</sup></strong>He put it in his own new, rock-hewn tomb, rolled a large stone against the entrance, and left. <strong><sup>61</sup></strong>Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary were there sitting across from the grave.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 27:57-61</p>

### The Watch at the Tomb


<span class="verse" id="v62"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The next day, the day after Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees got together with Pilate, <strong><sup>63</sup></strong><em>“Sir</em><em>, we’ve remembered that while he was alive,</em><em> </em><em>the deceiver said</em><em> he’d resurrect </em><em>after three days</em><em>.’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>64</sup></strong><em>Have</em><em> the grave</em><em> sealed till the third day so his disciples can’t steal the body and tell the people</em><em> h</em><em>e arose from the dead.</em><em> </em><em>The last deception would be worse than the first.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup><strong>65</strong></sup>Pilate told them, <em>“You have a guard. S</em><em>ecure it as well as you know how.”</em> <strong><sup>66</sup></strong>They secured the tomb with a guard and put a seal on the stone.</span>
