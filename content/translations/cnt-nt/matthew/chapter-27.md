## Matthew Chapter 27

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people developed a strategy for getting Jesus executed.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> They bound him and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.  	Mt 26:67-27:2 The Death of Judas</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> When Judas the traitor saw Jesus was condemned, he regretted it and took the 30 silver shekels back to the chief priests and elders, 4“I’ve sinned. I betrayed innocent blood.” They said, “What’s that to us? That’s your problem.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He threw the shekels into the sanctuary and went and hanged himself.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> The chief priests took the shekels and said, “It’s against the Law to put them in the Temple Treasury since they’re blood money.” 7They talked it over and decided to use them to buy a potter’s field as a cemetery for foreigners. 8That’s why it’s still called the Field of Blood.* 9That fulfilled what Jeremiah the prophet said, “I took the 30 silver shekels, the price of the One as evaluated by the people of Israel,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> and theyms bought a potter’s field, like the LORD instructed me” [Zech 11:12-13; cp Jer 32:6-9].	Mt 27:3-10 The First and Second Trials in Front of Pilate</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus stood in front of the governor, who asked him, “Are you king of the Jews?” “Yes.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> While the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he didn’t respond.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> Pilate said, “You hear all the things they’re accusing you of, don’t you?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> He didn’t answer him on a single charge. The governor was really surprised. Mt 27:11-14</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> At each Passover Festival the governor had a custom of releasing one prisoner the crowd wanted. 16At the time they were holding a notorious prisoner called [Jesus]ms Barabbas. 17So while they were assembled, Pilate said, “Who do you want me to release to you, [Jesus]ms Barabbas or Jesus, called Messiah?” (18He knew they’d delivered him up out of envy.)</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, “Don’t do anything with that innocent man. I suffered a terrible nightmare last night because of him.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and execute Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release?” “Barabbas.” 22“What do you want me to do with Jesus, called Messiah?” “Crucify him!” 23“Why? What’s he done?” They started shouting louder, “Crucify him!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> When Pilate saw he wasn’t getting anywhere, but a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, “I’m innocent of this man’s blood. This is your problem.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> The people answered, “His blood’s on us and our descendants.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Then he released Barabbas, had Jesus scourged, and turned him over to be crucified. Mt 27:15-26 Torture by the Roman Soldiers</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> The governor’s soldiers took him into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. 28They stripped him and put a scarlet military robe on him. 29They twisted together a crown made out of thorns and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, knelt to him, and made fun of him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 30They spit on him and took the reed and kept beating him over the head with it. 	Mt 27:27-30 The Way to Golgotha</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> When they got done making fun of him, they took the robe off, put his clothes back on him, and led him off to crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> As they were coming out, they found a Cyrenian named Simon and made him carry the cross. 33When they got to a place called Golgotha (“Place of the Skull”), 34they offered him wine mixed with gall; but, after tasting it, he wouldn’t drink it. 35After they crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots 36and sat down to keep watch. 37They put his accusation above his head: “Jesus, King of the Jews.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> They crucified two insurgents with him, on his right and left.   	Mt 27:31-38 The Death of Jesus</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> The ones passing by were ridiculing him, shaking their heads, 40“You that tear down the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you’re God’s Son, and come down from the cross!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> The chief priests as well as the scribes and elders were making fun of him too: 42“He saved other people; he can’t save himself! He’s king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross, and we’ll believe it. 43He has trusted in God; let God rescue him now if he wants him”—because he said, “I’m God’s Son.” 44The insurgents that were crucified with him were denouncing him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> From noon till 3, it got dark over the whole country. 46About 3 p.m., Jesus shouted, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (My God, my God, why have you deserted me)?” [Ps 22:1]</span>

<span class="verse" id="v47"><sup class="verse-num">47</sup> Some of the ones standing there heard him, “He’s calling for Elijah.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v48"><sup class="verse-num">48</sup> One of them ran to fill a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. 49The rest were saying, “Let’s see if Elijah will comep to save him.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v50"><sup class="verse-num">50</sup> Jesus let out another loud cry and quit breathing.	Mt 27:39-50 Miracles Accompanying His Death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v51"><sup class="verse-num">51</sup> The sanctuary curtain tore in two, top to bottom; the ground tremored, and the bedrocks ruptured. (52Tombs came open, and the bodies of many saints resurrected. 53They left their graves after his resurrection and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.) 54The centurion and the ones on watch with him were scared to death when they saw the earthquake and the other things that were happening.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v55"><sup class="verse-num">55</sup> Several women were watching from a distance. They’d traveled with Jesus from Galilee to wait on him. 56Among them were Mary the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.	Mt 27:51-56 The Burial of Jesus</span>

<span class="verse" id="v57"><sup class="verse-num">57</sup> That evening a wealthy man named Joseph from Arimathea came; he was a disciple of Jesus. 58He went to Pilate and asked for the body, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59He took it and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 60He put it in his own new, rock-hewn tomb, rolled a large stone against the entrance, and left. 61Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary were there sitting across from the grave. 	Mt 27:57-61 The Watch at the Tomb</span>

<span class="verse" id="v62"><sup class="verse-num">62</sup> The next day, the day after Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees got together with Pilate, 63“Sir, we’ve remembered that while he was alive, the deceiver said he’d resurrect after three days.’ 64Have the grave sealed till the third day so his disciples can’t steal the body and tell the people he arose from the dead. The last deception would be worse than the first.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v65"><sup class="verse-num">65</sup> Pilate told them, “You have a guard. Secure it as well as you know how.” 66They secured the tomb with a guard and put a seal on the stone.      	Mt 27:62-66 The Resurrection of Jesus</span>
