## Matthew Chapter 22

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Jesus told them another parable. 2"The kingdom of heaven is like a king that prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3He sent servants to call the people that he'd invited, but they didn't want to come. 4He sent some other servants, 'Tell the ones I've invited, "I've prepared my banquet. I've butchered my oxen and grain-fed calves; everything's ready. Come on to the banquet."' 5But they didn't pay any attention and went on with their own affairs, one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest grabbed his servants, treated them disgracefully, and killed them. 7"The king was angry and sent troops to destroy those murderers and burn their town. 8Then he told his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but the people I invited didn't deserve it. 9So go out to the main roads and invite everybody you find.' 10They went out in the roads and gathered everybody they could find, good and bad, and filled the wedding banquet with guests. 11"The king went in to inspect the guests and saw a man that wasn't dressed for a wedding. 12He said, 'How'd you get in here without being dressed for a wedding?' He was speechless. 13The king told the attendants, 'Tie him up hand and foot, and throw him out in the dark. There'll be crying and chattering of teeth out there. 14Many are called, but few are chosen.'"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> The Pharisees plotted how to trap Jesus in what he said. 16They sentp their disciples with the Herodians, saying, "Rabbi, we know you tell the truth and teach the way of God correctly; you don't defer to anybody or respect persons. 17So tell us what you think: Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> Jesus perceived their wickedness, "Why are you trying to put me on the spot, you hypocrites? 19Show me the coin for paying the tribute."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> They were dumbfounded and left.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> That day, some Sadducees, saying there's no resurrection, approached him, 'If a man dies childless, his brother is to marry his wife' [Deut 25:5] and 'raise up heirs for his brother' [Gen 38:8].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> There were seven brothers with us, and the first died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 26The same thing happened with the second and third through the seventh. 27Last of all, the woman died. 28So, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? They'd all married her."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v29"><sup class="verse-num">29</sup> Jesus answered them, "You're mistaken because you don't know the scriptures or God's power. 30In the resurrection there's no such thing as marriage. They're like the angels in heaven. 31"Now as to the resurrection of the dead, you've read, haven't you, what God said to you, 32'I'm Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's God'? [Ex 3:6, 15, 16] He's not a God of the dead, but of the living."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> The crowd was astounded at his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v34"><sup class="verse-num">34</sup> When the Pharisees heard he'd silenced the Sadducees, they gathered around him. 35One of them, [a lawyer]ms, tested him, 36"Rabbi, which is the most important commandment in the Law?" 37"'Love the LORD your God with all your heart, soul, and mind' [Deut 6:5]. 38That's the most important commandment. 39The second is like it, 'Love your neighbor as yourself' [Lev 19:18]. 40The whole Law and the Prophets depend on those two commandments."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> While the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them, 42"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" 46Nobody could answer him, and nobody dared ask him any more questions.</span>
