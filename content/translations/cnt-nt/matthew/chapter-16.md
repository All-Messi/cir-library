## Matthew Chapter 16

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1The Pharisees and Sadducees came, testing him, asking for a sign from the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> He answered, “When evening comes, you say, ‘It’ll be fair weather; the sky’s red.’ 3In the morning, ‘It’ll be bad weather today; the sky’s red and dark.’ You can read the sky, but you can’t read the signs of the times. 4An sinful, adulterous generation keeps looking for a sign, but it’s not going to get one—except for the sign of Jonah.” He left. 	Mt 16:1-4 Fourth Withdrawal East of the Lake; Warning to the Disciples</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The disciples went to the other side of the lake and had forgotten to take bread. 6Jesus told them, “Watch out for the ‘yeast’ from the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They started talking among themselves, “He said that because we didn’t bring any bread.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Jesus knew it, “Men with little faith, why are you talking about not having any bread? 9Don’t you understand or remember the 5 loaves for the 5,000 and how many medium-sized baskets full you picked up, 10or the 7 loaves for the 4,000 and how many large baskets full you picked up? 11How do you not know I wasn’t talking about bread!? Watch out for the ‘yeast’ from the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 12Then they got it; he hadn’t warned them about the yeast in bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 	Mt 16:5-12 Peter’s Great Confession</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> When Jesus came into the area around Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who are people saying the Son of Man is?” 14“John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, one of the prophets.” 15“Who do you say I am?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> Simon Peter said, “You’re the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 17“Bless you, Simon Barjonah. You didn’t get that from other people, but from my heavenly Father. 18As sure as you’re ‘Peter,’ I’ll build my church on that ‘rock.’ Even the gates of the grave won’t be strong enough to stop it. 19I’ll give yousg the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you lock up on earth will be locked up in heaven, and whatever you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.” 20Then he charged them not to tell anybody he was the Messiah. 										      Mt 16:13-20 The First Prediction of His Death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> From then on Jesus started showing his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem; suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes; be put to death, and resurrect the third day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But Peter pulled him aside and got after him, “That’s not going to happen to you!”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> But Jesus turned away from him, “Get behind me, Satan. You’re being a stumbling block to me. You don’t have God’s interests in mind, but people’s interests.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> Then he told his disciples, “If anybody wants to follow me, he has to set his own interests aside, pick up his cross, and follow me. 25Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses it over me will find it. 26What good does it do to get the whole world and lose your life? What will you give in exchange for your life? 27The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels. 28Some people standing here won’t die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. Mt 16:21-28 The Transfiguration</span>
