## Matthew Chapter 21

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When they got close to Jerusalem, to Bethany on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> in the village across from you.</em><em> </em><em>Close by you’ll find a donkey </em><em>tied</em><em> and a colt with her.</em><em> </em><em>Untie them and bring them to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> anybody says anything</em><em>, say t</em><em>he Lord needs them; </em><em>they</em><em>’ll send them </em><em>right away</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>That fulfilled what the prophet said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The disciples did like Jesus said, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>brought the donkey and colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The big crowd spread cloaks on the road; others started cutting tree branches and spreading them on the road. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The crowd ahead and behind started shouting, <strong><em>“Hosanna</em></strong><em> to the son of David!</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>Blessed </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> the One that’</em></strong><strong><em>s coming in the name of the L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:25-26]</strong><strong>!</strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Hosanna </em></strong><em>in the highest!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> When he went into Jerusalem, it stirred up the whole city, <em>“Who is this?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> The crowd said, <em>“T</em><em>he prophet Jesus from Nazareth in</em><em> Galilee.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Mt 21:1-11</strong> <strong>Second Cleansing of the </strong><strong>Temple;</strong> <strong>Cursing the Fig Tree</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jesus went into the Temple and drove out the ones that were buying and selling, and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of men selling doves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Scripture says</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘Call m</em></strong><strong><em>y house </em></strong><strong><em>a house for</em></strong><strong><em> prayer’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 56:7]</strong><strong>.</strong><em> </em> <em>Y</em><em>ou’ve</em><em> made it </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>a den of thieves</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>!</em><em>”</em> <strong>[Jer 7:11]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Blind and lame people came to him in the Temple, and he healed them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things he was doing and the kids shouting in the Temple, <em>“Hosanna to the son of David!”</em> they were indignant, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“Do</em><em> you hear what they’re saying?”</em> <em> “Yes.</em><em> You’ve </em><em>read,</em><em> haven’t you,</em><em> </em><strong><em>‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you’ve prepared yourself perfect praise’</em></strong><em>?”</em> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 8:3</strong><strong> LXX</strong><strong>]</strong> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He left the city for Bethany to spend the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> In the morning as he was coming into the city, he was hungry. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He noticed one fig tree beside the road. He went over to it and didn’t find anything on it but leaves. He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“You’ll never </em><em>grow</em><em> fruit again.”</em> Right away the tree started shriveling up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 21:12-19</p>

### Discussing the Shriveled Fig Tree


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When the disciples saw it, they were surprised, <em>“How did </em><em>it</em><em> shrivel up so fast?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Jesus answered, <em>“If you have faith—and don’t doubt—</em><em>not only will you do what </em><em>happened to this fig tree;</em><em> even if you </em><em>tell</em><em> this mountain</em><em> to b</em><em>e picked up and thrown in the sea, it’ll happen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Whatever</em><em> you ask for in prayer you’ll receive if you believe.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 21:20-22</p>

### Jesus’ Authority Challenged


<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When he went into the Temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came while he was teaching, <em>“What right do you have to do this?</em><em> </em><em>Who gave you</em><em> that right</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> They said, <em>“He’ll miserably destroy those</em><em> sinful</em><em> men and rent out the vineyard to other tenants that will pay him the fruit in its season.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’ve</em><em> read in the scriptures</em><em>, haven’t you,</em> <strong><em>‘The stone the builders rejected</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	has become the cornerstone.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	That has come from the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>it</em></strong><strong><em>’s</em></strong><strong><em> amazing to </em></strong><strong><em>us</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>?</em><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:22-23]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup class="verse-num">43</sup> <em>So</em><em> </em><em>God will take the</em><em> kingdom </em><em>away</em><em> from you</em><em> and give it</em><em> to a nation that will produce its fruit.</em><em> </em><em>[[</em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> </em><em>falls on that</em><em> stone will get bruised, and whoever it falls on will get crushed.]]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup class="verse-num">45</sup> The chief priests and the Pharisees knew he’d told his parables about them. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>They were trying to find a way to arrest him, but they were afraid to; the people considered him a prophet.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Mt 21:33-46</strong> <strong>Parable About</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> Wedding Garment</strong></span>
