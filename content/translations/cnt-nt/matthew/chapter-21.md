## Matthew Chapter **21**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>When they got close to Jerusalem, to Bethany on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, <strong><sup>2</sup></strong><em>“Go</em><em> in the village across from you.</em><em> </em><em>Close by you’ll find a donkey </em><em>tied</em><em> and a colt with her.</em><em> </em><em>Untie them and bring them to me.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> anybody says anything</em><em>, say t</em><em>he Lord needs them; </em><em>they</em><em>’ll send them </em><em>right away</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>That fulfilled what the prophet said, <strong><sup>5</sup></strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Tell</em></strong><strong><em> the </em></strong><strong><em>people</em></strong><strong><em> of Zion</em></strong><strong> [</strong><strong>Is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>62:11</strong><strong>]</strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	‘Your king’s coming to you,</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	humble and riding on a donkey—</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	the </em></strong><strong><em>colt</em></strong><strong><em> of a donke</em></strong><strong><em>y</em></strong><strong><em>’”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Zech</strong><strong> 9:9]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The disciples did like Jesus said, <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>brought the donkey and colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The big crowd spread cloaks on the road; others started cutting tree branches and spreading them on the road. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The crowd ahead and behind started shouting, <strong><em>“Hosanna</em></strong><em> to the son of David!</em> <em>	</em><em>	</em><strong><em>Blessed </em></strong><strong><em>be</em></strong><strong><em> the One that’</em></strong><strong><em>s coming in the name of the L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:25-26]</strong><strong>!</strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	Hosanna </em></strong><em>in the highest!”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup>When he went into Jerusalem, it stirred up the whole city, <em>“Who is this?”</em><em> </em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>The crowd said, <em>“T</em><em>he prophet Jesus from Nazareth in</em><em> Galilee.”</em><em>	</em></span>

### Second Cleansing of the Temple; Cursing the Fig Tree


<span class="verse" id="v12"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Jesus went into the Temple and drove out the ones that were buying and selling, and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of men selling doves.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Scripture says</em><em>, </em> <strong><em>‘Call m</em></strong><strong><em>y house </em></strong><strong><em>a house for</em></strong><strong><em> prayer’</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 56:7]</strong><strong>.</strong><em> </em> <em>Y</em><em>ou’ve</em><em> made it </em><strong><em>‘</em></strong><strong><em>a den of thieves</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>!</em><em>”</em> <strong>[</span>
<p class="section-ref">Jer 7:11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Blind and lame people came to him in the Temple, and he healed them. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things he was doing and the kids shouting in the Temple, <em>“Hosanna to the son of David!”</em> they were indignant, <strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>“Do</em><em> you hear what they’re saying?”</em> <em> “Yes.</em><em> You’ve </em><em>read,</em><em> haven’t you,</em><em> </em><strong><em>‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you’ve prepared yourself perfect praise’</em></strong><em>?”</em> <strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 8:3</strong><strong> LXX</strong><strong>]</strong> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>He left the city for Bethany to spend the night.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>In the morning as he was coming into the city, he was hungry. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>He noticed one fig tree beside the road. He went over to it and didn’t find anything on it but leaves. He said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“You’ll never </em><em>grow</em><em> fruit again.”</em> Right away the tree started shriveling up.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 21:12-19</p>

### Discussing the Shriveled Fig Tree


<span class="verse" id="v20"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>When the disciples saw it, they were surprised, <em>“How did </em><em>it</em><em> shrivel up so fast?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup>Jesus answered, <em>“If you have faith—and don’t doubt—</em><em>not only will you do what </em><em>happened to this fig tree;</em><em> even if you </em><em>tell</em><em> this mountain</em><em> to b</em><em>e picked up and thrown in the sea, it’ll happen.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>22</sup></strong><em>Whatever</em><em> you ask for in prayer you’ll receive if you believe.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 21:20-22</p>

### Jesus’ Authority Challenged


<span class="verse" id="v23"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong>When he went into the Temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came while he was teaching, <em>“What right do you have to do this?</em><em> </em><em>Who gave you</em><em> that right</em><em>?”</em> <strong><sup>24</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>I’ll</em><em> ask you a question too.</em><em> </em><em>If you tell me, </em><em>I’ll</em><em> tell you what right I </em><em>have to</em><em> do this.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>25</sup></strong><em>Was</em><em> John’s baptism from heaven or </em><em>humans</em><em>?”</em> They talked it over, <em>“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he’ll say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’</em><em> </em><strong><sup>26</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> we say, ‘From </em><em>humans</em><em>,’ we’re </em><em>afraid</em><em> of the people”</em> (everybody considered John a prophet). <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>So they answered, <em>“We don’t know.”</em><em> </em> He also said, <em>“</em><em>I </em><em>won’t tell you either what right I have to do this.</em><em>”</em></span>

### Parable About the Two Sons 28“What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first, ‘Go work in the vineyard today.’ 	29“‘I don’t want to,’ but later he regretted it and went. 	30“He went to the other son and said the same thing.  “‘Okay,’ but didn’t go. 31“Which one did the father’s will?” They said, “The first.” Jesus saidp, “Tax collectors and prostitutes are going into God’s kingdom before you are. 32John came telling you to live right, and you didn’t believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes did. But you, when you saw that, didn’t even regret it later and believe him. 	Mt 21:28-32 Parable About a Vineyard 33“Listen to another parable. A landowner planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, rented it out to tenants, and went on a trip. 34When it came time for the fruit, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. 35The tenants took them and beat one, murdered another, and stoned another. 36He sent some others—more than the first, and they did the same thing. 37Finally, he sent his son, ‘They’ll respect my son.’ 38But when they saw him, they said, ‘That’s the heir. Come on, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’ 39They dragged him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40When the owner comes, what will he do to those tenants?”


<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup>They said, <em>“He’ll miserably destroy those</em><em> sinful</em><em> men and rent out the vineyard to other tenants that will pay him the fruit in its season.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup>Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>Y</em><em>ou</em><em>’ve</em><em> read in the scriptures</em><em>, haven’t you,</em> <strong><em>‘The stone the builders rejected</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	has become the cornerstone.</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	That has come from the </em></strong><strong><em>L</em></strong><strong><em>ORD</em></strong><strong><em>;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>it</em></strong><strong><em>’s</em></strong><strong><em> amazing to </em></strong><strong><em>us</em></strong><strong><em>’</em></strong><em>?</em><strong> </strong><strong>[Ps</strong><strong> 118:22-23]</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v43"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup><em>So</em><em> </em><em>God will take the</em><em> kingdom </em><em>away</em><em> from you</em><em> and give it</em><em> to a nation that will produce its fruit.</em><em> </em><em>[[</em><strong><sup>44</sup></strong><em>Whoever</em><em> </em><em>falls on that</em><em> stone will get bruised, and whoever it falls on will get crushed.]]</em><em><sup>ms</sup></em><em>”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v45"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup>The chief priests and the Pharisees knew he’d told his parables about them. <strong><sup>46</sup></strong>They were trying to find a way to arrest him, but they were afraid to; the people considered him a prophet.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong></span>
