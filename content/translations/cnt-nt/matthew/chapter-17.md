## Matthew Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1Six days later, Jesus tookp Peter, James, and his brother John up on a tall mountain by themselves 2and was transfigured in front of them. His face glowed like the sun, and his clothes turned as white as light. 3Moses and Elijah appeared to them and were talking to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> Peter responded, “Lord, it’s good to be here. If you want, I’ll put up three tents—one each for you and Moses and Elijah.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> While he was still talking, a bright cloud engulfed them, and a voice said, “This is my dearly loved Son that I delight in. Listen to him.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces terrified. 7Jesus came and touched them, “Get up; don’t be afraid.” 8They looked up and didn’t see anybody but Jesus. 	Mt 17:1-8 Discussing the Vision</span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><sup class="verse-num">9</sup> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus impressed on them, “Don’t tell anybody what you saw till I’ve resurrected from the dead.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> The disciples asked, “Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?” 11“Elijah does come first to restore everything. 12He’s already come, and they didn’t recognize him. They treated him however they wanted to. That’s the way it’ll be, too, when the I suffer at their hand.” 13Then they caught on that he was talking about John the Baptist. 	Mt 17:9-13 Healing a Demoniac Boy</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> When they got to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and fell on his knees, 15“Sir, have mercy on my boy. He suffers badly with epilepsy. He falls into the fire and the water. 16I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.” 17“Unbelieving, perverse bunch, how long am I going to be with you? Bringpl him to me.” 18Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him. The child was healed from then on.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> The disciples came to Jesus privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?” 20“Because your faith was weak. If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can tell this mountain to move from here to there, and it’ll move. You can do anything. [[21“This kind doesn’t come out except by prayer and fasting.”]]ms  	Mt 17:14-21 Third Prediction of His Death</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> While they were together in Galilee, Jesus said, “I’m going to be betrayed. 23They’ll put me to death, but I’ll resurrect on the third day.” That really distressed them.	Mt 17:22-23 Jesus and the Temple Tax</span>

<span class="verse" id="v24"><sup class="verse-num">24</sup> As he was going into Capernaum, those who collect the didrachma came to Peter, “Your Rabbi pays the didrachma, doesn’t he?” 25“Yes.” When he came in the house, Jesus spoke first, “What do you think, Simon? Who do kings exact tribute from—citizens or foreigners?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> When Peter said, “Foreigners,” Jesus said, “So citizens are exempt. 27But we don’t want to make them stumble. Go to the lake and throw in a fishhook. Take the first fish you catch and open its mouth. You’ll find a stater. Give it to them for you and me.”	 Mt 17:24-27 Discussion About Rank;</span>
