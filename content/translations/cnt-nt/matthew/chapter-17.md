## Matthew Chapter 17

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>Six days later, Jesus took<sup>p</sup> Peter, James, and his brother John up on a tall mountain by themselves <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and was transfigured in front of them. His face glowed like the sun, and his clothes turned as white as light. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Moses and Elijah appeared to them and were talking to him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Peter responded, <em>“Lord, it’s good</em><em> to be here.</em><em> </em><em>If you want, I’ll </em><em>put up three tents—one each for you</em><em> </em><em>and Moses</em><em> and Elijah.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong>While he was still talking, a bright cloud engulfed them, and a voice said, <em>“This is my </em><em>dearly </em><em>loved Son that I delight in.</em><em> </em><em>Listen to him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces terrified. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Jesus came and touched them, <em>“Get up;</em><em> d</em><em>on’t</em><em> </em><em>be afraid.”</em> <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>They looked up and didn’t see anybody but Jesus.<strong> </strong><strong>	</strong><strong>Mt 17:1-8</strong> <strong>Discussing the Vision</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus impressed on them, <em>“Don’t tell anybody what you saw till </em><em>I’ve</em><em> r</em><em>esurrected</em><em> from the dead.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><strong><sup>0</sup></strong>The disciples asked, <em>“Why do the scribes say Elijah has to come first?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>When they got to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and fell on his knees, <strong><sup>15</sup></strong><em>“</em><em>Sir</em><em>, h</em><em>ave mercy on my boy.</em><em> </em><em>He suffers badly</em><em> with epilepsy</em><em>.</em><em> H</em><em>e falls in</em><em>to</em><em> the fire and the water. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong><em>I</em><em> brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>The disciples came to Jesus privately, <em>“Why couldn’t </em><em><u>we</u></em><em> cast it out?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> While they were together in Galilee, Jesus said, <em>“</em><em>I’m going to be betrayed</em><em>.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>23</sup></strong><em>They’ll</em><em> put </em><em>me</em><em> to death, </em><em>but</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em>’ll resurrect</em><em> </em><em>on the third day.”</em> That really distressed them.</span>

### Jesus and the Temple Tax


<span class="verse" id="v24"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong>As he was going into Capernaum, those who collect the didrachma came to Peter, <em>“Y</em><em>our Rabbi pay</em><em>s</em><em> the didrachma</em><em>, doesn’t he</em><em>?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>When Peter said, <em>“Foreigners</em><em>,</em><em>”</em> Jesus said, <em>“So </em><em>citizens are exempt.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>27</sup></strong><em>But</em><em> we don’t want to make them </em><em>stumble. G</em><em>o to the </em><em>lake and throw in a fishhook. </em><em>Take the first fish you catch and open its mouth.</em><em> </em><em>You’ll find a </em><em>stater</em><em>.</em><em> Give it to them for you</em><em> and </em><em>me</em><em>.”</em><em>	 </em><strong>Mt 17:24-27</strong> <strong>Discussion About </strong><strong>Rank;</strong></span>
