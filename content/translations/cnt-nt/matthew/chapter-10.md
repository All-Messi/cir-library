## Matthew Chapter 10

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1He called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out unclean spirits and heal all kinds of disease and illness. 2These are the twelve apostles: Simon called Peter; his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, his brother John, 3Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, 4Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him in the end.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> Jesus sent out these twelve, “Don’t go out among Gentiles or to any Samaritan town. 6Go to the lost sheep in Israel. 7As you go, say, ‘The kingdom of heaven is coming.’ 8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You’ve received at no charge; give at no charge. 9“Don’t get any gold, silver, or copper coins for your money belts. 10Don’t get a traveler’s bag, a staff, shoes, or two shirts for the trip. Workers deserve their wages.                                                                                  Mt 10:1-10 11“Whatever town or village you go into, find out who’s worthy in it, and stay at that place till you leave. 12When you go into a house, greet it. 13If the house is worthy, let your peace rest on it. If not, take it back. 14“Whoever doesn’t welcome you or listen to what you have to say, go outside that house or town and shake the dust off your feet. 15On judgment day it’ll be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. 16“I’m sending youpl out like sheep among wolves, so be as subtle as snakes and harmless as doves. 17Watch out for people, because they’ll deliver you up to the courts and flog you in their synagogues. 18They’ll take you in front of governors and kings because of me as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. 19When they deliver you up to the courts, don’t worry about how or what to say. It’ll come to you at the time. 20You won’t be the ones talking; your Father’s Holy Spirit will be speaking in youpl. 21“Brothers will betray brothers to death; fathers will betray sons. 22Everybody will hate you because of me. Whoever stays with it to the end will be saved. 23When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. You won’t get around to all the towns in Israel before the Son of Man comes. 	Mt 10:11-23 24“Students have it no better than their teachers, and servants have it no better than their masters. 25It’s enough for a student to become like the teacher and a servant to be like the master. If they’ve called the head of the house Beelzebub, how much worse the members of his household. 26“Don’t be afraid of them. Everything that’s covered up will become public; everything that’s hidden will come out n the open. 27What I tell you in the dark, say in the light; what’s whispered in your ear, announce from the housetops. 28Don’t be afraid of people that kill the body but can’t kill the soul. Be more afraid of the One that can kill both soul and body in hell. 29Aren’t two sparrows sold for a dollar, and not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing it? 30The very hairs on your head are all numbered, 31so don’t be afraid; you’re worth more than lots of sparrows. 32“Everybody that acknowledges me to other people, I’ll acknowledge to my Father in heaven.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v33"><sup class="verse-num">33</sup> Whoever denies who I am to other people, I’ll deny to my Father in heaven as belonging to me.	Mt 10:24-33 34“Don’t think I’ve come to bring peace to the earth. I didn’t come to bring peace, but a sword, 35to turn son ‘against father,’ ‘daughter against mother,’ ‘daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.’ 36‘People’s enemies will be in their own houses’ [Mic 7:6]. 37“If you loves father or mother more than me, you don’t deserve me. If you love son or daughter more than me you don’t deserve me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v38"><sup class="verse-num">38</sup> If you don’t pick up your cross and follow me, you don’t deserve me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v39"><sup class="verse-num">39</sup> If you find your life, you’ll lose it; if you lose your life over me, you’ll find it. 40“Anyone that receives you receives me; Anyone that receives me receives the One that sent me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v41"><sup class="verse-num">41</sup> If you receive a prophet as a prophet, you’ll receive a prophet’s reward. If you receive good people as good people, you’ll receive a good person’s reward.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v42"><sup class="verse-num">42</sup> If you give one of these little ones even a cup of cool water as a disciple, you’ll certainly receive reward.”</span>
