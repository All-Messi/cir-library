## Matthew Chapter 19

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> 1When Jesus finished, he left Galilee and went into the regions of Judaea on the other side of the Jordan. 2Big crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Pharisees came to him, testing him, “Is it lawful to divorce a wife for any reason whatever?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v4"><sup class="verse-num">4</sup> He answered, “You’ve read, haven’t you, that ever since the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female’? [Gen 1:27; 5:2] 5So ‘a man is to leave his parents and unite with his wife, and they’ll become a physical unit’ [Gen 2:24]. 6So, they’re no longer two but one. What God has united, people are not to separate.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> They said, “So why did Moses command ‘to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?” [Deut 24:1] 8“Because of your hardheartedness, Moses let you divorce your wives, but ever since the beginning it’s not been that way. 9Whoever divorces his wife—except for sexual immorality—and marries someone else, is committing adultery.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> His disciples saidp, “If that’s the way it is, it’s better not to get married.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> Jesus said, “Not everybody can live that way—only the ones who have that gift. 12Some are eunuchs from birth, some are made eunuchs by men, and some have made themselves ‘eunuchs’ because of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it that can accept it.” Mt 19:1-12 Jesus and the Little Children</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> At the time, people were bringing their kids so Jesus could lay hands on them and pray. But the disciples fussed at them.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus said, “Let the kids alone. Don’t get in their way. The kingdom of heaven is made up of people like them.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> He laid hands on them and left.	Mt 19:13-15 The Rich Young Ruler</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> A man came and said, “Rabbi, what good can I do to have eternal life?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> He said, “Why are you asking me about what’s good? There’s only One that’s good. But if you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments.” 18“Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘Do not commit murder, commit adultery, steal, or lie’; 19‘honor father and mother,’ ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’” [Ex 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> The young man saidp, “I’ve kept all of those. What do I still need to do?” 21“If you want to be perfect, go sell what you own and give it to the poor, and you’ll have wealth in heaven. Come with me.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> When he heard that, he went away discouraged because he was in possession of lots of things. 	Mt 19:16-22 The Peril of Wealth</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Jesus said to his disciples, “Wealthy people have a hard time getting into the kingdom of heaven. 24It’s easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for someone rich to get into God’s kingdom.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v25"><sup class="verse-num">25</sup> That really surprised them, “Then who can be saved?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v26"><sup class="verse-num">26</sup> Jesus looked at them and said, “With men it’s not possible, but with God everything’s possible.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> Peter responded, “We’ve left everything to follow you. What will we have?”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> Jesus told them, “In the next age when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you that have followed me will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. 29Anybody that has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or fields for my sake will receive 100 times as much and inherit eternal life. 30Many first will be last; and last, first. 	Mt 19:23-30 Parable About Workers in a Vineyard</span>
