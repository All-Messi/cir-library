### :29 	Cleansing a Leper

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus came down from the hillside, big crowds followed him. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>A leper came and knelt down to him, <em>“Sir</em><em>, if you’re willing, you can cleanse me.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus reached out and touched him, <em>“I’m wil</em><em>ling; be cleansed.” </em>Instantly his leprosy disappeared. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Jesus told<sup>p</sup> him, <em>“Don’t tell anybody. </em>Instead, for<em> a </em><em>public </em><em>statement</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>how yourself to </em><em>a</em><em> priest and offer the gift Moses commanded.”</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He went to Capernaum, and a centurion came and appealed to him,<strong> </strong><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>“Sir</em><em>, my servant is laid up at home paralyzed and tormented terribly.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus was impressed and told the people that were following him, <em>“I haven’t found faith</em><em> like that</em><em> in Israel.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>11</sup></strong><em>Lots</em><em> of</em><em> </em><em>people </em><em>will come from the east and west</em><em>,</em><em> and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; </em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong><em>but</em><em> </em><em>citizens</em><em> of the kingdom will be t</em><em>hrown out into the dark. There’ll be crying and chattering</em><em> of teeth.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He told the centurion, <em>“Go</em><em> on, it’ll happen </em><em>according to your faith.”</em> His servant was cured the same hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When he got to the region of the Gadarenes on the other side, two demon-possessed men from the tombs met him. They were so vicious nobody dared to go around there. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>They started crying out, <em>“What </em><em>is this,</em><em> you Son of God?</em><em> </em><em>Did you come to torment us ahead of time?”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> A little way off a tremendous herd of pigs was feeding. <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>The demons begged, <em>“If you’re going to cast us out, send us into the pigs.”</em></span>

<span class="verse" id="v32"><sup class="verse-num">32</sup> <em>“Go</em><em> ahead</em><em>.”</em> They went into the pigs, and the whole herd stampeded down the steep place into the lake and drowned. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong>The herdsmen ran away to town and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs. <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>The whole town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave.</span>
