## Matthew Chapter 8

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> When Jesus came down from the hillside, big crowds followed him. 2A leper came and knelt down to him, "Sir, if you're willing, you can cleanse me."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v3"><sup class="verse-num">3</sup> Jesus reached out and touched him, "I'm willing; be cleansed." Instantly his leprosy disappeared. 4Jesus toldp him, "Don't tell anybody. Instead, for a public statement, show yourself to a priest and offer the gift Moses commanded."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> He went to Capernaum, and a centurion came and appealed to him, 6"Sir, my servant is laid up at home paralyzed and tormented terribly."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Jesus saidp, "I'll come and heal him."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> But the centurion answered, "I don't deserve to have you under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9I'm under authority myself, with soldiers under me. I say, 'Go.' and they go; to another, 'Do this,' and he does it."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v10"><sup class="verse-num">10</sup> Jesus was impressed and told the people that were following him, "I haven't found faith like that in Israel. 11Lots of people will come from the east and west, and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; 12but citizens of the kingdom will be thrown out into the dark. There'll be crying and chattering of teeth."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> He told the centurion, "Go on, it'll happen according to your faith." His servant was cured the same hour.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v14"><sup class="verse-num">14</sup> Jesus went to Peter's house and saw his mother-in-law in bed with a fever. 15He touched her hand and the fever left. She got up and started waiting on him.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> That evening, people brought him a number of demon-possessed people, and he cast the spirits out with a word. 17As Isaiah the prophet said,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave instructions to leave for the other side of the lake.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v19"><sup class="verse-num">19</sup> A scribe came, "Rabbi, I'll go with you wherever you go."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v20"><sup class="verse-num">20</sup> Jesus saidp, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man doesn't have a place to lay his head."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> Another of his disciples said, "Let me go bury my father first."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> He got in the boat, and his disciples left with him. 24A dangerous storm came up, and the waves were beginning to splash into the boat. He was sleeping. 25The disciples went and woke him up, "Lord, help us! We're going to die!" 26"Why are you so scared? Where's your faith?" He got up and rebuked the wind, and a general calm settled in.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v27"><sup class="verse-num">27</sup> They were astounded, "What kind of man is this who can even make the wind and waves obey?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> When he got to the region of the Gadarenes on the other side, two demon-possessed men from the tombs met him. They were so vicious nobody dared to go around there. 29They started crying out, "What is this, you Son of God? Did you come to torment us ahead of time?"</span>

<span class="verse" id="v30"><sup class="verse-num">30</sup> A little way off a tremendous herd of pigs was feeding. 31The demons begged, "If you're going to cast us out, send us into the pigs." They went into the pigs, and the whole herd stampeded down the steep place into the lake and drowned. 33The herdsmen ran away to town and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs. 34The whole town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave.</span>
