### 13“Go through the narrow gate. It’s a broad road and a wide gate that leads to destruction, and many go through it. 14How narrow the path is and tight the gate that leads to life! Not many find it.   	15“Watch out for false prophets that come to you in wool, but inside they’re wolves. 16You can recognize them by what they produce. People don’t gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? 17-18Good trees bear good fruit; bad trees bear bad fruit. 19Every tree that doesn’t bear good fruit gets chopped down and thrown into the fire. 20So, you can recognize them by what they produce. 21“Not everybody that says to me ‘Lord’ is going to get into the kingdom of heaven. It’s the ones that do the will of my Father in heaven. 22A lot of people will try to say to me in that day, ‘Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, and do lots of miracles in your name?’ 23I’ll tell them, ‘I never knew you. Go away, sinners.’	Mt 7:13-23 	24“Everybody that hears what I’m saying and does it, is like a wise man that built his house on bedrock. 25Rain fell, floods came, winds blew and beat on it; but it didn’t collapse. He’d built it on bedrock. 	26“Everybody that hears what I’m saying and doesn’t do it, is like a foolish man that built his house on sand. 27Rain fell, floods came, winds blew and beat on it, and it collapsed—a total loss.”
