### The Parable About Talents 14“The kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a trip. He called his servants and entrusted them with things he owned. 15He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to another—according to their abilities—and left. Right away 16the one with five talents went and traded with them and earned five more. 17The one with two talents did the same thing and earned two more. 18But the servant with one talent dug a hole and hid it. 19“After a long time, the master came back and settled accounts with them. 20The one he gave five talents came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents; I’ve earned five more.’  21“‘Well done, good, dependable servant. You were dependable in handling a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many. Enjoy my approval.’ 22“The one he gave two talents came up, ‘You entrusted me with two talents; I’ve earned two more.’     	    Mt 25: 14-22 23“‘Well done, good, reliable servant. You were reliable in handling a few things; I’ll put you in charge of many. Enjoy my approval.’ 24“But the servant he gave one talent came up, ‘Master, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow, gathering where you didn’t scatter. 25I was afraid and hid your talent in the ground. You have what’s yours.’ 26“‘You wicked, lazy servant. You knew, did you, that I reap where I don’t sow and gather where I don’t scatter? 27You should’ve taken my money to the bankers. When I came back, I would’ve received it back plus interest. 28Take the talent away from him and give it to the one with ten. 29Everybody that has will receive more; but the one that doesn’t have will lose what he does have. 30Throw the worthless servant out into the dark. There’ll be crying and chattering of teeth out there.	       Mt 25:23-30 Discussion of the Final Judgment 31“When the Son of Man comes in his glory with the angels, he’ll sit on his glorious throne. 32The nations will stand in front of him, and he’ll separate them like a shepherd separates sheep from goats. 33He’ll put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34The king will tell the sheep, ‘Come, my Father’s blessed ones, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world. 35I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you gave me a place to stay. 36I needed clothes, and you gave me some. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’ 	Mt 25:31-36 37“Those good people will say, ‘When did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? 38When did we see you a stranger and give you a place to stay, or needing clothes and give you some? 39When did we see you sick or in prison and take care of you.’ 40“The king will answer, ‘When you did it for the of least of these friends of mine, you did it to me.’ 41“Then he’ll say to the people on the left, ‘Go away, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42I was hungry, and you didn’t give me anything to eat. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me anything to drink. 43I was a stranger, and you didn’t give me a place to stay. I needed clothes, and you didn’t give me any. I was sick and in prison and you didn’t take care of me.’  44”They’ll say, ‘When did we see you hungry, thirsty, a stranger, needing clothes, sick, or in prison, and not help you?’  45“He’ll answer, ‘Since you didn’t do it for the least of these of the friends of mine, you didn’t do it for me either.’ 46Those will go away into eternal punishment, but the good people will go into eternal life.”     	 Mt 25:37-46 Fifth Prediction of His Death
