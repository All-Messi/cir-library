## Matthew Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>There was a violent earthquake. An angel of the LORD came down from heaven, rolled the stone away, and sat on it. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>His appearance was like lightning; his clothes were white as snow. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>The guards were so shaken they were paralyzed with fear like dead men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The angel said to the women, <em>“</em><em><u>You</u></em><em> d</em><em>on’t </em><em>need to be afraid. I</em><em> know you’re looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>6</sup></strong><em>He’s</em><em> not here; he resurrected</em><em> like he said </em>he would<em>.</em><em> </em><em>Come </em><em>see </em><em>where he was lying.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>7</sup></strong><em>Hurry</em><em> </em><em>and tell his disciples, ‘He arose from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee; you’ll see him there.’</em><em> </em><em>I’ve told you.”</em></span>
<p class="section-ref">Mt 28:1-7</p>

### The Appearance to the Other Women


<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They left the tomb quickly with fear and great excitement and ran to tell his disciples. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Jesus met them and said, <em>“Hello.”</em> They came and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Then Jesus said<sup>p</sup>, <em>“</em><em>You don’t need to be afraid. G</em><em>o </em><em>tell</em><em> my brothers </em><em>to go to Galilee. T</em><em>hey’ll see me there.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Mt 28:8-10</strong> <strong>The Report of the Guard</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests what all happened. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>When they got together with the elders and took counsel, they gave a large number of silver coins to the soldiers, <strong><sup>13</sup></strong><em>“Say</em><em> that h</em><em>is disciples came during the night while </em><em>you</em><em> were asleep and stole him.</em><em> </em><em> </em><strong><sup>14</sup></strong><em>If</em><em> the governor hears about this, we’ll persuade him and keep you out of trouble.</em><em>”</em> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>They took the silver coins and did what they were told. That story has spread among the Jews to this day.</span>

### The Great Commission


<span class="verse" id="v16"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had indicated. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>When they saw him, they worshiped, but some of them doubted! <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>He came and told them, <em>“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</em><em> </em><strong><sup>19</sup></strong><em>Go</em><em> </em><em>make</em><em> disciples </em><em>in every country</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>Baptize them into the name of the Father, Son, and </em><em>Holy Spirit;</em><em> </em><strong><sup>20</sup></strong><em>and</em><em> </em><em>teach them to observe everything I’ve commanded you.</em><em> </em><em>I’ll always be with you till the end of the age.”</em><em>	</em><strong>Mt 28:16-20</strong> Translator: Virgil Warren                                                                                              christir.org</span>
