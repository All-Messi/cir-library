## Matthew Chapter 28

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 2There was a violent earthquake. An angel of the LORD came down from heaven, rolled the stone away, and sat on it. 3His appearance was like lightning; his clothes were white as snow. 4The guards were so shaken they were paralyzed with fear like dead men.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v5"><sup class="verse-num">5</sup> The angel said to the women, "You don't need to be afraid. I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6He's not here; he resurrected like he said he would. Come see where he was lying. 7Hurry and tell his disciples, 'He arose from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee; you'll see him there.' I've told you."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> They left the tomb quickly with fear and great excitement and ran to tell his disciples. 9Jesus met them and said, "Hello." They came and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. 10Then Jesus saidp, "You don't need to be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They'll see me there."</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests what all happened. 12When they got together with the elders and took counsel, they gave a large number of silver coins to the soldiers, 13"Say that his disciples came during the night while you were asleep and stole him.  14If the governor hears about this, we'll persuade him and keep you out of trouble." 15They took the silver coins and did what they were told. That story has spread among the Jews to this day.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> The eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had indicated. 17When they saw him, they worshiped, but some of them doubted! 18He came and told them, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. 19Go make disciples in every country. Baptize them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; 20and teach them to observe everything I've commanded you. I'll always be with you till the end of the age."
