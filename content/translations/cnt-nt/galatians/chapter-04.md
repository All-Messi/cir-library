## Galatians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let me point out that as long as heirs are minors, they're like servants at present though owners of everything in prospect. 2They're under guardians and trustees till the time their father specifies. 3That's like us. When we were minors, we were servants to the material-based notions the world operates by. 4But when the time came, God sent out his Son—born by woman under law—5to redeem us who were under law and to adopt us as children. 6Since we're children, God gave us the sense of being that his Son has; we call out, "Dad." 7So we're not servants anymore, but children that became heirs by God's promise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Before you knew God, you served what weren't really gods. 9Now, since you know him—or better, he knows you—why do you want to go back and serve weak, material-based notions again? 10You're observing days, months, seasons, and years. 11I'm afraid I've labored over you for nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I plead with you, become like me because I'm like you. You haven't wronged me in anything. 13You know I presented the good news to you at the first because of a physical handicap. 14You didn't look down on me because of it. You received me like an angel from God, like Christ Jesus. 15So where's your sense of being blessed? I point out that, if possible, you would've gouged your eyes out and given them to me. 16So, do I become your enemy by telling you the truth? 17The ones that are confusing you aren't seeking you out for any good reason. They want to lock you out so you'll look to them to get in. 18But it's always good to have someone seek you out in a good way, not just when I'm around. 19My children, I'm in labor with you again until Christ forms in you. 20I'd like to be with you now and change my tone. I'm worried about you.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You that want to be under law, tell me, are you listening to it? 22Scripture says Abraham had two sons, one by a servant girl and one by a free woman. 23The one the servant girl had was born physically, but the one the free woman had was born by promise. 24These points set up an illustration: the women represent two covenants. 25Hagar, from Mount Sinai in Arabia, bears children into bondage. She's the mountain that corresponds to present-day Jerusalem because she's in bondage along with her children. 26But the Jerusalem above is free; that's our mother. 27Scripture says,</span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You're children like Isaac. 29The one born physically was persecuting the one born spiritually; it's the same way now. 30But what does the scripture say?</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So we're not children of a servant girl, but of a free woman.</span>
