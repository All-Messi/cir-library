## Galatians Chapter 4

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Let me point out that as long as heirs are minors, they’re like servants <em>at present </em>though owners of everything <em>in prospect</em>. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>They’re under guardians and trustees till the time their father specifies. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>That’s like us. When we were minors, we were servants to the material-based notions the world operates by. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>But when the time came, God sent out his Son—born by woman under law—<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>to redeem us who were under law and to adopt us as children. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>Since we’re children, God gave us the sense of being that his Son has; we call out, <em>“</em><em>Dad</em><em>.”</em> <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>So we’re not servants anymore, but children that became heirs by God<em>’s promise.</em><em> </em><em>	</em><strong>Gal 4:1-7</strong> <strong>The Inadequacy of Law</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v8"><sup class="verse-num">8</sup> Before you knew God, you served what weren’t really gods. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Now, since you know him—or better, he knows you—why do you want to go back and serve weak, material-based notions again? <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>You’re observing days, months, seasons, and years. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>I’m afraid I’ve labored over you for nothing.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gal 4:8-11</p>

<span class="verse" id="v12"><sup class="verse-num">12</sup> I plead with you, become like me because I’m like you. You haven’t wronged me in anything. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>You know I presented the good news to you at the first because of a physical handicap. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>You didn’t look down on me because of it. You received me like an angel from God, like Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>So where’s your sense of being blessed? I point out that, if possible, you would’ve gouged your eyes out and given them to me. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>So, do I become your enemy by telling you the truth? <strong><sup>17</sup></strong><em>The</em><em> ones that are confusing you</em> aren’t seeking you out for any good reason. They want to lock you out so you’ll look to them <em>to get in</em>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>But it’s always good to have someone seek you out in a good way, not just when I’m around. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>My children, I’m in labor with you again until Christ forms in you. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>I’d like to be with you now and change my tone. I’m worried about you.</span>

### The Hagar-Sarah Allegory


<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> You that want to be under law, tell me, are you listening to it? <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Scripture says Abraham had two sons, one by a servant girl and one by a free <em>woman</em>. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The one the servant girl had was born physically, but the one the free <em>woman</em> had <em>was born</em> by promise. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>These points set up an illustration: the women represent two covenants. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Hagar, from Mount Sinai in Arabia, bears children into bondage. She’s the mountain that corresponds to present-day Jerusalem because she’s in bondage along with her children. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>But the Jerusalem above is free; that’s our mother. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Scripture says, <strong><em>“Celebrate, barren one that doesn’t </em></strong><strong><em>bear;</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	cry out and scream, woman that’s not in labor.</em></strong> <strong><em>	The woman that’s </em></strong><strong><em>single </em></strong><strong><em>has more children</em></strong> <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>	than the </em></strong><strong><em>one</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>with</em></strong><strong><em> a husband”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Is</strong><strong> 54:1].</strong></span>

<span class="verse" id="v28"><sup class="verse-num">28</sup> You’re children like Isaac. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>The one born physically was persecuting the one <em>born</em> spiritually; it’s the same way now. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong>But what does the scripture say? <strong><em>	</em></strong><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>Send away the servant girl and her </em></strong><strong><em>son;</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong><em>	h</em></strong><strong><em>er son will not inherit with the son”</em></strong><strong> </strong>of the free <em>woman</em> <strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 21:10]</strong>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v31"><sup class="verse-num">31</sup> So we’re not children of a servant girl, but of a free <em>woman</em>. <strong>5</strong><strong><sup>:1</sup></strong>Christ really has set us free;<strong> </strong>so stand firm; don’t put yourselves back under a yoke of bondage.</span>
