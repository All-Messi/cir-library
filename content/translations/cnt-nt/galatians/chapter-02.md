## Galatians Chapter **2**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Fourteen years later, I went up to Jerusalem again, that time with Barnabas, and took Titus along. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>I<em> </em>went up, directed by revelation, to lay out for them the message I was presenting to Gentiles. I met privately with the recognized leaders so I wouldn't be running or had run for nothing. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>They didn’t consider it necessary to circumcise Titus, a Gentile. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong><em>That</em><em> trip came about</em> because false believers had slipped in to spy out the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to enslave us <em>to the Law</em>. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>To maintain the truth about the good news, we didn’t back down for one minute. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The recognized leaders <em>in Jerusalem</em> didn’t contribute anything to me. (Who they were didn’t matter. God doesn’t pay any attention to that.) <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Instead, they saw that God had entrusted me with presenting the good news to the uncircumcised like he’d entrusted Peter with presenting it to the circumcised. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The One at work in Peter’s apostleship was at work in mine for the Gentiles. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>James, Cephas, and John—recognized pillars—shook hands with me and Barnabas to go to the Gentiles. They’d go to the Circumcision. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>The only thing was, they wanted us to remember the poor, and I was eager to do that.</span>

### Paul Confronts Cephas (Peter)


<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup>When Cephas came to Antioch, I confronted him because he’d condemned himself. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Before some men came from James, <em>[the Lord’s brother],</em> he’d been eating with the Gentiles. But when they got there, he started separating himself because he was afraid of the Circumcision. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>The rest of the Jews joined him in that hypocrisy—even Barnabas got caught up in it. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>When I saw they weren’t conforming to the true message, I said to Cephas, <em>“If you’re a Jew but</em><em> live like a Gentile, how is it that you </em><em>require Gentiles to live like Jews?</em><em> </em><strong><sup>15</sup></strong>We’re naturally Jews, not Gentile sinners. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>We know that no person’s made good by doing the Law, but by trusting in Christ. We’ve put trust in Christ Jesus so trusting <u>him</u> can justify us. What people do under <u>law</u> doesn’t make them good. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>But if while we’re trying to be good in Christ, we turn out to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Goodness, no! <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>If I rebuild what I used to tear down, I make myself a sinner. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>By the Law I died to law so I could live to God. I’ve been crucified with Christ. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>It’s not me that’s living, but Christ that’s living in me. What I live now in the flesh, I live by trusting God’s Son, who loved me and gave himself for me. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>I don’t cancel out God’s grace. If law can make us good, there was no reason for Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> to die.</span>
