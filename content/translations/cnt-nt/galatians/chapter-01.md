## Galatians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle—not appointed by human agency or by human authority, but by Jesus ChristMessiah and God the Father who resurrected him—2and the Christians that are with me, to the churches in Galatia. 3Grace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 4He gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this sinful age, as God had willed. 5Glory to him forevermore. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I'm amazed that you're turning away so quickly from the One that called you by the grace that comes from Christ and turning to a different kind of gospel that's 7not really another gospel at all. It's just that some people are confusing you by distorting Christ's gospel. 8But, even if we or an angel from heaven would present a gospel different from what we presented, consider him under a curse. 9I repeat, if anybody presents a gospel different from the one you've received, consider him under a curse. 10Am I trying to please people or God? If I was trying to please people, I wouldn't be serving Christ. 11-12I'm telling you, the message I presented to you didn't come from other people; Jesus Christ revealed it to me.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You've heard that when I was in Judaism, I was persecuting God's church to the extreme. I was trying to destroy it. 14I was moving up the ranks in Judaism past many contemporaries in my nation because I was more fanatical about the traditions of my ancestors. 15But God set me apart at birth and called me by his grace. It pleased him 16to reveal his Son in me so I could present him among the Gentiles. Right away, I didn't consult other people 17or go up to Jerusalem to the ones that were apostles before me. I went away to Arabia and then back to Damascus. 18Three years later I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. 19I didn't see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother. 20What I'm writing to you is the truth. 21After that, I went to Syria and Cilicia. 22Christ's churches in Judaea didn't know me by sight. 23The only thing they kept hearing was that the one who used to persecute them was now preaching the faith he tried to destroy, 24and they praised God because of me.</span>
