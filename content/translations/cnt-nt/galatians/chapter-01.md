## Galatians Chapter 1

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Paul, apostle—not appointed by human agency or by human authority, but by Jesus Christ<sup>Messiah</sup> and God the Father who resurrected him—<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>and the Christians that are with me, to the churches in Galatia. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Grace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>He gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this sinful age, as God had willed. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Glory<em> </em>to him forevermore. Amen.</span>

### The Only Gospel


<span class="verse" id="v6"><sup class="verse-num">6</sup> I’m amazed that you’re turning away so quickly from the One that called you by the grace that comes from Christ and<em> turning </em>to a different kind of gospel that’s <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>not really another gospel at all. It’s just that some people are confusing you by distorting Christ’s gospel. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>But, even if <u>we</u> or an angel from heaven would present a gospel different from what we presented, consider him under a curse. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>I repeat, if anybody presents a gospel different from the one you’ve received, consider him under a curse. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Am I trying to please people or God? If I was trying to please people, I wouldn’t be serving Christ. <strong><sup>11-</sup></strong><strong><sup>12</sup></strong>I’m telling you, the message I presented <em>to you</em> didn’t come from other people; Jesus Christ revealed it to me.</span>

### Paul’s History


<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You’ve heard that when I was in Judaism, I was persecuting God’s church to the extreme. I was trying to destroy it. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>I was moving up <em>the ranks</em> in Judaism past many contemporaries in my nation because I was more fanatical about the traditions of my ancestors. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>But God set me apart at birth and called me by his grace. It pleased him <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>to reveal his Son in me so I could present him among the Gentiles. Right away, I didn’t consult other people <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>or go up to Jerusalem to the ones that were apostles before me. I went away to Arabia and then back to Damascus. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong>Three years later I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong>I didn’t see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>What I’m writing to you is the truth. <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>After that, I went to Syria and Cilicia. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>Christ’s churches in Judaea didn’t know me by sight. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong>The only thing they kept hearing was that the one who used to persecute them was now preaching the faith he tried to destroy, <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>and they praised God because of me.</span>
