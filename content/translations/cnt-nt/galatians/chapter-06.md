## Galatians Chapter 6

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> If someone gets caught up in some sin, you that are spiritual should humbly restore that person. Keep an eye on yourselves so you don't get caught up in temptation. 2Share each other's burdens and fulfill Christ's 'law' that way. 3If we think we're special when we're not, we're kidding ourselves. 4We each one must examine our own behavior and take pride in it only in respect to ourselves, not in comparison to somebody else. 5Each one of us has to carry our own load. 6The one that's being taught the message needs to share everything good with the one that's teaching it. 7Make no mistake, we can't mock God. We reap what we sow. 8If we sow in the flesh, we'll reap decay. If we sow in the spirit, we'll reap eternal life. 9Let's not get discouraged with doing what's right. In due time we'll reap if we don't give up. 10So while we've got a chance, let's work at doing good to everybody, especially to members of the family of faith.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v11"><sup class="verse-num">11</sup> See what big letters I've written with my own hand. 12Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are trying to get you circumcised so they won't suffer persecution for the cross of ChristMessiah. 13They don't keep the Law themselves; they just want to get you circumcised so they can take pride in you physically. 14But I'm not going to take pride in anything but the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him the world's crucified to me and me to it. 15Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has anything to do with it; what matters is a new system God has created in Christ. 16Peace and mercy to as many as live by that principle—to God's 'Israel.'</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><sup class="verse-num">17</sup> From now on, don't create problems for me. I already have on my body the branding marks of the Lord Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup class="verse-num">18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span>
