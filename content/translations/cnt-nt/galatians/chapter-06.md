## Galatians Chapter **6**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>If someone gets caught up in some sin, you that are spiritual should humbly restore that person. Keep an eye on yourselves so <u>you</u> don’t get caught up in temptation. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Share each other’s burdens and fulfill Christ’s ‘law’ that way. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>If we think we’re special when we’re not, we’re kidding ourselves. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>We each one must examine our own behavior and take pride in it only in respect to ourselves, not <em>in comparison t</em>o somebody else. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Each one of us has to carry our own load. <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>The one that’s being taught the message needs to share everything good with the one that’s teaching it. <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>Make no mistake, we can’t mock God. We reap what we sow. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>If we sow in the flesh, we’ll reap decay. If we sow in the spirit, we’ll reap eternal life. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>Let’s not get discouraged with doing what’s right. In due time we’ll reap if we don’t give up. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>So while we’ve got a chance, let’s work at doing good to everybody, especially to members of the family of faith.</span>

### Closing Encouragements


<span class="verse" id="v11"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>See what big letters I’ve written with my own hand. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are trying to get you circumcised so they won’t suffer persecution for the cross of Christ<sup>Messiah</sup>. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong>They don’t keep the Law themselves; they just want to get you circumcised so they can take pride in you physically. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>But I’m not going to take pride in anything but the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him the world’s crucified to me and me to it. <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has anything to do with it; <em>what matters is </em>a new system<em> God </em><em>has </em>created <em>in Christ. </em><strong><sup>16</sup></strong>Peace and mercy to as many as live by that principle—to God’s ‘Israel.’</span>

<span class="verse" id="v17"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong>From now on, don’t create problems for me. I <em>already </em>have on my body the branding marks of the Lord Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v18"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with your spirit. Amen.<strong>          </strong></span>
