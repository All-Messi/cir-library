## Galatians Chapter **3**

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>Foolish Galatians! Who cast a spell on you? Right in front of your eyes I portrayed Jesus Christ crucified. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>This is what<strong> </strong>I’d like to know: did you receive the Spirit by working under <u>law</u> or by trusting the <u>Person</u> you listened to? <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Are you foolish enough to start with spirit and try to finish with flesh? <strong><sup>4</sup></strong>Did you suffer so much for nothing—if it was for nothing? <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>Does the one that provides you the Spirit and works miracles among you <em>do it</em> by working under law or trusting the Person he listened to? <strong><sup>6</sup></strong>In that way, Abraham <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em><u>trusted</u></em></strong><strong><em> God, and God </em></strong><strong><em><u>considered</u></em></strong><strong><em> him good”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</span>

### ].      	 Gal 3:1-6


<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup>Rest assured, then, the ones who “trust” are like Abraham. <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>The scripture looked forward to when God would make Gentiles good by trusting. So it “presented the good news” to Abraham, <strong><em>“</em></strong><strong><em>In y</em></strong><strong><em>ou</em></strong><strong><em> I will bless </em></strong><strong><em>all </em></strong><strong><em>the nations</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 12:3; 18:18]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong><sup>9</sup></strong>So God blesses people that trust like Abraham did. <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Those who work under law are under a curse: scripture says, <strong><em>“Everybody’s under a curse that doesn’t do everything all</em></strong><strong><em> the time that the Law requires</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 27:26]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong><sup>11</sup></strong>Obviously, law can’t make anyone good in front of God:<em> </em><strong><em>“A good person will have</em></strong><strong><em> life by trusting”</em></strong> <strong>[Hab</strong><strong> 2:4]</strong>. <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>Law doesn’t involve trusting: <strong><em>“The one that </em></strong><strong><em><u>does</u></em></strong><strong><em> them i</em></strong><strong><em>s the one that has life by them</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Lev</strong><strong> 18:5]</strong>.<strong> </strong><strong><sup>13</sup></strong>Christ redeemed us from the curse that law brings us under by becoming a curse on our behalf. Scripture says, <strong><em>“Everybody’s under a curse</em></strong><strong><em> that hangs on a tree</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong> <strong>[Deut</strong><strong> 21:23]</strong>. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>So the blessing associated with Abraham can come to Gentiles in Christ Jesus; and by trusting, we can receive the Spirit Christ promised <em>us. </em><em>	 </em></span>

### Law vs. Promise


<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup>Take an example from everyday life. Even with a human covenant, once it’s ratified, nobody annuls it or adds to it. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>God made promises to Abraham and his seed. The text doesn’t say “seeds,” plural, but “seed,” singular, <strong><em>“to your seed”</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>[Gen</strong><strong> 12:7; 13:15; 17:7</strong><strong>;</strong><strong> 24:7]</strong>, <em>that is</em>, Christ. <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>Here’s the point: the Law, which</span>
<p class="section-ref">came 430</p>

### years after the promise, didn’t annul the promise; it didn’t annul the covenant God had put in place earlier. 18If inheritance comes by law, it doesn’t come by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by making a promise. 19So, what was the Law for? God added it to deal with sins till the “seed” came that he made his promise to. Angels ordained the Law through a mediator. 20A mediator mediates between two parties, not one; but God is only one party.  	Gal 3:15-20 Law Prepares for Trust


<span class="verse" id="v21"><strong><sup>1</sup></strong>So, does the Law conflict with God’s promise? Goodness, no! If there could’ve been a law that gave life, the Law would make people good. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>But scripture locks up everything under sin so trusting could <em>directly</em> deliver the promise to the ones who trust <em>the promise</em>.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup>Till trust came into play, law held us in custody. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong>It served as an attendant to lead <em>us</em> to Christ so trusting in <em>him</em> could make us good. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>Now that trust has come, we aren’t under an attendant anymore. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong>We’re God’s children by trusting in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>Those of us who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <strong><sup>28</sup></strong>Jew-Greek, slave-free, male-female is irrelevant. We’re all alike in Christ Jesus. <strong><sup>29</sup></strong>If we’re Christ’s, we’re Abraham’s seed<sup>sg</sup> and heirs by promise.</span>
