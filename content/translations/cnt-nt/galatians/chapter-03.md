## Galatians Chapter 3

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Foolish Galatians! Who cast a spell on you? Right in front of your eyes I portrayed Jesus Christ crucified. 2This is what I'd like to know: did you receive the Spirit by working under law or by trusting the Person you listened to? 3Are you foolish enough to start with spirit and try to finish with flesh? 4Did you suffer so much for nothing—if it was for nothing? 5Does the one that provides you the Spirit and works miracles among you do it by working under law or trusting the Person he listened to? 6In that way, Abraham "trusted God, and God considered him good" [Gen 15:6].</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> Rest assured, then, the ones who "trust" are like Abraham. 8The scripture looked forward to when God would make Gentiles good by trusting. So it "presented the good news" to Abraham, "In you I will bless all the nations" [Gen 12:3; 18:18]. 9So God blesses people that trust like Abraham did. 10Those who work under law are under a curse: scripture says, "Everybody's under a curse that doesn't do everything all the time that the Law requires" [Deut 27:26]. 11Obviously, law can't make anyone good in front of God: "A good person will have life by trusting" [Hab 2:4]. 12Law doesn't involve trusting: "The one that does them is the one that has life by them" [Lev 18:5]. 13Christ redeemed us from the curse that law brings us under by becoming a curse on our behalf. Scripture says, "Everybody's under a curse that hangs on a tree" [Deut 21:23]. 14So the blessing associated with Abraham can come to Gentiles in Christ Jesus; and by trusting, we can receive the Spirit Christ promised us.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v15"><sup class="verse-num">15</sup> Take an example from everyday life. Even with a human covenant, once it's ratified, nobody annuls it or adds to it. 16God made promises to Abraham and his seed. The text doesn't say "seeds," plural, but "seed," singular, "to your seed" [Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:7; 24:7], that is, Christ. 17Here's the point: the Law, which came 430 years after the promise, didn't annul the promise; it didn't annul the covenant God had put in place earlier. 18If inheritance comes by law, it doesn't come by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by making a promise. 19So, what was the Law for? God added it to deal with sins till the "seed" came that he made his promise to. Angels ordained the Law through a mediator. 20A mediator mediates between two parties, not one; but God is only one party.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v21"><sup class="verse-num">21</sup> So, does the Law conflict with God's promise? Goodness, no! If there could've been a law that gave life, the Law would make people good. 22But scripture locks up everything under sin so trusting could directly deliver the promise to the ones who trust the promise.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v23"><sup class="verse-num">23</sup> Till trust came into play, law held us in custody. 24It served as an attendant to lead us to Christ so trusting in him could make us good. 25Now that trust has come, we aren't under an attendant anymore. 26We're God's children by trusting in Christ Jesus. 27Those of us who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28Jew-Greek, slave-free, male-female is irrelevant. We're all alike in Christ Jesus. 29If we're Christ's, we're Abraham's seedsg and heirs by promise.</span>
