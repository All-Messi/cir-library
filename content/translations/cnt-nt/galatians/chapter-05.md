## Galatians Chapter 5

### :1 	Law and Trust, Mutually Exclusive Systems

<span class="verse" id="v1"><sup class="verse-num">1</sup> Christ really has set us free; so stand firm; don't put yourselves back under a yoke of bondage.</span>
<p class="section-ref">Gal 4:21-5</p>

### :1 Law and Trust, Mutually Exclusive Systems


<span class="verse" id="v2"><sup class="verse-num">2</sup> I tell you, if you accept circumcision, Christ doesn't do you any good. 3You're obligated to keep the Law completely. 4You that are trying to gain righteousness by law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You've fallen away from grace into law. 5In spirit we wait by trust for the goodness we hope for. 6In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is relevant. What matters is trust expressing itself in love.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v7"><sup class="verse-num">7</sup> You were running well. Who stopped you from obeying the truth? 8The persuasion didn't come from the One that's calling you. 9A little yeast spreads through the whole lump. 10I have confidence in you in the Lord that you won't adopt something else. The one that's confusing you will face condemnation, whoever he is. 11If I still preach circumcision, why do the Jews still persecute me? 12I wish the ones that are troubling you would mutilate themselves. Christian Freedom</span>

<span class="verse" id="v13"><sup class="verse-num">13</sup> You were called to freedom. Just don't use it as an excuse for the flesh; serve one another with love. 14One statement fulfills the whole Law, "Love your neighbor as yourself" [Lev 19:18]. 15If you nip at and chew on each other, you'll end up eating each other up. Physical versus spiritual</span>

<span class="verse" id="v16"><sup class="verse-num">16</sup> I tell you, live by what's spiritual and you won't be fulfilling what's fleshly. 17Flesh pulls against spirit and vice versa. They work against each other, and you end up doing what you don't want to do. 18If spirit is leading you, you're not under law. 19It's clear what fleshly deeds are: sexual immorality, uncleanness, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery, hostility, rivalry, jealousy, rage, disputes, divisions, factions, 21envy, drunkenness, carousing, and so on. I tell you ahead of time, like I told you before, people that do such things won't inherit God's kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" id="v22"><sup class="verse-num">22</sup> But spirit produces fruit like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustworthiness, 23gentleness, self-control. There's no law against such things. 24Christ's people have crucified the physical along with its drives and desires. 25If we have life by spirit, let's conduct life by spirit. 26Let's not be proud or jealous or irritate each other. Patience with the Sinful</span>
